      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">In [[topology]], an '''Akbulut cork''' is a structure that is frequently used to show that in four dimensions, the smooth [[h-cobordism]] theorem fails. It was named after [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[mathematician]] [[Selman Akbulut]].&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Gompf and A.I. Stipsicz, 4-manifolds and Kirby calculus (p.357), AMS Pub. GSM v.20 {{isbn|0-8218-0994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.Scorpan, The wild world of 4-manifolds (p.90), AMS Pub. {{isbn|0-8218-3749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compact contractible Stein 4-manifold C with involution F on its boundary is called an Akbulut cork, if F extends to a self-homeomorphism but cannot extend to a self-diffeomorphism inside (hence a cork is an exotic copy of itself relative to its boundary). A cork (C,F) is called a cork of a smooth 4-manifold X, if removing C from X and re-gluing it via F changes the smooth structure of X (this operation is called "cork twisting"). Any exotic copy X' of a closed simply connected 4-manifold X differs from X by a single cork twist.&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut, A Fake compact contractible 4-manifold, Journ. of Diff. Geom. 33, (1991), 335-356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Matveyev, A decomposition of smooth simply-connected h-cobordant 4-manifolds, J. Differential Geom. 44 (1996), no. 3, 571–582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Curtis, M. H. Freedman, W. C. Hsiang, and R. Stong, A decomposition theorem for h-cobordant smooth simply-connected compact 4-manifolds, Invent. Math. 123 (1996), no. 2, 343–348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut and R. Matveyev, A convex decomposition theorem for 4-manifolds, Internat. Math. Res. Notices 1998, no. 7, 371–381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut and K. Yasui, Corks, Plugs and exotic structures, Jour. of GGT, vol 2 (2008) 40-82&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of the Akbulut cork is that when attempting to use the h-corbodism theorem in four dimensions, the cork is the sub-cobordism that contains all the exotic properties of the spaces connected with the cobordism, and when removed the two spaces become trivially h-cobordant and smooth. This shows that in four dimensions, although the theorem does not tell us that two [[manifold]]s are [[diffeomorphic]] (only [[homeomorphic]]), they are "not far" from being diffeomorphic.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans, 2007, ''Exotic Smoothness and Physics''&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this (without proof), consider a smooth h-cobordism ''W''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between two 4-manifolds ''M'' and ''N''. Then within ''W'' there is a sub-cobordism ''K''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between ''A''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' and ''B''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''N'' and there is a diffeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;W \setminus \operatorname{int}\, K \cong \left(M \setminus \operatorname{int}\, A \right) \times \left[0,1\right],&lt;/math&gt;

which is the content of the h-cobordism theorem for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5 (here int&amp;nbsp;''X'' refers to the interior of a manifold ''X''). In addition, ''A'' and ''B'' are diffeomorphic with a diffeomorphism that is an [[involute|involution]] on the boundary ∂''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∂''B''.&lt;ref name=Scorpan&gt;Scorpan, A., 2005 ''The Wild World of 4-Manifolds''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can be seen that the h-corbordism ''K'' connects ''A'' with its "inverted" image ''B''. This submanifold ''A'' is the Akbulut cork.

The '''axiom of reducibility''' was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the early 20th century as part of his [[Type theory|ramified theory of types]]. Russell devised and introduced the axiom in an attempt to manage the contradictions he had discovered in his analysis of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=Thierry Coquand|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With Russell's discovery (1901, 1902)&lt;ref&gt;According to van Heijenoort 1967:124, Russell discovered the paradox in June 1901. van Heijenoort in turn references Bertrand Russell (1944) "My mental development" in ''The philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp (Tudor, New York), page 13. But Russell did not report it to Frege until his letter to Frege dated 16 June 1902. Livio 2009:186 reports the same date. Livio 2009:191 writes that Zermelo discovered the paradox as early as 1900, but does not give his source for this (Ewald 1996?). Indeed, Zermelo makes this claim in a footnote 9 to his 1908 ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' in van Heijenoort 1967:191.&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[paradox]] in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' and Frege's acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively introduced his solution as "Appendix B: Doctrine of Types" in his 1903 ''The Principles of Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Russell's paradox|contradiction]] can be stated as "the class of all classes that do not contain themselves as elements".&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his "doctrine" would solve the immediate problem posed by Frege, but "there is at least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of reasoning..."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:528&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in van Heijenoort 150–182&lt;/ref&gt; Russell had studied "the contradictions" (among them the [[Epimenides paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Richard's paradox]]) and concluded that "In all the contradictions there is a common characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908:154. The exact wording appears in Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:60&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1903, Russell defined ''predicative'' functions as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, ''impredicative'' functions had to be disallowed:

{{quote|A function whose argument is an individual and whose value is always a first-order proposition will be called a first-order function. A function involving a first-order function or proposition as apparent variable will be called a second-order function, and so on. A function of one variable which is of the order next above that of its argument will be called a ''predicative'' function; the same name will be given to a function of several variables [etc].&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He repeats this definition in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913):

{{quote|A predicative function of ''x'' is one whose values are propositions of the type next above that of ''x'', if ''x'' is an individual or a proposition, or that of values of ''x'' if ''x'' is a function. It may be described as one in which the apparent variables, if any, are all of the same type as ''x'' or of lower type; and a variable is of lower type than ''x'' '''if it can significantly occur as argument to ''x'', or as argument to an argument to ''x'', and so forth.''' [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This usage carries over to [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and Russell's 1913 ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter II: "The Theory of Logical Types" to subchapter I. ''The Vicious-Circle Principle'': "We will define a function of one variable as ''predicative'' when it is of the next order above that of its argument, i.e. of the lowest order compatible with its having that argument. . . A function of several arguments is predicative if there is one of its arguments such that, when the other arguments have values assigned to them, we obtain a predicative function of the one undetermined argument."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:53&lt;/ref&gt;

They again propose the definition of a ''predicative function'' as one that does not violate The Theory of Logical Types. Indeed the authors assert such violations are "incapable [to achieve]" and "impossible":

{{quote|We are thus led to the conclusion, both from the vicious-circle principle and from direct inspection, that the functions to which a given object ''a'' can be an argument are incapable of being arguments to each other, and that they have no term in common with the functions to which they can be arguments. We are thus led to construct a hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authors stress the word ''impossible'':

{{quote|if we are not mistaken, that not only is it impossible for a function φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; to have itself or anything derived from it as argument, but that, if ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is another function such there are arguments ''a'' with which both "φa" and "ψa" are significant, then ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; and anything derived from it cannot significantly be argument to φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the original z&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is z with a circumflex (hat) over it, etc. Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Russell's axiom of reducibility==
The axiom of reducibility states that any truth function (i.e. [[propositional function]]) can be expressed by a formally equivalent ''predicative'' truth function. It made its first appearance in [[Bertrand Russell]]'s (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'', but only after some five years of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;cf commentary by [[W. V. Quine]] in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; In his words: 
{{quote|Thus a predicative function of an individual is a first-order function; and for higher types of arguments, predicative functions take the place that first-order functions take in respect of individuals. We assume then, that every function is equivalent, for all its values, to some predicative function of the same argument. This assumption seems to be the essence of the usual assumption of classes [modern sets] . . . we will call this assumption the ''axiom of classes'', or the '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.&lt;ref&gt;boldface added, cf Russell 1908 reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For relations (functions of two variables such as "For all x and for all y, those values for which f(x,y) is true" i.e. ∀x∀y: f(x,y)), Russell assumed an ''axiom of relations'', or [the same] '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.

In 1903, he proposed a possible process of evaluating such a 2-place function by comparing the process to double integration: One after another, plug into ''x'' definite values ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (i.e. the particular ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is "a constant" or a parameter held constant), then evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') across all the ''n'' instances of possible ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. For all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), then for all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), etc until all the ''x'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are exhausted). This would create an ''m'' by ''n'' matrix of values: TRUE or UNKNOWN. (In this exposition, the use of indices is a modern convenience.) 

In 1908, Russell made no mention of this [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of ''x'', ''y'' values that render a two-place function (e.g. relation) TRUE, but by 1913 he has introduced a matrix-like concept into "function". In *12 of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1913) he defines "a matrix" as "any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any apparent variables. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalisation, i.e. by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some values of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:162&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one asserts that "∀y: f(x, y) is true", then ''x'' is the apparent variable because it is unspecified. 

Russell now defines a matrix of "individuals" as a ''first-order'' matrix, and he follows a similar process to define a ''second-order matrix'', etc. Finally, he introduces the definition of a ''predicative function'':

{{quote|A function is said to be ''predicative'' when it is a matrix. It will be observed that, in a hierarchy in which all the variables are individuals or matrices, a matrix is the same thing as an elementary function [cf 1913:127, meaning: the function contains ''no'' apparent variables]. ¶ "Matrix" or "predicative function" is a primitive idea.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this reasoning, he then uses the same wording to propose the same ''axioms of reducibility'' as he did in his 1908.

As an aside, Russell in his 1903 considered, and then rejected, "a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples",&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the modern set-theoretic notion of [[ordered pair]]. An intuitive version of this notion appeared in Frege's (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' (translated in van Heijenoort 1967:23); Russell's 1903 followed closely the work of Frege (cf Russell 1903:505ff). Russell worried that "it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent from the relatum: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. It would seem, viewing the idea philosophically, that sense can only be derived from some relational proposition . . . it seems therefore more correct to take an [[intension]]al view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; As shown below, [[Norbert Wiener]] (1914) reduced the notion of relation to class by his definition of an ordered pair.

==Criticism==

===Zermelo 1908===
The outright prohibition implied by Russell's ''axiom of reducibility'' was roundly criticised by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'', stung as he was by a demand similar to that of Russell that came from [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]:

{{quote|According to Poincaré (1906, p. 307) a definition is "predicative" and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are "dependent" upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zermelo countered:

{{quote|A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wiener 1914===
In his 1914 ''A simplification of the logic of relations'', [[Norbert Wiener]] removed the need for the axiom of reducibility as applied to relations between two variables ''x'', and ''y'' e.g. φ(''x'',''y''). He did this by introducing a way to express a relation as a set of ordered pairs: "It will be seen that what we have done is practically to revert to Schröder's treatment of a relation as a class [set] of ordered couples".&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:226&lt;/ref&gt; Van Heijenoort observes that "[b]y giving a definition of the ordered pair of two-elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt; But Wiener opined that while he had dispatched Russell and Whitehead's two-variable version of the axiom *12.11, the single-variable version of the axiom of reducibility for (axiom *12.1 in ''Principia Mathematica'') was still necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wittgenstein 1918===
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], while imprisoned in a prison camp, finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. His introduction credits "the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell". Not a self-effacing intellectual, he pronounced that "the ''truth'' of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:4&lt;/ref&gt; So given such an attitude, it is no surprise that Russell's theory of types comes under criticism:

:In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a role; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the ''meaning'' of a sign; it ought to presuppose ''only'' the description of the expressions.
3.331
:From this observation we get a further view – into Russell's ''Theory of Types''. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meaning of the signs.
3.332
:No proposition can say anything about itself, because the proposition sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the "whole theory of types").
3.333
:A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself. ... Herewith Russell's paradox vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This appears to support the same argument Russell uses to erase his "paradox". This "using the signs" to "speak of the signs" Russell criticises in his introduction that preceded the original English translation:

{{quote|What causes hesitation is the fact that, after all, Mr Wittgenstein manages to say a good deal about what cannot be said, thus suggesting to the sceptical reader that possibly there may be some loophole through a hierarchy of languages, or by some other exit.}}

This problem appears later when Wittgenstein arrives at this gentle disavowal of the axiom of reducibility—one interpretation of the following is that Wittgenstein is saying that Russell has made (what is known today as) a [[category error]]; Russell has asserted (inserted into the theory) a "further law of logic" when ''all'' the laws (e.g. the unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] adopted by Wittgenstein) have ''already'' been asserted:

{{quote|6.123
:It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves obey further logical laws. (There is not, as Russell supposed, for every "type" a special law of contradiction; but one is sufficient, since it is not applied to itself.)
6.1231
:The mark of logical propositions is not their general validity. To be general is only to be accidentally valid for all things. An ungeneralised proposition can be tautologous just as well as a generalised one.
6.1232
:Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity, e.g., of the proposition "all men are mortal". Propositions like Russell's "axiom of reducibility" are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they can only be true by a happy chance.
6.1233
:We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic has nothing to do with the question of whether our world is really of this kind or not.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1919===
Russell in his 1919 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', a non-mathematical companion to his first edition of ''PM'', discusses his Axiom of Reducibility in Chapter 17 ''Classes'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;146ff).  He concludes that "we cannot accept "class" as a primitive idea; the symbols for classes are "mere conveniences" and classes are "logical fictions, or (as we say) 'incomplete symbols' ... classes cannot be regarded as part of the ultimate furniture of the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;146). The reason for this is because of the problem of impredicativity: "classes cannot be regarded as a species of individuals, on account of the contradiction about classes which are not members of themselves ... and because we can prove that the number of classes is greater than the number of individuals, [etc]". What he then does is propose 5 obligations that must be satisfied with respect to a theory of classes, and the result is his axiom of reducibility. He states that this axiom is "a generalised form of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). But he concludes Leibniz's assumption is not necessarily true for all possible predicates in all possible worlds, so he concludes that:

{{quote|I do not see any reason to believe that the axiom of reducibility is logically necessary, which is what would be meant by saying that it is true in all possible worlds. The admission of this axiom into a system of logic is therefore a defect ... a dubious assumption. (p. 155)}}

The goal that he sets for himself then is "adjustments to his theory" of avoiding classes:
{{quote|in its reduction of propositions nominally about classes to propositions about their defining functions. The avoidance of classes as entities by this method must, it would be seem, be sound in principle, however the detail may still require adjustment. (p. 155)}}

===Skolem 1922===
[[Thoralf Skolem]] in his 1922 ''Some remarks on axiomatised set theory'' took a less than positive attitude toward "Russell and Whitehead" (i.e. their work ''Principia Mathematica''):

{{quote|Until now, so far as I know, only ''one'' such system of axioms has found rather general acceptance, namely that constructed by Zermelo (1908). Russell and Whitehead, too, constructed a system of logic that provides a foundation for set theory; if I am not mistaken, however, mathematicians have taken but little interest in it.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:291&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skolem then observes the problems of what he called "nonpredicative definition" in the set theory of Zermelo:&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo stipulates that there exist "a domain ''B'' of objects, among which are the sets." But by a theorem Zermelo proves that this domain ''B'' cannot be a set itself "and this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned."(cf Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort:203) The ultimate problem (to be answered by Skolem [1922] and Fraenkel [1922]) is a precise definition of Zermelo's notion of ''definite property'' which, via Zermelo's Axiom of separation (Axiom der Aussonderung), when applied via a propositional function to a set ''M'', separates from ''M'' a subset e.g. ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:292).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the difficulty is that we have to form some sets whose existence depends upon ''all'' sets ... Poincaré called this kind of definition and regarded it as the real logical weakness of set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297. In a footnote 7 to the quotation above, he backs this up with a demonstration derived from the axioms of Zermelo: "A typical nonpredicative stipulation, is for example that the intersection of all sets that have an arbitrary definite property ''E'' again be a set. This in fact follows from the axioms [etc]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Skolem is mainly addressing a problem with Zermelo's set theory, he does make this observation about the ''axiom of reducibility'':

{{quote|they [Russell and Whitehead], too, simply content themselves with circumventing the difficulty by introducing a stipulation, the ''axiom of reducibility''. Actually, this axiom decrees that the nonpredicative stipulations will be satisfied. There is no proof of that; besides, so far as I can see, such a proof must be impossible from Russell and Whitehead's point of view as well as from Zermelo's. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1927===
In his 1927 ''Introduction'' to the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell criticises his own axiom:

{{quote|One point in regard to which improvement is obviously desirable is the axiom of reducibility (*12.1.11). This axiom has a purely pragmatic justification: it leads to the desired results, and to no others. But clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content. On this subject, however, it cannot be said that a satisfactory solution is as yet obtainable. ... There is another course recommended by Wittgenstein† [† ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', *5.54ff] for philosophical reasons. This is to assume that functions of propositions are always truth-functions, and that a function can only occur as in a proposition through its values. There are difficulties ... It involves the consequence that all functions of functions are extensional. ... [But the consequences of his logic are that] the theory of infinite Dedekindian and well-ordering collapses, so that irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. Also Cantor's proof that 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n'' breaks down unless ''n'' is finite. Perhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility, might give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the 2nd Edition 1927 of Whitehead and Russell 1913:xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wittgenstein's 5.54ff is more centred on the notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]:

{{quote|5.54
:In the general propositional form, propositions occur in a proposition only as bases of the truth-operations.
5.541
:At first sight it appears as if there were also a different way in which one proposition could occur in another. ¶ Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like "A thinks, that ''p'' is the case," or "A thinks ''p''," etc.  ¶ Here it appears superficially as if the proposition ''p'' stood to the object A in a kind of relation.  ¶ (And in modern epistemology [Russell, Moore, etc.] those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
5.542
:But it is clear that "A believes that ''p'', "A thinks ''p''", "A says ''p''", are of the form " ' ''p'' ' thinks ''p'' "; and here we have no co-ordination of a fact and an object, but a co-ordination of facts by means of a co-ordination of their objects.
5.5421 [etc: "A composite soul would not be a soul any longer."]
5.5422
:The correct explanation of the form of the proposition "A judges ''p''" must show that it is impossible to judge a nonsense. (Russell's theory does not satisfy this condition).&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A possible interpretation of Wittgenstein's stance is that the thinker A i.e. ''{{'}}p{{'}}'' ''is identically'' the thought ''p'', in this way the "soul" remains a unit and not a composite. So to utter "the thought thinks the thought" is nonsense, because per 5.542 the utterance does not specify anything.

===von Neumann 1925===
John von Neumann in his 1925 ''An axiomatisation of set theory'' wrestled with the same issues as did Russell, Zermelo, Skolem, and Fraenkel. He summarily rejected the effort of Russell:

{{quote|Here Russell, J. Konig, Weyl, and Brouwer must be mentioned. They arrived at entirely different results [from the set theorists], but the over-all effect of their activity seems to me outright devastating. In Russell, all of mathematics and set theory seems to rest upon the highly problematic "axiom of reducibility", while Weyl and Brouwer systematically reject the larger part of mathematics and set theory as completely meaningless.&lt;ref&gt; von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then notes the work of the set theorists Zermelo, Fraenkel and Schoenflies, in which "one understands by "set" nothing but an object of which one knows no more and wants to know no more than what follows about it from the postulates. The postulates [of set theory] are to be formulated in such a way that all the desired theorems of Cantor's set theory follow from them, but not the antinomies.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;

While he mentions the efforts of [[David Hilbert]] to prove the consistency of his axiomatisation of mathematics&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt; von Neumann placed him in the same group as Russell. Rather, von Neumann considered his proposal to be "in the spirit of the second group ... We must, however, avoid forming sets by collecting or separating elements [durch Zusammenfassung oder Aussonderung von Elementen], and so on, as well as eschew the unclear principle of 'definiteness' that can still be found in Zermelo. [...] We prefer, however, to axiomatise not 'set' but 'function'."&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:401&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Heijenoort observes that ultimately this axiomatic system of von Neumann's, "was simplified, revised, and expanded ... and it come to be known as the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:394&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hilbert 1927===
[[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert system|axiomatic system]] that he presents in his 1925 ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' is the mature expression of a task he set about in the early 1900s but let lapse for a while (cf his 1904 ''On the foundations of logic and arithmetic''). His system is neither set theoretic nor derived directly from Russell and Whitehead. Rather, it invokes 13 axioms of logic—four axioms of Implication, six axioms of logical AND and logical OR, 2 axioms of logical negation, and 1 ε-axiom ("existence" axiom)-- plus a version of the [[Peano axioms]] in 4 axioms including [[mathematical induction]], some definitions that "have the character of axioms, and certain ''recursion axioms'' that result from a general recursion schema"&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; plus some formation rules that "govern the use of the axioms".&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hilbert states that, with regard to this system, i.e. "Russell and Whitehead's theory of foundations[,] ... the foundation that it provides for mathematics rests, first, upon the axiom of infinity and, then upon what is called the axiom of reducibility, and both of these axioms are genuine contentual assumptions that are not supported by a consistency proof; they are assumptions whose validity in fact remains dubious and that, in any case, my theory does not require ... reducibility is not presupposed in my theory ... the execution of the reduction would be required only in case a proof of a contradiction were given, and then, according to my proof theory, this reduction would always be bound to succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Boldface added, Hilbert in van Heijenoort 1967:473&lt;/ref&gt;

It is upon this foundation that modern [[recursion theory]] rests.

===Ramsey 1925===
In 1925, [[Frank Plumpton Ramsey]] argued that it is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;The Foundations of Mathematics (1925), pages 1..61 of ''The Foundations of Mathematics'', F. P. Ramsey, Littlefield Adams &amp; Co, Paterson New Jersey, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; However in the second edition of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1927, page xiv) and in Ramsey's 1926 paper&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Logic, pages 62..61, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; it is stated that certain theorems about [[real numbers]] could not be proved using Ramsey's approach.  Most later mathematical formalisms (Hilbert's [[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalism]] or [[Brower]]'s [[Intuitionism]] for example) do not use it.

Ramsey showed that it is possible to reformulate the definition of ''predicative'' by using the definitions in [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].  As a result, all functions of a given order are ''predicative'', irrespective of how they are expressed.  He goes on to show that his formulation still avoids the paradoxes.  However, the "Tractatus" theory did not appear strong enough to prove some mathematical results.

===Gödel 1944===
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' offers in the words of his commentator Charles Parsons, "[what] might be seen as a defense of these [realist] attitudes of Russell against the reductionism prominent in his philosophy and implicit in much of his actual logical work. It was perhaps the most robust defense of realism about mathematics and its objects since the paradoxes and come to the consciousness of the mathematical world after 1900".&lt;ref&gt;This commentary appears on pages 102–118, and the paper itself on pages 119–141 appears in 1990 ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works, Volume II'', Oxford University Press, New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, Gödel is sympathetic to the notion that a propositional function can be reduced to (identified with) the ''real objects'' that satisfy it, but this causes problems with respect to the theory of real numbers, and even integers (p.&amp;nbsp;134). He observes that the first edition of ''PM'' "abandoned" the realist (constructivistic) "attitude" with his proposal of the axiom of reducibility (p.&amp;nbsp;133). However, within the introduction to the second edition of ''PM'' (1927) Gödel asserts "the constructivistic attitude is resumed again" (p.&amp;nbsp;133) when Russell "dropped" of the axiom of reducibility in favour of the matrix (truth-functional) theory; Russell "stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions ... [i.e.] the higher types and orders are solely a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]]''" (p.&amp;nbsp;134). But this only works when the number of individuals and primitive predicates is finite, for one can construct finite strings of symbols such as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = a_1 \vee x = a_2 \vee \dots \vee x = a_k&lt;/math&gt; [example on page 134]
And from such strings one can form strings of strings to obtain the equivalent of classes of classes, with a mixture of types possible. However, from such finite strings the whole of mathematics cannot be constructed because they cannot be "analyzed", i.e. reducible to the law of identity or disprovable by a negations of the law:
{{quote|Even the theory of integers is non-analytic, provided that one requires of the rules of elimination that they allow one actually to carry out the elimination in a finite number of steps in each case.&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Because this would imply the existence of a decision procedure for all arithmetical propositions. Cf. ''Turing 1937''.) ... [Thus] the whole of mathematics as applied to sentences of infinite length has to be presupposed to prove [the] analyticity [of the theory of integers], e.g., the axiom of choice can be proved to be analytic only if is assumed to be true. (p. 139)}}

But he observes that "this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other" (p.&amp;nbsp;134), and he states in the next paragraph that "the question of whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy must be considered as unsolved." (p.&amp;nbsp;135)

Gödel proposed that one should take a "more conservative approach":

{{quote|make the meaning of the terms "class" and "concept" clearer, and to set up a consistent theory of classes and concepts as objectively existing entities. This is the course which the actual development of mathematical logic has been taking ... Major among the attempts in this direction  ... are the simple theory of types ... and axiomatic set theory, both of which have been successful at least to this extent, that they permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes. Many symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation. (p. 140)}}

===W. V. Quine 1967===
In a critique that also discusses the pros and cons of Ramsey (1931)&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; Quine calls Russell's formulation of "types" to be "troublesome ... the confusion persists as he attempts to define {{'}}''n''th order propositions'... the method is indeed oddly devious ... the axiom of reducibility is self-effacing", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kleene Quine observes that Ramsey (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:532 gives this reference: "Ramsey, F. P. 1926, ''The foundations of mathematics'', Proc. London Math. Soc., ser. 2, vol. 25, pp. 338–384. Reprinted as pp. 1–61 in ''The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays'' by F. P. Ramsey, ed. by R. B. Braithwaite, London (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner) and new your (Harcourt, brace) 1931. The latter reprinted London (Routledge and Kegan Paul) and New York (Humanities Press) 1950."&lt;/ref&gt; (1931) divided the various paradoxes into two varieties (i) "those of pure set theory" and (ii) those derived from "semantic concepts such as falsity and specifiability", and Ramsey believed that the second variety should have been left out of Russell's solution. Quine ends with the opinion that "because of the confusion of propositions with sentences, and of attributes with their expressions, Russell's purported solution of the semantic paradoxes was enigmatic anyway."&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152. Kleene (1952) is less sanguine about the problem of the paradoxes, cf Kleene 1952:43. Kleene 1952 analyzes the situation this way: that Ramsey 1926 classifies the paradoxes as the "logical" versus the "epistomolical or "semantical" and Ramsey observes that the logical antinomies are (apparently) stopped by the simple hierarchy of types, and the semantical ones are (apparently) prevented ... by the absence ... of the requisite means for referring to expressions in the same language. But Ramsey's arguments to justify impredicative definitions within a type entail a conception of the totality of predicates of the type as existing independently of their constructibility or definability"; thus neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded (see at Kleene 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephen Kleene 1952===
In his section '''§12. First inferences from the paradoxes''', subchapter "LOGICISM" Kleene (1952) traces the development of Russell's theory of types:
{{quote|To adapt the logicistic [sic] construction of mathematics to the situation arising from the discovery of the paradoxes, Russell excluded impredicative definitions by his ''ramified theory of types'' (1908, 1910).&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kleene observes that "to exclude impredicative definitions within a type, the types above type 0 [primary objects or individuals "not subjected to logical analysis"] are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1 [properties of individuals, i.e. logical results of the [[propositional calculus]] ], properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order'' 0, and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order below to the next higher order)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene, however, parenthetically observes that "the logicistic definition of natural number now becomes predicative when the [property] P in it is specified to range only over properties of a given order; in [this] case the property of being a natural number is of the next higher order".&lt;ref&gt;Slight punctuation changes added for clarity, Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which [see Kleene's example at [[Impredicativity]]] contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''axiom of reducibility''.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But, Kleene wonders, "on what grounds should we believe in the axiom of reducibility?"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that, whereas ''Principia Mathematica'' is presented as derived from ''intuitively''-derived axioms that "were intended to be believed about the world, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world[,] ... if properties are to be constructed, the matter should be settled on the basis of constructions, not by an axiom." Indeed, he quotes Whitehead and Russell (1927) questioning their own axiom: "clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45, quoting from Whitehead and Russell's introduction to their 1927 2nd edition of ''Principia Mathematica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene references work of Ramsey 1926 but notes that "neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded in attaining the logicistic goal constructively" and "an interesting proposal ... by Langford 1927 and Carnap 1931-2, is also not free of difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;both quotes from Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; Kleene ends this discussion with quotes from Weyl (1946) that "the system of ''Principia Mathematica'' ... [is founded on] a sort of logician's paradise" and anyone "who is ready to believe in this 'transcendental world' could also accept the system of axiomatic set theory (Zermelo, Fraenkel, etc), which, for the deduction of mathematics, has the advantage of being simpler in structure."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Bioliquids''' are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like [[Palm oil|palm]] or [[Soybean oil|soya]] oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.

[[Rudolf Diesel]]'s first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on [[peanut]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/3986 Sustainable Energy From Vegetable Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioliquid production and use==
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.

A controversial plant in [[Bristol]] (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12439191 BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go-ahead by Eric Pickles]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.

==Advantages==
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref name="greenwise"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315021204/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2012-03-15 | title= Bioliquids: do they have a role in renewable energy? | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= March 2011 | work=  | publisher= Green Wise Business | accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bioliquids have a high energy density
* The technology is well established, having been used for many years
* Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power
* Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil.
* Reduces the green house gas emissions.

==Disadvantages==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}

Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], impact on [[water resources]], as well as energy balance and efficiency.

Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-bioliquid-feedstocks-and-heat-electricity-and-chp-technologies-nnfcc-11-016 Evaluation of Bioliquid Feedstocks &amp; Heat, Elec. &amp; CHP Technologies, NNFCC 11-016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Price of fuel is very variable, due to competitiveness of feedstock for other uses (e.g. soap)
* Supply chain is still very new
* Governments, such as the EU, remained undecided on bioliquids

:''For the U.S. National Vegetation Classification, see [[U.S. National Vegetation Classification]].

The '''British National Vegetation Classification''' or '''NVC''' is a system of classifying [[nature|natural]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] types in [[Great Britain]] according to the [[vegetation]] they contain.

A large scientific meeting of [[ecologist]]s, [[botanist]]s, and other related professionals in the [[United Kingdom]] resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books: ''[[British Plant Communities]]'', edited by [[John S. Rodwell]], which detail the incidence of plant species in twelve major habitat types in the British [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Rodwell"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British Plant Communities]] |isbn=0521797160|editor-first=John S. |editor-last=Rodwell |editor-link=John S. Rodwell|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1998–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the [[vegetation]] types of the country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (not [[Northern Ireland]]) and represent fifteen years of research by leading plant [[ecology|ecologists]].

From the data collated from the books, commercial [[software]] products have been developed to help to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain – these include ''MATCH'', ''TABLEFIT'' and ''MAVIS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/jncc335.pdf |title=National Vegetation Classification – Ten years’ experience using the woodland section |editor-first=E |editor-last=Goldberg |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee|JNCC]] |date=April 2001}} citing:

== Terminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification ==

The following is a list of terms used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification, together with their meanings:

=== Communities, subcommunities and variants ===

*A '''community''' is the fundamental unit of categorisation for vegetation.
*A '''subcommunity''' is a distinct recognisable subdivision of a community.
*A '''variant''' is a further subdivision of a subcommunity.

=== Constant species ===

*A '''constant species''' in a community is a species that is always present in any given stand of vegetation belonging to that community.

For a list of the constant species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of constant species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

=== Rare species ===

*A '''rare species''' is a species which is associated with a particular community and is rare nationally.

:The sources used by the authors of ''[[British Plant Communities]]'' for assessing rarity were as follows. 
:a) for [[vascular plant]]s, two sources were used:
::*Perring, F. H. and S. M. Walters (1962) ''[[Atlas of the British Flora]]'' - a species was regarded as rare if it was given an "A" rating in this work (these were plants which Perring &amp; Walters judged to be sufficiently rare to merit a special search in order to ensure all records were included in the atlas).
::*Any species included on lists compiled by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] of plants found in less than 100 [[hectad]]s.

:b) for [[bryophyte]]s, the source used was Corley, M. F. V. and M. O. Hill (1981) ''Distribution of bryophytes in the British Isles''. This lists the species and the [[vice-county|vice-counties]] in which they are recorded; presence in under 20 vice-counties was the criterion used for selection as rare.

:c) for [[lichen]]s, no source was available, and the authors used their own selection of species.

For a list of these rare species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see [[List of rare species in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

== Communities by category ==

In total there are 286 communities in the British National Vegetation Classification. They are grouped into the following major categories:

* [[Woodland and scrub communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Woodland and scrub communities]] (25 communities, prefixed with the letter "W" &amp;mdash; 19 classed as woodland, four as scrub and two as 'underscrub')
* [[Mires in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mires]] (38 communities, prefixed "M")
* [[Heaths in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Heaths]] (22 communities, prefixed "H")
* [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mesotrophic grasslands]] (13 communities, prefixed "MG")
* [[Calcicolous grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcicolous grasslands]] (14 communities, prefixed "CG")
* [[Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities]] (21 communities, prefixed "U")
* [[Aquatic communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Aquatic communities]] (24 communities, prefixed "A")
* [[Swamps and tall-herb fens in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Swamps and tall-herb fens]] (28 communities, prefixed "S")
* [[Salt-marsh communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Salt-marsh communities]] (28 communities, prefixed "SM")
* [[Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities]] (19 communities, prefixed "SD" &amp;mdash; one shingle, two strandline and 16 sand-dune communities)
* [[Maritime cliff communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Maritime cliff communities]] (12 communities, prefixed "MC")
* [[Vegetation of open habitats in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Vegetation of open habitats]] (42 communities, prefixed "OV")

A full list of these communities, grouped into the above categories, can be found at [[List of plant communities in the British National Vegetation Classification]].

Richards is Professor of Media Arts at the [[University of Ottawa]].&lt;ref name="University of Ottawa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty of Arts /Catherine Richards|url=http://arts.uottawa.ca/visualarts/people/richards-catherine|website=arts.uottawa.ca|publisher=University of Ottawa|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Catherine Richards' work explores the spectator and information technology relationship as the "jam in the electro-magnetic sandwich."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catherinerichards.ca/biography.html|title=Catherine Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; She deals with both old and new types of technology, exploreing the volatile sense of ourselves as we are shifting our boundaries - a process in which new technologies play a starring role.

Richards has exhibited within and without North America at major venues including the 2004 [[Sydney Biennale]]. Her work has been discussed in publications by major theorists in the field including [[Katherine Hayles]] and [[Frances Dyson]], and has been included in key surveys such as [https://books.google.ca/books/about/Art_+_Science_Now.html?id=zKBGAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Art &amp; Science Now], edited by Stephen Wilson. Richards is well known for collaborating with scientists and won the Artist in Residence for Research Fellowship (AIRes) at the [[National Research Council of Canada]], 2002-2005, and is the recipient of the highest media prize in Canada from [[Canada Council for the Arts]], Media Arts.  Her work on virtuality and new media is considered groundbreaking in setting the aesthetic terrain, realm of artistic intervention and substantive issues.

Richards was the first and sole artist to be awarded University Research Chair at the University of Ottawa. As a model for other universities, it is part of an on-going movement across North America to accept art as research within universities, a goal in which Richards has played a significant pioneering role.

[[Image:Joseph Justus Scaliger - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|222px|[[Joseph Scaliger]]'s ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) began the modern science of chronology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = E. G. | last = Richards | author-link = E. G. Richards | title = Mapping Time: The Calendar and History | place = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1998 | pages = 12–13 | isbn = 0-19-286205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}}, ''chrónos'', "time"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chronology|volume=6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]]. Consider, for example, the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also "the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events".&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;Memidex/WordNet, "chronology," [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]].

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon [[chronometry]], which is also known as timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{Main article|Calendar}}

The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the 8th century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is the date (year usually) when an era begins.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main article|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for "from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])",&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as "From the city having been founded".&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king lists]], late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: "The [[Beaker People]]" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne |date=November 2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological synchronism==
The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon of Eusebius]] (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. The adjacent image shows two pages from the second section.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Eusebius Chronicon example.png|thumb|alt=Example pages from the Chronicon of Eusebius.|Chronicon of Eusebius.]] --&gt;

By comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an [[Anno Mundi]] (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Hebrew [[Pentateuch]]. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as [[George Syncellus]] (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurus temporum'' (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.&lt;ref name=Grafton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the [[Eclipse of Thales]], described in the first book of [[Herodotus]] can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1441976239|pages=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|sequence dating]].

'''Combinatory categorial grammar''' ('''CCG''') is an efficiently [[parsable]], yet linguistically expressive grammar formalism. It has a transparent interface between surface syntax and underlying semantic representation, including predicate-argument structure, quantification and information structure. The formalism generates constituency-based structures (as opposed to dependency-based ones) and is therefore a type of [[phrase structure grammar]] (as opposed to a [[dependency grammar]]).

CCG relies on [[combinatory logic]], which has the same expressive power as the [[lambda calculus]], but builds its expressions differently. The first linguistic and psycholinguistic arguments for basing the grammar on combinators were put forth by [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]. More recent prominent proponents of the approach are [http://cog.brown.edu/People/jacobson/ Jacobson] and [http://www.jasonbaldridge.com/ Baldridge].

For example, the [[combinator]] B (the compositor) is useful in creating long-distance dependencies, as in "Who do you think Mary is talking about?" and the combinator W (the duplicator) is useful as the lexical interpretation of reflexive pronouns, as in "Mary talks about herself". Together with I (the identity mapping) and C (the permutator) these form a set of primitive, non-interdefinable combinators. Jacobson interprets personal pronouns as the combinator I, and their binding is aided by a complex combinator Z, as in "Mary lost her way". Z is definable using W and B.

==Parts of the formalism==

The CCG formalism defines a number of combinators (application, composition, and type-raising being the most common). These operate on syntactically-typed lexical items, by means of [[Natural deduction]] style proofs. The goal of the proof is to find some way of applying the combinators to a sequence of lexical items until no lexical item is unused in the proof. The resulting type after the proof is complete is the type of the whole expression. Thus, proving that some sequence of words is a sentence of some language amounts to proving that the words reduce to the type ''S''.

===Syntactic types===

The syntactic type of a lexical item can be either a primitive type, such as ''S'', ''N'', or ''NP'', or complex, such as ''S\NP'', or ''NP/N''.

The complex types, schematizable as ''X/Y'' and ''X\Y'', denote functor types that take an argument of type ''Y'' and return an object of type ''X''. A forward slash denotes that the argument should appear to the right, while a backslash denotes that the argument should appear on the left. Any type can stand in for the ''X'' and ''Y'' here, making syntactic types in CCG a recursive type system.

===Application combinators===

The application combinators, often denoted by ''&gt;'' for forward application and ''&lt;'' for backward application, apply a lexical item with a functor type to an argument with an appropriate type. The definition of application is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y}{\alpha \beta : X}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X}&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Composition combinators===

The composition combinators, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward composition and &lt;math&gt;B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward composition, are similar to function composition from mathematics, and can be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y/Z}{\alpha \beta : X/Z}B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y\backslash Z \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X\backslash Z}B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Type-raising combinators===

The type-raising combinators, often denoted as &lt;math&gt;T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward type-raising and &lt;math&gt;T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward type-raising, take argument types (usually primitive types) to functor types, which take as their argument the functors that, before type-raising, would have taken them as arguments.

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T/(T\backslash X)}T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T\backslash (T/X)}T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

The sentence "the dog bit John" has a number of different possible proofs. Below are a few of them. The variety of proofs demonstrates the fact that in CCG, sentences don't have a single structure, as in other models of grammar.

Let the types of these lexical items be

&lt;math&gt;the : NP/N \qquad dog : N \qquad John : NP \qquad bit : (S\backslash NP)/NP&lt;/math&gt;

We can perform the simplest proof (changing notation slightly for brevity) as:

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
       \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
       \qquad
       \dfrac{dog}{N}
    }{NP}&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
        \qquad
        \dfrac{John}{NP}
    }{S\backslash NP}&gt;
}{S}&lt;
&lt;/math&gt;

Opting to type-raise and compose some, we could get a fully incremental, left-to-right proof.  The ability to construct such a proof is an argument for the psycholinguistic plausibility of CCG, because listeners do in fact construct partial interpretations (syntactic and semantic) of utterances before they have been completed.

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{
            \dfrac{
                \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
                \dfrac{dog}{N}
                \qquad
            }{NP}&gt;
        }{S/(S\backslash NP)}T_&gt;
        \qquad
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
    }{S/NP}B_&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{John}{NP}
}{S}&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal properties ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

CCGs are known to be able to generate the language &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n : n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a non-context-free [[indexed language]]). A grammar for this language  can be found in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994).&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995" /&gt;

Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994)&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995"&gt;Vijay-Shanker, K. and Weir, David J. 1994. ''The Equivalence of Four Extensions of Context-Free Grammars''. Mathematical Systems Theory 27(6): 511–546.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that [[Indexed grammar#Linear indexed grammars|Linear Indexed Grammars]], Combinatory Categorial Grammars, [[Tree-adjoining grammar|Tree-adjoining Grammars]], and [[Head grammar|Head Grammars]] are [[Weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] formalisms, in that they all define the same string languages. Kuhlmann et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="KuhlmannKollerSatta2015"&gt;Kuhlmann, M., Koller, A., and Satta, G. 2015. ''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/COLI_a_00219 Lexicalization and Generative Power in CCG]''. Computational Linguistics 41(2): 215-247.&lt;/ref&gt; show that this equivalence, and the ability of CCG to describe &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n}&lt;/math&gt;, rely crucially on the ability to restrict the use of the combinatory rules to certain categories, in ways not explained above.

[[Image:Tyszowiecka Confederation 1655.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The swearing in of the [[Tyszowce Confederation]] in 1655, painting by [[Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski]].]]
A '''konfederacja''' ({{IPA-pl|kɔ̃fɛdɛˈrat͡sja|lang|Pl-konfederacja.ogg}}, "confederation") was an ''[[ad hoc]]'' association formed by Polish-Lithuanian ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility), clergy, cities, or military forces in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for the attainment of stated aims. A konfederacja often took the form of an armed rebellion aimed at redressing perceived abuses or trespasses of some (e.g. royal) authority. Such "confederations" acted in lieu of state authority or to force their demands upon that authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; They could be seen as a primary expression of [[direct democracy]] and [[right of revolution]] in the Commonwealth, and as a way for the nobles to act on their grievances and against the state's central authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

==History and function==
In the late 13th century, confederations of cities, aiming to support public safety and provide security from rampant banditry, appeared, with the first confederation being that of several towns ([[Poznań]], [[Pyzdry]], [[Gniezno]] and [[Kalisz]] in [[Greater Poland]]) in 1298.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-125-132"/&gt; In the mid-14th century, confederations of nobility, directed against the central authorities, emerged, with the first such confederation being that of 1352.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-125-132"/&gt; During [[interregnum]]s, confederations (essentially vigilance committees) formed to replace the inactive royal court, protect internal order, and defend the country from external dangers.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The confederations, as a [[right of revolution]], were recognized in [[Polish law]] through the [[Henrician articles]] (1573), part of the [[pacta conventa]] sworn by every Polish king since 1576.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;&lt;ref name=bardach2/&gt; They stated (in the ''articulus de non praestanda oboedientia'', a rule dating to 1501 from [[Privilege of Mielnik]]&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;) that if the monarch did not recognize or abused the rights and privileges of the nobility (szlachta), the nobles would no longer be bound to obey him and would have the legal right to disobey him.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;

With the beginning of the 17th century, confederations became an increasingly significant element of the Commonwealth's political scene.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, confederations were organized by [[magnates]], and were either pro- or anti-royal.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A confederation not recognized by the king was considered a ''[[rokosz]]'' ("rebellion"), although some of the rokosz would be eventually recognized by the king, who could even join them himself.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Most pro-royal confederations were usually formed as a response to an anti-royal one, and some would take a form of an extraordinary session of the parliament ([[sejm]]), as happened in 1710, 1717 and 1735.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Confederations where usually formed in one part of the country, and could expand into "general confederations" taking in most or all of the [[voivodeships of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; However, even such general confederations would be formed separately for the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Each confederation had a key document explaining its goals, known as the act of the confederation, which was deposited with the court (usually the local court for the region the confederation was formed).&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Additional resolutions of the confederates, known as ''sanctia'', would also be deposited with the court.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Membership of the confederation was voluntary, and required an oath.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The executive branch of a confederation was headed by a marshal, and a group of advisers, each known as ''konsyliarz konfederacji''.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A marshal and associated konsyliarze were known as a generality (''generalność'').&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A confederation would also have a larger council, similar to a parliament (''walna rada''), which made decisions by majority vote.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Until around the mid-18th century, resolutions of the council had to be [[unanimous]], but afterwards, majority voting became more common.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The chief military commanders of confederations were known as [[regimentarz]]e.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Also in the 18th century an institution known as a "[[confederated sejm]]" evolved.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; It was a parliament session (sejm) that operated under the rules of a confederation.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Its primary purpose was to avoid being subject to disruption by the ''[[liberum veto]]'', unlike the national Sejm, which was paralyzed by the veto during this period.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed from the whole membership of the national Sejm, so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate there.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

Confederations were proscribed by law in 1717, but continued to operate, indicating a weakness of the Commonwealth's central authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; They were also abolished by the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]] (adopted by the [[Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788–1792, itself a confederated sejm).&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; But in practice this prohibition was not observed. The May 3rd Constitution was overthrown in mid-1792, by the [[Targowica Confederation]] of Polish magnates backed by [[Russian Empire]] and eventually joined, under extreme duress, by King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław II August]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-184-185"/&gt; The ensuing Russian military intervention led (to the Confederates' surprise) to the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-184-185"/&gt; One of the last instances of confederation came in 1812, when the [[General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] to [[Napoleon I]]'s campaign against the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

The '''conflict between [[good and evil]]''' is one of the most common conventional themes in [[literature]], and is sometimes considered to be a universal part of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtransformation.com/good-vs-evil/ ''Good vs Evil''&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several variations on this conflict, one being the battle between individuals or ideologies, with one side held up as ''[[Goodness and value theory|Good]]'', while the other is portrayed as ''[[Evil]]''. Another variation is the inner struggle in characters (and by extension, humans in reality) between good and evil. 

==Classical tragedy==
The form of tragedy described as best by [[Aristotle]] and exemplified by ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is, properly, concerned more with the tragic operations of fate than with a thematized conflict between good and evil. Nevertheless, the conflict between the good and the flawed aspects of the [[tragic hero]] form an important part of tragic [[catharsis]] in Aristotle's theory. There is, moreover, the form of tragedy with a happy ending that, although denigrated from Aristotle, was quite common in antiquity. This form, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alcestis]] of [[Euripides]], ends with a hero or god decisively beating an evil character.  [[Northrop Frye]] has suggested that this form of "tragedy" is, in fact, the basic template for [[melodrama]].
&lt;gallery&gt;

Sometimes referred to as "The Good War," the Second World War has arguably come in western discourse to signify the very idea of a [[Just War Theory|just war]] between Good (The Allies) and Evil (The Axis), in both popular and at times even academic spheres.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Jewish and Christian literature==
Writers from the earliest times have thematized the conflict between good and evil, understood, of course, in religious terms.  In the [[Old Testament]], [[Yahweh]] asks the prophet [[Jeremiah]]: "The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse—who can understand it?" ({{bibleref|Jeremiah|17:9}}, [[NRSV]]). Compare also the [[Book of Job]].
  
In addition to explicating [[classical antiquity|classical]] myth and stories to reveal a hidden conflict between good and evil in them, they wrote into their own texts different versions of the conflict.  The basic forms may be described as the [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], in which the writer describes real, social events (whether historical or imagined) as manifestations of the eternal conflict between [[God]] and [[Satan]], good and evil &amp;mdash; a struggle that, if controlled in the end by God's [[omnipotence]], was nevertheless of deep importance for humans.  In a different way, Christian writers could focus on the internal struggle to find or maintain belief. This literature is exemplified by the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' of [[Prudentius]], whose title continues to signify great psychological turmoil, and supremely by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine of Hippo's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', the model for countless later psychological biographies. Special mention might also be made of the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], a work that combines Platonic, Christian, and Stoic thought on the nature of suffering.

== The inner evil conflict ==
[[Joseph Conrad]] defined all humans as having an "inner evil" or ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' in his novella of the same name.

While certainly not as widely seen as the direct good vs. evil conflict, the concept of "individual vs. self" is often much more compelling to a reader/watcher, especially if it is the [[protagonist]]. In both [[literature]] and [[film]], it requires well-written character development in order to truly succeed.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s version of the inner evil conflict, known as the [[Heart of Darkness]], is a [[human]]'s struggle with their own [[morals]], and their own battle with their hidden evil. Although first chiefly used in the novel, this improved device was commonly used, as opposed to the old devices used in literature before the turn of the century. It is a conflict that exists outside of literature as well, making it a universal truth of the human condition.

'''Conspiracies against the laity''' is a term coined by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in his 1906 play [[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]. The conspiracies refer to the methods used by professions to acquire prestige, power and wealth.

On the subject of such conspiracies, [[Tim Harford]] argued the following in his 2006 book [[The Undercover Economist]]: "... doctors, actuaries, accountants and lawyers manage to maintain high wages through... erecting virtual 'green belts' to make it hard for competitors to set up shop. Typical virtual green belts will include very long qualification periods and professional bodies that give their approval only to a certain number of candidates per year. Many of the organisations that are put forth to protect us from 'unqualified' professionals in fact serve to maintain the high rates of the 'qualified' to whom we are directed."

Shaw's sentiments echo Adam Smith's earlier writing: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''creative class''' is a posited [[social class|socioeconomic class]] identified by American economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. According to Florida, the creative class are a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]].

==Overview==
Florida describes the creative class as comprising 40 million workers (about 30 percent of the U.S. workforce). He breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* Super-creative core: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, [[computer programming]], research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to "fully engage in the creative process" (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. "Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* Creative [[professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They "draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems" using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the creative class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|title=Bohemia and Economic Geography|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|date=2002|volume=2|pages=55–71|doi=10.1093/jeg/2.1.55|url=http://creativeclass.com/rfcgdb/articles/6%20Bohemia_and_Economic_Geography.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 study, Florida concluded that the creative class would be the leading force of growth in the economy expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade, which would in 2012 equal almost 40% of the population.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]'s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore]], [[Dublin]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the creative class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to spur regional economic growth through innovation (2002).

Walter Grünzweig, professor for American Studies at [[Technical University of Dortmund]], has shown that the origin of the term “creative class” does not lie with Florida, but instead goes back to a passage in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay "Power" in his collection ''[[The Conduct of Life]]'' (1860).&lt;ref&gt;Grünzweig, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
Florida says that the creative class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes "people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today's global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the creative class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The creative class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the creative class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the creative class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today's global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Talent Development &amp; Excellence Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The impact of smart fractions, cognitive ability of politicians and average competence of peoples on social development |journal=International Research Association for Talent Development and Excellence |year=2009 |last=Rindermann |first=Heiner |authorlink=Heiner_Rindermann |last2=Sailer |first2=Michael |last3=Thompson |first3=James |authorlink3=|issn=1869-2885 |format=PDF }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high creative class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose "bobos" roughly correspond to Florida's creative class), and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by [[Ross Honeywill]] (whose NEOs deliver a more sophisticated level of evidence), has shown that cities which attract and retain creative residents prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop "Cool Cities," Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess "the three 'T's": Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class'', Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the "three 'T's", have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a "leading city in a new economy".

The "Creativity Index" is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: "the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area's openness" (2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's "Gay Index" and "Bohemian Index" developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002).

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as "people will go to where the jobs/factories are"). Creative workers are no longer bound by physical products, rather working with intellectual products. Their migration to metropolitan urban areas where creative work is available is more due to the attraction of leisure life and community rather than actual work. Although the Creative Class works towards the globalization of progressive and innovative ideas and products, they can also be considered to value local community and local autonomy. Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best "be themselves".

"The main assumption underlying this approach is that creative workers seek creative outlets in all aspects of their lives and therefore migrate to cities that actively support their preferred lifestyles" (Donegan et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;181).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Which Indicators Explain Metropolitan Economic Performance Best?

Each year Florida and the Martin Prosperity Institute release the [[Global Creativity Index]], an international study of nations, ranking countries on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. "The GCI is a broad-based measure for advanced economic growth and sustainable prosperity based on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. It rates and ranks 139 nations worldwide on each of these dimensions and on our overall measure of creativity and prosperity" (Florida et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://martinprosperity.org/content/the-global-creativity-index-2015/|title = The Global Creativity Index 2015|date = July 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI takes into account the diversity of geographical locations noting their openness as the means for progressive ideas to prosper. "Tolerance and openness to diversity is part and parcel of the broad cultural shift toward post-materialist values... Tolerance—or, broadly speaking openness to diversity—provides an additional source of economic advantage that works alongside technology and talent" (Florida, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of the Creative Class|last = Florida|first = Richard|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity allows these locations to attract creative individuals and therefore stimulate economic growth. The findings from the 2015 GCI measured 139 countries on their creativity and prosperity. Ranked number one on the 2015 GCI is Australia.

Share of Gross National Product spent on Research and Development is constantly raising at world level. Creative activities are growing at a fast pace in most advanced countries.  60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist. Repetitive works are being robotized. The whole world is becoming a "[[Creational Society]]".

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation in a variety of experiential activities. Florida (2002) uses the term "Street Level Culture" to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a "teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators" (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy a wide variety of activities (e.g., traveling, antique shopping, bike riding, and running) that highlight the collective interest in being participants and not spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of Florida's Creative Class theory. This body of critical empirical research demonstrates how the Creative Class thesis, and the associated [[creative city]] policy prescriptions, in fact exacerbate social and economic inequalities in cities in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eugene|first=McCann|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative-City Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jeffrey|title=From brew town to cool town: neoliberalism and the creative city development strategy in Milwaukee|journal=Cities|year=2008|volume=25|issue=4|pages=230–242|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2008.04.006|url=http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/zimmerman08.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catungal|first=J.

=== Statistical indices and composition ===
Scholars in the disciplines of economics, geography, sociology, and related social sciences have challenged Florida's conception of the "creative class", particularly for the perceived fuzziness of the concept and the lack of analytical precision.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1921–1940}}&lt;ref name="Evans, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.|title=Creative cities, creative spaces, and urban policy|journal=Urban Studies|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5/6|pages=1003–1040|doi=10.1177/0042098009103853|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319103434/http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boren and Young, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=T.|author2=C.

Studies and popular accounts have questioned whether the creative class is more likely to live in the homogenous, low-density suburban periphery.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1923}}{{sfn|Lang|Danielsen|2005|pp=203–220}}&lt;ref name="David Brooks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=David|title=Patio Man and the Sprawl People|url=http://staging.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/531wlvng.asp?page=1#|work=The Weekly Standard|publisher=The Weekly Standard LLC|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social scientists have also identified problems with the occupational composition of the creative class. Economic geographer Stefan Kratke challenges the inclusion of financial and real estate professionals within the creative class on two accounts: 1) these individuals played a decisive role as the "dealer class" in the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|ongoing financial crises]], and therefore cannot be considered a basis for sustainable urban and regional economic growth;{{sfn|Kratke|2011|pp=43–46}} and 2) the financial and real estate industries (especially in headquarter cities) are economically significant regional/urban players only because they are largely "reliant on inflows of wealth created by productive activities in other regions."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=50}} Moreover, Kratke argues that the "political class" is also ill-suited to be included within creative class, as they are, in many cases, implicated in neoliberal financial deregulation and the rise in highly unstable urban and regional growth regimes{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=45}} evident through [[real estate bubble]]s across the United States and in other countries. In "Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class", Ann Markusen argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative.{{sfn|Markusen|2006}} Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida's indices become insignificant after controlling for [[education]]. Markusen argues that Florida "does not seem to understand the nature of the occupational statistics he uses" and calls for the major occupational groups to be disaggregated.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1922—1923}} She questions the inclusion of particular occupations within these broad categories such as claim adjusters, funeral directors, tax collectors, yet argues that "[t]hese occupations may indeed be creative, but so too are airplane pilots, ship engineers, millwrights, and tailors – all of whom are uncreative in Florida's tally."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1923}} Moreover, it is questioned whether human creativity can be conflated with education since "[p]eople at all levels of education exercise considerable inventiveness."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1924}}

===Economic growth===

Research shows that economic growth is experienced when the significance of scientifically/technologically and artistically creative workers is taken into account, but this macro-level conclusion can be drawn without Florida's creative class theory, which provides more of an "affirmation of contemporary class relations."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=89}} Other scholars have criticized the very basis for Florida's definition of "[[creativity]]" which many argue is conceived of narrowly and is only valued for the potential for financial and [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=C.|author2=N.

The creative class thesis—and [[Richard Florida]] himself—have been criticized for what appears to be a change in Florida's prognosis for America's ailing [[Rust Belt]] cities. Florida's message was so quickly and enthusiastically adopted by cities because he argued that any city had the potential to become a vibrant, creative city with the right infrastructure investments, policies, and consulting advice.{{sfn|Peck|2005}} A 2009 article, "The Ruse of the Creative Class", questions Florida's costly speaking engagements in struggling industrial cities in which he offered optimistic prognoses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|title=The Ruse of the Creative Class|url=http://prospect.org/article/ruse-creative-class-0|work=The American Prospect|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and his more recent pronouncements that many American cities may never be saved in the wake of the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=How the Crash Will Reshape America|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/how-the-crash-will-reshape-america/307293/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative class thesis has also drawn criticisms for relying on [[inner city]] [[property development]], [[gentrification]], and urban [[labor markets]] reliant on low-wage [[Service sector|service workers]], particularly in the [[hospitality industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCann|first=E.|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative City-Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|access-date=2013-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peck|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=J.|title=Recreative City: Amsterdam, Vehicular Ideas and the Adaptive Spaces of Creativity Policy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2012|volume=36|issue=3|pages=462–485|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=210–219}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jakob|first=D.|title=Constructing the creative neighborhood: hopes and limitations of creative city policies in Berlin|journal=City, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=193–198|doi=10.1016/j.ccs.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zavos|first=Alison|title=A Portrait of East Austin and the Universal Story of Gentrification|url=http://www.featureshoot.com/2012/08/a-portrait-of-east-austin-and-the-universal-story-of-gentrification/|work=Feature Shoot|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Michael|title=East Austin Gentrification|url=http://www.klru.org/austinnow/archives/gentrification/index.php|work=Austin Now|publisher=KLRU|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Chloe|title=Hipster culture comes at a price in East Austin neighborhood|url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_8ef931d8-1713-11e2-a081-001a4bcf6878.html|work=Hilltop Views|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithson|first=Kate|title=Extreme makeover: gentrification transforms East Austin|url=http://abcnews.go.com/OnCampus/story?id=7399717&amp;page=1|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=David|title=How Much Tech Can One City Take?|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/how-much-tech-can-one-city-take|work=San Francisco Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida has called for service workers' wages to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cities must strategize to boost service workers' pay|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171257463/cities-must-strategize-to-boost-service-workers-pay|work=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots resistance===

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name="Creative Class Struggle."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name="Whyte, Murray.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7568">The Domar Serfdom Model is a mid-to-late 20th century model that develops a hypothesis concerning the causes of agricultural slavery or serfdom in historical societies. [[Evsey Domar]] first presented this model in his 1970 paper, “ The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis” published in the [[The Economic History Review|Economic History Review]]. The Domar Serfdom Model revives a hypothesis originally suggested by Russian Historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], who looks at the causes of slavery through the lens of the Russian experience in the 16th and 17th centuries. In his revisiting of the hypothesis, Domar aims to give it wider applicability while focusing more on an analysis that yields an economic model as an explanation of the causes of slavery.

== Assumptions and Hypothesis ==

In his model of serfdom, Domar assumes the following:

* Land and labor are the only factors of production (no capital or management required) (Domar, 2)	 
* Land is of uniform quality and location is a non-factor 
* Constant returns in labor (marginal product of labor is constant, and nearly equal to the average product of labor)

In addition, Domar asserts that there are 3 elements of agricultural structure relevant in his model: 
	
# Abundant free land
# Abundant free labor (free peasants)
# Large Scale Agriculture (non-working landowners)

Domar claims that any 2 of these 3 elements can exist cohesively, but never can all 3 elements exist simultaneously in any particular situation.  Dependent on which elements exist cohesively, one will see differing types of societies.  (Domar, 5)
	The Domar Serfdom Model characteristics bond labor to being a product of human choice and creation. Taking Q=F(Land, Labor), stated in words as production being a function of land and labor, and under the assumptions that production requires only land and labor,  production demonstrates constant returns to scale, and there is an abundance of free land, than free-wage labor will not exist.
Additionally, production units will require bond labor. It is this attribution of bond labor resulting from human choice that separates Domar’s model from models that attribute slavery to a product of nature, such as [[Staples thesis|Staple’s Thesis]].  (Domar, 5)

== Historical Application ==

Domar concentrates the testing of his model on historical analysis of serfdom and slavery in Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Western Europe, and the United States.  
	Domar’s analysis of Russia looks at pre-1550, where Russian peasants were free men, and 100 years later, where Russian peasants were serfs. (Domar, 8) Domar states that the relevant factors contributing to this change in classification were the number of servants required by the military and the population density. (Domar, 8) In the second half of the 15th century, the Russian government began distributing land, depopulating the central areas of the country. By the start of the 17th century, a high land/labor ratio was present in addition to the governmental need to create a large class of servants, which caused a large increase in serfdom levels in Russia into the 19th century. (Domar, 11)
	In Poland-Lithuania, relevant factors leading to the increase in slavery and serfdom started in the 14th century with a conquering of Ukrainian land, leading to a much higher land/labor ratio in the newly expanded region. (Domar, 11-12) In addition, the immigration out of the central areas and into the more peripheral areas of the state led to a more homogenous land/labor ratio throughout the entire state. (Domar, 12)
	In his analysis of serfdom in Western Europe, Domar suggests that depopulation of the late Rome Empire created a large increase in the land/labor ratio, creating a situation in which the development of serfdom rose as a subsequent effect of an increasing land/labor ratio due to a decreasing population.  (Domar, 13) The end of the 13th century in Western Europe is met by a sharp decline in serfdom, which Domar attributes to overpopulation, a large surplus of labor, and thus a very low land/labor ratio. 
	Additionally, this economic model plays an incredibly important role in the analysis of the causes of slavery in the Colonial American South. Domar states that the American South demonstrated abundant free land and large scale agriculture, but not abundant free labor. In contrast, the American North demonstrated abundant free land and abundant free labor, but not large scale agriculture. The American South during the colonial period was characterized by vast amounts of fertile land that was largely uninhabited previous to colonization, and sparsely populated during colonization. (Domar, 16) Domar attributes the importation of slaves to the American South as an economic need for labor due to such a high land/labor ratio. Domar qualifies the difference in popularity of slavery in the American South relative to the American North to political and social objections, as well as a potential for increased adaptability of slaves to the warmer climate, or the increased productivity that goes along with longer and more fruitful seasons in the south due to the temperature.  (Domar, 16)

== Critiques ==

The Domar Serfdom Model has been met with criticism since its publishing in ''The Journal of Economic History'' in 1970.  In 2009, Professor Jean Jacques Rosa authored a paper titled, “The Causes of Serfdom: A Hypothesis Revisited” in which Rosa argues that serfdom and slavery are mutually exclusive events. Where Domar argues that labor scarcity is a necessary but exogenous political factor needed for serfdom, Rosa challenges his view by showing that “in an agrarian subsistence economy the complementary conditions of serfdom are (a) oligopsony power in labor demand, sustained by (b) an oligopolistic supply of violence by large land owners.”  In addition, Professor Erik Green of Lund University argues that Domar’s model fails in explaining the origins of slavery in Cape Colony, South Africa, where the consensus is that slavery evolved as an urban phenomenon, which would call into question the land/labor ratio Domar uses to explain the causes of slavery and serfdom. Moreover, Professor Jonathon Cunning of Hunter University authored a paper titled “On the Causes of Slavery or Serfdom and the Roads to Agrarian Capitalism: Domar’s Hypothesis Revisited” In his paper, Cunning offers a “simple general equilibrium formalization of Domar’s famous hypothesis on the causes of slavery or serfdom that emphasizes the interactions between factor endowments, the nature of the production technologies, and the initial distribution of property rights over land.” Cunning’s paper is viewed more so as an expansion upon Domar’s model rather than a direct challenge to his hypothesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">'''Egosurfing''' (also '''Googling yourself''', '''vanity searching''', '''egosearching''', '''egogoogling''', '''autogoogling''', '''self-googling''') is the practice of searching for one's own name, or pseudonym on a popular [[search engine]] in order to review the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Geek to Me |work=Ur magazine |publisher=Rogers |accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an '''egosurfer''' is one who surfs the [[Internet]] for his or her own name to see what information appears. It has become increasingly popular with the rise of internet search engines, as well as free [[blog]]ging and web-hosting services. Though [[Google]] is the search engine most commonly mentioned when referring to egosurfing, other widely known search engines include [[Yahoo]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].

The term was coined by [[Sean Carton]] in 1995 and first appeared in print as an entry in [[Gareth Branwyn]]'s March 1995 Jargon Watch column in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenscholar.com/news/archives/45|title=Citizen Scholar Inc. — the design studio of Randy J. Hunt|work=citizenscholar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;catid=&amp;topic=10&amp;allstories=1 Street Tech :: hardware beyond the hype] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102175642/http://streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;catid=&amp;topic=10&amp;allstories=1 |date=2010-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/egosurfing.html|title=Definition of egosurfing, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary|work=macmillandictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.03/jargon_watch.html|title=3.03: Jargon Watch|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egosurfing is employed by many people for a variety of reasons. According to a study by the Pew Internet &amp; American life project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2007/Do-You-Use-Google-For-Vanity-Searching-Youre-Not-Alone.aspx|title=TechCrunch|author=Sarah Perez|first=|date=|work=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=y|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47% of American adult internet users have undertaken a vanity search in Google or another search engine. Some egosurf purely for  entertainment, such as finding celebrities with the same name. However, many people egosurf as a means of [[online reputation management]]. Egosurfing can be used to find [[data spill]]s, released information that is undesirable to have in the public eye. By searching one's own name in an online search engine, one can take on the perspective of a stranger attempting to find out personal information. Some egosurf in order to conceal personal images or information from potential employers, clients, [[identity thieves]], and the like. Similarly, some use egosurfing to maintain a positive public image and to achieve self-promotion.

Many [[social networking]] sites, such as [[Facebook]], allow users to make their profiles "searchable," meaning that their profile will appear in the appropriate search results. As a result, those seeking to maintain their privacy often egosurf in order to ensure that their profile does not appear in search engine results. As more people create online personas, many feel the need to more cautiously monitor their digital footprint, including information that they have not chosen to share online, such as telephone numbers and public records.&lt;ref name="technewsworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Pew-Study-Self-Googling-on-the-Rise-60810.html|title=Pew Study: Self-Googling on the Rise|work=technewsworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although personal information available online can be difficult to remove, in 2009 Google introduced a feature allowing users to create a small box listing personal information such as name, occupation, and location that appears on the first page of results when their name is searched. The box links to a full profile page, similar to one seen on Facebook. This Google profile can be linked to other social networking sites, such as one's blog, company website or [[Twitter]] feed. The more information that one includes on their Google profile, the higher one's informational box will rank in the results, thus essentially encouraging one to post personal information online and continue egosurfing.&lt;ref name="technewsworld.com"/&gt;

'''Eunomics''' is a term, first proposed by legal scholar [[Lon L. Fuller|Lon Fuller]] in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forms Liberate: Reclaiming the Jurisprudence of Lon L Fuller |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zyfcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Eunomics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2AHwMyeGfJ&amp;sig=-8U08h7ULJnnghn3y-5KxMvk3tc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiirc7i1MPcAhUH8LwKHdxtDw4Q6AEwDnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Eunomics&amp;f=false |website=Google Books |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to describe "the science, theory or study of good order and workable arrangements".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Lon L. (1954). ''American Legal Philosophy at Mid-Century - A Review of Edwin W. Patterson's ''Jurisprudence, Men and Ideas of the Law'', p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from [[Behavioral Systems Theory]], it was an attempt to fuse what Fuller saw as the inherent [[morality]] of [[law]] with the [[empirical]] data and methods of the objective [[sciences]]. Its main practical application appears to be as a form of industrial dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EUNOMICS AND JUSTICE |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1847&amp;context=dlj |website=scholarship and law |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with New Institutional Economics==

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize]] winner [[Oliver E. Williamson]], a leading mind of the [[New institutional economics|New Institutional Economics]] (NIE) movement, refers to Fuller's definition of eunomics as a [[simulacrum]] of his understanding of the term ''[[governance]]''. Same as with the NIE, eunomics are foremost concerned with the question how to achieve a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1996). ''The Mechanisms of Governance''. Oxford University Press. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fan effect'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Retrieval of propositional information from long-term memory|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=October 1974|volume=6|issue=4|pages=451–474|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon under the branch of [[cognitive psychology]] where recognition times or error rate for a particular concept increases as more information about the concept is acquired. The word "fan" refers to the number of associations correlated with the concept.

== The origin of the fan effect ==
The fan effect first appeared in a series of experiments conducted by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], a cognitive psychologist, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radvansky|first=Gabriel A.|title=The Fan Effect: A Tale of Two Theories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 1999|volume=128|issue=2|pages=198–206|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.2.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three experiments he conducted involved participants learning 26 sentences that paired a person with a location. Additionally, they were asked to determine whether or not a particular sentence that was given to them belonged to the 26 they were asked to study.  An example of a sentence Anderson used in his experiment was:  "A hippie is in the park." Some sentences seemed similar in the sense that a person was paired with another location. For instance, "A hippie is in the church." Results revealed that participants produced a longer retrieval time when a person was paired with more than one location. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that multiple associations, such as including a large number of nouns in a sentence, interfered with the recognition time by producing a much slower effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buntinga, M.F., Conwayb, A., and Heitzc, R.P.|title=Individual differences in the fan effect and working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=April 2004|volume=51|pages=604–621|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.07.007|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spreading activation==
In the brain, [[memory]] stores information in a network of nodes that are linked together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radvansky and Zacks|first=Gabriel and Rose|title=Mental Models and the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1991|volume=17|issue=5|pages=940–953|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.17.5.940}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a memory is retrieved, activation spreads on the links until it intersects or enough time has passed. If there is one association, the activation only has to spread to a single link whereas multiple associations would divide the activation to many links. Because there are so many connections, it causes the brain to take a longer time to identify the concepts and retrieve the memory.

==Plausible theories==
The fan effect is due to multiple mental models and is included as part of the [[ACT-R]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson and Reder|first=John and Lynne|title=The fan effect: New results and New Theories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 1999|volume=128|issue=2|pages=189–197|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.2.186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key factors that the fan effect is dependent on are the strength and degree to which one of the variables can predict the other and the importance of the concept to a person during the retrieval process. Concepts can be better recognized by similar ideas instead of a random order of ideas. When stored in a random order, the concepts are placed in independent places in the brain instead of putting the concepts together as one unit. The fan effect can be reduced if random sentences are exposed frequently and unified into one concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moeser|first=Shannon Dawn|title=The Role of Experimental Design in Investigations of the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|date=March 1979|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.5.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flowers in a glass vase on a partly draped stone ledge''''' is a circa 1667 floral painting by [[Nicolaes van Verendael]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q29882478}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q29882478|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Nicolaes van Verendael - Garland surrounding the Virgin Mary.jpg|thumb|Garland painting in the Prado]]
Nicolaes van Verendael was a respected flower painter in Antwerp who worked with [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], among others. The early provenance of this painting is unknown but it can be dated based on other works by Van Verendael, such as his garland painting in the [[Prado]] which was long attributed to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], who began floral painting in Antwerp a half-century beforehand.
==Description and interpretation==
This painting dates to the period in Antwerp when hothouses became popular among the nobility and patrons ordered paintings to record their personal hothouse triumphs. Not all of the blooms would have bloomed at the same time, and the painting was meant more for decoration than for botanical accuracy. The work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa × alba|Rosa alba]], [[Tropaeolum majus]], [[Anemone hepatica|Hepatica nobilis]], [[rosemary]], [[Tulip|Tulipa]], [[Delphinium]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Pomegranate|Punica granatum]], [[Rosa × centifolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/198239 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history and influence==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Soviet troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of a German citizen who later migrated to Canada and it appeared on the art market in the 1970s, whereupon it was returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.codart.nl/museums/after-70-years-in-exile-nicolaes-van-verendael-s-flower-still-life-returns-to-the-suermondt-ludwig-museum-in-aachen/ After 70 years in exile Nicolaes van Verendael’s Flower Still Life returns to the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen], article 4 March 2015 on codart&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gillray Temperance 051126.jpg|thumb|[[James Gillray]]'s satirical print ''Temperance Enjoying a Frugal Meal''. [[George III]] is depicted with patched trousers and a chair covered with protective fabric, eating a simple boiled egg and using the tablecloth as his napkin. Winter flowers fill the unlit fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperance enjoying a frugal meal|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1477394&amp;partId=1|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Frugality''' is the quality of being frugal, sparing, thrifty, prudent or economical in the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of consumable [[resources]] such as [[food]], [[time]] or [[money]], and avoiding waste, lavishness or extravagance.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;{{cite web|title=frugal|url=http://www.leoyan.com/century-dictionary.com/cent2jpgframes.php?volno=03&amp;page=2393|work=Century Dictionary Online|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=A.M. (ed.)|title=Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary|year=1972|publisher=Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford American Dictionaries (computer application)|year=2005|publisher=Apple Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolf|first=Henry (ed.)|title=Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|year= 1980|publisher= Merriam|location=Springfield MA|isbn= 0-87779-398-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral science]], frugality has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner, and resourceful use of already owned economic goods and services, to achieve a longer term [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lastovicka|first=J. L.|author2=Bettencourt, L. A.|author3= Hughner, R. S.|author4= Kuntze, R. J. |title=Lifestyle of the tight and frugal: Theory and measurement|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1999|volume=26|pages=85–98|doi=10.1086/209552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Common [[strategies]] of frugality include the reduction of [[waste]], curbing costly [[habituation|habit]]s, suppressing instant [[gratification]] by means of fiscal self-restraint, seeking [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], avoiding traps, defying expensive [[social norms]], detecting and avoiding [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertising, embracing cost-free options, using [[barter]], and staying well-informed about local circumstances and both market and product/service realities. Frugality may contribute to health by leading people to avoid products that are both expensive and unhealthy when used to excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Toney Smith, S.|author3=Segrist, D. J.|title=Too cheap to chug: Frugality as a buffer against college-student drinking |journal=Journal of Consumer Behaviour|year=2010|volume=9|pages=228–238|doi=10.1002/cb.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frugal living is mainly practiced by those who aim to cut expenses, have more money, and get the most they possibly can from their money.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, C. The Frugal Mind: 1,479 Money Saving Tips for Surviving the 1990s. Nottingham Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a ''[[philosophy]]'' in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) "expert" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Hamilton: "How to Succeed in Business," Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ontario County, N.Y., for 1867-8, Page 91 e.g. H. Child, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;

Different spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Richard Cartwright: "Environmental Theology", Page 169. Creekside Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Puritan]]s are examples of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mecklin, John M.: "An Introduction to Social Ethics, The Social Conscience in a Democracy", Page 254. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.&lt;ref&gt;Watkinson, William L.: "Frugality in the Spiritual Life", Page 7. F. H. Revell company, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[environmentalists]] who consider frugality to be a virtue&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fillmore Swain|Swain, George Fillmore]]; ''Conservation of Water by Storage'', [[Yale University Press]], 1915, p. 26 e.g.&lt;/ref&gt; through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. [[Henry David Thoreau]] expressed a similar philosophy in ''[[Walden]]'', with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while [[simple living|living simply]] in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David: "Walden", Page 184 e.g. T. Y. Crowell &amp; co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate world==
Frugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Phil: "http://freecheap.blogspot.com/" 2010&lt;/ref&gt; through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Woerner, Stephanie L.; "Networked at Cisco", Page 13. Center for eBusiness, Sloan School of Management, MIT, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.

The '''Galor-Zeira model''' is a modern macroeconomic theory about income distribution and its impact on economic growth. It challenges the prevalent neoclassical doctrine that equality inhibits the development of human capital.

==Thesis==
The Galor-Zeira model describes the inequality-education-growth relationship, explained by the mechanism of unequal access to education due to [[capital market imperfections|imperfect capital markets]]. It claims that this mechanism might lead to a negative effect of inequality on growth. [[income distribution|The initial distribution of income]] determines whether an economy will converge to a low- or high-income regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The model was developed by [[Oded Galor]] and [[Joseph Zeira]] in 1988, and it was published in the paper “Income Distribution and Macroeconomics”, 1993.&lt;ref name="Galor"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[neoclassical economics|Neoclassical viewpoint]] has been challenged in the past two decades, as both theories and subsequent empirical evidence have demonstrated that [[income distribution]] has a significant impact on the growth process. In contrast to the representative agent approach which dominated the field of macroeconomics for several decades, the modern perspective, originated by Galor and Zeira (1988, 1993), has underlined the role of [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]] in the determination of macroeconomic activity. It has advanced a novel viewpoint that heterogeneity, and thus income distribution, plays an important role in the determination of aggregate economic activity and economic growth in the short-run as well as in the long-run.

Galor and Zeira have demonstrated that in the presence of credit market imperfections, income distribution has a long-lasting effect on investment in [[human capital]], [[aggregate income]], and [[economic development]]. Moreover, in contrast to the [[classical economics|classical hypothesis]], which underscored the virtues of inequality for economic growth, their research advanced the hypothesis that inequality may be detrimental for human capital formation and economic development.

==Dynamics of the model==
The model consists of four assumptions:&lt;ref name="Galor" /&gt;
* A good can be produced by either a skilled or unskilled process and skilled workers are more productive. All individuals are born with the same potential abilities with the same preferences. They differ only in the amount they inherit from their parents. 
* Individuals live for two periods and each has one offspring. 
* In the first period, individuals either invest in human capital and acquire education or work as an unskilled worker. In the second period, they work as skilled or unskilled, according to their decision made in the first period. The decision to invest in education depends on the inheritance from the parent.
* There are imperfect capital markets: due to the need to monitor borrowers, which increases costs, the borrowing interest rate is higher than the lending rate.

There are three possible individual scenarios in the model:
* The individual inherits a higher amount than the cost of education and will invest in human capital. The individual becomes a lender.
* The individual inherits a lower amount than the cost of education, but finds it profitable to borrow money to invest in human capital. The individual becomes a borrower.
* The individual inherits a much lower amount than the cost of education and finds it unprofitable to invest in human capital, due to higher costs of borrowing. As a result, education is limited to individuals with sufficiently high initial wealth. If credit markets were perfect, every individual would be able to borrow money to invest in human capital.

==Long-run implications==
The economic situation of each dynasty depends on its initial wealth, due to credit markets’ imperfections and an indivisibility in investment in human capital. In rich dynasties, all generations invest in human capital, work as skilled and leave a large inheritance to their children. In poor dynasties people inherit less, work as unskilled, and leave less to the next generation. They can get stuck in a [[poverty trap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Ferreira 
 | first = Francisco H.G.
 | authorlink = Francisco H.G. Ferreira
 | title = Inequality and Economic Performance
 | journal = World Bank
 | date = June 1999
 
 | url = http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the initial distribution of wealth determines the size of these two groups: the rich and the poor dynasties. As a result, it also determines GDP, as skilled are more productive. Therefore, inequality may negatively affect macroeconomic activity and economic development due to “intergenerational transfers and their effect  on the persistence of inequality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = Edward Elgar Pub
 | series = International Library of Critical Writings in Economics

 | isbn = 184720676X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy implications==
A government policy can change the long-run equilibrium. The government can [[subsidy|subsidize]] education, which reduces the individual cost of education and finance it by taxing those who study and become skilled. This increases human capital investment in the short- and long-run, increases GDP and is a [[pareto efficiency|Pareto]] improving policy. The model gives an explanation to the rise of public education.

==Realistic application==
According to the Galor-Zeira model, the wealth-equality relationship works three ways:
* Richer economics tend to have smaller wage differentials and more equal distribution of income.
That means, wealth and equality are highly correlated and affect one another. On the one hand, countries with a greater income per capita have more equal distribution of income and smaller wage differentials. On the other hand, countries with more equal initial distribution of wealth and have higher income level in the long run.
* The effect stressed by the model is mitigated by public education, which makes wealth less necessary for access to education. Hence, the effect of inequality on growth is expected to be higher in poor countries than in rich countries.
* Economics with unequal income distribution suffer a permanent income and utility loss as a result of shock and their distribution of income becomes even more unequal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Gender schema theory''' was formally introduced by [[Sandra Bem]] in 1981 as a cognitive theory to explain how individuals become gendered in society, and how sex-linked characteristics are maintained and transmitted to other members of a culture.&lt;ref name="bemsl"&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981). Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review, 88'', 354–364&lt;/ref&gt;
Gender-associated information is predominantly transmuted through society by way of [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]], or networks of information that allow for some information to be more easily assimilated than others. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] argues that there are individual differences in the degree to which people hold these gender schemata. These differences are manifested via the degree to which individuals are sex-typed.

==Sex-typing==
Core gender identity is tied up in the sex typing that an individual undergoes. This typing can be heavily influenced by child rearing, media, school, and other forms of cultural transmission. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] refers to four categories in which an individual may fall: sex-typed, cross-sex-typed, androgynous, and undifferentiated. Sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with their gender. Cross-sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with the opposite gender. Androgynous individuals process and integrate traits and information from both genders. Finally, undifferentiated individuals do not show efficient processing of sex-typed information.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Gender stereotypes==
{{see also|Sexism#Gender stereotypes|Gender role#Gender stereotypes|Implicit stereotype#Gender stereotype}}
Being that gender schema theory is a theory of process and not content, this theory can help explain some of the processes by which gender stereotypes become so psychologically ingrained in our society. Specifically, having strong gender schemata provides a filter through which we process incoming stimuli in the environment. This leads to an easier ability to assimilate information that is stereotype congruent, hence further solidifying the existence of gender stereotypes.  Within adolescent development, Bem hypothesizes that children must choose among a plethora of dimensions, but that gender schemas lead to the regulation of behaviors that conform to the cultural definition of what it means to be male or female.  Additionally, Bem asserts that there is also a [[heterosexuality]] subschema, which likely encouraged the development of gender schemas.  Most societies treat exclusive heterosexuality as the benchmark for proper masculinity and femininity—that is, heterosexuality is the norm.  Furthermore, the heterosexuality subschema asserts that men and women are supposed to be different from one another. It is hypothesized that this is why cross-sexed interactions are likely to be sexually coded.  Sex-typed individuals have a general readiness to invoke the heterosexuality subschema in social interactions, behaving differently towards individuals of the opposite sex that they find attractive v. unattractive.

==Evidence==
Some of the early tests of gender schema theory came in the form of memory and other cognitive tasks designed to assess facilitated processing of sex-typed information. Much of this early research found that participants who were sex-typed remembered more traits associated with their sex, as well as processed sex-type congruent information more efficiently, suggesting that the gender schemata possessed by sex-typed individuals help to assimilate sex-associated information into one’s self-concept (see Bem, 1981).&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;
[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] showed that when given the option of clustering words by either semantic meaning or gender, sex-typed individuals are more likely to use the gender clustering system, followed by undifferentiated individuals.  Cross-typed individuals had the lowest percentage of words clustered by gender.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Positive social change==
A strong source of sex-typing comes from the rearing practices of parents. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] offers strong suggestions for preventing the sex-typing of children, including the prevention of access to media that promotes sex-typing, altering media and stories to eliminate sex-typing information, and modeling equal roles for mothers and fathers in the household.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1983). Gender schema theory and its implications for child development: Raising gender-aschematic children in a gender-schematic society. ''Signs, 8,'' 598–616.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Bem edited the books that her children read to create a more androgynous view.  This included, for example, drawing long hair and feminine body characteristics on male figures.  Ultimately, however, this is somewhat limited because children will become exposed to some of this sex-typing information, particularly when they begin attending school. Therefore, [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] suggests teaching alternative schemata to children so that they are less likely to build and maintain a gender schema. Some examples include an individual differences schema, where children learn to process information on a person-by-person basis rather than make wide assumptions about groups based on information from individuals. Also, providing children with a sexism schema, where children learn to process sex-typed information through a filter that promotes moral outrage when sexist information is being promoted, can assist in providing children with the resources to not only keep from becoming sex-typed but also promote positive social change.

Bem wished to raise consciousness that the male/female dichotomy is used as an organizing framework, often unnecessarily, especially in the school curriculum. She stressed that the omnirelevance of gender has a negative impact on society, and that the gender schema should be more limited in scope.  Within the feminist lens, androgyny is not radical enough, because androgyny means that “masculine” and “feminine” still exist.  Rather, society should decrease the use of the gender dichotomy as a functional unit, and be aschematic.

==Legacy==
The legacy of gender schema theory has not been one of obvious lasting impact in the psychology of gender. [[Sandra Bem|Bem's]] theory was undoubtedly informed by the cognitive revolution of the 1970s and 1980s and was coming at a time when the psychology of gender was drastically picking up interest as more and more women were entering academic fields. While gender schema theory does provide a cognitive backbone for how gender stereotypes may continue to be maintained in current society, it lost wind as more broad sociological theories became the dominant force in the psychology of gender. A major limitation of gender schema theory has been that once research supported the nature of the process, there was little work that followed.

The longest-lasting contribution to the field has been the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]]. Originally developed as a tool to identify sex-typed individuals, many researchers use the measure to look at other components of gender, including endorsement of gender stereotypes and as a measure of masculinity/femininity. Caution should be employed when examining research that uses the Bem Sex-Role Inventory for measuring constructs that it was not created to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, R. M., &amp; Borders, L. D. A. (2001). Twenty-five years after the Bem Sex-Role Inventory: A reassessment and new issues regarding classification variability. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, 34,'' 39–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] herself admitted that she was ill-prepared to develop the Bem Sex-Role Inventory and never anticipated it being as widely used as it still is today.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (2001). ''An unconventional family.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gift card''' (also known as '''gift certificate''' in North America, or '''gift voucher''' or '''gift token''' in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/gift-token|title=GIFT TOKEN {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a prepaid [[stored-value card|stored-value money card]] usually issued by a [[retailer]] or [[bank]] to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are also given out by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called '''cash cards'''. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. Visa and MasterCard credit cards produce generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for '''cashback''' marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.

From the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a [[gift]], given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the [[United States]], gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers and the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.&lt;ref name=consumer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |title=Congress Considers New Gift Card Rules |author=James R.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}
The first giftcard using a payments infrastructure was introduced by [[Neiman Marcus]] in late 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=The Vile History of Gift Cards and How They Came to Destroy Christmas|url=https://gizmodo.com/5434783/the-vile-history-of-gift-cards-and-how-they-came-to-destroy-christmas|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]] was the first company to do so at a wide scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CES/NaBANCO introduces stored value card technology; Blockbuster Video is first merchant partner|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of [[Sunrise, Florida]]. Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of giftcards using existing payment infrastructure.

Neiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the [[Mobil]] gas card which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]. [[Kmart]] was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with [[AT&amp;T]]. Later this feature was dropped as it was not profitable for both Kmart and Mobil. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is common place today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.

==Function and types==
[[File:Gift card assortment.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An assortment of gift cards, many from U.S. national retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Home Depot]].]]
A gift card may resemble a [[credit card]] or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.

Cards may have a [[barcode]] or [[magnetic strip]], which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the store's database, which is crosslinked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not [[stored-value card]]s as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system (with no network) stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is [[encrypted]]. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific number.

Gift cards can also be custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.

Gift cards are divided into "open loop" or "network" cards and "closed loop" cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerreports.org/holiday-shopping/tips-for-giving-gift-cards/|title=Avoid gift card pitfalls|date=December 2007}} accessed 06-16-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In either case the giver would buy the gift card (and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee), and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the "hybrid closed loop" card where the issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific [[shopping mall|mall]].

Gift cards differ from [[scrip|gift certificate]]s, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a [[voucher]] for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.

Bank-issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.

A [[Charity gift card|Charity Gift Card]] allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation, and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.

===Mobile and virtual gift cards===
[[File:App Store Gift Card by Zihexin.jpg|thumb|An [[app store]] gift card display in a shop]]

Mobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via [[email]] or [[SMS]] and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.

Virtual gift cards are delivered via e-mail to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the bricks and mortar location to purchase a gift card.

Other companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.

==Pitfalls==
It has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.t.html?ex=1325826000&amp;en=970d53de24147ae4&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | author=Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt | title=The Gift-Card Economy | date=January 7, 2007 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/bad_gift.html | title=Bad Gift Better Than Gift Card, Says Philosopher | date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this "impersonal" pitfall of gift cards. New services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_45/b4057049.htm | work=BusinessWeek | title=Gift Cards with a Personal Touch | date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift cards have been criticized for the ability of the issuer to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Further, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a "no fee, no expiration" policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post-sale fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scripsmart.com/gift_card_report_2011 |title=ScripSmart 2011 Gift Card Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey. And a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 |title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered [[unsecured debt]], and as such gift cards may become valueless.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Tamara Keith | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=2008-11-17 | publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.

Another issue regarding gift cards are the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cybercriminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3196035/fraud/what-not-to-get-mom-for-mother-s-day.html | work=CSO Online | title=What Not To Get Mom For Mother's Day | date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer’s systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/03/17/prevent-fraud-brute-force-online-coupon-gift-card-attacks/| work=Digital Commerce 360 from Internet Retailer | title=How to prevent fraud from brute force online coupon and gift card attacks | date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Redemption rate==
{{main article | breakage }}
Not all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost; there may be time decay (expiration and fees) or complex rules of redemption; the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

In 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.

==Regulations==

=== Canada ===
All Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2012/02/27/gift-cards-come-with-regulations/ Gift cards come with regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards (i.e. with Visa, MasterCard or American Express branding) and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal ''Prepaid Payment Products Regulations'', effective May 1, 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions, and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/Eng/about/news/Pages/News-nouvelles.aspx?itemid=249 Prepaid Payment Products Regulations published in the Canada Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627 Read The Bill: H.R. 627 [111th]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least 5 years after the card’s date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on August 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkow.com/Global/story.asp?S=12188430 Fed issues new gift card regulations – WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports]. Wkow.com (2010-03-23). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open loop cards are governed by rules of the [[Comptroller of the Currency]], however oversight has been criticized.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumerreports/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

'''Gun-related violence''' is violence committed with the use of a gun ([[firearm]] or [[small arm]]). Gun-related violence may or may not be considered criminal. Criminal violence includes [[homicide]] (except when and where ruled [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justifiable]]), [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and [[suicide]], or [[attempted suicide]], depending on [[jurisdiction]]. Non-criminal violence includes accidental or unintentional injury and death (except perhaps in cases of criminal negligence). Also generally included in gun violence statistics are military or para-military activities.[[File:Gun Deaths by Year, Australia, America.pdf|thumb|400px|alt=Graph showing the rate of gun deaths per capita in the United States and Australia.|Time series showing rates of gun-related deaths per capita (all sources) in the US and Australia]]

==Prevention==

{{POV section|date=May 2018}}
A number of ideas have been proposed on how to lessen the incidence of gun-related violence.

Some propose keeping a gun at home to keep one safer.

===Intentional homicide===

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines intentional homicide as "acts in which the perpetrator intended to cause death or serious injury by his or her actions." This excludes deaths: related to conflicts (war); caused by recklessness or negligence; or justifiable, such as in self-defense or by law enforcement in the line of duty.&lt;ref name=UNGSH2011 /&gt; A 2009 report by the Geneva Declaration using UNODC data showed that worldwide firearms were used in an average of 60 percent of all homicides.&lt;ref name="GBAV2008-CH4"&gt;{{cite book |date=September 2008  |chapter=Lethal Encounters: Non-conflict Armed Violence |chapterurl=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV/GBAV08-CH4.pdf |title=Global Burden of Armed Violence 2008 |url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/nc/en/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2008.html |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |location=Geneva, Switzerland |publisher=Geneva Declaration Secretariat |pages=67–88 |isbn=978-2-8288-0101-4 |accessdate= }} by Geneva Declaration editors using UNODC data.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} In the U.S. in 2011, 67 percent of homicide victims were killed by a firearm: 66 percent of single-victim homicides and 79 percent of multiple-victim homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4863 |title=Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement, 2011 |last1=Cooper |first1=Alexia |last2=Smith |first2=Erica L. |date=December 30, 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the United States' homicide rate was reported to be 5.0 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Study on Homicide |date=2011 |website=Unodc.org |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 Harvard study claims that in 2010 the homicide rate was about 7 times higher than that of other high-income countries, and that the US gun homicide rate was 25.2 times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinshteyn|first1=E|last2=Hemenway|first2=D|title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=March 2016|volume=129|issue=3|pages=266–73|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025|pmid=26551975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Harvard study found that higher gun availability was strongly correlated with higher homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|last2=Miller|first2=M|title=Firearm availability and homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.|journal=[[The Journal of Trauma]]|date=December 2000|volume=49|issue=6|pages=985–8|pmid=11130511|doi=10.1097/00005373-200012000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to guns is associated with an increased risk of being the victim of homicide.&lt;ref name=annals/&gt; Access to firearms is not the sole contributor to increased homicide rates, however, as one study by the Southern Criminal Justice Association in 2011 found.

===Domestic violence===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
Some gun control advocates say that the strongest evidence linking availability of guns to death and injury is found in [[domestic violence]] studies, often referring to those by public health policy analyst [[Arthur Kellermann]]. In response to suggestions by some that homeowners would be wise to acquire firearms for protection from home invasions, Kellermann investigated in-home homicides in three cities over five years. He found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present. The data showed that the risk of a [[crime of passion]] or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was higher when a gun was readily available (essentially loaded and unlocked) compared to when no gun was readily available. Kellerman said this increase in mortality overshadowed any protection a gun might have deterring or defending against burglaries or invasions. He also concluded that further research of domestic violence causes and prevention are needed.&lt;ref name=NEJM329&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellerman |first=Arthur L. |last2=Rivara |first2=Frederick P. |date=October 7, 1993 |title=Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=329 |issue=15 |pages=1084–1091 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |pmid=8371731 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Kellermann's study say that it is more directly a study of domestic violence than of gun ownership. Gary Kleck and others dispute the work.&lt;ref name=Suter1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suter |first=Edgar A. |date=March 1994  |title=Guns in the medical literature—a failure of peer review |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=162372 |journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia |publisher= |volume=83 |issue=13 |pages=133–148 |pmid=8201280 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kates |first=Don B. |last2=Schaffer |first2=Henry E. |last3=Lattimer |first3=John K. |last4=Murray |first4=George B. |last5=Cassem |first5=Edwin H. |year=1995 |editor-last=Kopel |editor-first=David B. |title=Guns: Who Should Have Them? |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guns-who-should-have-them/oclc/32393136 |location=New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |pages=233–308 |isbn=9780879759582 |accessdate= }} in chapter "Bad Medicine: Doctors and Guns." Orig. pub. 1994 in ''Tennessee Law Review'' as "Guns and Public Health: Epidemic of Violence or Pandemic of Propaganda?"&lt;/ref&gt; Kleck says that few of the homicides that Kellermann studied were committed with guns belonging to the victim or members of his or her household, and that it was implausible that victim household gun ownership contributed to their homicide. Instead, according to Kleck, the association that Kellermann found between gun ownership and victimization reflected that people who live in more dangerous circumstances are more likely to be murdered, but also were more likely to have acquired guns for self-protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleck |first=Gary |date=February 2001  |title=Can Owning a Gun Really Triple the Owner's Chances of being Murdered? |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=187212 |journal=Homicide Studies |publisher=SAGE |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=64–77 |doi=10.1177/1088767901005001005 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robbery and assault===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] defines robbery as the theft of property by force or threat of force.  Assault is defined as a physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury.  In the case of gun-related violence, the definitions become more specific and include only robbery and assault committed with the use of a firearm.&lt;ref name=UNODCCrimeData&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html |title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Data |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 29, 2013 |website=unodc.org |publisher=UNODC |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms are used in this threatening capacity four to six times more than firearms used as a means of protection in fighting crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Hemenway|author2=Deborah Azrael|title=The Relative Frequency of Offensive and Defensive Gun Uses: Results from a National Survey|journal=Violence and Victims|year=2000|volume=15|issue=3|pages=257–272|pmid=11200101|author3=D Hemenway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemenway |first=David |last2=Azrael |first2=Deborah |last3=Miller |first3=Matthew |date=2000 |title=Gun use in the United States: results from two national surveys |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263.full |journal=Injury Prevention |publisher= |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=263–267 |doi=10.1136/ip.6.4.263 |pmid=11144624 |accessdate= |pmc=1730664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemenway's figures are disputed by other academics, who assert there are many more defensive uses of firearms than criminal uses. See John Lott's "More Guns, Less Crime".

===Accidental firearm deaths===
From 1979 to 1997, almost 30,000 people in the United States alone died from accidental firearm injuries. A disproportionately high number of these deaths occurred in parts of the United States where firearms are more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M|last2=Azrael|first2=D|last3=Hemenway|first3=D|title=Firearm availability and unintentional firearm deaths.|journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention|date=July 2001|volume=33|issue=4|pages=477–84|pmid=11426678|doi=10.1016/s0001-4575(00)00061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs of gun-related violence ==
Violence committed with guns leads to significant [[public health]], [[psychological]], and [[economic]] costs.

=== Economic costs ===
The economic cost of gun-related violence in the United States is $229 billion a year,&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;(A. Peters. (2015) ''The Staggering Costs Of Gun Violence In The U.S. Every Year'' retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fastcoexist.com/3047682/the-staggering-costs-of-gun-violence-in-the-us-every-year&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;{{qualify evidence}} &lt;!-- How was this number constructed?

=== Public health ===
Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths worldwide in 2013, up from 128,000 deaths worldwide in 1990.&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt;  There were 47,000 [[gun safety|unintentional firearm deaths]] worldwide in 2013.&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt;

[[Emergency medicine|Emergency medical care]] is a major contributor to the monetary costs of such violence. It was determined in a study that for every firearm death in the United States for the year beginning 1 June 1992, an average of three firearm-related injuries were treated in hospital [[emergency department]]s.&lt;ref name="JAMA1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Annest |first=Joseph L. |last2=Mercy |first2=James A. |last3=Gibson |first3=Delinda R. |last4=Ryan |first4=George W. |date=June 14, 1995 |title=National Estimates of Nonfatal Firearm-Related Injuries: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg |journal=JAMA |publisher=American Medical Association |volume=273 |issue=22 |pages=1749–54 |doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520460031030 |pmid=7769767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological ===
Children exposed to gun-related violence, whether they are victims, perpetrators, or witnesses, can experience negative psychological effects over the short and long terms. Psychological trauma also is common among children who are exposed to high levels of violence in their communities or through the media.&lt;ref&gt;(Kathleen R. Patti L. Richard E.B.

Legislation at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], state, and local levels has attempted to address gun violence through a variety of methods, including restricting firearms purchases by youths and other "at-risk" populations, setting waiting periods for firearm purchases, establishing [[gun buyback program]]s, law enforcement and policing strategies, stiff sentencing of gun law violators, education programs for parents and children, and community-outreach programs. Despite widespread concern about the impacts of gun violence on public health, Congress has prohibited the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) from conducting research that advocates in favor of gun control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zwillich|first1=Todd|title=Quietly, Congress extends a ban on CDC research on gun violence|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-02/quietly-congress-extends-ban-cdc-research-gun-violence|accessdate=12 September 2015|agency=Public Radio International (PRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC has interpreted this ban to extend to all research on gun violence prevention, and so has not funded any research on this subject since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Rita|title=Tale of 2 Agencies: CDC Avoids Gun Violence Research But NIH Funds It|journal=JAMA|date=26 April 2016|volume=315|issue=16|pages=1689–91|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.1707|pmid=27050067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gun-related violence in Australia ==

=== Port Arthur ===
[[File:Stop Gun Violence Sad Face Sign (4573522770).jpg|thumb]]
The Port Arthur massacre of 1996 horrified the Australian public. The gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists, killing 35 people and wounding 23. This massacre, kick started Australia’s laws against guns. The Prime Minister at that time, John Howard, proposed a gun law that prevented the public from having all semi-automatic rifles, all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, in addition to a tightly restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls.

The government also bought back guns from people. In 1996–2003 it was estimated they bought back and destroyed nearly 1 million firearms. By the end of 1996, whilst Australia was still reeling from the Port Arthur massacre, the gun law was fully in place. Since then, the number of deaths related to gun-related violence dwindled almost every year. In 1979 six hundred and eighty-five people&lt;ref&gt;Kreisfeld, Renate. 2006. ‘Australia Revised Firearm Deaths 1979–2003.’ ''National Injury Surveillance Unit / NISU''. Adelaide: Research Centre for Injury Studies, Flinders University of South Australia. 1 March&lt;/ref&gt; died due to gun violence, and in 1996 it was five hundred and sixteen. The numbers continue to drop, however they were declining also before the gun law was in place.&lt;ref&gt;GunPolicy.org. 2016. ‘Calculated Numbers of Gun Deaths - Australia.’ ''Causes of Death, Australia, 2014''; 3303.0, Table 1.2 (Chapter XX). Canberra: Australian Bureau of Statistics. 14 March.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney Siege ===
On the Australia's most mediated gun violence-related incident since Port Arthur, was the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis|2014 Sydney Hostage Crisis]]. On 15–16 December 2014, a lone gunman, [[Man Haron Monis]], held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café. The perpetrator was on bail at the time, and had previously been convicted of a range of offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-15/sydney-siege-what-we-know/5967610|title=Sydney siege: What we do and don't know|date=2014-12-15|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11295658/Victims-of-Sydney-siege-hailed-as-heroes-after-they-die-protecting-hostages.html|title=Victims of Sydney siege hailed as heroes after they die protecting hostages|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year in August, the New South Wales Government tightened the laws of bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/firearms_and_prohibited_weapons_offences.html|title=Firearms and prohibited weapons offences|website=www.judcom.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4407">'''Hypocognition''', in [[cognitive linguistics]], means missing and being unable to communicate cognitive and linguistic representations because there are no words for particular concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hollan |first=Douglas |title=Constructivist Models of Mind, Contemporary Psychoanalysis, and the Development of Culture Theory |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=538–550, See p. 541 |year=2000 |doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.3.538 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.2000.102.3.538/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The word hypocognition (and its opposite, [[hypercognition]]) was coined by American [[psychiatrist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Robert I. Levy|Robert Levy]] in his 1973 book ''Tahitians: Mind and Experience in the Society Islands''. After 26 months of studying them, Levy described [[Tahitians]] as having no words to describe sorrow or guilt, resulting in people who had suffered personal losses describing themselves as feeling sick or strange instead of sad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Robert I.|title=Tahitians: mind and experience in the Society Islands|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226476073|page=324|edition=Pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Richard A. |editor-last=Shweder |title=Culture theory: essays on mind, self, and emotion |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521318319 |pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy believed the Tahitians' lack of frames for thinking about and expressing grief contributed to their high suicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet Joseph|title=The anthropology of language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495508845|page=41|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that a balance between hypercognition and hypocognition was culturally most desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrara|first=Nadia|title=Emotional expression among Cree Indians: the role of pictorial representations in the assessment of psychological mindedness|year=1998|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|isbn=1853026565|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Hypocognition is a phrase commonly used in linguistics. In 2004 [[George Lakoff]] used it to describe political [[progressives]] in the United States, saying that relative to conservatives they suffer from "massive hypocognition," which he described as the lack of having a progressive philosophy framed around the progressive core values of empathy and responsibility such as "effective government" versus "less government" or "broader prosperity" versus "free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Don't think of an elephant!: know your values and frame the debate: the essential guide for progressives|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green |location=White River Junction VT|isbn=1931498717|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Hypocognition has been blamed for preventing the practical application of [[evidence-based medicine]] in areas where [[Framing (social sciences)|frames]] (contextual and presentational influences on perceptions of reality) obscure facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc.''' ('''AJLI''') is a [[non-profit organization]] of 291 '''Junior Leagues''' in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Junior Leagues are educational and charitable women's organizations aimed at improving their communities through volunteerism and building their members' civic leadership skills through training. According to its mission, "The Association of Junior Leagues International Inc. (AJLI) is an organization of women committed to promoting voluntarism, developing the potential of women and improving communities through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Its purpose is exclusively educational and charitable."

==History==
[[File:Jr League 130 E80 jeh.JPG|thumb|Junior League of New York]]
The first Junior League, the Junior League for the Promotion of the [[settlement movement|Settlement Movement]] (now the Junior League of the City of New York, Inc. also called the New York Junior League) was founded in 1901 in [[New York, New York|New York City]] by [[Mary Harriman Rumsey]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicanexaminer.com/Rumsey.html Anglican Examiner]&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of railroad executive [[Edward H. Harriman]]. Inspired by a lecture on settlement movements that chronicled the works of social reformers such as [[Lillian Wald]] and [[Jane Addams]], Mary organized others to become involved in settlement work.  The organization's first project was working at the College Settlement on [[Rivington Street]] in New York City’s Lower East Side.  The League was soon emulated, and by 1921, 30 Leagues joined to form the national association.

In 1921, after serving as New York City's Junior League president from 1907 to 1910 [[Dorothy Payne Whitney]] became the first president of the Association of Junior Leagues International Inc., operating as the umbrella organization for all Junior Leagues worldwide. There are currently 291 Leagues in Canada, the United States, Mexico and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajli.org/?nd=home|title=The Association of Junior Leagues International Civic Leadership Development for Women|last=2016|first=2009,|website=www.ajli.org|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first League outside the United States was in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

In 1996, a man called Clark Clementsen tried to join but was denied membership.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Prodis, [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-28/news/mn-29569_1_junior-league "Man Battles Junior League Over Policy of Admitting Only Women"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 28, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kerr metric''' or '''Kerr geometry''' describes the geometry of empty [[spacetime]] around a rotating uncharged [[axially-symmetric]] [[black hole]] with a quasispherical [[event horizon]]. The Kerr [[metric tensor|metric]] is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; these equations are highly non-linear, which makes exact solutions very difficult to find.

==Overview==
The Kerr metric is a generalization of the [[Schwarzschild metric]], discovered by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1915, which described the geometry of [[spacetime]] around an uncharged, spherically-symmetric, and non-rotating body. The corresponding solution for a ''charged'', spherical, non-rotating body, the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], was discovered soon afterwards (1916–1918). However, the exact solution for an uncharged, ''rotating'' black-hole, the Kerr metric, remained unsolved until 1963, when it was discovered by [[Roy Kerr]].&lt;ref name=kerr_1963&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first=Roy P. | authorlink=Roy Kerr | date=1963 | title=Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=11 | issue=5 | pages=237–238 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v11/i5/p237_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Fulvio (2009). "Cracking the Einstein Code", Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0226519517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural extension to a charged, rotating black-hole, the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], was discovered shortly thereafter in 1965. These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.0em auto;"
| 
| Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)
| Rotating (''J'' ≠ 0)
|- 
| Uncharged (''Q'' = 0)
| [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]
| Kerr
|-
| Charged (''Q'' ≠ 0)
| [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner–Nordström]]
| [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr–Newman]]
|}

where ''Q'' represents the body's [[electric charge]] and ''J'' represents its spin [[angular momentum]].

According to the Kerr metric, such rotating black-holes should exhibit [[frame-dragging]] (also known as [[Lense–Thirring precession]]), a distinctive prediction of general relativity. Measurement of this frame dragging effect was a major goal of the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Roughly speaking, this effect predicts that objects coming close to a rotating mass will be entrained to participate in its rotation, not because of any applied force or torque that can be felt, but rather because of the swirling curvature of spacetime itself associated with rotating bodies. At close enough distances, all objects –&amp;nbsp;even light&amp;nbsp;– ''must'' rotate with the black-hole; the region where this holds is called the [[ergosphere]].

Rotating black holes have surfaces where the metric appears to have a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]]. The outer surface encloses the ergosphere and has a shape similar to a flattened sphere. The inner surface marks the "radius of no return" also called the "event horizon"; objects passing through this radius can never again communicate with the world outside that radius. However, neither surface is a true singularity, since their apparent singularity can be eliminated in a different [[coordinate system]]. Objects between these two horizons must co-rotate with the rotating body, as noted above; this feature can be used to extract energy from a rotating black hole, up to its [[invariant mass]] energy, ''Mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The LIGO experiment which detected gravitational waves also provided the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first direct observation]] of a pair of Kerr black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbot|first1=B.P.|title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=11 February 2016|volume=116|issue=6|pages=061102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102|arxiv = 1602.03837 |bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116f1102A|pmid=26918975}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A key feature to note in the above metric is the cross product &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}  dt \, d\phi \end{align}&lt;/math&gt; term. There is coupling between time and motion in the plane of rotation that disappears when the black hole's angular momentum goes to zero.

In the non-relativistic limit where ''M'' (or, equivalently, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]]
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - \frac{\Sigma }{r^{2} + a^{2}} dr^{2} - \Sigma  d\theta^{2}- \left( r^{2} + a^{2} \right) \sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

The total mass equivalent ''M'' (the gravitating mass) of the body (including its [[rotational energy]]) and its irreducible mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tongeren"&gt;Stijn van Tongeren: [https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~proko101/StijnJvanTongeren_bh_talk2.pdf#page=42 Rotating Black Holes], page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr} = \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{M^4-a^2 M^2}+M^2}{2}} \ \to \ M = 2 \sqrt{\frac{M_{\rm irr}^4}{4 M_{\rm irr}^2-a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the complete rotational energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;=''c''²(''M''-''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;) of a black hole is extracted, for example with the [[Penrose process]],&lt;ref name="mtw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat, Dhurandhar &amp; Dadhich: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02715080 Energetics of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole by the Penrose Process], page 94&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining mass cannot shrink below the irreducible mass. Therefore, if a black hole rotates with the spin ''a=M'', its total mass-equivalent ''M'' is higher by a factor of {{radic|2}} in comparison with a corresponding Schwarzschild black hole where ''M'' is equal to ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;. The reason for this is that in order to get a static body to spin, energy needs to be applied to the system. Because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]] this energy also has a mass-equivalent, which adds to the total mass-energy of the system, ''M''.

=== in Kerr–Schild coordinates ===
The Kerr metric can be expressed in "Kerr–Schild" form, using a particular set of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as follows.&lt;ref name="Debney"&gt;Debney, G. et al.  [http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 "Solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell Equations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223203626/http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 |date=2013-02-23 }} ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'', Volume 10, page 1842 (1969).

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{Gr^2}{r^4 + a^2z^2}\left[2Mr \right]&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{rx+ay}{r^2 + a^2} , \frac{ry-ax}{r^2 + a^2}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the spinning object, ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]], and ''a'' is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object.  It is understood that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is directed along the positive z-axis.  The quantity ''r'' is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined like this:

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{x^2+y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

Notice that the quantity ''r'' becomes the usual radius ''R''

:&lt;math&gt;r \to R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

when the rotational parameter ''a'' approaches zero.  In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (''c'' = 1).  At large distances from the source (R &gt;&gt; a), these equations reduce to the [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates|Eddington–Finkelstein form]] of the [[Schwarzschild metric]].

In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.&lt;ref name="Exact"&gt;Stephani, Hans et al.  ''Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations'' (Cambridge University Press 2003).  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=SiWXP8FjTFEC&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Schild%22+and+%22determinant+of+the+metric%22&amp;num=100 page 485] regarding determinant of metric tensor.

==Wave operator==

Since even a direct check on the Kerr metric involves cumbersome calculations, the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components &lt;math&gt;g^{ik}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[metric tensor]] in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are shown below in the expression for the square of the [[four-gradient]] [[Differential operator|operator]]:&lt;ref name="mtw" /&gt;   
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g^{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^{\mu}}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^{\nu}}} =
&amp; \frac{1}{c^{2}\Delta}\left(r^{2} + a^{2} + \frac{r_{s}ra^{2}}{\Sigma }\sin^{2}\theta\right)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\right)^{2} + \frac{2r_{s}ra}{c\Sigma \Delta}\frac{\partial}{\partial{\phi}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} \\
&amp; - \frac{1}{\Delta\sin^{2}\theta}\left(1 - \frac{r_{s}r}{\Sigma }\right)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{\phi}}\right)^{2} - \frac{\Delta}{\Sigma }\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}}\right)^{2} - \frac{1}{\Sigma }\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta}}\right)^{2} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

==Frame dragging==

We may rewrite the Kerr metric ({{EquationRef|1}}) in the following form:
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = \left( g_{tt} - \frac{g_{t\phi}^{2}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2} 
+ g_{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\theta\theta} d\theta^{2} + g_{\phi\phi} \left( d\phi + \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} dt \right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius ''r'' and the [[colatitude]] θ, where Ω is called the [[Killing horizon]].
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_{s} r a c}{\Sigma  \left( r^{2} + a^{2} \right) + r_{s} r a^{2} \sin^{2}\theta}. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is called [[frame-dragging]], and has been tested experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Will | first = Clifford M. | authorlink = Clifford Martin Will |date=May 2011 | title =Finally, results from Gravity Probe B | journal = Physics | volume = 4 | page = 43 | doi = 10.1103/Physics.4.43 | arxiv = 1106.1198 |bibcode = 2011PhyOJ...4...43W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of electromagnetic induction. An "ice skater", in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the [[Equivalence principle|Principle of Equivalence]] gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can be also be interpreted through [[Mach's principle]].

==Important surfaces==
[[File:Kerr-surfaces.png|thumb|Location of the horizons, ergospheres and the ring singularity of the Kerr spacetime in Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates.&lt;ref name="visser35"&gt;Visser, Matt [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0622v3.pdf#page=35 The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction] arxiv.org, p. 15, Eq 60-61, p.24, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The spin parameter ''a'' is animated from 0 to ''M'', while the left side of the black hole is rotating towards the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas de Vries: [http://haegar.fh-swf.de/publikationen/pascal.pdf#page=8 Shadows of rotating black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The Kerr metric has two physical relevant surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to an [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs where the purely radial component ''g&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric goes to infinity. Solving the quadratic equation 1/''g''&lt;sub&gt;''rr''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 yields the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm H}^{\pm} = \frac{r_{s} \pm \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2}}}{2} \ &lt;/math&gt; which is in natural units of G=M=c=1: &lt;math&gt; \ r_{\rm H}^{\pm} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Another singularity occurs where the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. Again solving a quadratic equation ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;''=0 yields the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm E}^{\pm} = \frac{r_{s} \pm \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2} \cos^{2}\theta}}{2} \ &lt;/math&gt; or in natural units: &lt;math&gt; \ r_{\rm E}^{\pm} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1-a^2 \cos ^2(\theta )}&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ term in the square root, this outer surface resembles a flattened sphere that touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude θ equals 0 or π; the space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. Within this volume, the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of Ω. Thus, no particle can rotate opposite to the central mass within the ergosphere.

As with the event horizon in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] the apparent singularities at r&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; are an illusion created by the choice of coordinates (i.e., they are  [[coordinate singularities]]). In fact, the space-time can be smoothly continued through them by an appropriate choice of coordinates.

==Ergosphere and the Penrose process==
{{main|Penrose process}}

A black hole in general is surrounded by a surface, called the [[event horizon]] and situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] for a nonrotating black hole, where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light. Within this  surface, no observer/particle can maintain itself at a constant radius. It is forced to fall inwards, and so this is sometimes called the ''static limit''.
&lt;!--- [[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|250px|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|Two important surfaces around a rotating black hole. The inner sphere is the static limit (the event horizon). It is the inner boundary of a region called the [[ergoregion | ergosphere]]. The oblate spheroidal surface, touching the event horizon at the poles, is the outer boundary of the ergosphere. Within the ergosphere a particle is forced (dragging of space and time) to rotate and may gain energy at the cost of the rotational energy of the black hole ([[Penrose process]]).]]  --&gt;

A rotating black hole has the same static limit at its event horizon but there is an additional surface outside the event horizon named the "ergosurface" given by &lt;math&gt;(r-M)^{2} = M^{2}-J^{2}\cos^{2}\theta&lt;/math&gt; in [[Boyer–Lindquist coordinates]], which can be intuitively characterized as the sphere where "the rotational velocity of the surrounding space" is dragged along with the velocity of light. Within this sphere the dragging is greater than the speed of light, and any observer/particle is forced to co-rotate.

The region outside the event horizon but inside the surface where the rotational velocity is the speed of light, is called the ''ergosphere'' (from Greek ''ergon'' meaning ''work''). Particles falling within the ergosphere are forced to rotate faster and thereby gain energy. Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole. The net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy. The possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969 and is thus called the [[Penrose process]]. Rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena, such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s.

==Features of the Kerr geometry==

The Kerr geometry exhibits many noteworthy features: the maximal analytic extension includes a sequence of [[asymptotically flat]] exterior regions, each associated with an [[ergosphere]], stationary limit surfaces, [[event horizon]]s, [[Cauchy horizon]]s, [[closed timelike curve]]s, and a ring-shaped [[Gravitational singularity|curvature singularity]]. The [[geodesic equation]] can be solved exactly in closed form. In addition to two [[Killing vector fields]] (corresponding to ''[[time translation]]'' and ''axisymmetry''), the Kerr geometry admits a remarkable [[Killing tensor]]. There is a pair of principal null congruences (one ''ingoing'' and one ''outgoing''). The [[Weyl tensor]] is [[algebraically special]], in fact it has [[Petrov classification|Petrov type]] '''D'''. The [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] is known. Topologically, the  [[homotopy type]] of the Kerr spacetime can be simply characterized as a line with circles attached at each integer point.

Note that the inner Kerr geometry is unstable with regard to perturbations in the interior region. This instability means that although the Kerr metric is axis-symmetric, a black hole created through gravitational collapse may not be so.&lt;ref name="visser35" /&gt;  This instability also implies that many of the features of the Kerr geometry described above may not be present inside such a black hole.&lt;ref name="pauldavies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="visser13" /&gt;

A surface on which light can orbit a black hole is called a photon sphere. The Kerr solution has infinitely many [[photon sphere]]s, lying between an inner one and an outer one. In the nonrotating, Schwarzschild solution, with ''a''=0, the inner and outer photon spheres degenerate, so that there is only one photon sphere at a single radius. The greater the spin of a black hole, the farther from each other the inner and outer photon spheres move. A beam of light traveling in a direction opposite to the spin of the black hole will circularly orbit the hole at the outer photon sphere. A beam of light traveling in the same direction as the black hole's spin will circularly orbit at the inner photon sphere. Orbiting geodesics with some angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the black hole will orbit on photon spheres between these two extremes. Because the space-time is rotating, such orbits exhibit a precession, since there is a shift in the &lt;math&gt;\phi \,&lt;/math&gt; variable after completing one period in the &lt;math&gt;\theta \,&lt;/math&gt; variable.

===Trajectory equations===

The [[equations of motion]] for [[test particle]]s in the Kerr spacetime are governed by four [[constant of motion|constants of motion]].&lt;ref name="carter_1968"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carter | first = Brandon | authorlink = Brandon Carter | year = 1968 | title = Global structure of the Kerr family of gravitational fields | journal = Physical Review | volume = 174 | issue = 5 | pages = 1559&amp;ndash;1571|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.174.1559 | bibcode=1968PhRv..174.1559C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the invariant mass &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; of the test particle, defined by the relation
:&lt;math&gt; -\mu^2 = p^\alpha g_{\alpha\beta}p^\beta,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-momentum]] of the particle. Furthermore, there are two constants of motion given by the time translation and rotation symmetries of Kerr spacetime, the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and the component of the orbital angular momentum parallel to spin of the black hole &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="mtw"&gt;Misner, Thorne &amp; Wheeler: [https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/03/21/gravitation-misner-thorne-wheeler Gravitation], pages 899, 900, 908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bardeen1972"&gt;James Bardeen, 1972: [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=1972ApJ...178..347B&amp;letter=.&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=347&amp;epage=347&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf#page=4 Rotating Black Holes: Locally Bonrotating Frame, Energy Extraction &amp; Scalar Synchrotron Radiation], page 350&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = -p_t&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;L_z = -p_\phi&lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation|Hamilton–Jacobi theory]], [[Brandon Carter]] showed&lt;ref name="carter_1968"/&gt; that there exists a fourth constant of motion, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, now referred to as the [[Carter constant]]. It is related to the total angular momentum of the particle and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = p_{\theta}^{2} + \cos^{2}\theta \Bigg( a^{2}(\mu^{2} - E^{2}) + \left(\frac{L_z}{\sin\theta} \right)^{2} \Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since there are four (independent) constants of motion for degrees of freedom the equations of motion for a test particle in Kerr spacetime are [[integrable]].

Using these constants of motion, the trajectory equations for a test particle can be written (using natural units of G=M=c=1),&lt;ref name="odyssey"&gt;Hung-Yi Pu, Kiyun Yun, Ziri Younsi &amp; Suk Jin Yoon: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02063.pdf#page=2 A public GPU-based code for general-relativistic radiative transfer in Kerr spacetime], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063 arXiv:1601.02063], page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, Janna and Perez-Giz, Gabe: ''A Periodic Table for Black Hole Orbits'', {{arxiv|0802.0459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{dr}{d\lambda} = \pm \sqrt{R(r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = \pm \sqrt{\Theta(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{d\phi}{d\lambda} = -\left(a E-\frac{L_z}{\sin^2\theta}\right)+\frac{a}{\Delta}P(r) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{dt}{d\lambda} = -a (a E\sin^2\theta-L_z)+\frac{r^2+a^2}{\Delta}P(r)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta(\theta)=Q-\cos^2\theta\left(a^2(\mu^2-E^2)+\frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(r)=E(r^2+a^2)-a L_z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(r)=P(r)^2-\Delta\left(r^2+(L_z-a E)^2+Q\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an [[affine parameter]] such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\lambda} = p^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the affine parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the proper time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \tau/\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the [[Frame-dragging]]-effect a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO)&lt;ref&gt;Andrei &amp; Valeri Frolov: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.6316.pdf Rigidly rotating ZAMO surfaces in the Kerr spacetime] {{arXiv|1408.6316v1}})&lt;/ref&gt; is corotating with the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; which is defined with respect to the bookkeeper's coordinate time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The local velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of the test-particle is measured relative to a probe corotating with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The gravitational time-dilation between a ZAMO at fixed &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a stationary observer far away from the mass is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{t}{\tau} = \sqrt{{\frac{(a^2+r^2)^2-a^2 \ \Delta \ \sin ^2 \theta }{\Delta \ \Sigma}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetries==
The group of isometries of the Kerr metric is the subgroup of the ten-dimensional [[Poincaré group]] which takes the two-dimensional locus of the singularity to itself. It retains the [[time translation]]s (one dimension) and rotations around its axis of rotation (one dimension). Thus it has two dimensions. Like the Poincaré group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the component which reverses time and longitude; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane; and the component that does both.

In physics, symmetries are typically associated with conserved constants of motion, in accordance with [[Noether's theorem]]. As shown above, the geodesic equations have four conserved quantities: one of which comes from the definition of a geodesic, and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry. The fourth conserved quantity does not arise from a symmetry in the standard sense and is commonly referred to as a hidden symmetry.

==Overextreme Kerr solutions==

The location of the event horizon is determined by the larger root of &lt;math&gt;\Delta=0&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;{r_s / 2} &lt; a &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;G M^2 &lt; J c &lt;/math&gt;), there are no (real valued) solutions to this equation, and there is no event horizon. With no event horizons to hide it from the rest of the universe, the black hole ceases to be a black hole and will instead be a [[naked singularity]].&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar_1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandrasekhar | first = S. | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | date = 1983 | title = The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes | series = International Series of Monographs on Physics | volume = 69 | pages = 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kerr black holes as wormholes==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Space-Time Diagram for a Spinning Black Hole.gif|thumb|right|300px|A [[Penrose diagram]] for the Kerr metric: an object traveling on world-line B can emerge out of the spinning black hole.]] --&gt;
Although the Kerr solution appears to be singular at the roots of Δ = 0, these are actually [[coordinate singularity|coordinate singularities]], and, with an appropriate choice of new coordinates, the Kerr solution can be smoothly extended through the values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to these roots. The larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon, and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon. A (future-directed, time-like) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon. Once having passed through the event horizon, the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; coordinate now behaves like a time coordinate, so it must decrease until the curve passes through the Cauchy horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hamilton: [http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html#kerr Black hole Penrose diagrams] (JILA Colorado)&lt;/ref&gt;

The region beyond the Cauchy horizon has several surprising features. The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; coordinate again behaves like a spatial coordinate and can vary freely. The interior region has a reflection symmetry, so that a (future-directed time-like) curve may continue along a symmetric path, which continues through a second Cauchy horizon, through a second event horizon, and out into a new exterior region which is isometric to the original exterior region of the Kerr solution. The curve could then escape to infinity in the new region or enter the future event horizon of the new exterior region and repeat the process. This second exterior is sometimes thought of as another universe. On the other hand, in the Kerr solution, the singularity is a [[Ring singularity|ring]], and the curve may pass through the center of this ring. The region beyond permits closed time-like curves. Since the trajectory of observers and particles in general relativity are described by time-like curves, it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past.&lt;ref name="pauldavies"&gt;[[Paul Davies]]: [https://archive.is/20170708235257/https://books.google.at/books?id=mOgIGyD1uSIC&amp;pg=PT291&amp;lpg=PT291&amp;dq=kerr+closed+loop+past&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=duxTYw68Fj&amp;sig=2vWOrEFsA59UXxO6xFSQWwjtDGw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWhJzk6_rUAhXJZ1AKHaGxCI0Q6AEIWTAG%23v=onepage&amp;q=kerr%20closed%20loop%20past&amp;f=false About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visser13"&gt;Visser, Matt [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0622v3.pdf#page=13 The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction] arxiv.org, p. 13, below eq. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This interior solution is not likely to be physical and considered as a purely mathematical artefact.&lt;ref name="kerrtube1"&gt;Roy Kerr (Crafoord Prize Symposium in Astronomy): ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeLkmS3PZ5g&amp;t=26m Spinning Black Holes]''.

While it is expected that the exterior region of the Kerr solution is stable, and that all rotating black holes will eventually approach a Kerr metric, the interior region of the solution appears to be unstable, much like a pencil balanced on its point.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visser35" /&gt; This is related to the idea of [[Cosmic censorship hypothesis|cosmic censorship]].

==Relation to other exact solutions==

The Kerr geometry is a particular example of a [[stationary spacetime|stationary]] [[axially symmetric spacetime|axially symmetric]] [[vacuum solution]] to the [[Einstein field equation]]. The family of all stationary axially symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation are the [[Ernst vacuum]]s.

The Kerr solution is also related to various non-vacuum solutions which model black holes. For example, the [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr–Newman electrovacuum]] models a (rotating) black hole endowed with an electric charge, while the [[Kerr–Vaidya null dust]] models a (rotating) hole with infalling electromagnetic radiation.

The special case &lt;math&gt;a = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; of the Kerr metric yields the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which models a ''nonrotating'' black hole which is [[static spacetime|static]] and [[spherically symmetric]], in the [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]. (In this case, every Geroch moment but the mass vanishes.)

The ''interior'' of the Kerr geometry, or rather a portion of it, is [[locally isometric]] to the [[Chandrasekhar–Ferrari CPW vacuum]], an example of a [[colliding plane wave]] model. This is particularly interesting, because the [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] of this CPW solution is quite different from that of the Kerr geometry, and in principle, an experimenter could hope to study the geometry of (the outer portion of) the Kerr interior by arranging the collision of two suitable [[gravitational plane waves]].

==Multipole moments==

Each [[asymptotically flat]] Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic [[multipole moment]]s, the first two of which can be interpreted as the [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the source of the field. There are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen, Thorne, and Geroch, which turn out to agree with each other. The relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr geometry were computed by Hansen; they turn out to be
:&lt;math&gt; M_n = M \, (i \, a)^n &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the special case of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild vacuum]] (''a''=0) gives the "monopole [[point source]]" of general relativity.

''Warning:'' do not confuse these relativistic multipole moments with the ''Weyl multipole moments'', which arise from treating a certain metric function (formally corresponding to Newtonian gravitational potential) which appears the Weyl-Papapetrou chart for the Ernst family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions using the standard euclidean scalar [[multipole moment]]s. In a sense, the Weyl moments only (indirectly) characterize the "mass distribution" of an isolated source, and they turn out to depend only on the ''even order'' relativistic moments. In the case of solutions symmetric across the equatorial plane the ''odd order'' Weyl moments vanish. For the Kerr vacuum solutions, the first few Weyl moments are given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = M, \; \; a_1 = 0, \; \; a_2 = M \, \left( \frac{M^2}{3} - a^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, we see that the Schwarzschild vacuum has nonzero second order Weyl moment, corresponding to the fact that the "Weyl monopole" is the [[Chazy–Curzon vacuum]] solution, not the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, which arises from the Newtonian potential of a certain finite length uniform density thin ''rod''.

In weak field general relativity, it is convenient to treat isolated sources using another type of multipole, which generalize the Weyl moments to ''mass multipole moments'' and ''momentum multipole moments'', characterizing respectively the distribution of [[mass]] and of [[momentum]] of the source. These are multi-indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized (anti-symmetrized) parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner.

Perez and Moreschi have given an alternative notion of "monopole solutions" by expanding the standard NP tetrad of the Ernst vacuums in powers of ''r'' (the radial coordinate in the Weyl-Papapetrou chart). According to this formulation:
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''zero'' angular momentum is the ''Schwarzschild vacuum'' family (one parameter),
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''radial'' angular momentum is the ''[[Taub–NUT vacuum]]'' family (two parameters; not quite asymptotically flat),
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''axial'' angular momentum is the ''Kerr vacuum'' family (two parameters).
In this sense, the Kerr vacuums are the simplest stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions in general relativity.

==Open problems==

The Kerr geometry is often used as a model of a [[rotating black hole]].  But if we hold the solution to be valid only outside some compact region (subject to certain restrictions), in principle we should be able to use it as an [[exterior solution]] to model the gravitational field around a rotating massive object other than a black hole, such as a [[neutron star]], or the Earth. This works out very nicely for the non-rotating case, where we can match the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior to a [[Schwarzschild fluid]] interior, and indeed to more general [[static spherically symmetric perfect fluid]] solutions. However, the problem of finding a rotating perfect-fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior, or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution, has proven very difficult. In particular, the [[Wahlquist fluid]], which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior, is now known not to admit any such matching. At present it seems that only approximate solutions modeling slowly rotating fluid balls are known. (Slowly rotating fluid balls are the relativistic analog of oblate spheroidal balls with nonzero mass and angular momentum but vanishing higher multipole moments.)  However, the exterior of the [[Neugebauer–Meinel disk]], an exact [[dust solution]] which models a rotating thin disk, approaches in a limiting case the &lt;math&gt; GM^2 = cJ &lt;/math&gt; Kerr geometry. Physical thin-disk solutions obtained by identifying parts of the Kerr space-time are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bičák | first1 = Jří | last2 = Ledvinka | first2 = Tomáš | year = 1993 | title = Relativistic disks as sources of the Kerr metric | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 71 | issue = 11| pages = 1669–1672 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.71.1669 | pmid=10054468| bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1669B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9040">{{Taxation}}
A '''landfill tax''' or '''levy''' is a form of [[tax]] that is applied in some countries to increase the cost of [[landfill]]. The tax is typically levied in units of currency per unit of weight or volume (£/t, €/t, $/yard³). The tax is in addition to the overall cost of landfill and forms a proportion of the [[gate fee]].

==Reasons for landfill tax==
A tax or fee may be imposed on landfills or other disposal facilities as a means of raising general revenues, to generate funds for inspection programs or long-term mitigation of environmental impacts related to disposal, or as a means of inhibiting disposal by raising the cost in comparison to preferable alternatives, in the same manner as an [[excise tax|excise]] or "[[sin tax]]".

Landfilling is discouraged due to a number of key reasons:

*[[Climate change]] caused by [[landfill gas]] from [[biodegradable waste]]
*Loss of resources
**Constraints on areas suitable for landfill sites
**Loss of recyclable components of waste landfilled
* [[Nimby]] objections causing political problems

==Landfill tax by country==
&lt;!--

Is it at a state rather than federal level?

see also Environmental Protection Regulations 1987 
===Australia===

 --&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] allowed for the charging of a landfill levy. Half of the landfill levy goes to local authorities with the other half going into a Waste Minimisation Fund. As of 2010 it is set at $10 a tonne but it can be reviewed by the Minister for the Environment.&lt;ref name="mfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-disposal-levy/faq.html|title=Waste Disposal Levy FAQs|date=22 September 2009|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Landfill Tax was introduced in 1996 by Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment, [[John Gummer]], and was the UK's first environmental tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00237/SN00237.pdf|title=Landfill tax : introduction &amp; early history|website=parliament.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1527/introduction/made|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is seen as a key mechanism in enabling the UK to meet its targets set out in the [[Landfill Directive]] for the landfilling of biodegradable waste. Through increasing the cost of landfill, other [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|advanced waste treatment technologies]] with higher gate fees are made to become more financially attractive.

The amount of tax levied is calculated according to the weight of the material disposed of and whether it is active or inactive waste.

*Inactive waste covers most materials used in a building's fabric as well as earth excavated for foundations. Most forms of concrete, brick, glass, soil, clay and gravel are classified as inactive.
*Active waste covers all other forms of waste such as wood, ductwork, piping and plastics.

Inevitably there will be some mixing of waste such as inert bricks and concrete mixed with small amounts of wood or mineral dust packaged in polythene bags. It is for the producer of the waste to decide what is reasonable and acceptable in terms of active waste contamination of inert waste.

The landfill site operator is responsible for paying the tax and will pass the cost on to businesses and local councils on top of normal landfill fees. VAT is charged on the landfill fees and the landfill tax.

Operators can reduce their tax liability by making payments to the Landfill Communities Fund under the [[Landfill Tax Credit Scheme]]. The fund aids community or environmental projects in the vicinity of a landfill site and is regulated by ENTRUST, a company limited by guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund|title=Landfill Communities Fund|website=www.entrust.org.uk|publisher=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landfill tax rates 2013–2014'''

*Standard rate for active waste: £80 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act 2012]], section 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.50 per tonne

Sections from the coalition government's Emergency Budget 2010:
*2.128 The standard rate of landfill tax will increase by £8 per tonne each year from 1 April 2011 until at least 2014. There will be a floor under the standard rate at £80 per tonne, so that the rate will not fall below £80 per tonne from April 2014 until at least 2020.
*2.129 New qualifying criteria for lower rated wastes will be legislated in the Finance Bill introduced in the autumn (2010), to come into effect on 1 April 2011.

'''Landfill tax rates 2015–16'''

From 1 April 2015 to April 2016 the landfill tax rates were:
* Standard rate for active waste: £82.60 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EfW, landfill, RDF - letsrecycle.com|url = http://www.letsrecycle.com/prices/efw-landfill-rdf-2/|website = letsrecycle.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.60 per tonne

With the [[Scotland Act 2012]], the [[Scottish Government]] gained the devolved power to levy its own landfill tax. The [[Scottish Landfill Tax]] was introduced by the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]] and began to be payable on 1 April 2015.&lt;ref name="ZeroWaste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/landfill-tax-scotland-0|title=A landfill tax for Scotland|website=zerowastescotland.org.uk|publisher=Zero Waste Scotland|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegislationSCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/|title=Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevenueScotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title=Scottish Landfill Tax|website=Revenue Scotland|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, there were concerns that some companies disposing waste to landfill were wrongly putting waste with a biodegradable and non-inert content into landfills at the inactive waste taxation level. A new testing regime was introduced, where a small amount of the load is tested to ascertain its biodegradable content.

'''Landfill tax rates 2018-19'''

From 1 April 2018 to April 2019 the landfill tax rates are:
* Standard rate for active waste: £88.95 per tonne
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.80 per tonne

The [[Welsh Government]] will take responsibility for the tax in Wales from April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund/wales/|title=The LCF in Wales|website=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The United States has numerous federal laws and regulations regarding the operation of landfills,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but there is no national landfill tax or fee.  Many{{Which|date=October 2009}} states and local governments collect fees and taxes on the collection or disposal of solid waste.

==== California ====
Landfills in California are subject to fees and taxes levied by cities and counties, as well as by the state.  The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 authorized a state fee (set at $1.40 per ton effective 2002-07-01) to fund the activities of the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] (CIWMB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/mtgdocs/2001/06/00005641.doc California Integrated Waste Management Board, June 19–21, 2001, Agenda Item 28] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities and counties collect fees from landfills within their jurisdiction to recover the costs of local solid waste planning and inspection programs, to operate programs for the collection and disposal of household [[hazardous wastes]], and to fund some costs of recycling and reuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=41001-42000&amp;file=41900-41904 California Public Resources Code, Section 41900 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfills in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] are subject to the highest disposal tax in California, with the Disposal Facility Tax set at $13.00 per ton in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14367&amp;sid=5 San Jose Municipal Code, Chapter 4.78]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynn Hershman Leeson''' (born 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]] and [[filmmaker]]. Her work combines art with social commentary, particularly on the relationship between people and technology.  Leeson's work in media-based technology helped legitimize digital art forms.&lt;ref name="The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tromble|first1=Meredith|title=The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I|date=2005|publisher=University of California|isbn=0-520-23970-9|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Leeson's work has as its themes: identity in a time of [[consumerism]], privacy in an era of surveillance, interfacing of humans and machines, and the relationship between real and [[virtual world]]s.  Her work grew out of an [[installation art]] and performance tradition, with an emphasis on interactivity.&lt;ref name="Wardrip-Fruin, Noah (2003)"&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort, eds. ''The New Media Reader''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003, p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt; With a practice spanning more than 40 years, Leeson has worked in performance, moving image, drawing, collage, text-based work, site-specific interventions, and later new media / digital technologies, and interactive net-based works.

Her projects explore technology in digital media and science. Leeson was the first artist to launch an interactive piece using [[Videodisc]], a precursor to DVD (Lorna, 1983–84), as well the first artist to incorporate a [[touch screen]] interface into her artwork (Deep Contact, 1984-1989). Her networked robotic art installation (The Difference Engine #3, 1995-1998) is an example of her tendency to expand her artwork beyond the traditional realms of art.&lt;ref name="The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)"&gt;[http://www.galeriewaldburger.com/lhershman/onroberta.pdf The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by Lynn Hershman Leeson is featured in the public collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the William Lehmbruck Museum, the [[ZKM]] (Zentrum fur Kunst und Medientechnologie), the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Canada]], di Rosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collection|url=http://www.dirosaart.org/about/the-collection/|website=dirosaart.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Walker Art Center]] and the University Art Museum, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], in addition to the private collections of Donald Hess and [[Arturo Schwarz]], among many others. Commissions include projects for the [[Tate Modern]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[de Young Museum]], [[Daniel Langlois]] and [[Stanford University]], and [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]].

=== Alter ego ===
From 1974 until 1978, Leeson ‘developed’ a fictional [[persona]] and [[alter ego]] of "Roberta Breitmore." It consisted not only of a physical self-transformation through make-up, clothing, and wigs, but a fully-fledged personality existing over an extended period of time and whose existence could be proven in the world through physical evidence: from a driver’s license and credit card to letters from her psychiatrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictive.arts.uci.edu/roberta_breitmore|title=Breitmore, Roberta (Lynn Hershman Leeson)|website=fictive.arts.uci.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artpractical.com/feature/looking_for_roberta_breitmore/|title=Looking for Roberta Breitmore|last=Maloney|first=Patricia|date=|work=Art Practical|access-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was later taken to further lengths when Leeson introduced another three ‘Robertas’, by hiring other performers to enact her character. These ‘clones’ of Roberta adopted the same look and attire, engaged in some of Roberta’s correspondence and also went on some of Roberta (Leeson’s) dates. Towards the end, the ‘original’ Roberta, withdrew from her character leaving the three ‘clones’ to continue her work, until they were retired in a performance at the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] in Ferrara, Italy in 1978, during an exorcism at the grave of [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. What remains are the physical artefacts of any life: documentation and [[personal effects]] such as legal and medical documents and a diary).&lt;ref name="The Importance of Being Roberta, Katerina Gregos (2011)"/&gt;

Between 1995–2000 Roberta transformed into the CybeRoberta, an interactive artificial intelligent sculpture on the web. In 2006 Roberta Breitmore developed into a character in [[Second Life]]. After Stanford University acquired her archive, Leeson worked with [[Henry Lowood]] (Stanford Humanities Lab) to convert parts of the archive into something for a broader public. They worked to recreate and re-enact both Roberta Breitmore and The Dante Hotel in a virtual space.&lt;ref name="Hacking the Codes of Self Representation, LEA Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aceti |first=Lanfranco |url=http://www.leoalmanac.org/hacking-the-codes-of-self-representation-lea-magazine-article/ |title=Hacking the Codes of Self-representation LEA Magazine Article |publisher=Leoalmanac.org |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LORNA ===
LORNA was an early project of Leeson's. The first [[art game|interactive laser artdisk]], LORNA tells the story of an [[Agoraphobia|Agoraphobic]] woman. Viewers have the option of directing her life into several possible plots and endings.&lt;ref name="lynnhershman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnhershman.com/lorna/ |title=Lynn Hershman Leeson – Lorna |publisher=Lynnhershman.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; LORNA never left her one-room apartment.  As LORNA watched the news and ads, she became fearful, afraid to leave her tiny room. Viewers were invited to liberate LORNA from her fears, using remote control units.

The plot has multiple variations that can be seen backwards, forwards, at increased or decreased speeds, and from several points of view. There is no hierarchy in the ordering of decisions. And the icons were often made of cut-off and dislocated body parts such as a mouth, or an eye.&lt;ref name="lynnhershman.com"/&gt;

=== Agent Ruby ===
In 2001, Leeson created the "Agent Ruby" for the [[SFMOMA]] . Since that time Agent Ruby&lt;ref&gt;[http://agentruby.sfmoma.org Lynn Hershman Leeson's Agent Ruby]&lt;/ref&gt; has conversed with online users, which has shaped her memory, knowledge, and moods. In 2013 the SFMOMA presented ''Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files''. This digital and analog presentation reinterprets dialogues drawn from the decade-long archive of text files of Agent Ruby’s conversations with online users and reflects on technologies, recurrent themes, and patterns of audience engagement.&lt;ref name="Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmoma.org/exhib_events/exhibitions/512 |title=Exhibitions + Events &amp;#124; Calendar &amp;#124; Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files |publisher=SFMOMA |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films and documentaries ==
A 1990 documentary, ''[[Desire Inc.]]'' features a series of seductive television ads in which a sexy woman asked for viewers to call her.

Leeson's three feature films - ''[[Strange Culture]]'', ''[[Teknolust]]'', ''[[Conceiving Ada]]'' - have been part of the [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Toronto International Film Festival and The [[Berlin International Film Festival]], among others, and have won numerous awards.

In 2011 Hershman released the ground-breaking [[!Women Art Revolution]], a feature-length documentary about the [[Feminist art movement in the United States]].  According to Leeson:&lt;ref name="Hacking the Codes of Self Representation, LEA Magazine"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The films are all about loss and technology. Ada Lovelace invented computer language, but was never credited and was basically erased from history. Teknolust is about artificial intelligence clones: the bots that escape into reality and interact with human life, in effect a symbiosis between technological life and human life, and how the two can marry. Strange Culture again was about misidentity, where the media created a fictional character that they blame this crime on, rather than the actual person. All of these works are about erasure of identity and how technology adds to it and creates it. And how you can defeat that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of her 2014 exhibition "How To Disappear," she premiered her video ''The Ballad of JT LeRoy'',&lt;ref name="Birds Eye View"/&gt; examining [[Laura Albert]]'s use of the [[literary persona]] [[JT LeRoy]]. Reflecting on the parallels between JT LeRoy and Roberta Breitmore, Hershman Leeson has commented:&lt;ref name="KubaParis Interview"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of an alter ego is not new at all. Writers have been protecting themselves in that way for centuries. [[Mary Shelley]] did it. Of course Laura took this practice further and I think that was very smart and I do not think she deserves the kind of condemnation that she got. If I had done the Roberta thing ten years later, I would have faced the same problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Retrospectives ==
In 2007 a retrospective at the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]] in [[Manchester]], ''Autonomous Agents'', featured a comprehensive range of the artist's work - from the ''Roberta Breitmore'' series (1974–78) to videos from the 1980s and interactive installations that use the Internet and artificial intelligence software. Her influential early ventures into performance and photography are also featured in the current touring exhibition ''WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution'', organized by the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]]. ''The Art and Films of Lynn Hershman Leeson: Secret Agents, Private I'', was published by The [[University of California Press]] in 2005 on the occasion of another retrospective at the [[Henry Gallery]] in [[Seattle]].

In 2014 a retrospective at The ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]], "Civic Radar", has realized the first retrospective which not only ensures an overview of all creative phases in Lynn Hershman Leeson’s oeuvre but also the most recent productions of this innovative artist.
&lt;ref name="The ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zkm.de/en/event/2014/12/lynn-hershman-leeson-civic-radar|title=Civic Radar|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While encompassing a wide body of Hershman's work throughout the years, as an exhibition, "Civic Radar" highlights Hershman's interest in technology, looking closely at artificial intelligence and genetic modification.  In 2017, "Civic Radar," Hershman's retrospective from ZKM was hosted at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ybca.org/whats-on/civic-radar|title=YBCA: Civic Radar|website=www.ybca.org|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeson was also featured in the Women's eNews "21 Leaders for the 21st Century" special in 2014 for her role in empowering young female artists to strengthen their artistic voices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">'''Maggot farming''' is the act of growing [[maggot]]s for the industry. It is distinct from [[vermicompost]]ing as there is no separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from [[earthworm]]s (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material).

==Species used==
A variety of species can be used, including the [[black soldier fly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entologics.com/production.html Entologics growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterrafeed.com/process/ Enterrafeed growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various other fly species. Due to convenience, fly species are often used which are indigenous to the area of cultivation.

==Method of cultivation==
When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin)&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs by Gunther Pauli&lt;/ref&gt; is to simply dump [[offal]] or [[Food waste#Animal feed|meat that has exceeded the sell-by date]] in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with [[chicken wire]] to prevent any large animals of being able to feed off it. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it. After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal, ...).

==Use of the maggots==
The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed. Especially [[Aquaculture|fish]], chickens, pig, ducks appreciate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3825158/farming-flies-south-africa/ Black soldier fly farms serving aquaculture and chicken farms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksoldierflyfarming.com/faq/bsf-uses Black free soldier fly maggots used as animal feed]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be sold as fishing bait.

'''Might makes right''' is an [[aphorism]] with several potential meanings (in order of increasing complexity):
{|
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''[[English language|English]]''':}}
|The idea associated with the phrase connotes that a society's view of [[Right (ethics)|right]] and [[wrong]] is determined, like its perspective on history, by those currently in power. The term can be used in the [[descriptive]], rather than [[prescriptive]] way, in the same sense that people say that "History is written by the victors". Because every person labels what they think is good for themselves as right, only those who are able to defeat their enemies can push their idea of what is right into [[wikt:fruition|fruition]]. The phrase is most often used in negative assessments of expressions of power.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Kratocracy''':}}
|According to [[William Pepperell Montague|Montague]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/k.html|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''kratocracy''' or '''kraterocracy''' (from the Greek κρατερός ''krateros'', meaning "strong") is a government by those who are strong enough to seize power through [[coercive power]], social persuasion, or deceptive cunning. The term was used by [[Kropotkin]] in ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', but is now rarely seen. In terms of [[Master morality]], those who are the strongest will rule others and have the power to determine both right and wrong, and what constitutes "the greater good".  By this definition, the phrase manifests itself in a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] sense. This meaning is often used to define a proscriptive [[moral code]] for society to follow, as well as while discussing [[social Darwinism]] and [[Weberian]] themes of the authority of the state (e.g. ''[[Economy and Society|Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft]]'').
|}

==History==
The idea of "woe to the conquered" can be found in [[Homer]] and the [[The Hawk and the Nightingale|hawk parable]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' and in [[Livy]], in which "[[vae victis]]", Latin for "woe to the conquered", is first recorded.

The first commonly quoted use of ''might makes right'' in the English language was in 1846 by the American [[pacifist]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Adin Ballou]] (1803–1890), who wrote, "But now, instead of discussion and argument, brute force rises up to the rescue of discomfited error, and crushes truth and right into the dust. 'Might makes right,' and hoary folly totters on in her mad career escorted by armies and navies." (Christian Non-Resistance: In All Its Important Bearings, Illustrated and Defended, 1846.)

The phrase in reverse is echoed in [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s words in his February 26, 1860, [[Cooper Union Address]] ("Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it") in his attempt to defend a policy of neutral engagement with those who practised slavery, perhaps to appear more nationally oriented and religiously convicted in hopes of winning the presidential election later that year (which he did).

The idea, though not the wording, has been attributed to the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]], who stated that "right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/melian.htm|title=The Melian Dialogue|author=|date=|website=www.mtholyoke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pepperell Montague|Montague]] coined the term ''Kratocracy'', from the Greek κρατερός ''krateros'', meaning "strong", for government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Albert Einstein]] from 1932, [[Sigmund Freud]] clearly explores this idea of "might versus right" as well. He discusses the relationship between the two and how this concept has in fact existed throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freud.org.uk/file-uploads/files/WHY%20WAR.pdf|title=Freud 1968, p. 83.|author=|date=|website=freud.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first chapter of Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', [[Thrasymachus]] claims that "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger", which [[Socrates]] then disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.2.i.html|title=Plato's Republic, Book 1|author=Plato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Might makes right" has been described as the [[credo]] of [[totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/valr59&amp;section=19|title=Evolution of Reasoned Elaboration: Jurisprudential Criticism and Social Change, The|author=GE White|publisher=Va. L. Rev.|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Realism (international relations)|Realist]] scholars of [[international politics]] think of it as a game in a kind of "[[state of nature]]" in which might makes right.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/26/1/161.pdf|title=Understanding Rummel|author=JL Ray|publisher=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in literature==
The author [[T.H. White]] covered this topic extensively in the [[Arthurian]] novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. [[Merlin]] teaches young Arthur to challenge this concept; Arthur, after assuming the throne, attempts to reduce violence through various means and with varying degrees of success.

The '''Online Consciousness Conference''' held at Consciousness Online &lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2008 by Richard Brown, then a graduate student at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. The conference was inspired by and partially modeled on the Online Philosophy Conference &lt;ref&gt;http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/online_philosophy_confere/&lt;/ref&gt; started by Thomas Nadellhoffer and Eddie Nahmias, with one major difference being the heavy use of homemade video and audio presentations, and another difference being the restricted focus of the conference on consciousness studies as opposed to all of philosophy.

==The Conferences==
The first conference was held February 20-March 4, 2009 with the theme "Philosophers Facing Phenomenal Consciousness" and a keynote given by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]. Papers from this conference were subsequently published in the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123204645/http://imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held February 19-March 5, 2010 with the theme "Lessons and Limits from the Empirical Study of Consciousness" with keynote talks by Hakwan Lau (psychology Columbia) with commentary by [[Ned Block]], David Rosenthal and [[David Chalmers]], and Collin Clifford (psychology University of Sydney). Papers from it are due to be published in [[Consciousness and Cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/information-for-contributors/&lt;/ref&gt; The third conference was held February 18-March 4, 2011 with the theme "Neurophilosophy and the Philosophy of Neuroscience" and featured invited talks from [[Paul Churchland]], [[Kathleen Akins]], [[Stevan Harnad]] and [[Jesse Prinz]]. 

Past presentations and the discussion at the conference is preserved online and can be viewed at Consciousness Online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">In [[mathematics]], an '''open book decomposition''' (or simply an '''open book''') is a [[manifold decomposition|decomposition]] of a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[oriented]] [[3-manifold]] ''M'' into a union of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s (necessarily with boundary) and [[solid torus|solid tori]]. Open books have relevance to [[contact geometry]], with a famous theorem of [[Emmanuel Giroux]] (given below) that shows that contact geometry can be studied from an entirely topological viewpoint.

==Definition and construction==
'''Definition.'''  An ''open book decomposition'' of a 3-dimensional manifold ''M'' is a pair (''B'', π) where
:*''B'' is an oriented [[link (knot theory)|link]] in ''M'', called the '''binding''' of the open book;
:*&amp;pi;: ''M''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[fibration]] of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''B'' such that for each &amp;theta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;theta;) is the interior of a compact surface &amp;Sigma;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' whose boundary is ''B''. The surface &amp;Sigma; is called the '''page''' of the open book.
This is the special case ''m'' = 3 of an open book decomposition of an ''m''-dimensional manifold, for any ''m''.

When Σ is an oriented compact surface with ''n'' boundary components and φ:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Σ is a [[homeomorphism]] which is the identity near the boundary, we can construct an open book by first forming the [[mapping torus]] Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;. Since φ is the identity on ∂Σ, ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is the trivial circle bundle over a union of circles, that is, a union of tori; one torus for each boundary component. To complete the construction, [[solid torus|solid tori]] are glued to fill in the boundary tori so that each circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{''p''}&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;∂''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is identified with the boundary of a page. In this case, the binding is the collection of ''n'' cores ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;{q} of the ''n'' solid tori glued into the mapping torus, for arbitrarily chosen ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is known that any open book can be constructed this way. As the only information used in the construction is the surface and the homeomorphism, an alternate definition of open book is simply the pair (Σ,&amp;nbsp;φ) with the construction understood. In short, an open book is a mapping torus with solid tori glued in so that the core circle of each torus runs parallel to the boundary of the fiber.

Each torus in ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is fibered by circles parallel to the binding, each circle a boundary component of a page. One envisions a [[rolodex]]-looking structure for a neighborhood of the binding (that is, the solid torus glued to ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;mdash;the pages of the rolodex connect to pages of the open book and the center of the rolodex is the binding. Thus the term ''open book''.

It is a 1972 theorem of Elmar Winkelnkemper that for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, a simply-connected ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if it has signature&amp;nbsp;0. In 1977 Terry Lawson proved that for odd ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, every ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition. For even ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6,  an ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if an asymmetric [[Witt group]] obstruction is 0, by a 1979 theorem of [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]].

==Giroux correspondence==

In 2002, Emmanuel Giroux published the following result:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''M'' be a compact oriented 3-manifold. Then there is a [[bijection]] between the set of oriented [[contact structure]]s on ''M'' [[up to]] [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]] and the set of open book decompositions of ''M'' up to positive stabilization.

''Positive stabilization'' consists of modifying the page by adding a [[handle decomposition|2-dimensional 1-handle]] and modifying the monodromy by adding a positive [[Dehn twist]] along a curve that runs over that handle exactly once. Implicit in this theorem is that the new open book defines the same contact 3-manifold. Giroux's result has led to some breakthroughs in what is becoming more commonly called [[contact topology]], such as the classification of contact structures on certain classes of 3-manifolds. Roughly speaking, a contact structure corresponds to an open book if, away from the binding, the contact distribution is isotopic to the tangent spaces of the pages through [[confoliation]]s. One imagines smoothing the contact planes (preserving the contact condition almost everywhere) to lie tangent to the pages.

{{Rape}}

[[Pregnancy]] is a potential result of [[rape]]. It has been [[Wartime sexual violence|studied in the context of war]], particularly [[Genocidal rape|as a tool for genocide]], as well as other unrelated contexts, such as rape by a stranger, [[statutory rape]], [[incest]], and [[Teenage pregnancy|underage pregnancy]]. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that rape is at least as likely to lead to pregnancy as [[sexual consent|consensual sexual intercourse]], with some studies suggesting rape may actually result in higher rates of pregnancy than consensual intercourse.&lt;ref name=CNN22-08-2012&gt;Dellorto, Danielle (22 August 2012). [http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/health/rape-pregnancy/index.html "Experts: Rape does not lower odds of pregnancy"]. [[CNN Health]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012&gt;Begley, Sharon; Heavey, Susan (20 August 2012). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-20/news/sns-rt-us-usa-politics-abortion-claimbre87j0xj-20120820_1_pregnancy-female-orgasm-claim "Rape trauma as barrier to pregnancy has no scientific basis"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gottschall03/&gt;

Rape can cause difficulties during and after pregnancy, with potential negative consequences for both the victim and a resulting child. Medical treatment following a rape includes testing for, preventing, and managing pregnancy. A woman who becomes pregnant after a rape may face a decision about whether to raise the child, give the child up for [[adoption]] or [[parenting]] by others, or to have an [[abortion]]. In some countries where abortion is illegal after rape and incest, over 90% of pregnancies in girls age 15 and under are due to rape by family members.&lt;ref name="Schiffman" /&gt;

The false belief that pregnancy can almost never result from rape was widespread for centuries. In Europe, from medieval times well into the 18th century a man could use a woman's pregnancy as a legal defense to "prove" that he could not have raped her, since her pregnancy was thought to mean that she had enjoyed the sex and, therefore, consented to it. In recent decades, some [[pro-life]] organizations and politicians (such as [[Todd Akin]]) who [[opposition to legal abortion|oppose legal abortion]] in cases of rape have advanced claims that pregnancy very rarely arises from rape, and that the practical relevance of such exceptions to [[abortion law]] is, therefore, limited or non-existent.&lt;ref name=Clowes97/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-21-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ-21-08-2012/&gt;

== Rape-pregnancy incidence==

Any female capable of [[ovulation]] may become pregnant after rape by a virile male.

Estimates of the numbers of pregnancies from rape vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Geiger, [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/23/news/la-pn-statistics-on-rape-and-pregnancy-are-complicated-20120822 Statistics on rape and pregnancy are complicated], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 23, 2012.

Retrieved 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent estimates suggest that rape conception happens between 25,000 and 32,000 times each year in the U.S.
&lt;!-- STUDIES IN THE US --&gt;
In a 1996 three-year [[longitudinal study]] of 4,000 American women, physician Melisa Holmes estimated from data from her study that forced sexual intercourse causes over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States each year.&lt;ref name="AJOG"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70141-2 |title=Rape-related pregnancy: Estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women |year=1996 |last1=Holmes |first1=Melisa M. |last2=Resnick |first2=Heidi S. |last3=Kilpatrick |first3=Dean G. |last4=Best |first4=Connie L. |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=175 |issue=2 |pages=320–4; discussion 324–5 |pmid=8765248}} (abstract also available at NIH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765248 pubmed site] Retrieved 24 May 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Physician Felicia H. Stewart and economist James Trussell estimated that the 333,000 assaults and rapes reported in the US in 1998 caused about 25,000 pregnancies, and up to 22,000 of those pregnancies could have been prevented by prompt medical treatment, such as [[emergency contraception]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00243-9 |title=Prevention of pregnancy resulting from rape: A neglected preventive health measure |year=2000 |last1=Stewart |first1=Felicia H |last2=Trussell |first2=James |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=228–9 |pmid=11064225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- HIGHER CONCEPTION RATES --&gt;
Psychologist Robert L. Smith states that some studies have reported "unusually high rates of conception following rape".&lt;ref name="Smith2005" /&gt; He cites a paper by C.A. Fox and Beatrice Fox, reporting that biologist Alan Sterling Parkes had speculated in personal correspondence that "there is a high conception rate in rape, where hormonal release, due to fear or anger, could produce reflex ovulation".&lt;ref name="fox1971" /&gt; Smith also cites veterinary scientist Wolfgang Jöchle, who "proposed that rape may induce ovulation in human females".&lt;ref name="Jöchle1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jöchle1975" /&gt; Literary scholar [[Jonathan Gottschall]] and economist Tiffani Gottschall argued in a 2003 ''[[Human Nature (journal)|Human Nature]]'' article that previous studies of rape-pregnancy statistics were not directly comparable to pregnancy rates from consensual intercourse, because the comparisons were largely uncorrected for such factors as the use of [[contraception]]. Adjusting for these factors, they estimated that rapes are about twice as likely to result in pregnancies (7.98%) as "consensual, unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse" (2–4%). They discuss a variety of possible explanations and advance the hypothesis that rapists tend to target victims with biological "cues of high fecundity" or subtle indications of ovulation.&lt;ref name=Gottschall03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1014-0 |laysummary=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79895.html |laysource=Politico |laydate=21 August 2012 |title=Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates? |year=2003 |last1=Gottschall |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Gottschall |first2=Tiffani A. |journal=Human Nature |volume=14 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- LOWER RATES FROM RAPE --&gt;
In contrast, psychologists Tara Chavanne and Gordon Gallup Jr., citing unpublished dissertations by Rogel&lt;ref name="Rogel1976" /&gt; and Morgan,&lt;ref name="Morgan1981" /&gt; argued that female [[adaptation]]s reduce the likelihood of rape during fertile periods.&lt;ref name="Chavanne" /&gt; A 1995 study of women who became pregnant after rape found that 60% had been impregnated during consensual intercourse.&lt;ref name="thornhill"/&gt; Anthropologist [[Daniel Fessler]] disputed these findings, saying, "analysis of conception rates reveals that the probability of conception following rape does not differ from that following consensual coitus".&lt;ref name="fessler2003" /&gt;

===Sociobiological theories of rape pregnancy===
{{See also|Sociobiological theories of rape}}
[[Sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape may be a [[mating strategy]] in humans, as a way for males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations.&lt;ref name="mckibbin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.12.1.86 |title=Why do men rape?

Palmer]] are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women of childbearing age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women.&lt;ref name="thornhill2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thornhill |first1=Randy |last2=Palmer |first2=Craig T |year=2000 |title=Why men rape |journal=The Sciences |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=30–6 |issn=0036-861X |oclc=93004665 | doi = 10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03465.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=Gottschall03/&gt;

=== Statutory rape, incest and underage pregnancy ===
{{main|statutory rape|incest|teenage pregnancy}}
In 1995–96, the journal ''Family Planning Perspectives'' published a study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], a sexual health research and policy organization, on [[statutory rape]] (sexual intercourse with a minor) and resulting pregnancies. It drew on other research&lt;ref name="Landry"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David J. |last1=Landry |first2=Jacqueline Darroch |last2=Forrest |title=How Old Are U.S. Fathers? |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |pmid=7589357 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2715995.html |year=1995 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=159–61, 165 |doi=10.2307/2136260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.86.4.565 |title=The ages of fathers in California adolescent births, 1993 |year=1996 |last1=Males |first1=Mike |last2=Chew |first2=Kenneth S Y |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=565–8 |pmid=8604792 |pmc=1380562}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conclude that "at least half of all babies born to minor women are fathered by adult men", and that "although relatively small proportions of 13–14-year-olds have had intercourse, those who become sexually active at an early age are especially likely to have experienced coercive sex: Seventy-four percent of women who had intercourse before age 14 and 60% of those who had sex before age 15 report having had a forced sexual experience". Because of difficulties in bringing such cases to trial, however, "data from the period 1975–1978&amp;nbsp;... indicate that, on average, only 413 men were arrested annually for statutory rape in California, even though 50,000 pregnancies occurred among underage women in 1976 alone".&lt;ref&gt;''Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court'', 450 U.S. 464 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In that state, it was found that two thirds of babies born to school-age mothers were fathered by adult men.&lt;ref name="Landry" /&gt;

&lt;!-- EFFECT OF PRIOR SEXUAL ABUSE ON PREGNANCY--&gt;
Sexual abuse early in life can lead young women to feel a lack of control over their sexual lives, decrease their future likelihood of using [[contraceptive]]s such as condoms, and increase their chances of becoming pregnant or acquiring [[sexually transmitted infections]].{{sfn|Krug|2002|p=162}} A 2007 paper by [[Child Trends]]&lt;ref name="child trends"&gt;[http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/childhood.pdf Childhood sexual abuse and teen pregnancy: a white paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021041714/http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/childhood.pdf |date=21 October 2012 }} – Logan ''et al.'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; examined studies from 2000 to 2006 to identify links between sexual abuse and teenage pregnancy, starting with Blinn-Pike et al.'s 2002 [[metastudy]] of 15 studies since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lynn |last1=Blinn-Pike |first2=Thomas |last2=Berger |first3=Diane |last3=Kuschel |first4=Michael |last4=Kaplan |year=2002 |title=Is There a Causal Link between Maltreatment and Adolescent Pregnancy?

In [[Nicaragua]], between 2000 and 2010, around 172,500 births were recorded for girls under 14, representing around 13% of the 10.3 million births during that period.

Rape has been used as a weapon of [[psychological warfare]] for centuries, to terrorize, humiliate, and undermine the morale of the enemy. Rape was also used as an act of [[ethnic cleansing]] to produce babies that share the perpetrators' ethnicity.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|pp=1–2}} [[Forced pregnancy]] has been noted in places including [[Bangladesh]], [[Darfur]], and [[Bosnia]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}} More broadly, pregnancy commonly results from wartime rape that was perpetrated without the intention of impregnating the enemy, as has been found in conflicts in [[East Timor]], [[Liberia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Rwanda]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}}  [[Gita Sahgal]] of [[Amnesty International]] commented that, rather than being primarily about "spoils of war" or sexual gratification, rape is often used in ethnic conflicts as a way for attackers to perpetuate social control and redraw ethnic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/in_depth/4078677.stm |title=In Depth &amp;#124; How did rape become a weapon of war? |publisher=BBC News |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=4 March 2010 | first=Laura | last=Smith-Spark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may be born to women and girls forced to "marry" abductors and occupiers; this happened in the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]] and in the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]'s conflict in [[Uganda]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5, 94–95}}

Rape during war is recognized under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820]] as a war crime and a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/877066/Geneva-Conventions-as-discussed-in-rape-crime |title=Geneva Conventions as Discussed in Rape Crime |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Forced pregnancy" is specifically enumerated as a war crime and crime against humanity in the [[Rome Statute]], which was the "first international criminal tribunal ever officially to criminalize forced pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol18/iss3/6/ 2012 law-review paper].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- CHILDREN OF WAR RAPE --&gt;
Children born as the result of wartime rape may be identified with the enemy and grow up stigmatized and excluded by their communities; they may be denied basic rights or even killed before reaching adulthood.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}} Children are particularly at risk for such abuse when they are visibly identifiable as sharing half their ethnicity with the occupying forces, as in the case of half-Arab children of Darfuri women raped by [[janjaweed]] soldiers as part of the [[war in Darfur]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5}}  Children of war rape are also at risk due to neglect by traumatized mothers unable to provide sufficient care.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5}}

=== Rape of Nanking ===
In 1937 the Japanese army took over [[Nanking]], which at the time was the capital of China. In the resulting seven-week occupation known as the [[Rape of Nanking]], as many as 80,000 people were raped.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} Chinese women and girls of all ages were raped, mutilated, tortured, sexually enslaved, and killed; unknown numbers of them were left pregnant.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} Many pregnant Nanking women killed themselves in 1938, and others committed [[infanticide]] when their babies were born.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} During the rest of the 20th century there was no record of any Chinese woman acknowledging her child as having been born as a result of the Rape of Nanking.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}}

=== Bosnian War ===
{{main|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
During the 1992–95 [[Bosnian War]], pregnancy from rape was used to perpetrate [[genocide]]. There were reports of deliberately created "rape camps" intended to impregnate captive Muslim and Croatian women. Women were reported to have been kept in confinement until their pregnancies had advanced beyond a stage at which abortion would be safe.{{sfn|Hazelwood and Burgess|2009|p=34}} In the context of a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, such camps were intended to create a new generation of Serbian children.{{sfn|Hazelwood and Burgess|2009|p=34}} The women's group ''Tresnjevka'' claimed that more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run camps.&lt;ref name="Tresnjevka"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&amp;dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |pages=9–10 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm new Internationalist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817134853/http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm |date=17 August 2010 }} issue 244, June 1993.

== Treatment and outcomes==
Immediate post-rape protocols call 
for medical professionals to assess the likelihood that a victim will become pregnant in their assessment of the physical damage done to the woman. Protocol for gaining a history of the use of contraceptives, as a woman's use of [[birth control pills]] or other contraceptives before a rape affect her chance of becoming pregnant.{{sfn|Krug|2002|pp=162, 166}}  Treatment protocols also call for clinicians to provide access to [[emergency contraception]] and counseling on abortion in countries where it is legal.{{sfn|Krug|2002|p=166}}  High-dose estrogen pills were tried as an experimental treatment after rape in the 1960s, and in 1972 Canadian physician [[A.

&lt;!-- RAISING THE CHILD --&gt;
When a mother chooses to raise her child conceived in rape, the traumatic effect of the rape and the child's blood relationship to the rapist has the potential to create some psychological challenges, but the circumstance of conception is no guarantee to cause psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Palmer2012&gt;{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Brian |title=Should a Mother Tell Her Child He Was Conceived in a Rape? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/08/rape_and_pregnancy_is_it_best_to_tell_a_child_he_was_conceived_in_a_rape_.html |work=Slate |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prewitt-cnn/&gt;

== History ==
Children whose births result from rape have been killed by their mothers at various times in history. During ancient and medieval times, such [[infanticide]] was not prohibited (however, [[penance]] was expected of these mothers in medieval Europe).&lt;ref name=Solomon2012/&gt;

=== Law ===
In contrast to the modern scientific consensus that rape-induced pregnancies are no less likely than any other, beliefs that rape could not lead to pregnancy were widespread in both legal and medical opinion for centuries.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt; [[Galen]], an ancient Greek physician, believed that a woman must experience pleasure to release "seed" and become pregnant, and could not derive such pleasure from nonconsensual sex.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=155}} Galen's thinking influenced understanding from medieval England to [[Colonial America]].{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=155}}

[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|left|The Ancient Greek physician [[Galen]]'s belief that women could not conceive without pleasure influenced medical and legal thinking for centuries.]]
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] also believed that female pleasure played a central role in conception.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Female reproduction was, in many ways, viewed through the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence orgasm was required for conception.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;

Centuries later, in medieval Europe, the belief that pregnancy could not occur without consent was still standard; in fact, conception by a woman was considered a legitimate defense against charges of rape.&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt; The belief was codified in the medieval British law texts ''[[Fleta]]''&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt; and ''[[Britton (law)|Britton]]''. ''Britton'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the defendant confesses the fact, but says that the woman at the same time conceived by him, and can prove it, then our will is that it be adjudged no felony, because no woman can conceive if she does not consent."&lt;ref name="Nichols1865"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval literary scholar Corinne Saunders acknowledged a difficulty in determining how widely held was the belief that pregnancy implies consent, but concluded that it influenced "at least some justices", citing a 1313 case in Kent.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, Corinne J. (2001). ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England.'' D. S. Brewer, {{ISBN|978-0-85991-610-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1700s, scientists no longer universally accepted the view that pregnancy was impossible without pleasure, although this view was still common.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=2–3}} A 1795 British legal text, ''[[Hawkins' Treatise of Pleas of the Crown|Treatise of Pleas of the Crown]]'', disparaged the belief's legal utility and its biological veracity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Also it hath been said by some to be no rape to force a woman who conceives at the time; for it is said, that if she had not consented, she could not have conceived, but this opinion seems very questionable, not only because the previous violence is no way extenuated by such a subsequent consent, but also because, if it were necessary to shew that the woman did not conceive, the offender could not be tried till such time as it might appear whether she did or did not, and likewise because the philosophy of this notion may very well be doubted of."&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hawkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLBCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308 Treatise of Pleas of the Crown], seventh edition, p. 308 (London, 1795).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1814 British legal text ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' by [[Samuel Farr (physician)|Samuel Farr]] claimed that conception "probably" could not occur without a woman's "enjoyment", so that an "absolute rape" was unlikely to lead to pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Farr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTeHRzdCpJwC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=-ON8tpZavp&amp;dq=%22So%20that%20if%20an%20absolute%20rape%20were%20to%20be%22&amp;pg=PA25 Elements of Medical Jurisprudence], second edition, chapter IV (London, 1814). See also [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i1cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdid=book-i1cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdot=1 scanned original book].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the US in an 1820 court case in the [[Arkansas Territory]] a man pleaded not guilty to rape charges because the victim became pregnant, but the court rejected the argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The old notion that if the woman conceive, it could not be a rape, because she must have in such case have consented, is quite exploded.  Impregnation, it is well known, does not depend on the consciousness or volition of the female. If the uterine organs be in a condition favorable to impregnation, this may take place as readily as if the intercourse was voluntary."&lt;ref name="U.S. v. Dickinson, 1 Hempstead Reporter 1 (1820 Ark. Territory), at 2 n.1."&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. v. Dickinson, 1 Hempstead Reporter 1 (1820 Ark.

{{see also|Islam and rape|Islam and abortion#Rape}}
Historian Ian Talbot has written about how countries with [[Quran]]-based [[Sharia|Islamic codes]] on rape and pregnancy use Sura [[An-Nur]], verse 2, as a legal basis: "The law of evidence in all sexual crimes required either self-confession or the testimony of four upright (''salah'') Muslim males. In the case of a man, self-confession involved a verbal confession. For women however medical examinations and pregnancy arising from rape were admissible as proof of self-guilt."&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;Talbot Ian (1998). ''Pakistan: A Modern History.''

Pregnancy from rape is an [[ethics|ethical]] and [[morality|moral]] issue in the context of [[opposition to legal abortion]]. In recent decades, claims of the improbability of rape-induced pregnancy, reminiscent of historical beliefs,&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt; have again begun to play a role in political discourse surrounding abortion regulation in cases of rape, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ-21-08-2012&gt;Garance Franke-Ruta, [http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/analysis-a-canard-that-will-not-die-legitimate-rape-doesn-t-cause-pregnancy-20120820 Analysis — A Canard That Will Not Die: 'Legitimate Rape' Doesn't Cause Pregnancy], ''[[National Journal]]'' (21 August 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among female victims of partner violence who filed a protective order, 68% reported they were raped by their intimate partner and 20% reported a rape-related pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McFarlane J, Malecha A, Watson K, Gist J, Batten E, Hall I, Smith S | year = 2005 | title = Intimate partner sexual assault against women: Frequency, health consequences &amp; treatment outcomes | url = | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 105 | issue = 1| pages = 99–108 | doi=10.1097/01.aog.0000146641.98665.b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that rape reduces the chance of pregnancy have at times been made by referring to the fact that [[chronic stress]] can reduce a woman's fertility over a long term. However the current scientific consensus is that this is specific to long-term stress—the [[acute stress reaction]] that occurs during rape cannot "shut down ovulation that has already begun".&lt;ref name=CNN22-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt; In a 1972 article, physician and anti-abortion activist [[Fred Mecklenburg]] argued that pregnancy from rape is "extremely rare", adding that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape "will not [[ovulate]] even if she is 'scheduled' to".&lt;ref name="Mecklenburg"&gt;Mecklenburg, Fred E.

Related views have also been expressed by pro-life groups outside the United States.

In [[logic]], the semantic '''principle (or law) of bivalence''' states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one [[truth value]], either [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]].&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logic satisfying this principle is called a '''two-valued logic'''&lt;ref name="Goble2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bivalent logic'''.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürlimann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hürlimann|title=Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BThojvh-XUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=Gabler Verlag|isbn=978-3-8349-1493-4|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] may or may not possess. It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=vii|series=The handbook of the history of logic|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the law of the excluded middle ==

The principle of bivalence is related to  the [[law of excluded middle]] though the latter is a [[syntactic]] expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ &amp;not;P". The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.&lt;ref name="Priest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.

== Classical logic ==
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

Assigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];&lt;ref name="SørensenUrzyczyn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.

== Suszko's thesis ==
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Future contingents===
{{main|Problem of future contingents}}
A famous example&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:

: Imagine P refers to the statement "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."

The principle of bivalence here asserts:

: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.

Aristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===Vagueness===
Such puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

: This apple is red.&lt;ref&gt;Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: "This" as opposed to a more-vague "The". If "The" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell &amp; Whitehead observe that this " this " indicates "something given in sensation" and as such it shall be considered "elementary".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:

: This apple is red and it is not-red.

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (§64, pp.&amp;nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:

{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.

Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The third "truth value"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".}}

The following are his "strong tables":&lt;ref&gt;"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q &amp; R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R  " This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".

== Founders ==
The founders of Pro-Truth Pledge come from its mother organization, Intentional Insights. The behavior and social science methodologies behind the Pro-Truth Pledge were applied to the topic by Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, one of the founders of Intentional Insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/gleb-tsipursky-phd |title=Gleb Tsipursky Ph.D. |website=Psychology Today |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/which-politicians-should-we-trust-in-the-november-7_us_59e9b65ce4b0542ce4290cb5 |title=Which Politicians Should We Trust in the November 7 Election? |last=Tsipursky |first=Gleb |date=October 23, 2017 |website=Huffington Post |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters and impact ==
According to the project's home page, as of August 26, 2018, there are 8,374 signatories to the pledge, including 85 organizations, 625 government officials, and 850 public figures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.protruthpledge.org/ |title=Take the Pro-Truth Pledge |work=Pro-Truth Pledge |accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[Jonathan Haidt]], [[Michael Shermer]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Pierre Whalon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fugitive.com/2018/01/11/fugitive-watch-takes-the-pro-truth-pledge/ |title=Fugitive Watch Takes The Pro-Truth Pledge |date=January 11, 2018 |work=Fugitive Watch |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://community.cengage.com/t5/American-Government-Instructor/Tell-Students-About-the-Pro-Truth-Pledge/td-p/3089 |title=Tell Students About the Pro Truth Pledge |date=July 26, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pro-Truth Pledge has received media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/01/16/birds-the-same-feather-the-unmissable-link-between-ad-fraud-and-fake-news |title=Birds of the same feather: The unmissable link between ad fraud and fake news |work=The Drum |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
At least two peer-reviewed studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of taking the Pro-Truth Pledge.  

A study published in the  journal &lt;i&gt;Behavior and Social Issues&lt;/i&gt; examined the sharing of news-related content on Facebook before and after taking the pledge.  The findings "suggest that taking the PTP had a statistically significant effect on behavior change in favor of more truthful sharing on Facebook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/9127/7551 |title=FIGHTING FAKE NEWS AND POST-TRUTH POLITICS WITH BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE: THE PRO-TRUTH PLEDGE |accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Social and Political Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, used a different methodology and reached a similar conclusion: "taking the
pledge results in a statistically significant increase in alignment with the behaviors of the pledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/856/pdf |title=A Psychological Approach to Promoting Truth in Politics: The Pro-Truth Pledge |accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations and pledge-takers by geography ==
The pledge has been translated into Spanish, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Portuguese and German, but the map of the pledge takers shows that most (above 90%) of the pledge takers live in North America, mainly in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2017/07/11/taking-pro-truth-pledge/ |title=Taking the Pro-Truth Pledge |date=July 11, 2017 |work=Dispatches From the Culture Wars |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quasispecies model''' is a description of the process of the Darwinian [[evolution]] of certain [[self-replication|self-replicating]] entities within the framework of [[physical chemistry]]. A quasispecies is a large group or "'''cloud'''" of related [[genotype]]s that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent.  This is in contrast to a [[species]], which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Biebricher, C.K &amp; Eigen, M.|chapter=What is a Quasispecies|editor=Esteban Domingo|title=Quasispecies: Concept and Implications for Virology |publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-26395-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] or simple asexual organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es (see also [[viral quasispecies]]), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]]. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Eigen M, Schuster P |year=1979 |title=The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-09293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on initial work done by Eigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eigen |first=Manfred |date=October 1971 |title=Selforganization of matter and the evolution of biological macromolecules |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=465–523 |doi=10.1007/BF00623322 |pmid=4942363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simplified explanation==

When evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies.  (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive ''fidelity''.)  Evolutionarily, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations.  A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless.  Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other.  For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again.  Thus we can envision a "'''cloud'''" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud.  Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Quasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, MA, Martus G, Capel E, Parera M, Franco S, Nevot M (2012) Quasispecies Dynamics of RNA Viruses. In: Viruses: Essential Agents of Life, Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection===
In a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes.  If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species.  Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties.  Instead, what matters is the ''connectedness'' of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villarreal | first1 = L.P. | last2 = Witzany | first2 = G. | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking quasispecies theory: From fittest type to cooperative consortia | journal = World Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 70–79 | doi = 10.4331/wjbc.v4.i4.79 | pmid = 24340131 | pmc=3856310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on.  If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud.  If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.

===Application to biological research===

Quasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as [[HIV]] and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |last2=et. al. |year= |title=RNA virus populations as quasispecies |journal=Genetic Diversity of RNA Viruses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Domingo |first1=E. |year=2002 |title=Quasispecies theory in virology |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |pages=463–465 |doi= 10.1128/jvi.76.1.463-465.2002|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/1/463.full|pmc=135734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilke |year=2005 |title=Quasispecies theory in the context of population genetics |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=5 |pages=44 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-44 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/44|pmc=1208876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and [[Emmanuel David Tannenbaum]] to model the evolution of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannenbaum ED, Fontanari JF |year=2008 |title=A quasispecies approach to the evolution of sexual replication in unicellular organisms |journal=Theory Bioscience |volume=127 |pages=53–65 |doi=10.1007/s12064-008-0023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the [[Gard model]] for [[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross |first1=R. |last2=Fouxon |first2=I. |last3=Lancet |first3=D. |last4=Markovitch |first4=O. |year=2014 |title=Quasispecies in population of compositional assemblies |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=14 |pages=2623 |doi=10.1186/s12862-014-0265-1 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102125325/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |archivedate=January 2, 2015 |pmid=25547629 |pmc=4357159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.

==Formal background==

The model rests on four assumptions{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}:
# The self-replicating entities can be represented as sequences composed of a small number of building blocks—for example, sequences of RNA consisting of the four bases [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[uracil]].
# New sequences enter the system solely as the result of a copy process, either correct or erroneous, of other sequences that are already present.
# The substrates, or raw materials, necessary for ongoing replication are always present in sufficient quantity. Excess sequences are washed away in an outgoing flux.
# Sequences may decay into their building blocks. The probability of decay does not depend on the sequences' age; old sequences are just as likely to decay as young sequences.

In the quasispecies model, [[mutation]]s occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, [[natural selection|selection]] arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational "clouds" of closely related sequences, referred to as ''quasispecies''. In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuster P, Swetina J |date=November 1988 |title=Stationary mutant distributions and evolutionary optimization |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=50 |issue=6  |pages=635–660 |issn=0092-8240 |doi=10.1007/BF02460094 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Dordrecht |pmid=3219448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in ''in vitro'' RNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domingo E, Holland JJ |date=October 1997 |title=RNA virus mutations and fitness for survival |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=51 |pages=151–178  |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.51.1.151 |pmid=9343347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burch CL, Chao L |year=2000 |title=Evolvability of an RNA virus is determined by its mutational neighbourhood |journal=Nature |volume=406 |pages=625–628 |doi=10.1038/35020564 |pmid=10949302 |issue=6796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the [[Error threshold (evolution)|error threshold]], the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Mathematical description==

A simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; let there be  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  possible sequences and let there be &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; organisms with sequence ''i''. Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence ''i'', but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the [[probability]] that a ''j'' type parent will produce an ''i'' type organism. Then the [[Expected value|expected]] fraction of offspring generated by ''j'' type organisms that would be ''i'' type organisms is &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i q_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the total number of ''i''-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a death rate term &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is included so that:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}-D_i\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the ''n-th'' generation can be found by just taking the ''n-th'' power of '''W''' substituting it in place of '''W''' in the above formula.

This is just a [[system of linear equations]]. The usual way to solve such a system is to first [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalize]] the '''W''' matrix. Its diagonal entries will be [[eigenvalues]] corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be [[eigenvectors]] of the '''W''' matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies.  Assuming that the matrix '''W''' is a [[primitive matrix]] ([[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] and [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|aperiodic]]), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Note about primitive matrices ===

'''W''' being primitive means that for some integer &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, that the &lt;math&gt;n^{th} &lt;/math&gt; power of '''W''' is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive.  If '''W''' is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of '''W''') mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. '''W''' is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Alternative formulations===

The quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; and the old state &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by this difference,   &lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i = n'_i-n_i&lt;/math&gt; we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j-n_i&lt;/math&gt;

The quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n_i}{\sum_j n_j}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;x'_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n'_i}{\sum_j n'_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:

:&lt;math&gt;x'_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}x_j}{\sum_{ij} w_{ij}x_j}&lt;/math&gt;

or, for the continuum version:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i =\sum_j w_{ij}x_j-x_i\sum_{ij}w_{ij}x_j.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simple example===
The quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, &lt;math&gt;1-k&lt;/math&gt; replicas of themselves, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of each of the other two types, where &lt;math&gt;0\le k\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. The '''W''' matrix is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-k&amp;k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;1-k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;k&amp;1-k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagonalized matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W'}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1-2k&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-2k&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1+k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

And the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[Eigenvalue]] !! [[Eigenvector]]
|-
|1-2k || [0,-1,0,1]
|-
| 1-2k || [0,-1,1,0]
|-
| 1 || [1,0,0,0]
|-
| 1+k || [0,1,1,1]
|}

Only the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;1+k&lt;/math&gt; is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be &lt;math&gt;(1+k)^n&lt;/math&gt; and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive,  the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In [[philosophy]], '''rationalism''' is the [[epistemology|epistemological]] view that "regards [[reason]] as the chief source and test of knowledge"&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification".&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"&gt;Lacey, A.R. (1996), ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1st edition, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976. 2nd edition, 1986. 3rd edition, Routledge, London, UK, 1996. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, rationalism is defined as a [[methodology]] or a [[theory]] "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and [[deductive]]".&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"&gt;Bourke, Vernon J., "Rationalism," p. 263 in Runes (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an old controversy, rationalism was opposed to [[empiricism]], where the rationalists believed that reality has an intrinsically logical structure. Because of this, the rationalists argued that certain truths exist and that the intellect can directly grasp these truths. That is to say, rationalists asserted that certain rational principles exist in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]] that are so fundamentally true that denying them causes one to fall into contradiction. The rationalists had such a high confidence in reason that empirical proof and physical evidence were regarded as unnecessary to ascertain certain truths – in other words, "there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience".&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Rationalism vs. Empiricism] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position "that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge" to the more extreme position that reason is "the unique path to knowledge".&lt;ref name="Audi 771"&gt;Audi, Robert, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition, 1999, p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to [[philosophy]], the [[Socrates|Socratic]] life of inquiry, or the zetetic ([[Skepticism|skeptical]]) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, [[Leo Strauss]] sought to revive "Classical Political Rationalism" as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as [[Maieutics|maieutic]].

In [[politics]], rationalism, since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], historically emphasized a "politics of reason" centered upon [[rational choice]], [[utilitarianism]], [[secularism]], and [[irreligion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.isi.org/catalog/resource/view/id/678 Oakeshott, Michael,"Rationalism in Politics," ''The Cambridge Journal'' 1947, vol. 1] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the latter aspect's [[antitheism]] was later softened by the adoption of pluralistic methods practicable regardless of religious or irreligious ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usj.sagepub.com/content/43/5-6/863.abstract Boyd, Richard, "The Value of Civility?," ''Urban Studies Journal'', May 2006, vol. 43 (no. 5–6), pp. 863–78] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, the philosopher [[John Cottingham]]&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John. 1984. Rationalism. Paladi/Granada&lt;/ref&gt; noted how rationalism, a [[methodology]], became socially conflated with [[atheism]], a [[worldview]]:
{{quote|In the past, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term 'rationalist' was often used to refer to free thinkers of an anti-clerical and anti-religious outlook, and for a time the word acquired a distinctly pejorative force (thus in 1670 Sanderson spoke disparagingly of 'a mere rationalist, that is to say in plain English an atheist of the late edition...'). The use of the label 'rationalist' to characterize a world outlook which has no place for the supernatural is becoming less popular today; terms like '[[secular humanist|humanist]]' or '[[materialism|materialist]]' seem largely to have taken its place. But the old usage still survives.}}

==Philosophical usage==
Rationalism is often contrasted with [[empiricism]]. Taken very broadly these views are not mutually exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist.&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"/&gt; Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']], that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]&amp;nbsp;– through the use of logic&amp;nbsp;– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as [[Galen Strawson]] once wrote, "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref&gt;Sommers (2003), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of [[epistemology]], their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the [[theory of justification]].

===Theory of justification===
{{Main|Theory of justification}}

The theory of justification is the part of [[epistemology]] that attempts to understand the justification of [[propositions]] and [[belief]]s. Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief, which include the ideas of [[Formal proof|justification]], warrant, [[rationality]], and [[probability]]. Of these four terms, the term that has been most widely used and discussed by the early 21st century is "warrant". Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone (probably) holds a belief.

If "A" makes a claim, and "B" then casts doubt on it, "A"'s next move would normally be to provide justification. The precise method one uses to provide justification is where the lines are drawn between rationalism and empiricism (among other philosophical views). Much of the debate in these fields are focused on [[Philosophical analysis|analyzing]] the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[Formal proof|justification]].

===Thesis of rationalism===
At its core, rationalism consists of three basic claims. For one to consider themselves a rationalist, they must adopt at least one of these three claims: The Intuition/Deduction Thesis, The Innate Knowledge Thesis, or The Innate Concept Thesis. In addition, rationalists can choose to adopt the claims of Indispensability of Reason and or the Superiority of Reason – although one can be a rationalist without adopting either thesis.

====The Intuition/Deduction Thesis====
{{Main|Intuition (philosophy)|Deductive reasoning}}

Rationale: ''"Some propositions in a particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone; still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions."''&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#2 The Intuition/Deduction Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, intuition is [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge or experiential belief characterized by its immediacy; a form of rational insight. We simply "see" something in such a way as to give us a warranted belief. Beyond that, the nature of intuition is hotly debated.

In the same way, generally speaking, deduction is the process of [[reasoning]] from one or more general [[premise]]s to reach a logically certain conclusion. Using valid [[argument]]s, we can deduce from intuited premises.

For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit that the number three is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, it can be said that intuition and deduction combined to provide us with ''a priori'' knowledge – we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.

Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] have been willing to accept this thesis for describing the relationships among our own concepts.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt; In this sense, empiricists argue that we are allowed to intuit and deduce truths from knowledge that has been obtained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']].

By injecting different subjects into the Intuition/Deduction thesis, we are able to generate different arguments. Most rationalists agree [[mathematics]] is knowable by applying the intuition and deduction. Some go further to include [[Ethics|ethical truths]] into the category of things knowable by intuition and deduction. Furthermore, some rationalists also claim [[metaphysics]] is knowable in this thesis.

In addition to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary the strength of their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant. Some rationalists understand warranted beliefs to be beyond even the slightest doubt; others are more conservative and understand the warrant to be belief beyond a reasonable doubt.

Rationalists also have different understanding and claims involving the connection between intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition is not always a source of certain knowledge&amp;nbsp;– thus allowing for the possibility of a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in the same way a third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.

Naturally, the more subjects the rationalists claim to be knowable by the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the more certain they are of their warranted beliefs, and the more strictly they adhere to the infallibility of intuition, the more controversial their truths or claims and the more radical their rationalism.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt;

To argue in favor of this thesis, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], a prominent German philosopher, says, "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…"&lt;ref&gt;1704, Gottfried Leibniz Preface, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Innate Knowledge Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have knowledge of some truths in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#3 The Innate Knowledge Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Innate Knowledge thesis is similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim [[knowledge]] is gained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.

This thesis targets a problem with the nature of inquiry originally postulated by [[Plato]] in ''[[Meno]]''. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Meno, 80d–e&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems."&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"/&gt; The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this [[paradox]]. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either [[Consciousness|consciously]] or [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], a rationalist claims we don't really "learn" things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.

====The Innate Concept Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have some of the concepts we employ in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#4 The Innate Concept Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis suggests that some concepts are simply part of our rational nature. These concepts are [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] in nature and sense experience is irrelevant to determining the nature of these concepts (though, sense experience can help bring the concepts to our [[Consciousness|conscious mind]]).

Some philosophers, such as [[John Locke]] (who is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and an [[Empiricism|empiricist]]) argue that the Innate Knowledge thesis and the Innate Concept thesis are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Concerning Human Understanding, Book I, Ch. III, par. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, such as [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], argue that the two theses are distinct from one another. As with the other theses covered under the umbrella of rationalism, the more types and greater number of concepts a philosopher claims to be innate, the more controversial and radical their position; "the more a concept seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our concept of the latter.&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"/&gt;

In his book, ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwiTTpwasgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor1-first= J. |editor1-last=Cottingham |date=April 1996 |origyear= 1986 |edition= revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-55818-1 |title= Meditations on First Philosophy With Selections from the Objections and Replies }}&amp;nbsp;–The original ''Meditations'', translated, in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] postulates three classifications for our [[idea]]s when he says, "Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly, [[siren (mythology)|siren]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[hippogriff]]s and the like are my own invention."&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes AT VII 37–8; CSM II 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventitious ideas are those concepts that we gain through sense experiences, ideas such as the sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot [[Will (philosophy)|will]] away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in [[mythology]], [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of [[perfection]], are those ideas we have as a result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] defends the idea of innate concepts by suggesting the mind plays a role in determining the nature of concepts, to explain this, he likens the mind to a block of marble in the ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', "This is why I have taken as an illustration a block of veined marble, rather than a wholly uniform block or blank tablets, that is to say what is called tabula rasa in the language of the philosophers. For if the soul were like those blank tablets, truths would be in us in the same way as the figure of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the marble is completely indifferent whether it receives this or some other figure. But if there were veins in the stone which marked out the figure of Hercules rather than other figures, this stone would be more determined thereto, and Hercules would be as it were in some manner innate in it, although labour would be needed to uncover the veins, and to clear them by polishing, and by cutting away what prevents them from appearing. It is in this way that ideas and truths are innate in us, like natural inclinations and dispositions, natural habits or potentialities, and not like activities, although these potentialities are always accompanied by some activities which correspond to them, though they are often imperceptible."&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1704, New Essays on human Understanding, Preface, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

====The other two theses====
The three aforementioned theses of Intuition/Deduction, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept are the cornerstones of rationalism. To be considered a rationalist, one must adopt at least one of those three claims. The following two theses are traditionally adopted by rationalists, but they aren't essential to the rationalist's position.

'''The Indispensability of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, "The knowledge we gain in subject area, ''S'', by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas and instances of knowledge in ''S'' that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience."&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In short, this thesis claims that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.

'''The Superiority of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, '"The knowledge we gain in subject area ''S'' by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior to any knowledge gained by sense experience".&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In other words, this thesis claims reason is superior to experience as a source for knowledge.

In addition to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this [[foundational knowledge]] to know more truths.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt;

==Background==
Rationalism - as an appeal to human reason as a way of obtaining knowledge - has a philosophical history dating from antiquity. The [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] nature of much of philosophical enquiry, the awareness of apparently [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] domains of knowledge such as mathematics, combined with the emphasis of obtaining knowledge through the use of rational faculties (commonly rejecting, for example, direct [[revelation]]) have made rationalist themes very prevalent in the history of philosophy.

Since the Enlightenment, rationalism is usually associated with the introduction of mathematical methods into philosophy as seen in the works of [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"/&gt; This is commonly called '''continental rationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, because it was predominant in the continental schools of Europe, whereas in Britain [[empiricism]] dominated.

Even then, the distinction between rationalists and empiricists was drawn at a later period and would not have been recognized by the philosophers involved. Also, the distinction between the two philosophies is not as clear-cut as is sometimes suggested; for example, Descartes and Locke have similar views about the nature of human ideas.&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"/&gt;

Proponents of some varieties of rationalism argue that, starting with foundational basic principles, like the axioms of [[geometry]], one could [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] derive the rest of all possible knowledge. The philosophers who held this view most clearly were [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], whose attempts to grapple with the epistemological and metaphysical problems raised by Descartes led to a development of the fundamental approach of rationalism. Both Spinoza and Leibniz asserted that, ''in principle'', all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, could be gained through the use of reason alone, though they both observed that this was not possible ''in practice'' for human beings except in specific areas such as [[mathematics]]. On the other hand, Leibniz admitted in his book ''[[Monadology]]'' that "we are all mere [[Empirics]] in three fourths of our actions."&lt;ref name="Audi 771"/&gt;

==History==
===Rationalist philosophy from antiquity===
Although rationalism in its modern form post-dates antiquity, philosophers from this time laid down the foundations of rationalism. {{Cn|date=April 2018}} In particular, the understanding that we may be aware of knowledge available only through the use of rational thought. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

====Ajita Kesakambali (600 BCE)====
[[Ajita Kesakambali]] was an ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] philosopher in the 6th century BCE. He is considered to be the first known proponent of Indian materialism, and forerunner to the [[Charvaka]] school of Indian thought, which holds [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, embraces [[philosophical skepticism]] and rejects Vedas, [[Vedic ritualism]], and [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pythagoras (570–495 BCE)====
{{Main|Pythagoras}}
Pythagoras was one of the first Western philosophers to stress rationalist insight.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68592/History-of-rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often revered as a great [[mathematician]], [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[scientist]], but he is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which bears his name, and for discovering the mathematical relationship between the length of strings on lute and the pitches of the notes. Pythagoras "believed these harmonies reflected the ultimate nature of reality. He summed up the implied metaphysical rationalism in the words "All is number". It is probable that he had caught the rationalist's vision, later seen by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1564–1642), of a world governed throughout by mathematically formulable laws".&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; It has been said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plato (427–347 BCE)====
{{Main|Plato}}
Plato held rational insight to a very high standard, as is seen in his works such as [[Meno]] and [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]. He taught on the [[Theory of Forms]] (or the Theory of Ideas)&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas," but the latter has a long and respected tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too. See W D Ross, Plato's Theory of Ideas (1951) and [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php this] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }} reference site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Forms:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}...., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | pages=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself." See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that the highest and most fundamental kind of reality is not the material world of change [[allegory of the cave|known to us through sensation]],  but rather the abstract, non-material  (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) world of forms (or ideas).&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.'' [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php Plato's theory of forms (or ideas)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, these forms were accessible only to reason and not to sense.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; In fact, it is said that Plato admired reason, especially in [[geometry]], so highly that he had the phrase "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter" inscribed over the door to his academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq009.htm|title=Plato FAQ: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter"|first=Bernard F.|last=SUZANNE|website=plato-dialogues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle (384–322 BCE)====
{{Main|Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s main contribution to rationalist thinking was the use of [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic and its use in argument. Aristotle defines syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Prior Analytics'', 24b18–20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this very general definition, Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms which consist of three [[categorical proposition]]s in his work ''[[Prior Analytics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#SynSemSen] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Non-Modal Syllogistic&lt;/ref&gt; These included categorical [[modal logic|modal]] syllogisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Modal Logic&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-Aristotle====
Although the three great Greek philosophers disagreed with one another on specific points, they all agreed that rational thought could bring to light knowledge that was self-evident – information that humans otherwise couldn't know without the use of reason. After Aristotle's death, Western rationalistic thought was generally characterized by its application to theology, such as in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]] and Jewish philosopher and theologian [[Maimonides]]. One notable event in the Western timeline was the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who attempted to merge Greek rationalism and Christian revelation in the thirteenth-century.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt;

===Classical rationalism===
Early modern rationalism has its roots in the 17th-century [[Dutch Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavaert, Sonja; Schröder, Winfried: ''The Dutch Legacy: Radical Thinkers of the 17th Century and the Enlightenment''. (BRILL, 2016, {{ISBN|978-9004332072}})&lt;/ref&gt; with some notable intellectual representatives like [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref&gt;Berolzheimer, Fritz: ''The World's Legal Philosophies''. Translated by Rachel Szold. (New York: The MacMillan Co., 1929. lv, 490 pp. Reprinted 2002 by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd). As [[Fritz Berolzheimer]] noted, "As the Cartesian "cogito ergo sum" became the point of departure of rationalistic philosophy, so the establishment of government and law upon reason made Hugo Grotius the founder of an independent and purely rationalistic system of [[natural law]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]], and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

====René Descartes (1596–1650)====
{{Main|René Descartes}}
Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy.' Much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp. 511, 516–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002) p. 76 "Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard A. |last1=Watson |authorlink1=Richard Watson (philosopher) |title=René Descartes |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |date=31 March 2012 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158787/Rene-Descartes |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are studied closely to this day.

Descartes thought that only knowledge of eternal truths{{spaced ndash}} including the truths of mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the sciences{{spaced ndash}} could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the [[scientific method]]. He also argued that although [[dream]]s appear as real as [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge. Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about sensory reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or [[reason]]) can be classified as knowledge. These truths are gained "without any sensory experience," according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive process, will result in clear truths about reality.

Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the senses. For instance, his famous dictum, ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' or "I think, therefore I am", is a conclusion reached ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' i.e., prior to any kind of experience on the matter. The simple meaning is that doubting one's existence, in and of itself, proves that an "I" exists to do the thinking. In other words, doubting one's own doubting is absurd.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in modern philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68594/Epistemological-rationalism-in-modern-philosophies|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was, for Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], distinguishing between the substances of the human body ("''res extensa''") and the [[mind]] or soul ("''res cogitans''"). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved and lead to what is known as the [[mind-body problem]], since the two substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and irreducible.

====Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716)====
{{Main|Gottfried Leibniz}}
Leibniz was the last of the great Rationalists who contributed heavily to other fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[jurisprudence]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]; he is also considered to be one of the last "universal geniuses".&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz "&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz].&lt;/ref&gt; He did not develop his system, however, independently of these advances. Leibniz rejected Cartesian dualism and denied the existence of a material world. In Leibniz's view there are infinitely many simple substances, which he called "[[Monadology|monads]]" (possibly taking the term from the work of [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway|Anne Conway]]).

Leibniz developed his theory of monads in response to both Descartes and [[Spinoza]], because the rejection of their visions forced him to arrive at his own solution. Monads are the fundamental unit of reality, according to Leibniz, constituting both inanimate and animate objects. These units of reality represent the universe, though they are not subject to the laws of causality or space (which he called "[[well-founded phenomenon|well-founded phenomena]]"). Leibniz, therefore, introduced his principle of [[pre-established harmony]] to account for apparent causality in the world.

====Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)====
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
Kant is one of the central figures of modern [[philosophy]], and set the terms by which all subsequent thinkers have had to grapple. He argued that human perception structures natural laws, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to hold a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/ |title=Immanuel Kant (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant named his brand of epistemology "[[Transcendental Idealism]]", and he first laid out these views in his famous work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason|The Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those things that are necessarily beyond the realm of all possible experience: the [[existence of God]], free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as "The Thing in Itself" and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. "In Kant's views, [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/rationalism.html Excerpt from the Encyclopædia Britannica]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary rationalism===
Rationalism has become a rarer label ''tout court'' of philosophers today; rather many different kinds of specialised rationalisms are identified. For example, [[Robert Brandom]] has appropriated the terms [[rationalist expressivism]] and [[rationalist pragmatism]] as labels for aspects of his programme in ''Articulating Reasons'', and identified [[linguistic rationalism]], the claim that the content of propositions "are essentially what can serve as both premises and conclusions of inferences", as a key thesis of [[Wilfred Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;''Articulating reasons'', 2000. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
Rationalism was criticized by [[William James]] for being out of touch with reality. James also criticized rationalism for representing the universe as a closed system, which contrasts to his view that the universe is an open system.&lt;ref name="pragmatism"&gt;{{cite speech|last=James|first=William|date=November 1906|location=Lowell Institute|title=The Present Dilemma in Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4820">'''Respect for persons''' is the concept that all people deserve the right to fully exercise their [[autonomy]]. Showing respect for persons is a system for interaction in which one entity ensures that another has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to be able to make a [[choice]].

This concept is usually discussed in the context of [[research ethics]]. It is one of the three basic principles of research ethics stated in the [[Belmont Report]] issued by the Office of Human Subject Research; it comprises two essential moral requirements: to recognize the right for autonomy and to protect individuals who are disadvantaged to the extent that they cannot practice this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research |location=[[Washington, DC]] |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html#gob1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013513/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autonomous person is defined as an individual who is capable of self-legislation and is able to make judgments and actions based on his/her particular set of values, preferences, and beliefs. Respecting a person’s autonomy thus involves considering his/her choices and decisions without deliberate obstruction. It also requires that subjects be treated in a non-degrading manner out of respect for their dignity. In practice, respect for persons is operationalized by obtaining [[Informed Consent]] from all individuals who are going to be research subjects.

==Vulnerable populations==
The standard case for applying respect for persons is when the person receiving the health intervention is of sound mind, fit to make personal decisions, and empowered to choose from various options. Other cases involve showing respect to people who for whatever reason are not free to choose among the typical range of options when making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = D. | last2 = Moore-Cox | first2 = A. | last3 = Xavier | first3 = D. | last4 = Lauzier | first4 = F. | last5 = Roberts | first5 = I. | title = Randomized Trials in Vulnerable Populations | doi = 10.1177/1740774507087552 | journal = Clinical Trials | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–69 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18283082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and regulation of clinical research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical research ethics, the term Vulnerable Populations generally refers to individuals whose situations do not allow them to protect their own interests. The categories of individuals that constitute Vulnerable Populations are outlined under The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subparts A-D). These include individuals who are minors, prisoners, pregnant, physically handicapped, mentally disabled, old, economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged, or subordinates in hierarchical groups (e.g. a soldier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Geneva, Switzerland, 2002|url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823205120/http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These individuals are entitled to protection, and additional ethical justification is needed to involve such populations in human subject studies. In such cases, a balance should be established between protecting subjects from exploitation and depriving these subjects of access to the potential benefits of research.

Reasons justifying the participation of these subjects would include that some studies could not be carried out without a vulnerable population. Another justification would be that the aim of the study is to gain knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diseases associated specifically with that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''round-robin story''', or simply "round robin," is a type of [[collaborative fiction]] or [[storytelling]] in which a number of authors write chapters of a novel or pieces of a story, in rounds. Round-robin novels were invented in the 19th century, and later became a tradition particularly in [[science fiction]]. In modern usage, the term often applies to collaborative [[fan fiction]], particularly on the [[Internet]], though it can also refer to friends or family telling stories at a [[sleepover]], around a [[campfire]], etc.

Innovations conventionally associated with terrestrially first appeared in aquatic [[elpistostegalians]] such as ''[[Panderichthys]] rhombolepis'', ''[[Elpistostege]] watsoni'', and ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]''. Phylogenetic analyses distribute the features that developed along the tetrapod stem and display a stepwise process of character acquisition, rather than abrupt.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J.

By the [[Upper Devonian]] period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., &amp; Ruta, M.

Evolution and Development 4(5), 390–396. doi:10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02026.x&lt;/ref&gt; As aquatic tetrapods began their transition to land, several skeletal changes are thought to have occurred to allow for movement and respiration on land. Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism’s base to generate propulsive force required for walking.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., &amp; Hale, M.E.

[[File:Osteolepis BW.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Restoration of ''Osteolepis'']] 

The [[Osteolepiformes]] and Elpistostegalia are two crown groups of rhipidistians with respect to the tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of skull roof and cheekbone patterns in these organisms match those found in the first tetrapods. Palatal and nasal skeletal features like choanae are present in these groups and are also observed in modern amphibians. This indicates that incipient air breathing was developed, as well as modification of the hyoid arch towards stapes development.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics account for why osteichthyans are accepted as the sister group of tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elpistostegalid fish are considered the most apomorphic of fish in comparison to tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*.

Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of eye ridges and flatting of the skull are also observed in primitive fossil amphibians and reptiles. The most likely reason for the traits to be adaptive was for their use in aerial vision above the waterline.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The traits enabled animals to check area on land for safe spots if being chased by a predator in water, as well as being useful for searching for prey items above the water. The water-based [[lateral line system]] was used substantially by these aquatic tetrapods to detect danger from predators.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Osteichthyan diversification, there were no changes related to respiration in the transition as can be seen by the nasal region and palatal morphology in elpistostegalid fishes. The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.&lt;ref&gt;LONG, J. A. (1990).

=== Head changes in prototetrapod ===

[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Elginerpeton'']]

In ''[[Elginerpeton pancheni]]'', a prototetrapod from the late [[Frasnian]], basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The ''Elginerpeton'' is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tubular lower jaw of the ''Elginerpeton'', compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting – allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004).

=== Head changes in aquatic tetrapods ===
[[File:Acanthostega BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Acanthostega'']] 
In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle [[Famennian]] there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, O. A., &amp; Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Acanthostega'', it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, M.

There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian.

The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002).

Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.&lt;ref name=Lauder&gt;Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates. This technique does not function in air so animals use methods of overtaking prey with jaws followed by biting down.&lt;ref&gt;Bramble, D. M., Liem, K. F., &amp; Wake, D. B. (1985). Functional vertebrate morphology (pp. 38-57). Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional forms prior to fully developed terrestrial tetrapods such as ''Acanthostega'', are thought to have captured prey in the water.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Large coronoid fangs are present in the fishes ''Eusthenopteron'', ''Panderichthys'', and ''Tiktaalik'', and the early tetrapod, ''Ventasega''. In ''Acanthostega'', which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In ''Eusthenopetron'' and ''Panderichthys'', an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the ''Tiktaalik'', ''Ventastega'', and ''Acanthostega''. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological data is not enough however to prove that suction feeding was less used as the morphological changes have been found in fish that use the suction feeding mechanism.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian.

Cranial sutures are indicators of skull function and morphologies can be linked to specific feeding modes.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. W., &amp; Mucci, R. J. (1991). In vivo strain in cranial sutures: the zygomatic arch. Journal of morphology, 207(3), 225-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows for the creation of a sutural morphospace.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish ''[[Polypterus]]'': implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in ''Polypterus'', a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod ''[[Phonerpeton]]'', there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. ''Acanthostega'' fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neck ==
The cranial endoskeleton of ''T. roseae'' shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in ''T. roseae'' compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., &amp; Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish–tetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbs ==

Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.&lt;ref name=hinch&gt;Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have originated in the group [[Sarcopterygians]], including osteolipiforms like ''Eusthenopteron'', due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton.&lt;ref name=hinch /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, ''Panderichthys'' and ''Eusthenopteron''.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Like ''Panderichthys'',  the humerus of ''Acanthostega'' is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Similar to ''Eusthenopteron'', the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;  ''Acanthostega'' also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than ''Acanthostega'' on the phylogeny.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Unlike ''Panderichthys'', ''Acanthostega'' hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Similarly, ''Ossinodus'' has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossinodus'' also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to ''Acanthostega'', and is thought to be only partially terrestrial.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pelvis ==
The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Protopterus]] annectens'' (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with ''Acanthostega'' and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

== Digits and Limb Joints ==

''Acanthostega'' is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; ''Acanthostega'' has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool-shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods.

''[[Pederpes]]'', a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, ''Pederpes'' has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in ''Pederpes'', allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish ''Pederpes'' the first true terrestrial tetrapod.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The idea of a '''sphere-world''' was constructed by [[Henri Poincaré]] who, while pursuing his argument for [[conventionalism]] (see [[philosophy of space and time]]),  offered a [[thought experiment]] about a [[sphere]] with strange properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poincaré|first1=Henri|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37157|via=[[Project Gutenberg]]|title=Science and hypothesis|date=1952|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=0486602214|page=51|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
Poincaré asks us to imagine a sphere of radius ''R''.  The temperature of the sphere decreases from its maximum at the center to absolute zero at its extremity such that a body’s temperature at a distance ''r'' from the center is proportional to &lt;math&gt;R^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, all bodies have the same [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient of dilatation]] so every body shrinks and expands in similar proportion as they move about the sphere.  To finish the story, Poincaré states that the [[refractive index|index of refraction]] will also vary with the distance ''r'', in [[inverse proportion]] to &lt;math&gt;R^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

How will this world look to inhabitants of this sphere? 

In many ways it will look ''normal''. Bodies will remain intact upon transfer from place to place, as well as seeming to remain the same size (the Spherians would shrink along with them).  The geometry, on the other hand, would seem quite different.  Supposing the inhabitants were to view rods believed to be rigid, or measure [[distance]] with [[light beam|light rays]]. They would find that a [[geodesic]] is not a straight line, and that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius is greater than &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

These inhabitants would in fact determine that their universe is not ruled by [[Euclidean geometry]], but instead by [[hyperbolic geometry]].

==Commentary==

This [[thought experiment]] is discussed in [[Roberto Torretti]]'s book ''Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torretti|first1=Roberto|title=Philosophy of geometry from Riemann to Poincaré|date=1984|publisher=D. Reidel Pub. Co.|location=Dordrecht, Holland|isbn=9027709203|page=320|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Jeremy Gray]]'s article "Epistemology of Geometry" in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epistemology of Geometry |author1=Jeremy Gray|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-geometry/|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sphere-world is also described in [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book ''[[Flatterland]]'' (chapter 10, Platterland).

'''Sustainable automotive air conditioning''' is the subject of a debate – nicknamed the ''Cool War'' – about the next-generation [[refrigerant]] in car [[air conditioning]]. The '''Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions''' supports the uptake of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a refrigerant in passenger cars, and the chemical industry is developing new chemical blends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/the_choice.pdf The Choice Today - New Chemical Blends or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance and its supporters – scientists, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and business leaders – urge the car industry to replace high global warming chemical substances with the [[natural refrigerant]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[R744]]/ R-744) in car cooling and heating. This, they argue, would lead to 10% less car emissions, and knock out 1% of total [[greenhouse gas]] emissions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/challenge.pdf Car Air Conditioning &amp; the Climate Change Challenge - Made Simple]&lt;/ref&gt; If CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is applied in other sectors, such as commercial and industrial refrigeration, heat pumps for water heating etc., it may even save up to 3% of the world’s greenhouse gases.

Opponents of the Alliance claim that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is not cost-efficient and safe, hence seeking to postpone the global industry decision to be taken to develop new chemical blends instead.

==Background==
The Cool War has emanated from the decision of the European Union to phase out the current high global warming refrigerant [[HFC-134a]] in car air conditioning from January 2011 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_161/l_16120060614en00120018.pdf European Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with the legislation, carmakers have to decide today on a new refrigerant, as they typically need 3–4 years to develop and introduce a new car platform including the air conditioning system. (It would take much less time to design merely a new air conditioning system to install in a new version of an existing model.) The current total value of the car air conditioning market is estimated to be $14.5 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A shift in car air conditioning technology – Carbon Dioxide Refrigerant|url=http://www.autoairconparts.co.uk/blog/a-shift-in-car-air-conditioning-technology-carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/|publisher=www.autoairconparts.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions and its supporters agree that the refrigerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

*More environmentally friendly with the lowest [[Global warming potential]] (GWP) of all currently used and proposed refrigerants. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not deplete the ozone layer. Since the carbon dioxide used in car air conditioning is a recycled industrial waste product it becomes environmentally neutral.  Overall, using a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based air conditioning system will reduce total car emissions by 10%, thereby sparing the planet 1% of total greenhouse gases.{{cn|date=February 2016}}
*More technically ready because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models have been developed and tested in all climates, being now ready for mass production. They are faster to heat and cool a car, and show a superior performance in over 90% of all driving conditions.
*More cost-efficient because as a refrigerant itself, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is cheap and worldwide available. The servicing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be less costly and less complicated than that for present systems. For the consumer the total cost of ownership is lowest with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as it will significantly cut fuel consumption by the air conditioning device. Carmakers have to make an initial investment estimated at €20 per unit, with no additional costs once CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology enters into mass production.
*Usable in Heat Pumps because at least one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system under development can act as a [[heat pump]], supplying cabin heat and windshield defrosting even before the engine has warmed up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html Visteon's R744 system] {{cite web | url=http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | title=Feature Stories-Company-R744 Climate System | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114205439/http://visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | archivedate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although the Alliance may not mention it, since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is so cheap and relatively harmless to the environment, the reservoirs in such systems could store additional liquid R744 to keep a vehicle cool even when the engine (or compressor) was not running.

===Arguments against CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology requires the design of completely new high-pressure systems whereas so-called "drop-in solutions" (the adaptation of current systems to new substances) are potentially more cost-efficient. 

The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions claims, however that the initial costs of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be around €5 higher than drop-in solutions and that over a car’s life cycle, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; air conditioning systems will be more cost-efficient than any currently used or proposed new chemical blends. (see [[#Arguments_for_CO2|Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).
{{CO2}} has been classified as Safety Class A1 (low-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant) by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/ASHRAE_standard.pdf ASHRAE Standard 34]&lt;/ref&gt; – the highest safety class possible.  As the charge of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the air conditioning systems is very small (200-400 g) there is no realistic danger for the passengers, even in case of accidental release.

===Arguments for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===

*Refrigerants such as the greenpeace-developed '[[isobutane#Uses|Greenfreeze]]', based on purified [[butane]]/[[propane]] mixtures, are entirely 'natural', and due to increased efficiency over refrigerants such as [[R134a]], allow the use of very small amounts of refrigerant to be used.
*Use of pure hydrocarbon refrigerants, which are 'backward compatible' with even early [[Freon]] (R-12) car air conditioning systems, would allow these systems to be easily converted (without modification), increasing their efficiency, and preventing further release of harmful R-134a and R-12 to the atmosphere.

===Arguments against non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===
Butane and propane are very flammable petroleum products; they are used as fuels for gas [[barbecue]] grills, disposable lighters, etc. Like gasoline, to which it chemically is closely related, propane has a tendency to explode if mixed with oxygen and ignited in an enclosed container.&lt;!-- The next remark is so dubious that I am removing it unless or until a source for the claim is found: However the small quantities should make this risk minimal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}--&gt;

The use of highly flammable hydrocarbon gases such as butane and propane as automotive refrigerants raises serious safety concerns.  The EPA, in evaluating motor vehicle air conditioning substitutes for CFC-12 (Freon, or R-12) under its SNAP program, has classified as "Unacceptable Substitutes" other "Flammable blend[s] of hydrocarbons" by reason of "insufficient data to demonstrate safety."  The EPA defines "Unacceptable" in this context as "illegal for use as a CFC-12 substitute in motor vehicle air conditioners".  All of the refrigerants which EPA approved for motor vehicle use in place of CFC-12 (as of 28 September 2006) contain no more than 4% total flammable hydrocarbons (butane, isobutane, and/or isopentane).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/macssubs.html#otherinfo EPA: Choosing and Using Alternative Refrigerants for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it appears unlikely, for safety reasons, that EPA will approve 'Greenfreeze' or similar hydrocarbon-based refrigerants for automotive use.

==Latest and next steps==
In September 2007, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) officially announced its decision to use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the refrigerant in next-generation air conditioning. Other carmakers from Europe and the rest of the world may follow the German lead.

A working group at ACEA, the European carmakers’ association, was to be drafting a common position on the issue to be adopted across the whole industry by end-2007.

However, on 9 April 2009, German public television channel ARD aired a report claiming that VDA members would be using loopholes in the law to avoid complying with the EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/articles/2009-04-10-german-tv-explains-car-industry-boycott-of-eu-law.php German TV explains car industry boycott of EU law]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2016, she became the first female lecturer to give a professorial inaugural lecture at Makerere University.

==Other considerations==
In March 2018, Makerere University selected Dr Tamale to chair a select committee to investigate "sexual harassment" at the public institution of higher learning.

'''Thomas Luckmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|m|ən}}; October 14, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American-Austrian sociologist of [[Germans|German]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] origin who taught mainly in [[Germany]]. His contributions were central to studies in sociology of communication, [[sociology of knowledge]], [[sociology of religion]], and the [[philosophy of science]].

== Biography ==

He was born in [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. His father was an [[Austria]]n industrialist, while his mother was from a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family from [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=L|date=2016|title=Social and communicative construction of reality - the memory of Thomas Luckmann|url=|journal=Sociologický Casopis|language=Czech|volume=52|pages=581–589|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, he was the cousin of the Slovene poet [[Božo Vodušek]].

During [[World War II]], in 1943, he and his mother moved to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944 he was drafted for the army,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endreß|first=Martin|date=2016|title=Thomas Luckmann (October 14, 1927–May 10, 2016)|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|journal=Human Studies|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=487–491|doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|issn=0163-8548|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the [[Luftwaffe]] where he served as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Luckmann: ''„Teilweise zufällig, teilweise, weil es doch Spaß macht“.'' In: Monika Wohlrab-Sahr (Hrsg.): ''Kultusoziologie: Paradigmen – Methoden – Fragestellungen''. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he became a [[prisoner of war]], and escaping after three months. He then settled in Vienna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luckmann studied [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] and [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950 he married Benita Petkevic, with whom he moved to the United States, where he studied at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The couple had three daughters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He worked as a professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Konstanz]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 to his retirement,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adam|first=F|last2=Čas|first2=B|date=2004|title=Utemeljitev za imenovanje dr.

He died at the age of 88 on May 10, 2016, at his home in Austria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Work  ==

Luckmann was a follower of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologically]] oriented school of [[sociology]], established by the Austrian-American scholar [[Alfred Schütz]]. He contributed to the foundation of phenomenological sociology, the sociology of religion in modern societies, and the sociology of knowledge and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his works, he developed the theory of [[social constructionism]], which argues that all knowledge, including the most basic common sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. Together with [[Peter L. Berger]], he wrote the book ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' in 1966. The book was an important part of the move in sociology, and partiuclarly the sociology of religion, away from the view of religion and religious values as central to [[Social order|the social order]], arguing that social order is socially constructed by individuals and/or groups of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767737455|title=Encyclopedia of global religion|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Juergensmeyer, Mark., Roof, Wade Clark.|isbn=9781452266565|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=767737455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he continued the work of Alfred Schütz, drawing on Schütz's notes and unfinished manuscripts to complete ''[[Structures of the Life-World]]'', published (posthumously for Schütz) in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Together with [[Richard Grathoff]] and Walter M. Sprondel, Luckmann founded the [[Social Science Archive Konstanz]] (also known as the Alfred Schütz Memorial Archives).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

|quote="Positive liberty... is a valid universal goal. I do not know why I should have been held to doubt this, or, for that matter, the further proposition, that democratic self-government is a fundamental human need, something valuable in itself, whether or not it clashes with the claims of negative liberty or of any other goal... What I am mainly concerned to establish is that, whatever may be the common ground between them, and whatever is liable to graver distortion, negative and positive liberty are not the same thing."

}}

"'''Two Concepts of Liberty'''" was the inaugural [[lecture]] delivered by the liberal philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] before the [[University of Oxford]] on 31 October 1958. It was subsequently published as a 57-page pamphlet by Oxford at the [[Clarendon Press]]. It also appears in the collection of Berlin's papers entitled ''Four Essays on Liberty'' (1969) and was more recently reissued in a collection entitled simply ''Liberty'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, re-introduced the study of political philosophy to the methods of [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It is also one of Berlin's first expressions of his ethical ontology of [[value-pluralism]]. Berlin defined negative liberty (as the term "liberty" was used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] &lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 170&lt;/ref&gt;) as the absence of coercion or interference with agents' possible private actions, by an exterior social-body. He also defined it as a comparatively recent political ideal, which re-emerged in the late 17th century, after its slow and inarticulate birth in the Ancient doctrines of [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon the Sophist]], the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic discipleship]], and of [[Otanes]] after the death of [[Bardiya|pseudo-Smerdis]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to the essay, Berlin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for Otanes, he wished neither to rule nor to be ruled—the exact opposite of Aristotle's notion of true civic liberty. ... [This ideal] remains isolated and, until Epicurus, undeveloped ... the notion had not explicitly emerged".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', ''Five Essays on Liberty: An Introduction'', page 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Summary ==

=== Positive liberty ===
:"is involved in the answer to the question 'What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?' The two questions are clearly different, even though the answers to them may overlap."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive liberty]] may be understood as self-mastery, and includes one's having a role in choosing who governs the society of which one is a part.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Berlin traced positive liberty from Aristotle's definition of citizenship, which is historically derived from the social role of the freemen of classical Athens: it was, Berlin argued, the liberty in choosing their government granted to citizens, and extolled, most famously, by [[Pericles]]. Berlin granted that both concepts of liberty represent valid human ideals, and that both forms of liberty are necessary in any free and civilised society.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Negative liberty ===
:"liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berlin, [[negative liberty]] represents a different, and sometimes contradictory, understanding of the concept of liberty, which needs to be carefully examined. Its later proponents (such as [[Tocqueville]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]],{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} who accepted [[Chrysippus]]' understanding of [[self-determination]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 171 and 260&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that constraint and discipline were the antithesis of liberty and so were (and are) less prone to confusing liberty and constraint in the manner of rationalists and the philosophical harbingers of totalitarianism.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} This concept of negative liberty, Berlin argued, constitutes an alternative, and sometimes even opposed, concept to positive liberty, and one often closer to the intuitive modern usage of the word.  Berlin considered negative liberty one of the distinguishing concepts of modern liberalism and observed
:"The fathers of liberalism--Mill and Constant--want more than this minimum: they demand a maximum degree of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life. It seems unlikely that this extreme demand for liberty has ever been made by any but a small minority of highly civilized and self-conscious human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse of positive liberty ===
Isaiah Berlin notes that historically positive liberty has proven particularly susceptible to rhetorical abuse; especially from the 18th century onwards, it has either been paternalistically re-drawn from the third-person, or conflated with the concept of negative liberty and thus disguised underlying value-conflicts.

Berlin contended that under the influence of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], modern political thinkers often conflated positive liberty with rational action, based upon a rational knowledge to which, it is argued, only a certain elite or social group has access.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Bern, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 257&lt;/ref&gt; This rationalist conflation was open to political abuses, which encroached on negative liberty, when such interpretations of positive liberty were, in the nineteenth century, used to defend nationalism, paternalism, social engineering, historicism, and collective rational control over human destiny. Berlin argued that, following this line of thought, demands for freedom paradoxically could become demands for forms of collective control and discipline—those deemed necessary for the "self-mastery" or "self-determination" of nations, classes, democratic communities, and even humanity as a whole. There is thus an elective affinity, for Berlin, between positive liberty, when it is rhetorically conflated with goals imposed from the third-person that the individual is told they "should" rationally desire, and the justifications for political [[totalitarianism]], which contrary to [[value-pluralism]], presupposed that values exist in [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] harmony. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Dialectic of positive and negative liberty ===
Berlin did not argue that the concept of positive liberty should be rejected—on the contrary, he recognised it as one human value among many, and one necessary to any free society.&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that positive liberty was a genuine and valuable version of liberty, so long as it was identified with the autonomy of individuals, and not with the achievement of goals that individuals 'ought to' 'rationally' desire.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', p 39&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin argued, rather, that these differing concepts showed the plurality, and incompatibility of human values, and the need to analytically distinguish and trade-off between, rather than conflate, them.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Berlin offers in his "Two Concepts of Liberty" essay, "Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others. Freedom for an Oxford don, others have been known to add, is a very different thing from freedom for an Egyptian peasant."

'''The looting of Polish cultural artifacts during World War II''' was carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] side by side after the [[invasion of Poland]] of 1939. A significant portion of Poland's cultural heritage, estimated at about half a million art objects, was plundered by the occupying powers. Cataloged pieces are still occasionally recovered elsewhere and returned to Poland.

Priceless pieces of art still considered missing or found in Russian museums include works by [[Bernardo Bellotto|Canaletto]], [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]owa, [[Józef Brandt]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Frans Luycx]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], [[Veit Stoss]], [[Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski]], [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Henri Gervex]], [[Ludwig Buchhorn]], [[Józef Simmler]], [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] and many others.&lt;ref name="sural"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Agnieszka Sural | year =2013 | month = | title =Najcenniejsze dzieła zaginione podczas II wojny światowej |trans-title=The most precious pieces of art missing since WWII | journal =culture.pl | volume = | issue =2013-08-13 | pages = | issn = | url =http://www.culture.pl/baza-sztuki-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/najcenniejsze-dziela-zaginione-podczas-ii-wojny-swiatowej# | publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] | location=Warsaw | accessdate =2013-08-22 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the efforts to locate and retrieve the missing pieces of art, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] founded the Database of War Losses, as of 2013 containing over 63,000 entries.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"&gt;{{cite web | author=Muzeum Utracone (corporate author) | title=About The Lost Museum | publisher=Muzeum Utracone | year=2013 | work= muzeumutracone.pl| url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/o-muzeum/ | accessdate=2013-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is periodically sent to over 100 auction houses around the world, published by the Ministry and also submitted to the National Institute of Museology and Collections Protection, Polish embassies, and the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945 (lootedart.com).&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt; In addition, the Ministry also founded the Lost Museum website, a virtual museum containing historic photographs of many pieces of art still missing.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

==Background==
At the beginning of the [[1939 invasion of Poland]], the Polish interwar government attempted to conceal the nation's most valued cultural heritage such as the royal treasures of the [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]]. The royal accessories including the [[Jagiellonian tapestries]] were secretly shipped to Western Europe and then to Canada among other places. At the end of the war, two parallel Polish governments, the Western-supported [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet-backed government in [[Communist Poland]] laid claims to these national treasures. The cultural artifacts were released by Canada to the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in February 1961.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treasures"/&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[occupation of Poland]] by German forces, the Nazi regime attempted to [[Polish culture during World War II|suppress Polish culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; As part of that process, the Nazis confiscated Polish national heritage assets and much private property.&lt;ref name="Knuth2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madajczyk122"/&gt; Acting on the legal decrees of October 19 and December 16 (''Verordnung über die Beschlagnahme Kunstgegeständen im Generalgouvernement''), several German agencies began the process of looting Polish museums and other collections, ostensibly considered necessary for the "securing" of German national interests.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;

Thousands of art objects were plundered, as the Nazis carried out a plan put in place before the start of hostilities.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The looting was supervised by experts of the ''[[SS]]''-''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' units, who were responsible for art; and, by experts of ''[[Haupttreuhandstelle Ost]]'', who were responsible for confiscating businesses and more mundane objects.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Nazi officials responsible for carrying-out the plan included [[Hans Posse]], [[Josef Mühlmann]] and his half-brother [[Kajetan Mühlmann|Kajetan]] (a.k.a. Kai, both from the [[SS]]),&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="miastospoleczne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |title=Warszawa Oskarża |publisher=Drukarnia Narodowa, M-01526 |work=Przewodnik po wystawie urządzonej przez Biuro Odbudowy Stolicy wespół z Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |author1=Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki |author2=i Ministerstwo Odbudowy Kraju |language=Polish |format=PDF direct download, 91.8 KB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001132/http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zab"/&gt; overseen by [[Dagobert Frey]], an SS historian originally also from Austria, selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a "Teutonic land" without Jews.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofarthistorians"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/freyd.htm | title=Frey, Dagobert | publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians | accessdate=August 4, 2012 | author=Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies of Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the official looting by Nazi authorities, some looting was also carried out by individuals acting on their own initiative; in fact Mühlmann complained as early as on October 6, 1939, that many items he was tasked to secure had already been moved or simply stolen.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; While the Nazis kept extensive documentation of newly acquired looted art pieces, the system was not foolproof, and they lost track of much of the looted goods during the increasingly haphazard evacuation of Polish territories in 1944.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

Most of the important art pieces had been "secured" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that "over 90%" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned ''[[Führermuseum]]'' in [[Linz]], while other art became the private property of Nazi officials.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; In 1940, Hitler received a "gift" from [[Hans Frank]], governor of [[General Government|occupied Poland]] - a collection, prepared by Mühlmann, of 521 of the most valuable art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Frank aided by ''Oberführer'' Mühlmann, an art connoisseur, amassed a large collection of Polish art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The total cost of the Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 11.14 billion dollars (value in 2001 dollars).&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt;

Over 516,000 individual art pieces were taken.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The exact number is uncertain as not all art was registered, and much of that documentation was lost as well.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Assessment of losses began during World War II under the auspices of the [[Polish government in exile]] and the [[Polish Underground State]]; in 1944, [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]] published in London the first work on this subject, ''Cultural Losses of Poland''.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; A 2010 estimate gave a figure of 75% for the percentage of cultural heritage lost by Poland during the war&lt;ref name="gp"/&gt; (though that estimate covers both destroyed and lost cultural heritage).&lt;ref name="jasinski"/&gt; The looted art included 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 2,800 paintings by other European painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps, 22,000 books printed before 1800 (''starodruki''); 300,000 graphics, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value.&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; The number of looted or destroyed books is estimated at 1.5 million&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; to as high as 15&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; or 22 million.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; Even exotic animals were taken from the [[zoo]]s.&lt;ref name="Kisling2000"/&gt;

During the genocidal campaign against the [[Polish Jews]] culminating in the ''[[Aktion Reinhard]]'' of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en-CA&amp;q=cache:_OoZLk7G3wAJ:http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/areconomics.html%2Bwww.death-camps.org/reinhard/areconomics&amp;gbv=2&amp;&amp;ct=clnk |title=Aktion Reinhard Economics |publisher=Aktion Reinhard |work=Google's cache |year=2006 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |author=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Robbery of Polish Jews and looting of their property became the norm. In every town and village, Jews were forced to hand over not merely gold, currency and other valuables, but virtually anything consumable, including furniture and clothing. Even items such as birdcages, door handles and hot-water bottles were looted. Any excuse, or none at all, became the pretext for extortion.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;}}

==Soviet Union==
[[File:Пл. Ринок, 4.JPG|thumb|upright|Holdings of ''Lwów Historical Museum'' were taken to the basement of Black House and smashed behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;]]
After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] on September 17, 1939, it similarly engaged in the looting and destruction of the Polish cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimoz"/&gt; It is estimated that soon after the invasion, about half of Polish museums and similar public institutions were dismantled in the territories occupied by the Soviets. Many items were shipped to Soviet museums such as the [[Moscow Museum of History]] and the [[Central Anti-Religious Museum]] (also in Moscow).&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; Other collections were simply done away with. For instance, during the liquidation of the Poland's ''Lwów Historical Museum'' in the early 1940, its holdings were transported to the basement of the Black (''Czarna'') [[Kamienica (architecture)|Kamienica]] ''(pictured)'', away from public eye, and deliberately destroyed there.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;

Following the Soviet advance across the German-occupied Polish lands, the looting and plunder of anything of value continued&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;  up to 1947 even though the looted territories were theoretically assigned to its own ally, the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] already.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raack" /&gt; The Soviet forces engaged in particularly extensive plunder in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] that were to be transferred to Poland, stripping them of any piece of equipment left behind.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś" /&gt; Even the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish Communists]] felt uneasy about the scope of their crimes. In 1945, the future Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State]], Gen. [[Aleksander Zawadzki]], worried that "raping and looting of the Soviet army would provoke a civil war"&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

{{see also|Rape during the liberation of Poland|Soviet war crimes}}

The operations of these "war trophy brigades" were regulated by detailed orders issued by Soviet vice-minister of defence [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in early 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Первоисточники ]-- Приказы народного комиссара обороны СССР (1943-1945)|url = http://militera.lib.ru/docs/da/nko_1943-1945/14.html|website = militera.lib.ru|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1948 these brigades sent at least 239'000 [[Railroad car|freight cars]] to USSR transporting natural resources, complete factories and individual machines. Town of [[Bydgoszcz]] lost 30 complete factories and 250 ships, from [[Grudziądz]] the army confiscated all machinery from factories, regardless of their size. From [[Toruń]] all [[gristmill]]s were taken, causing temporary deficit of bread. Blachownia Śląska lost a large, German-built [[synthetic fuel]] producing installation, transported to USSR on 10,000 train cars. A similar production line in [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] was transported using 14,000 cars. [[Gliwice]] lost a pipe factory, [[Bobrek, Cieszyn|Bobrek]] and Łabędy - iron furnaces. Complete power stations were taken from Miechowice, [[Zabrze]], [[Zdzieszowice]], Mikulczyce, Blachownia Śląska i Chełmsk Śląski. Smaller industries were also confiscated in [[Sosnowiec]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Częstochowa]], Zgoda, [[Chorzów]], [[Siemianowice Śląskie|Siemianowice]], [[Poznań]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Toruń]], [[Inowrocław]], [[Włocławek]], [[Chojnice]], [[Łódź]], Dziedzice and [[Oświęcim]].

Farming animals were also significant target of looting: until 1 September 1945 the [[Red Army]] confiscated 506,000 cows, 114,000 sheep and 206,000 horses. In February 1945 alone over 72,000 tons of sugar was taken. In Toruń region alone 14,000 tons of grain, 20,000 of potatoes and 21,000 beetroots were taken during that period. These number represent looting alone, as the Polish government also supplied food to the Red Army officially at that time (150,000 tons of grains, 250,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of meat and 100,000 tons of straws).

Individual Red Army soldiers were also allowed to send home "war trophies", with the weight depending on their rank, which resulted in widespread looting of private houses of anything valuable, including food, clothes, shoes, radios, jewelry, utensils, clothes, bicycles, and even ceramic toilet bowls. Scale of individual looting can be estimated by the example of Russian town of [[Kursk]], which received only 300 personal parcels from soldiers in January 1945 but till May their number reached 87,000.

After these transports were finished, the Red Army also started looting the train infrastructure itself—repair yards, signalling installations and the rails themselves: around 5,500&amp;nbsp;km of rails were looted.

In 1946 the scale of looting was estimated by Polish authorities at 2.375 billions of 1938 dollars (equivalent of $54 billion in 2015 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ŁUPY WOJENNE|url = http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleinmagazineshow/13006?t=LUPY-WOJENNE|website = www.polska-zbrojna.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Największy rabunek w dziejach Pomorza i Kujaw - Express Bydgoski - Bydgoszcz, Kujawy i Pomorze - aktualności, informacje, artykuły, wydarzenia.|url = http://express.bydgoski.pl/990,Najwiekszy-rabunek-w-dziejach-Pomorza-i-Kujaw.html|website = express.bydgoski.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Znienawidzona Armia Czerwona w Łodzi - Dzienniklodzki.pl|url = http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/516739,znienawidzona-armia-czerwona-w-lodzi,id,t.html?cookie=1#!|website = www.dzienniklodzki.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rosja jest nam winna 54 miliardy dolarów.

==Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art==
After the war, the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and Art]] took over efforts to compile a list of lost art, locate it and recover it.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The Bureau of Revindication and Damages (''Biuro Rewindykacji i Odszkodowań'') operated from 1945 to 1951.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The realities of the [[Cold War]] made retrieval of looted cultural heritage difficult, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that the situation changed.&lt;ref name="MSZ2"/&gt; In 1991, a new body was formed for that purpose, the Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad (''Biuro Pełnomocnika Rządu ds. Polskiego Dziedzictwa Kulturalnego Za Granicą''), operating at the Ministry of Culture and Art.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; In 1999, the initiative received support from the Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="MSZ3"/&gt; Once a looted piece of art is located, the Polish government issues a request for its restoration, and as noted on the Ministry website, all requests to date have been successful.&lt;ref name=MSZ3/&gt; {{As of|October 2012}}, the Ministry listed 30 objects which had been retrieved in the years 2001-2012.&lt;ref name="MSZ4"/&gt; Among the recovered art is the [[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''Jewish Woman''—found by surprise at the ''Eva Aldag'' auction house in [[Buxtehude]] in November 2010, returned to [[National Museum, Warsaw]] at the end of July 2011 and restored.&lt;ref name="gierymski"/&gt;

[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' reported hidden in a secret bank vault]]
On 1 August 2012, the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] announced that one of the most famous pieces of Polish art, [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'', had been found "in a bank vault in an undisclosed location"; a ministry spokesman was confident that the painting would eventually be returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; In April 2014, [[Francesco Guardi]]'s ''Palace Stairs'' was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/45012/germany-returns-stolen-polish-art-from-1939/|title=Germany Returns Stolen Polish Art from 1939|last=Fry|first=Maddy|date=2014-04-01|website=Time.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Poland is planning to build a [[virtual museum]], the [[Lost Museum]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Muzeum Utracone|pl}}), which would feature the lost art.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

Both Germany and the [[post-Soviet states|countries of the former Soviet Union]] still have much Polish material looted during World War II.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rękopis Słowackiego odnaleziony w Rosji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onet"/&gt; In particular, recovering looted art from the former states of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, is proving difficult.&lt;ref name="wprost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad-tygodnik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/spoils-of-war-1.html | title=Spoils of War Returned: U.S. Restitution of Nazi-Looted Cultural Treasures to the USSR, 1945 - 1959, Part 1 | author=[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted]] | journal=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]] | year=Fall 2002 | volume=34 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
