In [[quantum field theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]], the '''1/''N'' expansion''' (also known as the "'''large ''N'''''" '''expansion''') is a particular [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] analysis of quantum field theories with an [[internal symmetry]] [[group theory|group]] such as [[special orthogonal group|SO(N)]] or [[special unitary group|SU(N)]]. It consists in deriving an expansion for the properties of the theory in powers of &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;, which is treated as a small parameter.

This technique is used in [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] (even though &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is only 3 there) with the [[gauge group]] SU(3). Another application in [[particle physics]] is to the study of [[AdS/CFT]] dualities.

It is also extensively used in [[condensed matter physics]] where it can be used to provide a rigorous basis for [[mean field theory]].

== Example ==
Starting with a simple example — the [[orthogonal group|O(N)]] [[Quartic interaction|&amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]] — the scalar field φ takes on values in the [[real number|real]] [[vector representation]] of O(N). Using the [[index notation]] for the N "[[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor]]s" with the [[Einstein summation convention]] and because O(N) is orthogonal, no distinction will be made between covariant and contravariant indices. The [[Lagrangian density]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}\partial^\mu \phi_a \partial_\mu \phi_a-{m^2\over 2}\phi_a \phi_a-{\lambda\over 8N}(\phi_a \phi_a)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; runs from 1 to N. Note that N has been absorbed into the [[coupling constant|coupling strength]] λ. This is crucial here.

Introducing an [[auxiliary field]] F;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}\partial^\mu \phi_a \partial_\mu \phi_a -{m^2\over 2}\phi_a \phi_a +{1\over 2}F^2-{\sqrt{\lambda /N}\over 2}F \phi_a \phi_a&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Feynman diagram]]s, the graph breaks up into disjoint [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]], each made up of φ edges of the same flavor and the cycles are connected by F edges.

Each 4-point vertex contributes λ/N and hence, 1/N. Each flavor cycle contributes N because there are N such flavors to sum over. Note that not all momentum flow cycles are flavor cycles.

At least perturbatively, the dominant contribution to the 2k-point [[connected correlation function]] is of the order (1/N)&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the other terms are higher powers of 1/N. Performing a 1/N expansion gets more and more accurate in the large N limit. The vacuum energy density is proportional to N, but can be ignored due to non-compliance with general relativity assumptions.

Due to this structure, a different graphical notation to denote the Feynman diagrams can be used. Each flavor cycle can be represented by a vertex. The flavor paths connecting two external vertices are represented by a single vertex. The two external vertices along the same flavor path are naturally paired and can be replaced by a single vertex and an edge (not an F edge) connecting it to the flavor path. The F edges are edges connecting two flavor cycles/paths to each other (or a flavor cycle/path to itself). The interactions along a flavor cycle/path have a definite cyclic order and represent a special kind of graph where the order of the edges incident to a vertex matters, but only up to a cyclic permutation, and since this is a theory of real scalars, also an order reversal (but if we have SU(N) instead of SU(2), order reversals aren't valid). Each F edge is assigned a momentum (the momentum transfer) and there is an internal momentum integral associated with each flavor cycle.

== QCD ==

{{Main|Quantum chromodynamics}}

QCD is an SU(3) [[gauge theory]] involving [[gluon]]s and [[quark]]s. The [[Weyl fermion|left-handed quark]]s belong to a [[triplet representation]], the right-handed to an [[antitriplet representation]] (after charge-conjugating them) and the gluons to a [[real number|real]] [[adjoint representation]]. A quark edge is assigned a color and orientation and a gluon edge is assigned a color pair.

In the large N limit, we only consider the dominant term. See [[AdS/CFT]].

==Contents==
Throughout the book’s fourteen chapters, Phillips draws from over a decade of experience as a composer in the video game industry in order to explore the creative and technical aspects of game music composition. The book investigates the specialized skills and training necessary for the pursuit of a game music career.  The structural requirements of game music are discussed, including the distinctive creative workflow involved in composing both interactive and linear music for games. [[Dynamic music]] constructs such as horizontal resequencing, vertical layering, [[MIDI]], [[MOD (file format)|MOD]], and [[generative music]] are explored.  Also included is an examination of technical abilities, equipment necessities, and software proficiencies that assist in the creation of music for games. The concluding chapter focuses on skills that help a game composer pursue a sustainable career, network in the video game industry, and build a resilient business.

Phillips intersperses practical advice with personal memories and anecdotes gleaned from her years in the video game industry. She describes the impetus that caused her to pursue a game music career, her early struggles to obtain work, her breakthrough when hired to join the music composition team for ''God of War,'' and her experiences during the development of several other game projects.  Phillips also includes stories that explore the interpersonal dynamics within [[video game development]] and the [[gamer]] community, as well as the importance of game music [[fandom]].  The book periodically turns its attention to scholarly topics, including the influence of music on the [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] phenomenon, the relationship between game music and the [[21st Century Game Design|Demographic Game Design (DGD)]] model, and several discussions of the role played by traditional [[music theory]] in the creation of music for video games.

'''Anemophily''' or '''wind pollination''' is a form of [[pollination]] whereby [[pollen]] is distributed by [[wind]].&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. K. Shukla |author2=M. R. Vijayaraghavan |author3=Bharti Chaudhry |year=1998 |title=Biology Of Pollen |publisher=[[APH Publishing]] |isbn=9788170249245 |chapter=Abiotic pollination |pages=67–69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfSlwa0BnDgC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all [[gymnosperm]]s are anemophilous, as are many plants in the order [[Poales]], including [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[Juncaceae|rushes]].&lt;ref name="Shukla"/&gt; Other common anemophilous plants are [[oak]]s, [[sweet chestnut]]s, [[alder]]s and members of the family [[Juglandaceae]] (hickory or walnut family).

==Syndrome==
Features of the wind-pollination syndrome include a lack of scent production, a lack of showy floral parts (resulting in inconspicuous flowers), reduced production of [[nectar]], and the production of enormous numbers of pollen grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Dave Moore |chapter=Insects of palm flowers and fruits |editor=F.W. Howard |editor2=D. Moore |editor3=R.M. Giblin-Davis |editor4=R.G. Abad |year=2001 |title=Insects on Palms |publisher=[[CAB International]] |isbn=9780851997056 |pages=233–266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL5jorrwFLYC&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes them from [[entomophily|entomophilous]] and [[zoophily|zoophilous]] species (whose pollen is spread by [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s respectively).

Anemophilous [[pollen]] grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically {{convert|20|-|60|um|4}} in diameter, although the pollen grains of ''[[Pinus]]'' species can be much larger and much less dense.&lt;ref name="Shukla"/&gt; Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed [[stamen]]s so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery [[stigma (botany) | stigma]] to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-[[protein]] pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by [[bee]]s' [[electrostatic]] field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit [[ragweed]] flowers, its [[Melissopalynology|pollen is often found]] in [[honey]] made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting [[Poaceae|grass]] flowers, and the larger [[honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s frequently gathering pollen from [[maize|corn]] tassels and other grains.

Anemophily is an [[adaptation]] that helps to separate the male and female reproductive systems of a single plant, reducing the effects of [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =J. D. Ackerman |year=2000 |title=Abiotic pollen and pollination: ecological, functional, and evolutionary perspectives |journal=[[Plant Systematics and Evolution]] |volume=222 |issue=1–4 |pages=167–185 |doi=10.1007/BF00984101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often accompanies [[dioecy]] – the presence of male and female reproductive structures on separate plants.

==Allergies==
Almost all pollens that are [[allergen]]s are from anemophilous species.&lt;ref name="Emberlin"&gt;{{cite book |author =Jean Emberlin |editor1=A. Barry Kay |editor2=Allen P. Kaplan |editor3=Jean Bousquet |editor4=Patrick G. Holt |year=2009 |series=Allergy and Allergic Diseases |volume=1 |title=The Scientific Basis of Allergy |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9781444300925 |chapter=Grass, tree, and weed pollen |pages=942–962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_3T1ZXvP5YC&amp;pg=PA943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasses ([[Poaceae]]) are the most important producers of aeroallergens in most temperate regions, with lowland or meadow species producing more pollen than upland or [[moorland]] species.&lt;ref name="Emberlin"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">The '''Biamonti Catalogue''' is a catalogue of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s compositions published in 1968 by the ILTE of Turin. The original name of the work is ''Catalogo cronologico e tematico di tutte le opere di Beethoven, comprese quelle inedite e gli abbozzi non utilizzati''. [[Giovanni Biamonti]] tried to combine all pieces of the author, including all works approached in other catalogues (the opus, [[Kinsky–Halm Catalogue]], [[Willy Hess (composer)|Hess]] and Grove), in a single chronological listing. All other catalogues are numbered by date of publishing. The numeration system used is "Bia" plus the number attributed to the piece in the catalogue.

In addition to including the 138 Opus numbers, the 205 WoOs of the Kinsky/Halm Catalogue, the 335 numbers of the Hess Catalogue, previously catalogued, the Biamonti Catalogue includes an important revision appendix to the three so-called official catalogues, accompanied by a personal catalogue including all the other fragments, unused sketches, notes, cues, various unused musical hints scattered in the letters, in the album sheets, in the notebooks of sketches and in the conversation notebooks known at the time of its publication.
Although Biamonti's work comprises 849 entries, including published and unpublished pieces, and even fragments, from 1782 to March 1827, there are some that Biamonti could not have known about, and so there is still no single catalog with all of Beethoven's compositions. Biamonti's numbers, in addition, are rarely used. Instead, [[WoO]] numbers are generally favoured.{{fact|date=November 2008}}

A '''Bible concordance''' is a [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]], or verbal index, to the [[Bible]]. A simple form lists Biblical words alphabetically, with indications to enable the inquirer to find the passages of the Bible where the words occur.

Concordances may be for the original languages of the Biblical books, or (more commonly) they are compiled for translations.

==Latin==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Friars of the [[Dominican order]] invented the verbal concordance of the Bible. As the basis of their work they used the text of the ''[[Latin Vulgate]]'', the standard Bible of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. The first concordance, completed in 1230, was undertaken under the guidance of Cardinal [[Hugo de Saint-Cher]] (Hugo de Sancto Charo), assisted by fellow Dominicans.

It contained short quotations (see the Ms. Saint-Omer, Bibliothèque municipale, 0028 &lt;ref&gt;[https://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/consult/consult.php?mode=ecran&amp;panier=false&amp;reproductionId=5540&amp;VUE_ID=1185442&amp;carouselThere=false&amp;nbVignettes=4x3&amp;page=1&amp;angle=0&amp;zoom=grand&amp;tailleReelle=true Online access to the first page of the Concordance by Hugues de St. Cher]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the passages where a word was found. These were indicated by book and chapter (the division into chapters had recently been made by [[Stephen Langton]]) but not by verses, which [[Robert Estienne]] would first introduce in 1545. In lieu of verses, Hugo divided each chapter into seven almost equal parts, indicated by the letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc.

Three English Dominicans (1250–1252) added the complete quotations of the passages indicated. Due to lack of space, present-day concordances do not aim for this completeness of quotation; it is likely,{{original research inline|date=March 2016}} therefore, that the passages indicated were far fewer than those found in a complete concordance of today. The work was somewhat abridged, by retaining only the essential words of a quotation, in the 1310 concordance of [[Conrad of Halberstadt]], another Dominican - his work obtained great success on account of its more convenient form.

The first concordance to be printed appeared in 1470 at Strasburg, and reached a second edition in 1475. The larger work from which it was abridged was printed at Nuremberg in 1485. Another Dominican, [[John Stoicowic]], or [[John of Ragusa]], finding it necessary in his controversies to show the Biblical usage of ''nisi'', ''ex'', and ''per'', which were omitted from the previous concordances, began (c. 1435) the compilation of nearly all the indeclinable words of Latin Scripture; the task was completed and perfected by others and finally added as an appendix to the concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt in the work of [[Sebastian Brant]] published at Basle in 1496. Brant's work was frequently republished and in various cities. It served as the basis of the concordance published in 1555 by Robert Estienne.  Estienne added proper names, supplied omissions, mingled the indeclinable words with the others in alphabetical order, and gave the indications to all passages by verse as well as by chapter, bringing his work much closer to the present model of concordances. Since then many different Latin concordances have been published:
[[File:Concordance of Latin Vulgate Bible.jpg|thumb|5 volume concordance to the Latin Vulgate Bible]]
* [[Plantinus]]'s "Concordantiæ Bibliorum juxta recognitionem Clementinam" (Antwerp, 1599), which was the first made according to the authorized Latin text;
* "Repertorium Biblicum ... studio ... Patrum Ordinis S. Benedicti, Monasterii Wessofontani" (Augsburg, 1751)
* "Concordantiæ Script. Sac.", by [[Dutripon]], in two immense volumes, the most useful of all Latin concordances, which gives enough of every text to make complete sense (Paris, 1838; seventh ed. 1880)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/BibliorumSacrorumConcordantiae Online access to the concordance of Dutripon]&lt;/ref&gt;
* an edition of the same by G. Tonini, at [[Prato]], 1861, recognized as nearly complete
* V. Coornaert's ''Concordantiae librorum Veteris et Novi Testamenti Domini Nostri Jesu Christi juxta Vulgatam editionem, jussu Sixti V, Pontificis Maximi, recognitam ad usum praedicatorum'', intended for the use of preachers (Bruges, 1892)
*the "Concordantiarum S. Scripturæ Manuale", by H. de Raze, Ed. de Lachaud, and J.-B. Flandrin (13th ed., Paris, 1895), which gives rather a choice of texts than a complete concordance
*"Concordantiarum Universæ Scripturæ Sacræ Thesaurus", by Fathers Peultier, Etienne, and Gantois (Paris, 1902)

Peter Mintert's "Lexicon Græco-Latinum" of the New  Testament is a concordance as well as a lexicon, giving the Latin equivalent of the Greek and, in the case of ''[[Septuagint]]'' words, the Hebrew equivalent also (Frankfort, 1728).

==Hebrew==

The first Hebrew concordance (''Meïr Netib'') was the work of [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]], begun in 1438 and finished in 1448. It was inspired by the Latin concordances to aid in [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews#Christian missions|defence of Judaism]], and was printed in Venice in 1523. An improved edition of it by a Franciscan monk, [[Marius de Calasio]], was published in 1621 and 1622 in four volumes. Both these works were several times reprinted, while another Hebrew concordance of the sixteenth century, by [[Elias Levita]], said to surpass Nathan's in many respects, remained in manuscript.

Nathan and Calasio arranged the words according to the Hebrew roots, the derivatives following simply according to the order in which they occur in the Hebrew books; the [[Buxtorf]]s, father and son, introduced order into the derivatives by a grammatical classification of the verbs and nouns. Their work (Basle, 1632) also contained many new words and passages previously omitted, and an appendix of all the Chaldaic words in the O. T.; Baer's edition of Buxtorf (1847) added certain particles.

[[Fürst]]'s concordance (Leipzig, 1840) was for a long time the standard. It corrected Buxtorf and brought it nearer to completeness, printed all Hebrew words with the vowel-points, and perfected the order of the derivatives. Every word is explained in Hebrew and Latin. Fürst excludes, however, the proper nouns, the pronouns, and most of the indeclinable particles, and makes many involuntary omissions and errors; his classification of roots is sometimes fanciful.{{who says|date=June 2018}} "The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldaic Concordance" (London, 1843; third edition, 1866) is still considered very useful.{{by whom|date=June 2018}}

A comprehensive Hebrew concordance is that of [[Mandelkern]] (Leipzig, 1896), who rectified the errors of his predecessors and supplied omitted references. Though his own work has been shown to be frequently imperfect, still it is almost complete. An abridged edition of it was published in 1900.

[[A New Concordance of the Bible]] (full title A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible, Hebrew and Aramaic, Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms) by [[Avraham Even-Shoshan]] is a concordance of the Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, first published in 1977. The source text used is that of the Koren edition of 1958.

==Greek Septuagint==
[[File:HatchRedpath2-23psi-1486.png|thumb|page from Hatch-Redpath concordance]]
The first was that of [[Conrad Kircher]] (Frankfort, 1607); Tromm's, published at Amsterdam, 1718, had reference not only to the ''Septuagint'', but also to the versions of [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], and [[Theodotion]]. It remained the standard until it gave way to [[Edwin Hatch]] and [[Henry Adeney Redpath]]'s "Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Versions of the Old Testament" (Oxford, 1892–97). This includes a concordance to the [[deutero-canonical books]] and the [[Old Testament Apocrypha]], and to the remains of the versions which form part of [[Origen of Alexandria]]'s ''[[Hexapla]]''. The Hebrew equivalents of the Greek, when known, are also given. References to proper names are added in a supplement published in 1900. Bagster's "Handy Concordance to the Septuagint" (London, 1887) gives simply the references, without quotations.

==Greek New Testament==

The earliest concordances to the ''[[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]'' are those of Birken or [[Betulius]] (Basle, 1546), [[Henry Estienne]] (Paris, 1594), and [[Erasmus Schmid]] (Wittenberg, 1638), whose work was twice revised and republished. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the standard New Testament concordance was that of [[Karl Hermann Bruder|Bruder]] (Leipzig, 1842; 4th ed., 1888). Its main defect is that it was practically based on the ''[[textus receptus]]'', though it aims, in its latest editions to give also the chief variants.

[[William Fiddian Moulton|Moulton]] and [[Alfred Shenington Geden|Geden]]'s ''Concordance to the Greek Testament'', according to the text of [[Westcott-Hort|Westcott and Hort]], [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], and the English Revisers (Edinburgh and New York, 1897) includes all the marginal readings. In the case of a reading being in dispute among these authorities, the fact is pointed out. The Hebrew equivalents of all quotations in the N. T. are given; the relation of the Greek N. T. words to the Septuagint and other O. T. Greek versions, as well as to classical usage, is indicated. Two other concordances are ''The Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament'' by [[George Wigram|G. V. Wigram]] (London, 1839, 2d ed. 1844), and Hudson's ''Critical Greek and English Concordance of the N. T.'' (Boston, 1875), which contains references to the chief variant readings.

==Syriac==

[[Charles Schaaf]]'s "Lexicon Syriacum" (Leyden, 1709) practically serves the purpose of a concordance to the ''[[Peshito]]'' version.

==English==

The earliest concordances in English were published in the middle of the sixteenth century, the first by [[Thomas Gybson]] in 1535 (for the New Testament only), and the second in 1550 by [[John Marbeck]]. The most famous one, ''[[Cruden's Concordance]]'' was the work of [[Alexander Cruden]]. First published in 1738, it reached several editions in his own lifetime and has been re-edited, abridged and reprinted repeatedly. Cruden's work is not a complete concordance, and omits especially many references to proper names, but his last edition had a concordance to the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament, which, however, is usually not reprinted.

It was surpassed by three major concordances of the King James Version of the Bible, those of [[Robert Young (Biblical scholar)|Robert Young]], [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]], and Walker.

*''[[Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible]]'' (Edinburgh, 1879–84), an almost complete concordance, indicates the Hebrew, Chaldaic, or Greek original of the English word, and distinguishes the various meanings that may underlie the same word.
*''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' has reference only to the English text. It contains also a comparative concordance between the Authorized and Revised English versions, useful for a study of the changes introduced.
*Walker's ''Comprehensive Concordance to the Holy Scriptures'' (Boston, 1894) is almost as complete as Strong's. A ''Complete Concordance to the Revised Version of the New Testamen'', by J. A. Thoms, was published in London, 1884.

These were followed by a concordance based on the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay–Rheims translation]] of the Bible preferred by Roman Catholics, ''A Textual Concordance of the Holy Scriptures'' by Father Thomas David Williams, 1942.

==Contemporary use ==
Since software has made the Bible available in electronic form and with thorough electronic indexes, hard-copy printed  concordances have less application. Most scholars and Bible students rely instead on software.{{citation needed|date = November 2010}}

Due to Strong's numbers (see ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'') it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible ("Новая учебная Библия Томпсона", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society "The Bible for everyone", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible]] (''The New Thompson Study Bible.'' La Buona Novella Inc. &amp; B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then it's Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

'''Central Saint Martins''', often abbreviated to '''CSM''', is a [[public university|public]] [[tertiary education|tertiary]] [[art school]] in London, England. It is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]].{{r|bus|times}} It offers full-time courses at foundation, [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] levels, and a variety of short and summer courses.

It was formerly known as '''Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design''', and before that as '''Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design'''.{{r|aim2}}

==History==
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the [[Central School of Art and Design]], founded in 1896, and [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], founded in 1854.{{r|aim2|alex}} Since 1986 both schools had been part of the [[London Institute]], formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools.{{r|hist}} The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.{{r|hist}} It also includes [[Camberwell College of Arts]], [[Chelsea College of Arts]], the [[London College of Communication]], the [[London College of Fashion]] and [[Wimbledon College of Arts]].

The [[Drama Centre London]], founded in 1963, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 as an integral school, maintaining its name and teaching approaches. The [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], founded in 1910, was merged into Central Saint Martins in 2003.

===Central School of Art and Design===
[[File:Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design - Blue Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Central School of Art and Design, Southampton Row, Holborn, London WC1B 4AP: [[Blue Plaque]] for [[William Lethaby]], first Principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, placed by [[London County Council]] in 1957]]
{{main|Central School of Art and Design}}
The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by [[London County Council]]. It grew directly from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was [[William Richard Lethaby]]; a [[blue plaque]] in his memory was erected in 1957.{{r|plaque}} The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the [[Regent Street Polytechnic]]. It moved to purpose-built premises in [[Southampton Row]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], in 1908.{{r|oxford}} In the same year the [[Royal Female School of Art]], established in 1842, was merged into the school.{{r|aim25b}} Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.{{r|frieze}}

===Saint Martin's School of Art===
{{main|Saint Martin's School of Art}}
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. It became independent from the church in 1859.{{r|oxford2}} Frank Martin became head of the [[sculpture]] department in 1952; he brought in young sculptors and recent graduates of the department as teachers. Among these, [[Anthony Caro]] was particularly influential. The group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors and the sculpture department of Saint Martin's became, in the words of [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]]: "the most famous in the art world".{{r|mclean}} Saint Martin's became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Central in 1989.

===Drama Centre London===
{{Main|Drama Centre London}}
The [[Drama Centre London]] was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], led by John Blatchley, [[Yat Malmgren]] and Christopher Fettes. The school is a member of [[Drama UK]]{{r|dramauk}} and its undergraduate [[Acting]] course is accredited by Drama UK.{{r|dramauk2}} The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999.

===Byam Shaw School of Art===
{{main|Byam Shaw School of Art}}

Byam Shaw School of Art was founded by the artists [[Byam Shaw|John Byam Shaw]] and [[Rex Vicat Cole]] in 1910 as a school of [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. It was originally located in Campden Street, [[Kensington]], and moved to larger premises in [[Archway, London|Archway]] in 1990. It was subsumed by Central Saint Martins in 2003.

==Awards and assessment==
In 1998 the London Institute received a [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for the "massive contribution" of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design to the growth of the fashion industry in Britain.{{r|royal}}  The University of the Arts London received a Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2013, for the contribution of CSM industrial and product design graduates to commerce, industry and the design profession.{{r|rat}}

CSM does not receive independent assessment in the ''[[Complete University Guide]]'' league tables, but is ranked as part of the University of the Arts London. In 2014 the university received an overall ranking of 67 out of 124 institutions, with a rank of 102 for graduate prospects and 123 for student satisfaction with teaching.{{r|indepedent|cug}} In 2018 it was placed 83rd out of 129 universities, with a rank of 125 for student satisfaction.{{r|cug2}} 

==Schools and location==
Teaching at Central Saint Martins is organised into nine programmes, which include acting, art, design, fashion, graphics and jewellery and textiles, as well as foundation courses.{{r|programmes}}

Central Saint Martins moved to a converted warehouse complex on [[Granary Square]] at [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] in 2011. Most of the college is housed there, but it also uses the former Byam Shaw building in Elthorne Road, [[Archway, London|Archway]], and premises in Richbell Place, [[Holborn]].{{r|locations}}

A '''clearwater river''' is classified based on its chemistry, [[sediment]]s and water colour.

[[Amazon basin|Amazonian]] rivers fall into three main categories: clearwater, [[Blackwater river|blackwater]] and [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]]. This classification system was first proposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined according to chemistry and physics by Harald Sioli ([[:de:Harald Sioli|de]]) from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Duncan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sioli1984&gt;{{cite book| editor=Sioli, H. | year=1984 | title=The Amazon: Limnology and landscape ecology of a mighty tropical river and its basin | pages=160–161, 219, 276–280, 445, 493–494 | isbn=978-94-009-6544-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Villamizar2013&gt;{{cite web | author1=Ríos-Villamizar, E.A.| author2=M.T.F.

==Location==
[[File:Amazonriverbasin basemap.png|thumb|Map of the [[Amazon basin]]. Tributaries of the [[Amazon River]] in the eastern part of the basin are typically clearwater]]

The main clearwater rivers are South American and have their source in the [[Brazilian Plateau]] or the [[Guiana Shield]]. Examples of clearwater rivers originating in the Brazilian Plateau include [[Tapajós River|Tapajós]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]], several large right-bank tributaries of the [[Madeira River|Madeira]] (notably [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]], [[Ji-Paraná River|Ji-Paraná]] and [[Aripuanã River|Aripuanã]]) and [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]] (although heavily influenced by its [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]] tributaries).&lt;ref name=Sleen2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Junk2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venticinque2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Blettler, M.C.M; M.L.

Ichthyol. | volume=5 | issue=3 |  doi=10.1590/S1679-62252007000300015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside South America the classification is not commonly used, but rivers with clearwater characteristics are found elsewhere, such as the upper [[Zambezi River]], certain upland streams in major river basins of South and Southeast Asia, and many streams of northern Australia.&lt;ref name=Winemiller2008/&gt;

==Chemistry and sediments==
[[File:Confluence of the Madeira River and Aripuanã River.jpg|thumb|The [[confluence]] of the [[Madeira River]] and [[Aripuanã River]] (dark). Despite its colour on this photo, Aripuanã is clearwater, while the Madeira is [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]]]]
In South America, clearwater rivers typically have their source and flow through regions with sandy soils and [[crystalline rock]]s. These are generally ancient, of [[Precambrian]] origin, and therefore heavily weathered, allowing relatively few sediments to be dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=Duncan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sleen2017/&gt; This results in the low [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], relatively low levels of [[Total dissolved solids|dissolved solids]] and clear colour typical of clearwater rivers.&lt;ref name=Duncan2010/&gt;

Sand and [[kaolinite]] are the typical sediments transported by clearwater rivers, similar to blackwater, but unlike whitewater that also transports high levels of [[illite]] and [[montmorillonite]], resulting in a significantly higher [[Soil fertility|fertility]] of places influenced by the latter river type.&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt; Nevertheless, although clearwater rivers can have extremely low nutrient levels similar to blackwater, some such as the Tapajós, Xingu and Tocantins have nutrient levels that are intermediate between black and whitewater.&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt; The exact chemistry of clearwater rivers varies,&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt; but it is often very similar to rainwater, low in major nutrients with [[sodium]] as the relatively dominating chemical.&lt;ref name=amazonwaters&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amazonwaters.org/waters/river-types/clearwater-rivers/ | title=Clearwater Rivers | publisher=Amazon Waters | accessdate=1 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water is typically neutral to slightly [[acid]]ic,&lt;ref name=Sleen2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=amazonwaters/&gt; but the [[pH]] can range between 4.5&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt; and 8.&lt;ref name=Duncan2010/&gt; In the Amazon basin, clearwater rivers flowing through regions with sediments of [[Tertiary]] age are typically highly acidic, while those flowing through sediments of [[Carboniferous]] age are closer to neutral or slightly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]].&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt;

As suggested by the name, clearwater rivers are highly transparent with a typical visibility of {{convert|1.5-4|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=Goulding, M. | year=1981 | title=Man and Fisheries on an Amazon Frontier | page=10 | isbn=978-90-481-8520-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be large variations, even within a single river, depending on season or heavy rains.&lt;ref name=Sioli1984/&gt;

'''Continental Electronics''' is a major American manufacturer of broadcast and military radio [[transmitters]], based in [[Dallas]], Texas.  Although Continental today is best known for its [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[shortwave]], and military [[VLF]] transmitters, Continental is most significant historically for its line of [[mediumwave]] ([[AM broadcasting|AM]]) transmitters, many of which are still in active service as either main transmitters or backup facilities.  Among [[Clear-channel stations|clear-channel]] AM stations in the U.S. and Canada, the Continental 317C was the most popular transmitter type in the 1970s and 1980s.

== History ==
Continental Electronics was founded in Dallas in 1946 by [[James O. Weldon]], as a spin-off of the broadcast consulting business in which he was a partner, Weldon &amp; Carr.  In 1953, when [[Western Electric]]'s radio equipment business was broken up by Federal antitrust regulators, Continental acquired the AM transmitter business, and with it the U.S. patent on the [[Doherty amplifier|Doherty linear RF amplifier]].  Continental became part of [[Ling-Temco-Vought]] in about 1962, the first in a series of sales which would later bring it under the control of [[E-Systems]] and then [[Varian Associates]] in 1985.  [[Tech-Sym]] acquired Continental from Varian in 1990, and then sold it to [[Integrated Defense Technologies]] in 2000.  [[DRS Technologies]] acquired IDT in 2003, and in 2005, [[private equity|private-equity]] firm [[Veritas Capital]] (which had previously owned IDT) bought Continental back from DRS.  Weldon remained with the company until his retirement in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1958, Continental introduced a more-efficient Doherty-style amplifier based on a [[tetrode]] (previous Doherty designs made by Western Electric and Continental used [[triode]]s) with the type 317B transmitter.  With four subsequent revisions, more than 200 units were sold in the 317 line (a substantial number given the limited customer base for 50-kW AM transmitters in the North American market); the final revision, the 317C-3, was introduced in 1990.  By this time, competitors such as [[GatesAir|Harris]] had demonstrated the workability of all-solid-state 50-kW AM transmitters, which were far more energy-efficient than tube transmitters, and the North American broadcasting industry rapidly shifted away from [[vacuum tube]]-based AM transmitters.  Continental eventually dropped the 317 from its product line, but still makes transmitters using similar modified-Doherty designs for high-power [[longwave]] and [[shortwave]] broadcasting and military customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1980, Continental purchased the [[Collins Radio]] line of broadcast transmitters from [[Rockwell International]].  Collins's high-power FM transmitter, the type 831, replaced Continental's type 816 in production, and was renumbered the 816R.  More than thirty variants of the 816R have been produced since 1980, and the line is still in production today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Control system security''' is the prevention of intentional or unintentional interference with the proper operation of [[automation|industrial automation]] and [[industrial control systems|control systems]]. These control systems manage essential services including electricity, petroleum production, water, transportation, manufacturing, and communications. They rely on computers, networks, operating systems, applications, and [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]], each of which could contain [[vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]]. The 2010 discovery of the [[Stuxnet|Stuxnet worm]] demonstrated the vulnerability of these systems to cyber incidents.&lt;ref name="tofinoexida201202"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | title=The 7 Steps to ICS Security | accessdate=March 3, 2011 | author1=Byres, Eric | author2=Cusimano, John | date=February 2012 | publisher=Tofino Security and exida Consulting LLC | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123141949/http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | archivedate=January 23, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and other governments have passed [[cyber-security regulation]]s requiring enhanced  protection for control systems operating critical infrastructure.

Control system security is known by several other names such as ''[[SCADA]] security'', ''PCN security'', ''industrial [[network security]]'', and ''control system cyber security''.

== Risks ==
Insecurity of, or vulnerabilities inherent in industrial automation and control systems (IACS) can lead to severe consequences in categories such as safety, loss of life, personal injury, environmental impact, lost production, equipment damage, information theft, and company image.
Guidance to assess, evaluate and mitigate these potential risks is provided through the application of many Governmental, regulatory, industry documents and Global Standards, addressed below.

== Vulnerability of control systems ==
Industrial automation and control systems have become far more vulnerable to security incidents due to the following trends that have occurred over the last 10 to 15 years.  
* Heavy use of Commercial Off-the Shelf Technology (COTS) and protocols.  Integration of technology such as MS Windows, SQL, and Ethernet means that process control systems are now vulnerable to the same viruses, worms and trojans that affect IT systems 
* Enterprise integration (using plant, corporate and even public networks) means that process control systems (legacy) are now being subjected to stresses they were not designed for
* Demand for Remote Access - 24/7 access for engineering, operations or technical support means more insecure or rogue connections to control system
* Public Information - Manuals on how to use control system are publicly available to would be attackers as well as to legitimate users

The cyber threats and attack strategies on automation systems are changing rapidly.  Fortunately, regulation of control system security is rare as regulation is a slow moving process. The United States, for example, only does so for the [[nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power]] and the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]].&lt;ref name="gross201104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|title=A Declaration of Cyber-War|author=Gross, Michael Joseph|first=|date=2011-04-01|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Condé Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713082739/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|archivedate=2017-11-29|accessdate=2017-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government efforts ==
The U.S. Government [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]] (US-CERT) originally instituted a [[control systems security program]] (CSSP) now the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Industrial Control Systems, which has made available a large set of free National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards documents regarding control system security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/csstandards.html|title=Standards and References - NCCIC / ICS-CERT|website=ics-cert.us-cert.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automation &amp; control system security standards ==

===ISA/IEC-62443 (Formerly ISA-99)===
ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and control systems.

These documents were originally referred to as '''ANSI/ISA-99''' or '''ISA99''' standards, as they were created by the [[International Society of Automation|International Society for Automation (ISA)]] 99 committee, accredited by and publicly released as [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the '''ANSI/ISA-62443''' series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the corresponding [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]] standards.

All ISA work products are now numbered using the convention “ISA-62443-x-y” and previous ISA99 nomenclature is maintained for continuity purposes only. 

ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC for consideration as standards and specifications in the IEC 62443 series following the IEC standards development process.

[[File:ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png|thumb|right|alt=The numbering and organization of ISA62443 work products into categories.|Planned and published ISA62443 work products for IACS Security.]] All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called ''General'', ''Policies and Procedures'', ''System'' and ''Component''.&lt;ref&gt;More information about the activities and plans of the ISA99 committee is available on the committee Wiki site ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110402180044/http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99%20Wiki/Home.aspx])&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles for IACS.
# The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.
# The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model.
# The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure products.

=== IEC-62443 ===
The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted.  The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees.  To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7033|title=Standards and References - IEC-62443|website=www.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;


These standards are being used by practitioners in several industries to design and evaluate automation systems for cybersecurity resilience. Several of the standards are being used in personnel, engineering process, product, and system cybersecurity certification programs (also called conformity assessment programs).  

Certifications are awarded by accredited Certification Bodies (CB) who operate following ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies.  ABs are typically members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.

== Control system security certification ==

=== The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) Conformity Assessment Program  ===
ISCI created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ISA S99 IACS cybersecurity standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) IACS products and systems, addressing securing the IACS supply chain. 
exida from the United States was the first organization accredited for the ISCI scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center – Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and TÜV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS).  All of these AB organizations are members of the IAF.

==== ISCI Certification Offerings====
Two COTS product certifications are available under the ISASecure® brand: ISASecure-EDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certifying IACS products to the 62443-4-1 / 62443-4-2 IACS cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying IACS systems to the same standards.

A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies IACS development organizations to the 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard, providing assurances that a supplier organization has institutionalized cybersecurity into their product development practices.

====ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation====
The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB).  The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools.

Through Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized.

====Test Tool Recognition====
The ISASecure scheme includes a process for recognizing test tools to ensure the tools meet functional requirements necessary and sufficient to execute all required product tests and that test results will be consistent among the recognized tools.

====Chemicals, Oil and Gas Industries====
ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the IEC 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure scheme’s certification requirements working groups include subject matter experts from the chemical and oil and gas industries and are reflective of their cybersecurity needs.

=== IEC 62443 Certification Programs===
IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies.  Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures.  Programs are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV Sud, TÜV Nord, and SGS-TÜV Saar.

{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}
In [[Indic scripts]], the '''danda''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दण्ड ''{{IAST|daṇḍa}}'' "stick") is a [[punctuation]] [[character (computing)|character]]. The [[glyph]] consists of a single vertical stroke. The character can be found at [[character encoding|code point]] U+0964 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0964;}}) in [[Unicode]]. The "double danda" is at  U+0965 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0965;}}). [[ISCII]] encodes danda at 0xEA.

The danda marks the end of a sentence or period, comparable to a [[full stop]] (period) as commonly used in the [[Latin alphabet]], and is used alternate with Western punctuation in most modern [[Languages of India|Indic]] languages. In metrical texts, a double danda is used to delimit verses, and a single danda to delimit a [[pada (foot)|pada]] or semi-verse.

[[File:Public documents of the legislature of Connecticut, session (1882) (14763332785).jpg|thumb|alt=A drawing of the American Sign Language manual alphabet|[[Sign language]]s are an important part of Deaf culture. The American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is shown here.]]

The '''Deaf rights movement''' encompasses a series of [[social movements]] within the [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and [[Cultural diversity|cultural diversity movements]] that encourages [[Deaf|deaf and hard of hearing]] to push society to adopt a position of equal respect for them. Acknowledging that those who were hearing impaired had rights to obtain the same things as those with no hearing impairments lead this movement. Establishing an educational system to teach those with hearing impairments was one of the first accomplishments of this movement. Sign language, as well as cochlear implants, has also had an extensive impact on the Deaf community. These have all been aspects that have paved the way for those with hearing impairments, which began with the Deaf Rights movement.  
== Deaf education ==
{{main article|Deaf education}}

===Oralism===
{{main article|Oralism}}
Oralism focuses on teaching deaf students through oral communicative means rather than sign languages.

There is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the [[Oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[Lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of [[sign language]] in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is also central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]] and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

=== Deaf schools ===
Parents of deaf children also have to opportunity to send their children to deaf schools, where the curriculum is taught in [[American Sign Language]]. The first school for the education of deaf individuals was the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, which opened on April 15, 1817.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was a coeducation insitiution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/dhm/edu/essay.html?id=38|title=Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb|last=Crowley|first=John|website=www.disabilitymuseum.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was later renamed the [[American School for the Deaf]], and was granted federal money to set up of deaf institutions around the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many teachers in these schools were women, because according to PBS and the research done for the film ''Through Deaf Eyes'', they were  better at instructing due to the patience it took to do something repetitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/women.html|title=Oral Education and Women in the Classroom|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American School for the Deaf was set up based on a British model of education for deaf individuals with instruction in the subjects of reading, writing, history, math, and an advanced study of the Bible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gallaudet University]] is the only deaf university in the world, which instructs in American Sign Language, and promotes research and publications for the deaf community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/|title = Gallaudet University|website = www2.gallaudet.edu|access-date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University is responsible for expanding services and education for deaf individuals in developing countries around the world, as well as in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviewing The Pioneering Roles Of Gallaudet University Alumni In Advancing Deaf Education And Services In Developing Countries: Insights And Challenges From Nigeria." ''American Annals Of The Deaf'' 2 (2015): 75. ''Project MUSE''. Web. 15 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many deaf individuals choose to be educated in a deaf environment for their college level education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Deaf President Now ===
{{main article|Deaf President Now}}

[[I. King Jordan]] had made history in 1988 for becoming the first deaf president of [[Gallaudet University]] after the protest, ''Deaf President Now'' Students, with the support of from many alumni, faculty, staff and friends, protested the Board of Trustees' continued appointments of  hearing presidents over highly qualified deaf candidates in an institution established to serve the deaf.

=== Historical figures===
{{Main articles|List of deaf people}}
There have been many individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community. These individuals have been both deaf or hearing. A few of the most recognizable names include:
[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who is known for the invention of the telephone but to the Deaf, is seen as a villain of sorts; 
[[Heather Whitestone]], the first deaf Miss-America; 
[[Marlee Matlin]], a well known deaf actress;
[[Laurent Clerc]], a well-known deaf professor; and 
[[Helen Keller]], the most commonly known deaf-blind woman.

However, this is only a small number of individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community.

== Public accommodations ==
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], also known as the ADA, has made a huge impact on the deaf community. In 1990 it was a landmark for people with disabilities. The ADA has been a great benefit for hard of hearing and deaf people to help them gain every aspect of life that a hearing person has. The ADA took the important principles in these laws and extended them to the broad mainstream of Americans public life. It prohibits discrimination in almost every aspect of society.(26)  Meaning you would have a legitimate reason to not hire someone with a disability.  The legislation provides legal protection in employment(Title I), access to state and local government and public transportation (title II), public accommodations (Title III)(they have to provide a translator), and telecommunications (title IV). (26) George H W Bush signed this into act, and there was no acclaimed retaliation from this. It didn’t solve the problem of discrimination but it gave those who had a disability protection.

In 1975 Congress found that more than eight million children were not receiving equal education. There was another bill passed to help solve this problem called the Individual with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The IDEA was made to "ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate, public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their needs and prepare them for employment and independent living. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents are protected. To assist states, localities, educational service agencies, and federal agencies to pay for education for all children with disabilities. And finally to assess and ensure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities." (73)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National, A. O. T. D. (2015). Legal Rights, 6th Ed. : The Guide for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People. Washington, DC, US: Gallaudet University Press.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaf culture movement ==
{{main article|Deaf culture}}

Deaf culture is a culture defined by usage of sign language and many cultural and social norms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Cochlear implants===
Within the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], there is strong opposition to the use of [[cochlear implants]] and sometimes also [[hearing aids]] and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that [[deafness]], as a condition, is something that needs to be ''fixed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Bonnie Poitras|title=Deaf Culture, Cochlear Implants, and Elective Disability|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=8 July 1998|volume=28|issue=4|pages=6-14|doi=10.2307/3528607|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3528607|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to [[Deaf culture]] ''to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc''.&lt;ref name="woodcock1992"&gt;{{cite book | first=Kathryn | last=Woodcock | year=1992 | title=Cochlear Implants vs. Deaf Culture? In Mervin Garretson (ed.), ''Viewpoints on Deafness: A Deaf American Monograph''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse [[deafness]], or create a normal perception of sounds. The Deaf community still insists that a child not be fitted with a cochlear implant until old enough to decide for themselves because the affects are irreversible and could cause a lifetime of pain, regret, and hatred/isolation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8061">'''Deculturalization''' is the process by which an ethnic group is forced to abandon its language, culture, and customs. It is the destruction of the culture of a dominated group and its replacement by the culture of the dominating group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=André J|title=Deculturalization|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/diversityineducation/n190.xml|website=SAGE knowledge|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deculturalization is a slow process due to its extensive goal of fully replacing the subordinate ethnic group's culture, language, and customs. This term is often confused with [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[acculturation]].

==Methods of Deculturalization==
* [[Geographical segregation]]
* Forbidding education to the dominated group
* Forceful replacing of language
* Superior culture's curriculum in schools
* Instructors are from the dominant group
* Avoiding the dominated group's culture in curriculum

==Deculturalization in the United States==
'''African Americans'''
The enslavement of African Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States is a form of deculturalization. [[Slavery in the United States]] made the African Americans dependent on their owners allowing for the owners to exploit them. The owners removed their African names, did not allow them to read, and did not allow them to practice their culture and language. Deculturalization of African Americans stems back to When the African American slaves were forbidden access to education due to fear of a slave revolt against the slaveholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://h637-books.wikispaces.com/Deculturalization+and+the+Struggle+for+Equality&lt;/ref&gt; A series of court cases occurred in the United States helping deculturalization of African Americans as wells as there were cases that went against deculturalization. For example, the addition of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/ukhxfexpakmq/deculturalization-of-education/|title=Deculturalization of Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Civil War (United States)]] segregated education continued and was a struggle to integrate fully and completely. While integration was achieved, the textbooks that the African American students learn from are bias and contain material from the dominant, Anglo-American culture.

'''Latin Americans'''
The deculturalization of Latinos can refer back to the Mexican–American War and [[The Treaty Of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Once the United States won California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado Mexicans who were living in these areas were removed from their lands. Their identity in the United States changed constantly from Mexican to White and vice versa until the word Hispanic was created to refer to these Mexican Americans. By simply using the word Hispanic to refer to the Mexican Americans and later the Latin-American immigrants refers to the conqueror's culture-the Spanish culture. Latin@ in the United States also had segregated schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/latino/latinothemestudy/education.htm|title=Demanding their Rights: The Latino Struggle for Educational Access and Equity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools they were given second-hand material from the wealthy, Anglo schools. When Latinos were being integrated, they as well as the African Americans, were being taught from bias, Anglo-cultured, Anglo-praising textbooks. Latinos did have a win to have bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.org/resources/civilrights101/desegregation.html|title=School Desegregation and Equal Educational Opportunity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were allowed to have bilinugal education, the primary, enforced language is the English one. In some schools Latinos were corporally punished for speaking Spanish in the classroom. In some Universities, Latinos were also forced to take many speech classes in order to remove the accents of the Latinos when they spoke English.&lt;ref&gt;http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/calabj/282/how%20to%20tame%20wild%20tongue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While that is not seen evidently in schools anymore, the education system continues to enforce English, Anglo-American customs, culture and language as the dominant one.

'''Asian Americans'''
Asian Americans began to be deculturalized by not being allowed to be naturalized, the Chinese-Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment, forbidding land ownership, and enforcing the Anglo-culture onto them. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] did not allow for the Chinese along with other Asians to become naturalized, because the naturalization process was limited only to the Anglo community in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaasu.org/site/important-dates-in-asian-american-history/|title=Important Dates in Asian American History - East Coast Asian American Student Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of schooling, in some cases Asian Americans were denied an education entirely. It was not until the 1900s when Asian Americans were allowed to receive an education through the implementation of certain provisions. In 1855, the Chan Yong case fortified that the Chinese are not "white" therefore ineligible for citizenship due to the Naturalization Act of 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/mit2005/Winter/History/RacismTimelin2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1922, the court case Ozawa v. United States, the Japanese man understood he was not allowed to be naturalized due to the former act, but asked for the Japanese to be considered white, but was denied the request.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"/&gt; The Ozawa v. United States shows how some Asians would rather refer to themselves as white than as Japanese or their individual ethnic group, because of the advantages that being "white" bring. The enforced Anglo-American culture upon the Asians and using them during the Cold War as a model minority that the United States is not racist, it is the individual's fault allows for deculturalization to be successful. [[Jade Snow Wong]] is a Chinese-American writer who was used by the American government to travel to the Asian world and show how an Asian can succeed in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1790878/_Americas_Chinese_Anti-Communism_Citizenship_and_Cultural_Diplomacy_During_the_Cold_War|title="America's Chinese": Anti-Communism, Citizenship, and Cultural Diplomacy During the Cold War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Americans'''
Once the first settlement in Jamestown 1607 occurred, the Pre-American deculturalization process began. When the English came to America they looked to the Native Americans as "pagans" and "savages". Native Americans believed that the land was not property, a thing to be claimed and owned. Once the English settlers arrived this was one of the major culture difference that needed to be extinguished. The idea of private property and ownership was enforced upon the Native Americans. While even those who accepted it, because they understood the consequences, their lands were taken away. They wanted to impose the traditional "Christian" nuclear family as well among the Native Americans. In order to gain success the colonists made Native American Educational Programs. Christian missionaries such as John Eliot learned the Native American language in order to convert them into Christianity began the segregation among the "pagans" and the "holy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/11onrwncpstw/deculturalization-theory/|title=Deculturalization Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans were exploited. There was a cultural genocide and simply genocide against the Native Americans. From the Trail of Tears to the appropriation of their designs in order to gain capital, corporate gains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8548">'''Design-based learning''' ('''DBL'''), also known as '''design-based instruction''', is an [[inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based]] form of learning, or [[pedagogy]], that is based on integration of [[design thinking]] and the [[design process]] into the classroom at the [[K-12]] and [[post-secondary]] levels.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/inquiry-project-learning-research Powerful Learning: Studies Show Deep Understanding Derives from Collaborative Methods, By Brigid Barron, Linda Darling-Hammond, in Edutopia, October 8, 2008].

Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Design-based [[learning environment]]s can be found across many disciplines, including those traditionally associated with design (e.g. art, architecture, engineering, interior design, graphic design), as well as others not normally considered to be design-related (science, technology, business, humanities).&lt;ref name="Edutopia2"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/pdfs/edutopia-teaching-for-meaningful-learning.pdf ''Teaching for meaningful learning,'' Edutopia].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anneburdick.com/Design-wo-Designers/Burdick_Design_wo_Designers.pdf ''Design Without Designers,'' Diane Burdick, May 2009].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  DBL, as well as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]], is used to teach [[21st century skills]] such as [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] and foster [[deeper learning]].&lt;ref name="KSBE"&gt;[http://www.ksbe.edu/_assets/spi/pdfs/21_century_skills_full.pdf  ''21st Century Skills - for Students and Teachers'', Research and Evaluation, August 2010, Kamehameha Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper learning is supported when students design and create an artifact that requires understanding and application of knowledge. DBL activity supports [[iteration]] as students create, assess, and redesign their projects. The work's complexity often requires collaboration and specialized roles, providing students with the opportunity to become “experts” in a particular area.  Design projects require students to establish goals and constraints, generate ideas, and create prototypes through [[storyboarding]] or other representational practices.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt; [[Robotics]] competitions in schools are popular design-based learning activities, wherein student teams design, build and then pilot their robots in competitive challenges. 
 
Design-based learning was developed in the 1980s by Doreen Nelson, a professor at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] and the [[Art Center College of Design]]. Her findings suggested that [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic problem-solving]] helps students acquire, retain, and synthesize information in practical ways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/partnerships-grants/tiip/showcase/virgil-project-portfolio/design-based-learning Design based learning, UCLA].

==Design process==

The design process is an iterative process that has a variety of sequential steps:&lt;ref name="Mehalik"&gt;[http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/Schunn/research/papers/MehaliketalJEE2008.pdf ''Middle-School Science Through Design- Based Learning versus Scripted Inquiry: Better Overall Science Concept Learning and Equity Gap Reduction'', Mehalik, Doppelt, Schunn.

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]
A similar approach is the [[ADDIE Model]] of [[instructional design]], a framework of generic processes used by instructional designers and [[Training and development|training developers]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Gary R. Designing Effective Instruction, 6th Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a descriptive guideline with five distinct phases:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation

==Results==
Positive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt; The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt;  A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser &amp; Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students’ desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase  interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v19n2/doppelt ''Engagement and Achievements:  A Case Study of Design-Based Learning in a Science Context,'' Doppelt, Mehalik, Schunn, Silk, Krysinski].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Significant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;  Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system’s parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, &amp; Kolodner, 2000).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;

A 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems.  The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups and individual students.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The teaching of [[21st century skills]] is more effective when teachers gain expertise in both the practice and the teaching of these skills, in effect becoming successful 21st century learners in the areas of:  communication and collaboration amongst teachers and with students; being flexible with new classroom dynamics; fostering independent student learning; adapting teaching and learning styles to new pedagogical approaches.

Challenges to implementing DBL include developing the skills of the instructors:&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt; 
* teachers' ability to select topics and activities that support, and benefit from, differing viewpoints and students' real-world experiences 
* selecting students who will work well together
* setting of effective ground rules to ensure equal opportunities to participate, 
* encouraging multiple strategies to foster full participation for all members of a group of team.

'''Electromagnetism''' is a branch of [[physics]] involving the study of the '''electromagnetic force''', a type of [[physical interaction]] that occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles. The electromagnetic force usually exhibits [[electromagnetic field]]s such as [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and [[light]], and is one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s (commonly called forces) in [[nature]]. The other three fundamental interactions are the [[strong interaction]], the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ravaioli|first1=Fawwaz T. Ulaby, Eric Michielssen, Umberto|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-13-213931-1|page=13|edition=6th|ref=Ulaby13}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [[electroweak interaction|electroweak force]].
[[File:Lightning.0257.jpg|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an [[electrostatic discharge]] that travels between two charged regions.]]
Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the [[Lorentz force]], which includes both [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life.  Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of [[intermolecular force]]s between individual atoms and [[molecule]]s in matter, and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force. [[Electron]]s are bound by the electromagnetic force to [[atomic nuclei]], and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions between the [[Molecular orbital|electrons]] of neighboring atoms.

There are numerous [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]].  In [[classical electrodynamics]], electric fields are described as [[electric potential]] and [[electric current]]. In [[Faraday law of induction|Faraday's law]], [[magnetic field]]s are associated with [[electromagnetic induction]] and magnetism, and [[Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.

The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the "medium" of propagation ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]]), led to the development of [[special relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905.

==History of the theory==
[[File:Ørsted.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hans Christian Ørsted]].]]
{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory}}

Originally, electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1873 ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:
# Electric charges ''{{vanchor|attract}}'' or ''{{vanchor|repel}}'' one another with a force [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract, like ones repel.
# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.
# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire.  Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.

[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[André-Marie Ampère]]]]
While preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a [[compass needle]] deflected away from [[magnetic north]] when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off. This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.
[[File:SS-faraday.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]
At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[CGS]] unit of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

[[File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in [[electrodynamics]]. They influenced French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by [[Michael Faraday]], extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and partially reformulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]], is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]]. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of [[light]]. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] are at present seen as taking the form of [[quantum|quantized]], self-propagating [[oscillation|oscillatory]] electromagnetic field disturbances called [[photon]]s. Different [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillation give rise to the different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], from [[radio wave]]s at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to [[gamma ray]]s at the highest frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, so if current flew across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martins |first1=Roberto de Andrade |title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times |chapter=Romagnosi and Volta's Pile: Early Difficulties in the Interpretation of Voltaic Electricity |volume=vol. 3 |editors=Fabio Bevilacqua and Lucio Fregonese (eds) |publisher=Università degli Studi di Pavia |pages=81–102 |url=http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200951/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap4/4.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson.&lt;ref&gt;  VIII. An account of an extraordinary effect of lightning in communicating magnetism. Communicated by Pierce Dod, M.D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire.
Phil. Trans. 1735 39, 74-75, published 1 January 1735 &lt;/ref&gt; The account stated, "A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ...  and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &amp;c.  ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found
to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing
needles, and other iron things of considerable weight ..."   [[E. T. Whittaker]] suggested in 1910 that 
this particular event was responsible for lightning to be "credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars." &lt;ref&gt; Whittaker, E. T. (1910). A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity from the Age of Descartes to the Close of the Nineteenth Century. Longmans, Green and Company.

The electromagnetic force is one of the four known [[fundamental force]]s. The other fundamental forces are:
* the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which binds to all known particles in the [[Standard Model]], and causes certain forms of [[radioactive decay]]. (In [[particle physics]] though, the [[electroweak interaction]] is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);
* the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark]]s to form [[nucleon]]s, and binds nucleons to form [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]
* the [[gravity|gravitational force]].
All other forces (e.g., [[friction]], contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).&lt;ref&gt;Browne, "Physics for Engineering and Science," p 160: "Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. The other forces such as friction, tension, and the normal force are derived from the electric force, another of the fundamental forces. Gravity is a rather weak force... The electric force between two protons is much stronger than the gravitational force between them."&lt;/ref&gt;

The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between [[atom]]s can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[electron]]s of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in "pushing" or "pulling" ordinary material objects, which result from the [[intermolecular force]]s that act between the individual [[molecule]]s in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of [[chemistry|chemical phenomena]].

A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Pauli exclusion principle]]. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, "Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Edition," p 546: Ch 11 Section 6, "Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical electrodynamics==
{{Main article|Classical electrodynamics}}

In 1600, [[ William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] proposed, in his ''[[De Magnete]]'', that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed experiments in 1752.  One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was [[Romagnosi]], who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a [[voltaic pile]] deflected a nearby [[compass]] needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment.&lt;ref name='Oersted'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html |title=Magnetic Fields -- History |accessdate=2009-11-27 |last=Stern |first=Dr. David P. |first2=Mauricio |last2=Peredo |date=2001-11-25 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as [[classical electromagnetism]], was developed by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|treatise]] by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p 436. Chapter 9.3, "Maxwell's description of the electromagnetic field was essentially complete."&lt;/ref&gt; In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]], and the electromagnetic force is given by the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]].&lt;ref&gt;Purcell: p 278: Chapter 6.1, "Definition of the Magnetic Field." Lorentz force and force equation.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with [[classical mechanics]], but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] of [[free space]]. This violates [[Galilean invariance]], a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a [[luminiferous aether]] through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré]], in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see [[History of special relativity]].)

In addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term "electromagnetism". (For more information, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]] and [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].)

==Extension to nonlinear phenomena==
[[File:Sun in X-Ray.png|thumb|300px|[[Magnetic reconnection]] in the solar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] gives rise to [[solar flare]]s, a complex magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon.]]
The Maxwell equations are ''linear,'' in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. [[Nonlinear system|Nonlinear dynamics]] can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], which combines Maxwell theory with the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

==Quantities and units==
{{see also|List of physical quantities|List of electromagnetism equations}}
'''Electromagnetic units''' are part of a system of electrical units based primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents, the fundamental SI unit being the ampere. The units are:
{{Div col}}
*[[ampere]] (electric current)
*[[coulomb]] (electric charge)
*[[farad]] (capacitance)
*[[henry (unit)|henry]] (inductance)
*[[ohm]] (resistance)
*[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (conductance)
*[[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (magnetic flux density)
*[[volt]] (electric potential)
*[[watt]] (power)
*[[weber (unit)|weber]] (magnetic flux)
{{Div col end}}
In the electromagnetic [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via [[Ampère's law]] and takes the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.

{{SI electromagnetism units}}

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Heaviside–Lorentz]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase "CGS units" is often used to refer specifically to [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian units]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16808">''Energy recycling'' is the [[energy recovery]] process of utilizing energy that would normally be wasted, usually by converting it into [[electricity]] or [[thermal energy]].  Undertaken at manufacturing facilities, power plants, and large institutions such as hospitals and universities, it significantly increases efficiency, thereby reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas pollution simultaneously.  The process is noted for its potential to mitigate global warming profitably.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/467/|title=The Unsung Solution: What rhymes with waste heat recovery?|work=[[Orion Magazine, November/December 2007]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work is usually done in the form of [[combined heat and power]] (also called [[cogeneration]]) or [[waste heat recovery]].

== Forms of energy recycling ==
'''[[Waste heat]] recovery''' is a process that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam, or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air, water, glycol, or oil.&lt;ref name="thecmmgroup.com"&gt;[http://www.thecmmgroup.com/energy-recovery-systems Energy Recovery Systems], The CMM Group.&lt;/ref&gt; A "waste heat recovery boiler" contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released. When high-temperature heat meets the boiler, steam is produced, which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity. This process is similar to that of other fired boilers, but in this case, waste heat replaces a traditional flame. No fossil fuels are used in this process. Metals, glass, pulp and paper, silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"/&gt;

'''Waste heat recovery from air conditioning''' is also used as an alternative to wasting heat to the atmosphere from chiller plants. Heat recovered in summer from chiller plants is stored in Thermalbanks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html 'Thermalbanks']&lt;/ref&gt; in the ground and recycled back to the same building in winter via a heat pump to provide heating without burning fossil fuels. This elegant approach saves energy - and carbon - in both seasons by recycling summer heat for winter use.

'''[[Combined heat and power]] (CHP)''', also called [[cogeneration]], is, according to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], “an efficient, clean, and reliable approach to generating electricity and heat energy from a single fuel source. By installing a CHP system designed to meet the thermal and electrical base loads of a facility, CHP can greatly increase the facility's operational efficiency and decrease energy costs. At the same time, CHP reduces the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global climate change.”   When electricity is produced on-site with a CHP plant, excess heat is recycled to produce both processed heat and additional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/|title=Combined Heat and Power Partnership|work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|title=Clean Heat and Power Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701010700/http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enabling technologies:'''  [[Heat pumps]] and [[thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the recycling of energy that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Capability to increase power output and capacity, with improved fuel efficiency.
* ETC system integration offers a step change in efficiency without increasing service or maintenance requirements.
* The cost of generating power through waste heat recovery is substantially less than burning more fuel, even with low diesel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==== Disadvantages of using ETC ====
* Upfront costs incur an additional expense for businesses.
* The need to update existing turbomachinery and recertification of the unit adds additional costs and can be time consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.

Both waste heat recovery and CHP constitute "decentralized" energy production, which is in contrast to traditional "centralized" power generated at large power plants run by regional utilities.&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"/&gt;  The “centralized” system has an average efficiency of 34 percent, requiring about three units of fuel to produce one unit of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/fuelelectric.html|title=Electricity|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By capturing both heat and power, CHP and waste heat recovery projects have higher efficiencies.

A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of CHP in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hedman, Energy and Environmental Analysis/USCHPA, "Combined Heat and Power and Heat Recovery as Energy Efficiency Options", Briefing to Senate Renewable Energy Caucus, September 10, 2007, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/843010-3bxGVs/native/843010.pdf|title=Clean Energy Technologies: a Preliminary Inventory of the Potential for Electricity Generation, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, 4/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies suggest about 200,000 megawatts—or 20% -- of total power capacity that could come from energy recycling in the U.S.  Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat2p2.html|title=The Energy Information Administration, Existing Capacity by Energy Source, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, as of 2005, about 42 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27 percent from the production of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks |work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218171807/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |archivedate=2011-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/emission.html|title=Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005|work=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]],}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. takes advantage of recycling energy in [[heat recovery ventilation]] and latent heat pump and CHCP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recyclingenergy.com RecyclingEnergy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by [[Thomas Edison]].  His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world’s first commercial power plant, was a CHP plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=[[Cogeneration Technologies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities.  These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as CHP.  They even went so far as to make it illegal for non-utilities to sell power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/~finance/hearings/testimony/2007test/052407testsc.pdf
|title=Testimony of Sean Casten before Senate subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, 5/27/07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers. CHP plants proliferated, soon producing about 8 percent of all energy in the U.S.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.localpower.org|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy, 5/06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.

In 2008 [[Tom Casten]], chairman of [[Recycled Energy Development]], said that "''We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.''"&lt;ref name=npr2008may22/&gt;

Outside the U.S., energy recycling is more common. Denmark is probably the most active energy recycler, obtaining about 55% of its energy from CHP and waste heat recovery. Other large countries, including Germany, Russia, and India, also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr2008may22&gt;

'''Female sabotage''' is an [[evolutionary theory]] regarding the propensity of certain females to select "burdened" males of their species for mating.

==History==
Soon after [[Charles Darwin]] published his theory of [[Natural Selection]], he was faced with a puzzle.  If natural selection suggests "[[survival of the fittest]]," then why do some males have traits that detract from their survival?  For instance, the [[peacock]] grows a colorful, cumbersome tail that not only attracts [[predator]]s, but makes it difficult for him to escape those predators.  Similarly, the buck grows enormous [[antler]]s which are heavy to carry and can easily become tangled in branches, interfering with effective escape from pursuing [[hunter]]s.

Of course, Darwin knew that there was more to natural selection than simple [[Survival of the fittest|fitness]].  An equally important part of the struggle of life regards reproduction.  In this case, the question becomes, "Why would a female burden her offspring with dangerous traits by mating with a similarly burdened male?"

Noting that the males with burdensome traits are almost entirely those in [[polygamous]] species, where a minority of males generally mate with many females, Darwin had an insight.  He realized that if females found these male burdens more "attractive," and if that attractiveness resulted in more matings by burdened males, then the increase in matings of a few sons might offset the death of many other sons as a result of the burden.  In effect, if the success of the surviving males produced enough offspring to cover more than the loss of potential offspring from their lost brothers, then the female who mated with a burdened male had chosen correctly.

==The female sabotage theory==
In 1996, however, Joe Abraham presented a re-interpretation of the problem.  In polygamous species, males generally contribute nothing to the nurturing of offspring, but nevertheless continue to consume finite resources.  In such situations, males effectively become competitors with females and young once they are finished mating.  This gives females a reason to sabotage males, and mating gives them an opportunity to do so.  By choosing to mate exclusively with males who are unlikely to survive because of their burdens, the females ensure that as the males die, more food and other resources will remain for females and their young.  Because females are the limiting resource in most species, as their numbers increase, population fitness will also increase.

Just as a given amount of land can only produce a finite amount of grazing, and a limited amount of grazing can only support a limited number of grazing animals, so a given number of grazing animals can only sustain a limited number of predators.  Similar limitations apply to all living things, and are known as the [[carrying capacity]] of a physical area.  If males' burdens are more likely to draw the interest of local predators, then such males effectively shift predation away from females and their young.  In this case, the females and young will gain an added benefit from decreased predation, and enjoy even higher rates of survivability.

Abraham's explanation reunites the major split in [[sexual selection]]—intrasexual selection (male combat) and intersexual selection (female choice)--together under one rubric.  Under female sabotage, the increase in resources becomes the critical factor, and the cause of increased male mortality is secondary.  The theory also offers new, [[feminist]] approaches to [[Lek (biology)|leks]], [[harem]]s, resource guarding and mate location.

Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Abraham's explanation, however, is that it can easily work with any of the many current theories of sexual selection, and must play some role in them.  An increase in resources and a decrease in predation for females and their young is an inevitable result of increased male mortality, regardless of what mechanism drives females to mate with males carrying burdensome traits.

[[File:Firn field on the top of Säuleck.jpg|thumb|right|Firn field on the top of [[Säuleck]], [[Hohe Tauern]]]]
'''Firn''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪər|n}}; from [[Swiss German]] {{lang|gsw|firn}} "last year's", cognate with ''before'') is partially compacted [[névé]], a type of [[snow]] that has been left over from past seasons and has been [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallized]] into a substance denser than névé. It is [[ice]] that is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice. Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but has a hardness that makes it extremely resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from 0.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm³ to 0.83&amp;nbsp;g/cm³,&lt;ref&gt;Cuffey and Paterson (2010), The Physics of Glaciers 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a [[glacier]].

[[Snowflake]]s are compressed under the weight of the overlying [[snowpack]]. Individual [[crystal]]s near the melting point are semiliquid and slick, allowing them to glide along other crystal planes and to fill in the spaces between them, increasing the ice's density. Where the crystals touch they bond together, squeezing the air between them to the surface or into bubbles.

In the summer months, the crystal metamorphosis can occur more rapidly because of water percolation between the crystals. By summer's end, the result is firn.

The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the ''firn limit'', ''firn line'' or ''snowline''.

== Other uses ==
In colloquial and technical language, 'firn' is used to describe certain forms of [[Snow#By age|old snow or harsch]]:
* Old snowfields or [[névé]] (''Firnfelder''), even if the snow is not yet one year old
* the more recent snow layers of a glacier (a 'firned' glacier)
* the uppermost, soft layer of snow that is frozen overnight and, as a result of spring sunshine and high air temperatures, forms on an area of old snow or ''[[harsch]]'' (a slope ''firns up''; in Switzerland called ''Sulz'', but this term in Germany refers to a certain depth at which skiing downhill is no longer enjoyable)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17871">'''Genetic purging''' is the reduction of the frequency of a deleterious [[allele]], caused by an increased efficiency of natural selection prompted by [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Dorado |first1=A. |title=On the consequences of ignoring purging on genetic recommendations of MVP rules |journal=Heredity |date=15 April 2015 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2015.28 |volume=115 |pages=185–187|pmc=4814235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purging occurs because many deleterious alleles only express all their harmful effect when [[homozygous]], present in two copies. During inbreeding, as related individuals mate, they produce offspring that are more likely to be homozygous. Deleterious alleles appear more often, making individuals less fit genetically, i.e. they pass fewer copies of their genes to future generations. Put another way, [[natural selection]] purges the deleterious alleles.

Purging reduces both the overall number of recessive deleterious alleles and the decline of mean fitness caused by inbreeding (the [[inbreeding depression]] for fitness).

The term "purge" is sometimes used for selection against deleterious alleles in a general way. It would avoid ambiguity to use "[[purifying selection]]" in that general context, and to reserve purging to its more strict meaning defined above.

== The mechanism ==

Deleterious alleles segregating in populations of [[diploid]] organisms have a remarkable trend to be, at least, partially recessive. This means that, when they occur in homozygosis (double copies), they reduce [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by more than twice than when they occur in heterozygosis (single copy). In other words, part of their potential deleterious effect is hidden in heterozygosis but expressed in homozygosis, so that selection is more efficient against them when they occur in homozygosis. Since inbreeding increases the probability of being homozygous, it increases the fraction of the potential deleterious effect that is expressed and, therefore, exposed to selection. This causes some increase in the selective pressure against (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, which is known as purging. Of course, it also causes some reduction in fitness, which is known as [[inbreeding depression]].

Purging can reduce the average frequency of deleterious alleles across the genome below the value expected in a non-inbred population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glémin|first=S|year=2003|title=How are deleterious mutations purged? Drift versus nonrandom mating|journal=Evolution|volume=57|pages=2678–2687|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01512.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this reduction usually does not compensate for all the negative effects of inbreeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedrick|first1=P. W.|first2=S. T.|last2=Kalinowski|year=2000|title=Inbreeding depression in conservation biology|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=31|pages=139–162|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has several beneficial consequences for fitness. A consequence is the reduction of the so-called inbreeding load. This means that, after purging, further inbreeding is expected to be less harmful. But the most immediate consequence is the reduction of the actual inbreeding depression of fitness: due to purging, mean fitness declines less than would be expected just from inbreeding and, after some initial decline, it can even rebound up to almost its value before inbreeding.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last=García-Dorado|first=A|year=2012|title=Understanding and predicting the fitness decline of shrunk populations: inbreeding, purging, mutation and standard selection|journal=Genetics|volume=190|pages=1461–1476|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.135541|pmid=22298709|pmc=3316656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The joint effect of inbreeding and purging on fitness ==

Accounting for purging when predicting inbreeding depression is important in evolutionary genetics, because the fitness decline caused by inbreeding can be determinant in the evolution of [[diploidy]], sexual reproduction and other main biological features. It is also important in animal breeding and, of course, in [[conservation genetics]], because inbreeding depression may be a relevant factor determining the extinction risk of endangered populations, and because conservation programs can allow some breeding handling in order to control inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankham|first=R|year=2005|title=Genetics and extinction|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=126|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, Due to purging, inbreeding depression is not proportional to the standard measure of inbreeding (Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), since this measure only applies to [[Neutral evolution|neutral]] alleles. Instead, fitness decline is proportional to "purged inbreeding" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which gives the probability of being homozygous for deleterious alleles due to inbreeding, taking into account how they are being purged.

Purging reduces inbreeding depression in two ways: first, it slows its progress; second, it reduces the overall inbreeding depression expected in the long term. The slower the progress of inbreeding, the more efficient is purging.

=== A more detailed explanation ===

In the absence of natural selection, mean fitness would be expected to decline exponentially as inbreeding increases, where inbreeding is measured using Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crow|first1=J.F.|first2=M.|last2=Kimura|year=1970|title=An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the reason why decline is exponential on {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of linear is just that fitness is usually considered a multiplicative trait). The rate at which fitness declines as {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases (the inbreeding depression rate ''δ'') depends on the frequencies and deleterious effects of the alleles present in the population before inbreeding.

The above coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is the standard measure of inbreeding, and gives the probability that, at any given neutral locus, an individual has inherited two copies of a same gene of a common ancestor (i.e. the probability of being homozygous "by descent"). In simple conditions, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can be easily computed in terms of population size or of genealogical information. {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is often denoted using lowercase ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;f&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), but should not be confused with the coancestry coefficient.

However, the above prediction for the fitness decline rarely applies, since it was derived assuming no selection, and fitness is precisely the target trait of [[natural selection]]. Thus, Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} for neutral loci does not apply to deleterious alleles, unless inbreeding increases so fast that the change in gene frequency is governed just by random sampling (i.e., by [[genetic drift]]).

Therefore, the decline of fitness should be predicted using, instead of the standard inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, a "purged inbreeding coefficient" ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) that gives the probability of being homozygous by descent for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, taking into account how their frequency is reduced by purging.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Due to purging, fitness declines at the same rate {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/var&gt;}} than in the absence of selection, but as a function of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.
 
This purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can also be computed, to a good approximation, using simple expressions in terms of the population size or of the genealogy of individuals (see BOX 1). However this requires some information on the magnitude of the deleterious effects that are hidden in the heterozygous condition but become expressed in homozygosis. The larger this magnitude, denoted purging coefficient ''d'', the more efficient is purging.

An interesting property of purging is that, during inbreeding, while {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases approaching a final value {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can approach a much smaller final value. Hence, it is not just that purging slows the fitness decline, but also that it reduces the overall fitness loss produced by inbreeding in the long term. This is illustrated in BOX 2 for the extreme case of inbreeding depression caused by recessive lethals, which are alleles that cause death before reproduction but only when they occur in homozygosis. Purging is less effective against mildly deleterious alleles than against lethal ones but, in general, the slower is the increase of inbreeding {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, the smaller becomes the final value of the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and, therefore, the final reduction in fitness. This implies that, if inbreeding progresses slowly enough, no relevant inbreeding depression is expected in the long term. This results in the fitness of a small population, that has been a small population for a long time, can be the same as a large population with more genetic diversity. In conservation genetics, it would be very useful to ascertain the maximum rate of increase of inbreeding that allows for such efficient purging.

== Examples ==

=== Predictive equations when inbreeding is due to small population size ===
Consider a large non-inbred population with mean fitness {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. Then, the size of the population reduces to a new smaller value {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;N&lt;/VAR&gt;}} (in fact, the [[effective population size]] should be used here), leading to a progressive increase of inbreeding.

Then inbreeding depression occurs at a rate {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, due to (partially) recessive deleterious alleles that were present at low frequencies at different loci. This means that, in the absence of selection, the expected value for mean fitness after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding, would be:

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta F_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is the population mean for Wright's inbreeding coefficient after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, since selection operates upon fitness, mean fitness should be predicted taking into acco naveenraj unt both inbreeding and purging, as

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta g_t}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation, &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; is the average "purged inbreeding coefficient" after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt; It depends upon the "purging coefficient" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;d&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which represents the deleterious effects that are hidden in heterozygosis but exposed in homozygosis.

The average "purged inbreeding coefficient" can be approximated using the recurrent expression

&lt;math&gt;g_t = \left [ \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2N} \right ) g_{t-1} + \frac{1}{2N} \right ] \left [ 1 - 2dF_{t-1} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

There are also predictive equations to be used with genealogical information.

=== The example of inbreeding depression due to recessive lethals ===
[[File:Fitness decline from lethals vs generations of inbreeding.tif|thumb|200px|Average population fitness ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) against number of generations ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) of maintenance with population size N=10 when, in the original population, individuals carried on the average one rare recessive lethal. Evolution of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}} expected only from inbreeding (red line) or from inbreeding and purging (blue line).]]
As an example of genetic purging, consider a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles. Although about 63% of the individuals carry at least one of these lethal alleles, almost none carry two copies of the same lethal. Therefore, since lethals are considered completely recessive (i.e., they are harmless in heterozygosis), they cause almost no deaths. Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say ''N''=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them. The figure to the right gives the expected decline of fitness against the number of generations, taking into account just the increase in inbreeding {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} (red line), or both inbreeding and purging (blue line, computed using the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}). This example shows that purging can be very efficient preventing inbreeding depression. However, for non-lethal deleterious alleles, the efficiency of purging would be smaller, and it can require larger populations to overcome genetic drift.

=== Genome renewal ===
The yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] and [[Saccharomyces paradoxus]] have a life cycle that alternates between long periods of [[asexual reproduction]] as a diploid, ending in [[meiosis]] that is usually immediately followed [[selfing]], with only rare [[outcrossing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=I. J.|last2=Bensasson|first2=D.|last3=Burt|first3=A.|last4=Koufopanou|first4=V.|title=Population genomics of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus: Quantifying the life cycle|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=14 March 2008|volume=105|issue=12|pages=4957–4962|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707314105|pmid=18344325|pmc=2290798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during the diploid expansion phase, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed "genome renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mortimer|first1=Robert K.|last2=Romano|first2=Patrizia|last3=Suzzi|first3=Giovanna|last4=Polsinelli|first4=Mario|title=Genome renewal: A new phenomenon revealed from a genetic study of 43 strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae derived from natural fermentation of grape musts|journal=Yeast|date=December 1994|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1543–1552|doi=10.1002/yea.320101203|pmid=7725789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masel|first1=Joanna |author1link=Joanna Masel|last2=Lyttle|first2=David N.|title=The consequences of rare sexual reproduction by means of selfing in an otherwise clonally reproducing species|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2011|volume=80|issue=4|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2011.08.004|pmid=21888925|pmc=3218209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and problems ==
When a previously stable population undergoes inbreeding, if nothing else changes, natural selection should consist mainly of purging. The joint consequences of inbreeding and purging on fitness vary depending on many factors: the previous history of the population, the rate of increase of inbreeding, the harshness of the environment or of the competitive conditions, etc. The effects of purging were first noted by Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C. R.|authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1876|title=The effects of cross and selffertilisation in the vegetable kingdom|location=London|publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; in plants, and have been detected in laboratory experiments and in vertebrate populations undergoing inbreeding in zoos or in the wild, as well as in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crnokrak|first1=P.|last2=Barrett|first2=S. C. H.|year=2002|title=Purging the genetic load: a review of the experimental evidence|journal=Evolution|volume=56|pages=2347–2358|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00160.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of purging is often obscured by many factors, but there is consistent evidence that, in agreement with the predictions explained above, slow inbreeding results in more efficient purging, so that a given inbreeding F leads to less threat to population viability if it has been produced more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leberg|first1=P. L.|last2=Firmin|first2=B. D.|year=2008|title=Role of inbreeding depression and purging in captive breeding and restoration programmes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=334–343|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03433.x|pmid=18173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in practical situations, the genetic change in fitness also depends on many other factors, besides inbreeding and purging. For example, adaptation to changing environmental conditions often causes relevant genetic changes during inbreeding. Furthermore, if inbreeding is due to a reduction in population size, selection against new deleterious [[mutation]]s can become less efficient, and this can induce additional fitness decline in the medium-long term.

In addition, part of the inbreeding depression could not be due to deleterious alleles, but to an intrinsic advantage of being heterozygous compared to being homozygous for any available allele, which is known as overdominance. Inbreeding depression caused by overdominance cannot be purged, but seems to be a minor cause of overall inbreeding depression, although its actual importance is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=JF|year=2008|title=Mid-century controversies in population genetics|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=42|pages=1–16|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091612|pmid=18652542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, predicting the actual evolution of fitness during inbreeding is highly elusive. However, the component of fitness decline expected from inbreeding and purging on deleterious alleles could be predicted using {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8483">[[File:Gorgoneion Regnaudin Amelot de Bisseuil.jpg|thumb|A wooden door panel intended to guard the house from an unwelcome guest ([[Thomas Regnaudin]], former Hôtel des Ambassadeurs de Hollande, rue vieille du Temple, Paris c. 1660).]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

{{Human growth and development}}
'''Human embryogenesis''' refers to the development and formation of the human [[embryo]]. It is characterised by the process of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the [[embryo]] that occurs during the early stages of [[Human development (biology)|development]]. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[sperm]] cell successfully enters and fuses with an [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of [[prenatal development]] commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].
'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is nine months or 38 weeks.
 
The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.

In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.

== Germinal stage ==

=== Fertilization ===
{{Main|Human fertilization}}
Fertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[Mitotic division|mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.

Successful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |format= |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.

=== Cleavage ===
{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}
[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]
The beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&amp;pg=PA27|author1=Forgács, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.  When eight [[blastomere]]s have formed they begin to develop [[gap junction]]s, enabling them to develop in an integrated way and co-ordinate their response to physiological signals and environmental cues.&lt;ref name="BrisonSturmey2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brison|first1=D.

When the cells number around sixteen the solid sphere of cells within the zona pellucida is referred to as a [[morula]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Boklage, Charles E.|title=How New Humans Are Made: Cells and Embryos, Twins and Chimeras, Left and Right, Mind/Self/Soul, Sex, and Schizophrenia|publisher=World Scientific|year=2009|isbn=978-981-283-513-0|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7GfgRIgP9YC&amp;pg=PT233}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage the cells start to [[cell junction|bind]] firmly together in a process called compaction, and cleavage continues as [[cellular differentiation]].

=== Blastulation ===
{{Further |Polarity in embryogenesis}}
[[File:Blastocyst English.svg|thumb|200px|Blastocyst with an [[inner cell mass]] and [[trophoblast]].]]
Cleavage itself is the first stage in [[blastulation]], the process of forming the [[blastocyst]]. Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the [[trophoblast]]) and an [[inner cell mass]]. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the [[zona pellucida]]. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis |polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the blastula.) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to hatch through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

The inner cell mass will give rise to the embryo proper, the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer. The embryo plus its [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s is called the [[conceptus]], and by this stage the conceptus has reached the [[uterus]]. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, and the now exposed cells of the trophoblast allow the blastocyst to attach itself to the [[endometrium]], where it will [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]].
The formation of the [[hypoblast]] and [[epiblast]], which are the two main layers of the bilaminar germ disc, occurs at the beginning of the second week.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carlson |first1= Bruce M. |title= Human Embryology &amp; Developmental Biology  |publisher= Mosby, Inc. |year= 1999 |origyear=1t.

An erosion of the endothelial lining of the maternal capillaries by the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the sinusoids will form where the blood will begin to penetrate and flow through the trophoblast to give rise to the uteroplacental circulation.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Keith L. |last2=Persaud |first2=V.N. |title= The Developing Human, Clinically Oriented Embryology |publisher= W B Saunders Co |year= 2003 |origyear=1t.

Pub. 1998 |pages= 37–45 |chapter=Chapter 2: Bilaminar embryonic disc development and establishment of the uteroplacental circulation | ISBN=0-443-06583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently new cells derived from yolk sac will be established between trophoblast and exocelomic membrane and will give rise to extra-embryonic [[mesoderm]], which will form the [[chorion|chorionic cavity]].&lt;ref name=Sadler/&gt;

At the end of the second week of development, some cells of the trophoblast penetrate and form rounded columns into the syncytiotrophoblast. These columns are known as [[Chorionic villi|primary villi]]. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.&lt;ref name=Sadler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

=== Implantation ===
{{Main|Implantation (human embryo)}}
[[File:Gray36.png|thumb|200px|Trophoblast differentiation]]
After [[ovulation]], the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.

The syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden  |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston |pages = |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=0-13-250882-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.&lt;ref name=Sadler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;
Arteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.

As the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells,and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.

===Embryonic disc===
The embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].

The '''[[primitive streak]]''', a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of '''[[gastrulation]]''', which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the amnion.The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].

The three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Lawrence M. &amp; Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

The inner layer of endoderm will serve as the starting point for the development of the [[lungs]], [[intestine]], [[thyroid]], [[pancreas]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]].

Following ingression, a [[Gastrulation#Overview|blastopore]] develops where the cells have ingressed, in one side of the embryo and it deepens to become the [[archenteron]], the first formative stage of the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]. As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of [[neurulation]] can begin.

==Neurulation==
{{Main|Neurulation}}
[[File:Neural crest.svg|220px|thumb|left|Neural plate]]
[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.png|thumb|280px|Neural tube development]]
Following gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and [[nervous tissue|neural tissue]], and the gastrula is now referred to as the [[neurula]]. The [[neural plate]] that has formed as a thickened plate from the ectoderm, continues to broaden and its ends start to fold upwards as [[neural folds]]. [[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of '''[[somitogenesis]]''' will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,&lt;ref name="pmid12705871"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235–48 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009286740300268X |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the

==Development of organs and organ systems==

[[Organogenesis]] is the development of the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that begins during the third to eighth week, and continues until birth. Sometimes full development, as in the lungs, continues after birth. Different organs take part in the development of the many [[organ system]]s of the body.

===Blood===
[[Haematopoietic stem cell]]s that give rise to all the [[blood cell]]s develop from the mesoderm. The development of [[haematopoiesis|blood formation]] takes place in clusters of blood cells, known as [[blood island]]s, in the [[yolk sac]]. Blood islands develop outside the embryo, on the umbilical vesicle, allantois, connecting stalk, and chorion, from mesodermal [[hemangioblast]]s. 

In the centre of a blood island, hemangioblasts form the haematopoietic stem cells that are the precursor to all types of blood cell. In the periphery of a blood island the hemangioblasts differentiate into [[angioblast]]s the precursors to the blood vessels.&lt;ref name="LME"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sadler |first1=T.W. |title=Langman's Medical Embryology |date=2010 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp;Wilkins |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780781790697 |pages=79-81 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart and circulatory system===
{{Main|Heart development}}
{{Further |Vascular remodelling in the embryo}}
[[File:2037 Embryonic Development of Heart.jpg|thumb|right|450px]]

The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around 21 or 22 days.&lt;ref name="Anatomy &amp; physiology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J. Gordon|title=Anatomy &amp; physiology|date=2013|isbn=1938168135|url=http://cnx.org/content/m46676/latest/?collection=col11496/latest|pages=787–846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac [[myoblast]]s and [[blood islands]] in the [[splanchnopleuric mesenchyme]] on each side of the [[neural plate]], give rise to the cardiogenic region.&lt;ref name=Sadler/&gt;{{rp|165}}This is a horseshoe-shaped area near to the head of the embryo. By day 19, following [[cell signalling]], two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them. These two [[endocardial tubes]] grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the [[tubular heart]]. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the [[thoracic cavity]].&lt;ref name="Human Embryology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=W J|title=Human Embryology|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-443-06583-7|pages=170–190|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at the same time that the endocardial tubes are forming, [[vasculogenesis]] (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Human Embryology"/&gt; Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo |vascular remodelling]] takes place.

The tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].&lt;ref name="Anatomy &amp; physiology"/&gt;

Cardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] in the process of [[apoptosis]] is involved in this stage, taking place at the joining surfaces enabling fusion to take place.&lt;ref name="Human Embryology"/&gt;
In the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.

During the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.&lt;ref name="Human Embryology"/&gt;

A second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]
the [[intraventricular septum|septum inferius]] also forms which develops into the muscular [[interventricular septum]].&lt;ref name="Human Embryology"/&gt;

===Digestive system===
{{Main |Development of the digestive system}}
The digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.

=== Respiratory system ===
The respiratory system develops from the [[lung bud]], which appears in the ventral wall of the foregut about four weeks into development. The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes). Tertiary bronchi form from secondary bronchi.

While the internal lining of the [[larynx]] originates from the [[lung bud]], its cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth [[pharyngeal arch]]es.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/732776409|title=Langman's medical embryology.|last=W.)|first=Sadler, T. W. (Thomas|date=2012|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Langman, Jan.|isbn=9781451113426|edition=12th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=732776409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urinary system ===
{{Main|Development of the urinary system|Kidney development}}

==== Kidneys ====
Three different [[kidney]] systems form in the developing embryo: the [[pronephros]], the [[mesonephros]] and the [[Kidney development#Metanephros|metanephros]]. Only the metanephros develops into the permanent kidney. All three are derived from the [[intermediate mesoderm]]. 

===== Pronephros =====
The [[pronephros]] derives from the intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region. It is not functional and degenerates before the end of the fourth week.

===== Mesonephros =====
The [[mesonephros]] derives from intermediate mesoderm in the upper thoracic to upper lumbar segments. Excretory tubules are formed and enter the [[mesonephric duct]], which ends in the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]]. The mesonephric duct atrophies in females, but participate in [[development of the reproductive system]] in males.

===== Metanephros =====
The metanephros appears in the fifth week of development. An outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, the [[ureteric bud]], penetrates metanephric tissue to form the primitive [[renal pelvis]], [[Renal calyx|renal calyces]] and [[renal pyramids]]. The [[ureter]] is also formed.

==== Bladder and urethra ====
Between the fourth and seventh weeks of development, the [[urorectal septum]] divides the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]] into the [[urogenital sinus]] and the [[anal canal]]. The upper part of the urogenital sinus forms the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], while the lower part forms the [[urethra]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Reproductive system ===
{{Main|Development of the reproductive system}}
{{Further|Development of the gonads}}

=== Integumentary system ===
{{Further|Human skin colour}}
The superficial layer of the [[human skin|skin]], the [[epidermis]], is derived from the [[ectoderm]]. The deeper layer, the [[dermis]], is derived from [[mesenchyme]].

The formation of the epidermis begins in the second month of development and it acquires its definitive arrangement at the end of the fourth month. The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual [[Epidermis#Layers|layers of the epidermis]].

The mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources:

* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]
* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from [[paraxial mesoderm]]
* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from [[Neural crest|neural crest cells]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Nervous system===
{{Main|Development of the nervous system in humans |Development of the human brain}}
[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|240px|Development of brain in 8 week old embryo]]
Late in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future [[midbrain]]—the [[mesencephalon]]. Above the mesencephalon is the [[prosencephalon]] (future forebrain) and beneath it is the [[rhombencephalon]] (future hindbrain).

[[Cranial neural crest]] cells migrate to the [[pharyngeal arch]]es as [[neural stem cell]]s, where they develop in the process of [[neurogenesis]] into [[neuron]]s.

The [[optic vesicle|optical vesicle]] (which eventually becomes the [[optic nerve]], [[retina]] and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon. The [[alar plate]] of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] becomes the diencephalon. Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth.

==Development of physical features==
===Face and neck===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
{{Main article|Face and neck development of the embryo}}
From the third to the eighth week the [[face and neck development of the embryo|face and neck develop]].

=== Ears ===
{{See also|Ear#Development}}The [[inner ear]], [[middle ear]] and [[outer ear]] have distinct embryological origins.

==== Inner ear ====
At about 22 days into development, the [[ectoderm]] on each side of the [[Hindbrain|rhombencephalon]] thickens to form [[Otic placode|otic placodes]]. These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[Otic pit|otic pits]], and then [[Otic vesicle|otic vesicles]]. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.

The ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].

The dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].

==== Middle ear ====
The [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube.

The [[Bone|bones]] of the middle ear, the [[ossicles]], derive from the cartilages of the [[Pharyngeal arch|pharyngeal arches]]. The [[malleus]] and [[incus]] derive from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#First arch|first pharyngeal arch]], whereas the [[stapes]] derives from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#Second arch|second pharyngeal arch]].

==== Outer ear ====
The [[Ear canal|external auditory meatus]] develops from the dorsal portion of the first [[Pharyngeal groove|pharyngeal cleft]]. Six auricular hillocks, which are mesenchymal proliferations at the dorsal aspects of the first and second pharyngeal arches, form the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]] of the ear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Eyes===
{{Main article |Eye development}}
The eyes begin to develop from the third week to the tenth week.
[[File:Movements at gestational age of 9 weeks.gif|thumb|Movements of embryo at 9 weeks gestational age.]]

===Limbs===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
{{main article|Limb development|Limb bud}}
{{Further |Zone of polarizing activity}}
At the end of the fourth week [[limb development]] begins. [[Limb bud|Limb buds]] appear on the ventrolateral aspect of the body. They consist of an outer layer of [[ectoderm]] and an inner part consisting of [[mesenchyme]] which is derived from the parietal layer of [[lateral plate mesoderm]]. Ectodermal cells at the distal end of the buds form the [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which creates an area of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal cells known as the [[progress zone]]. [[Cartilage]] (some of which ultimately becomes [[bone]]) and muscle develop from the mesenchyme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Clinical significance==
{{Further information |Prenatal testing |Environmental toxicants and fetal development}}
{{See also|Obstetric ultrasonography}}
Toxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major [[congenital malformation]]s, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing.

Each cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the [[cellular differentiation|different cell types]] in the developing embryo. This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].

[[Sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sadler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

[[First arch syndrome]]s are [[congenital disorder]]s of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.

[[Spina bifida]] a [[congenital disorder]] is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.

[[Vertically transmitted infection]]s can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its [[prenatal development|development]].

[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a [[preterm birth|preterm]] or premature birth.

Via '''deep [[water aeration]]''' or '''[[Hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] aeration''', the [[oxygen]] demand of deep water is covered by oxygen from the atmosphere without destroying the lake’s natural [[Lake stratification|stratification]]. Thus the deep water becomes aerobic, the [[phosphate]] dissolution is reduced significantly and the mineralization of [[sediments]] improves.
Years of scientific evidence show that it is possible to keep the deep water aerobic all year round via technical ventilation measures and thereby to recover the natural balance of lakes effectively.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, C., Bernhardt, H.: Handbuch Angewandte Limnologie – 14. Erg.Lfg. 4/0 Verlag: Hüthig Jehle Rehm, 2002, {{ISBN|3-609-75820-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eutrophication ==
In stratified, eutrophic lakes an oxygen deficit in deep water is created during summer stagnation. As a result of elevated nutrient inputs the trophic level of many lakes increases continuously. Elevated phosphorus concentrations may lead to stronger algae growth and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption in the deep zones. 
In the anaerobic environment of deep water sludge accumulates, while concentrations of [[ammonium]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]] increase in the [[water body]].
The [[hypolimnion]] is now not only hostile, but the [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic conditions]] also cause increased phosphate dissolutions from the sediments into the deep water. These additional nutrient loads create further problems after the next full circulation. 
Particularly in terms of drinking water production in reservoirs and dams with respect to the existing regulations of the Drinking Water Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;Verordnung über die Qualität von Wasser für den menschlichen Gebrauch (Trinkwasserverordnung) vom 21. Mai 2001. Zuletzt geändert durch Art. 3, Abs. 1, 2 vom 5. Dezember 2012. In: BGBl., Teil 1, Nr. 24: 959-969 (2001) und BGBl. I S. 2562 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; these deteriorations in water status are a serious problem. The deep water aeration can prevent this process.

== Technical measures for hypolimnetic aeration ==
TIBEAN or TWBA stands for the German „Tiefenwasserbelüftungsanlage" which means „deep water aeration system". 
The TIBEAN - series are floating or submerse plants. They consist of one or more upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, [[degassed water]] is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented. [[File:TIBEAN Polycon Anlagenkomponenten.jpg|thumbnail|TIBEAN: technical components and functional principal]]

=== Technology ===
At the lower end of the plant atmospheric air is inserted into the water by an [[Injector|ejector]]. A mixture of water and oxygen is forced upwards in the upstream pipe. At the end of the upstream pipe the mixture flows into the degassing chamber. Residual gases are separated from the oxygenated water. The gas escapes into the [[atmosphere]], the oxygenated water flows back through the downstream pipe. The outlet provides a laminar flow and a horizontal outflow into the hypolimnion.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, D.: TIBEAN – a new hypolimnetic water aeration plant. Verb. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 24: 184-187, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klapper, H. 1992"&gt;Klapper, H.: Eutrophierung und Gewässerschutz. Stuttgart, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1992, {{ISBN|978-3-334-00394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thanks to the flow and mass transfer calculations which are performed in the context of the technical configuration, the optimal set-up can be determined.

TIBEAN can be made of [[Polyethylene]], [[Polypropylene]], [[stainless steel]] and an Al/Mn- alloy. Thanks to best properties almost all facilities are made of thermoplastic materials (PE, PP) and thus are UV, weather and frost resistant.

== Applications ==
TIBEAN systems are highly variable and cover a very wide range of applications with an oxygen input from 1.5 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg/h, an application depth of 5 to 50 m and a flow rate from 600 to 7500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h.

The objectives for water body restoration or aquatic therapy can vary, depending on the priority. Therefore, the possibilities of deep water aeration systems as TIBEAN are diverse:
* Conservation of deep zones as aerobic habitat for fish and other higher organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Doke, J.L., Funk, W.H., Juul, S.T.J., Moore, B.C.: Habitat availability and benthic invertebrate population changes following alum treatment and hypolimnetic oxygenation in [[Newman Lake]], Washington. In: J. Freshwat. Ecol. 10: 87-100,1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehrli, B., Wüest, A.: Zehn Jahre Seenbelüftung: Erfahrungen und Optionen. EAWAG, Dübenedorf-Zürich, Schweiz,1996, {{ISBN|3-906484-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction of nutrient concentration in surface waters.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Prevention of sludge formation, increased ammonium production and the formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Cost reduction for drinking water production.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Targeted treatment of deep water with coagulants.

=== Drinking water production in water reservoir dams ===
Especially in respect of drinking water production, deep-water aeration allows a significant reduction of production costs and facilitates further technical treatment of the hypolimnic water.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; Since water for drinking water production is drawn from below the thermocline in most reservoirs, an improved hypolimnic water quality has direct influence on the production of drinking water. With regard to the applicable limiting values of drinking water regulations, the following effects can be achieved via deep-water aeration:

==== pH and corrosion ====
For the [[pH]] of drinking water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide an indication of the [[corrosion]] behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also [[copper]] and asbestos cement pipes.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter"&gt;Die Bedeutung einzelnen Trinkwasserparameter, Wasserverband Großraum Ansfelden, 29.08.2003,  http://wasserverbandansfelden.riscompany.net/medien/download/50330502_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted.&lt;ref name="Korrosion"&gt;Wasserqualität: Spezialteil Korrosion, www.waterquality.de, know-how online, http://www.waterquality.de/trinkwasser/K.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly [[alkalinity|alkaline]] reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, [[buffer solution]]s are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Iron and manganese ====
For concentrations of iron and manganese in drinking water, the threshold values are 200&amp;nbsp;µg/l and 50&amp;nbsp;µg/l respectively. Although they serve as essential [[trace element]]s in drinking water, slightly elevated iron and manganese concentrations are undesirable from a technical and hygienic point of view.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; At low oxygen concentrations, iron and manganese are dissolved as ions. The naturally occurring iron and manganese is mainly present as divalent, soluble ferrous/ manganous compound. At very high concentrations, a yellow water colour is noticeable. When this water is aerated, the oxidization creates ferric iron/ manganese, with iron forming red-brown and manganese forming black precipitates. These precipitates cause staining and turbidity of the water and lead to laundry stains. The precipitates can also narrow pipes and deposit on mountings. Iron levels above 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/l and manganese levels above 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l become noticeable as an unpleasant metallic taste.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; Providing an aerobic hypolimnic environment, deep-water aeration oxidizes and precipitates dissolved iron and manganese compounds, before the water is treated in a suitable facility for drinking water production. In this way further operating costs for the removal of dissolved iron and manganese compounds can be realized.

The amount and mobility of iron species also influences the redox-controlled phosphorus household.&lt;ref&gt;Lean, D.R.S., McQueen, D.J., Story, V.R.: Phosphate transport during hypolimnetic aeration. Arch. Hydrobiol. 108, 269-280, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Divalent iron compounds successively diffusing from anaerobic sediment layers are oxidized at the boundary zone between aerobic water and anaerobic sediment, and accumulate at the top sediment layer. The stronger this accumulation, the more effective the aerobic boundary between sediment and water can act as a [[diffusion]] barrier for phosphate.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Nutrient concentrations and sludge formation ====
As already mentioned, the deep-water aeration can reduce nutrient concentrations significantly. Aerobic conditions promote [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] thus contributing to nitrogen discharge of the system.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; The chemical and microbial oxidation of reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide and methane as well as the intensified degradation of organic matter can reduce the sludge formation. Aerobic conditions in the deep-water are also an important factor to decrease the redox-controlled redissolution of phosphorus from the sediment and to allow reprecipitation of released phosphorus. In this way the deep-water aeration additionally reduces costs for drinking water production by waiving denitrification stages or reducing the use of costly flocculants.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

== Planning and design ==
The final design of plants is carried out in different phases. The first step should always be a [[Echo sounding|morphometric measurement]] of the water body in order to assess the depth profile and the associated requirements for the technical design, and later on to determine the optimal location of the plant.
The exact technical design requires the evaluation of various measurements of parameters such as nutrient concentrations, temperature stratification, pH, temporal variations of oxygen concentrations as well as calculations of flow rates, mass transport quantities and distribution of [[suspended solids]] in the hypolymnion.

'''Hypoxemia''' (or '''hypoxaemia''' in [[British English]]) is an abnormally low level of [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Charles P.|title=The encyclopedia of sleep and sleep disorders |year=2010 |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780816068333|page=104|edition=3rd |author2=Thorpy, Michael J. |author3=Yager, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999 /&gt; More specifically, it is oxygen deficiency in [[artery|arterial]] blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckman|first=Margaret |title=Professional guide to pathophysiology |year=2010 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1605477664 |page=208 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypoxemia has many causes, often [[respiratory disorders]], and can cause tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as the blood is not supplying enough oxygen to the body.

==Definition==
''Hypoxemia'' refers to low oxygen in the blood, and the more general term ''hypoxia'' is an abnormally low oxygen content in any tissue or organ, or the body as a whole.&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999 /&gt; Hypoxemia can cause [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (hypoxemic hypoxia), but hypoxia can also occur via other mechanisms, such as [[anemia]].&lt;ref name='Nadel'&gt;
Robert J. Mason, V. Courtney Broaddus, Thomas R. Martin, Talmadge E. King, Dean E. Schraufnagel, John F. Murray and Jay A. Nadel (eds.)  (2010) Murray &amp; Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. {{ISBN|1-4160-4710-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypoxemia is usually defined in terms of reduced [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (mm Hg) in arterial blood, but also in terms of reduced content of oxygen (ml oxygen per dl blood) or percentage saturation of [[hemoglobin]] (the oxygen binding [[protein]] within [[red blood cell]]s) with oxygen, which is either found singly or in combination.&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Lawrence|title=All you really need to know to interpret arterial blood gases|year=1999|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0683306040|page=xxvi|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IntermountainManual&gt;
Morris, Alan; Kanner, Richard; Crapo, Robert; Gardner, Reed. (1984) ''Clinical Pulmonary Function Testing. A manual of uniform laboratory procedures'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is general agreement that an [[arterial blood gas]] measurement which shows that the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than normal constitutes hypoxemia,&lt;ref name=IntermountainManual /&gt;&lt;ref name='Nadel_Hypoxemia' /&gt;&lt;ref name=CRITICAL2007&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=William C. |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first2=Christopher M. |editor-last2=Grande |editor-first3=David B. |editor-last3=Hoyt|title=Critical care|year=2007|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-2920-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is less agreement concerning whether the oxygen content of blood is relevant in determining hypoxemia. This definition would include oxygen carried by [[hemoglobin]]. The oxygen content of blood is thus sometimes viewed as a measure of tissue delivery rather than hypoxemia.&lt;ref name=CRITICAL2007 /&gt;

Just as extreme hypoxia can be called anoxia, extreme hypoxemia can be called anoxemia.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Hypoxia (medical)#Signs and symptoms}}

In an acute context, hypoxemia can cause symptoms such as those in [[respiratory distress]]. These include [[dyspnoea|breathlessness]], an increased rate of breathing, use of the chest and abdominal muscles to breathe, and [[Pursed lip breathing|lip pursing]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|642}}

Chronic hypoxemia may be compensated or uncompensated. The compensation may cause symptoms to be overlooked initially, however, further disease or a stress such as [[Basal metabolic rate|any increase in oxygen demand]] may finally unmask the existing hypoxemia. In a compensated state, blood vessels supplying less-ventilated areas of the lung may [[vasoconstriction|selectively contract]], to redirect the blood to areas of the lungs which are better ventilated. However, in a chronic context, and if the lungs are not well ventilated generally, this mechanism can result in [[pulmonary hypertension]], overloading the right ventricle of the heart and causing [[cor pulmonale]] and [[Heart failure#Right-sided failure|right sided heart failure]]. [[Polycythemia]] can also occur.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONS2010"&gt;{{cite book |veditors = Colledge NR, Walker BR, Ralston SH |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine |year=2010 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7020-3085-7|edition=21st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children, chronic hypoxemia may manifest as delayed growth, neurological development and motor development and decreased sleep quality with frequent sleep arousals.&lt;ref name=ADDE2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adde |first=FV |author2=Alvarez, AE |author3=Barbisan, BN |author4= Guimarães, BR  |title=Recommendations for long-term home oxygen therapy in children and adolescents |journal=Jornal de Pediatria |date=Jan–Feb 2013 |volume=89|issue=1 |pages=6–17 |doi=10.1016/j.jped.2013.02.003 |pmid=23544805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symptoms of hypoxemia may include [[cyanosis]], [[digital clubbing]], and symptoms that may relate to the cause of the hypoxemia, including [[cough]] and [[hemoptysis]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|642}}

Serious hypoxemia occurs (1) when the partial pressure of oxygen in blood is less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, (the beginning of the steep portion of the [[oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve]], where a small decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen results in a large decrease in the oxygen content of the blood);&lt;ref name='Nadel_Hypoxemia'&gt;
Lorenzo Del Sorbo, Erica L. Martin, V. Marco Ranieri (2010) "Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure" In: Murray &amp; Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, Robert J. Mason, V. Courtney Broaddus, Thomas R. Martin, Talmadge E. King, Dean E. Schraufnagel, John F. Murray and Jay A. Nadel (eds.) 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. {{ISBN|1-4160-4710-7}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt; or (2) when hemoglobin [[oxygen saturation]] is less than 90%.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2013}} Severe hypoxia can lead to [[respiratory failure]] &lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;

==Causes==
Hypoxemia refers to insufficient oxygen in the blood. Thus any cause that influences the rate or volume of air entering the lungs ('''ventilation''') or any cause that influences the transfer of air from the lungs to the blood may cause hypoxemia. As well as these respiratory causes, [[cardiovascular]] causes such as [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] may also result in hypoxaemia.

Hypoxemia is caused by five categories of etiologies: hypoventilation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunt, diffusion impairment, and low PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Low PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hypoventilation are associated with a normal A-a gradient whereas the other categories are associated with an increased A-a gradient.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2008v1&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Anthony S. |editor-last=Fauci |editor-first2=T. R. |editor-last2=Harrison|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-147692-8|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|229}}

===Ventilation===
If the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] ventilation is insufficient, there will not be enough  oxygen delivered to the alveoli for the body's use. This can cause hypoxemia even if the lungs are normal, as the cause is in the brainstem's control of ventilation or in the body's inability to breathe effectively.

====Respiratory drive====
[[Control of respiration|Respiration is controlled]] by centres in the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], which influence the rate of breathing and the depth of each breath. This is influenced by the blood level of carbon dioxide, as determined by central and peripheral chemoreceptors located in the central nervous system and carotid and aortic bodies, respectively. Hypoxia occurs when the breathing center doesn't function correctly or when the signal is not appropriate:
* [[Stroke]]s, [[epilepsy]] and cervical neck fractures can all damage the medullary [[respiratory centres]] that generates rhythmic impulses and transmit them along the [[phrenic nerve]] to the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the muscle that is responsible for breathing.
* A decreased respiratory drive can also be the result of [[metabolic alkalosis]], a state of decreased [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood
* [[Central sleep apnea]]. During sleep, the breathing centers of the brain can pause their activity, leading to prolonged periods of apnea with potentially serious consequences.
* Hyperventilation followed by prolonged breath-holding. This hyperventilation, attempted by some swimmers, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs. This reduces the urge to breathe. However, it also means that falling blood oxygen levels are not sensed, and can result in hypoxemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig |first=Albert B. |title=Summary of 58 cases of loss of consciousness during underwater swimming and diving |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports|date=Fall 1976|volume=8|issue=3|pages=171–5|pmid=979564 |doi=10.1249/00005768-197600830-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical states====
A variety of conditions that physically limit airflow can lead to hypoxemia.
* [[Asphyxia|Suffocation]], including temporary interruption temporary cessation of breathing as in [[obstructive sleep apnea]], or bedclothes may interfere with breathing in infants, a putative cause of [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]].
* Structural deformities of the chest, such as [[scoliosis]] and [[kyphosis]], which can restrict breathing and lead to hypoxia.
* [[Myopathy|Muscle weakness]], which may limit the ability of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the primary muscle for drawing new air into lungs, to function. This may be a result of a congenital disease, such as [[motor neuron disease]], or an acquired condition, such as fatigue in severe cases of [[COPD]].

====Environmental oxygen====
[[File:Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.png|thumb|Oxygen-Haemoglobin Dissassociation Curve.]]

In conditions where the proportion of oxygen in the air is low, or when the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen has decreased, less oxygen is present in the alveoli of the lungs. The alveolar oxygen is transferred to [[hemoglobin]], a carrier protein inside [[red blood cell]]s, with an efficiency that decreases with the partial pressure of oxygen in the air. 
  
*[[Altitude]]. The external partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude, for example in areas of high altitude or when [[Aviation|flying]]. This decrease results in decreased carriage of oxygen by haemoglobin.&lt;ref name="02_calc"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kenneth Baillie |author2=Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher= Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} – Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly seen as a cause of [[cerebral hypoxia]] and [[Altitude sickness|mountain sickness]] in climbers of [[Mount Everest]] and other peaks of extreme altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=West JB, Boyer SJ, Graber DJ, Hackett PH, Maret KH, Milledge JS, Peters RM, Pizzo CJ, Samaja M, Sarnquist FH |title=Maximal exercise at extreme altitudes on Mount Everest |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology: Respiratory, Environmental and Exercise Physiology|date=September 1983 |volume=55|issue=3 |pages=688–98 |pmid=6415008 |doi=10.1152/jappl.1983.55.3.688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grocott|first=MP|author2=Martin, DS |author3=Levett, DZ |author4=McMorrow, R |author5=Windsor, J |author6=Montgomery, HE |author7= Caudwell Xtreme Everest Research, Group |title=Arterial blood gases and oxygen content in climbers on Mount Everest |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Jan 8, 2009|volume=360|issue=2|pages=140–9|pmid=19129527|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801581}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the peak of Mount Everest, the partial pressure of oxygen is just 43 mmHg, whereas at sea level the partial pressure is 150 mmHg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=John B.|title=Human limits for hypoxia: the physiological challenge of climbing Mt. Everest |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |year=2000 |volume=899|pages=15–27|pmid=10863526|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06173.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[Cabin pressurization|cabin pressure in aircraft]] is maintained at 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1500 to 1800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ersnet.org/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=items&amp;id=4106:airlines-are-cu|title=Airlines are cutting costs – Are patients with respiratory diseases paying the price? {{!}}|last=Administrator|website=www.ersnet.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Underwater diving|Diving]]. Hypoxia in diving can result from sudden surfacing. The partial pressures of gases increases when diving, increases by one ATM every ten metres. This means that a partial pressure of oxygen sufficient to maintain good carriage by haemoglobin is possible at depth, even if it is insufficient at the surface. A diver that remains underwater will slowly consume their oxygen, and when surfacing, the partial pressure of oxygen may be insufficient ([[shallow water blackout]]). This may manifest at depth as [[deep water blackout]].
*[[Suffocation]]. Decreased concentration of oxygen in inspired air caused by reduced replacement of oxygen in the breathing mix.
*[[Anaesthetic]]s. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs when switching from inhaled [[anesthesia]] to atmospheric air, due to the [[Fink effect]], or diffusion hypoxia.
* Air depleted of oxygen has also proven fatal.  In the past, [[Anaesthetic machine|anesthesia machines]] have malfunctioned, delivering low-oxygen gas mixtures to patients.  Additionally, oxygen in a confined space can be consumed if [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s are used without sufficient attention to supplementing the oxygen which has been consumed.

===Perfusion===

====Ventilation-perfusion mismatch====
This refers to a disruption in the ventilation/perfusion equilibrium. Oxygen entering the lungs typically diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane into blood. However this equilibration does not occur when the alveolus is insufficiently ventilated, and as a consequence the blood exiting that alveolus is relatively hypoxemic.  When such blood is added to blood from well ventilated alveoli, the mix has a lower oxygen partial pressure than the alveolar air, and so the A-a difference develops. Examples of states that can cause a ventilation-perfusion mismatch include:
* Exercise. Whilst modest activity and exercise improves ventilation-perfusion matching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whipp|first=BJ|author2=Wasserman, K|title=Alveolar-arterial gas tension differences during graded exercise |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=September 1969 |volume=27|issue=3 |pages=361–5 |pmid=5804133 |doi=10.1152/jappl.1969.27.3.361}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypoxemia may develop during intense exercise as a result of preexisting lung diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hopkins|first=SR|title=Exercise induced arterial hypoxemia: the role of ventilation-perfusion inequality and pulmonary diffusion limitation |year=2006|volume=588|pages=17–30|pmid=17089876|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-34817-9_3|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-0-387-34816-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During exercise, almost half of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (again, on average).&lt;ref name="Agustí 219–25"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agustí|first=AG|author2=Roca, J |author3=Gea, J |author4=Wagner, PD |author5=Xaubet, A |author6= Rodriguez-Roisin, R  |title=Mechanisms of gas-exchange impairment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis |journal=The American Review of Respiratory Disease |date=February 1991|volume=143|issue=2|pages=219–25|pmid=1990931 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm/143.2.219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aging]]. An increasingly poor match between ventilation and perfusion is seen with age, as well as a decreased ability to compensate for hypoxic states.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONS2010"/&gt; {{rp|646}}
* Disease that affect the pulmonary interstitum can also result in hypoxia, by affecting the ability of oxygen to diffuse into arteries. An example of these diseases is [[pulmonary fibrosis]], where even at rest a fifth of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (on average).&lt;ref name="Agustí 219–25"/&gt;
* Diseases that result in acute or chronic [[respiratory distress]] can result in hypoxia. These diseases can be acute in onset (such as obstruction by inhaling something or a [[pulmonary embolus]]) or chronic (such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]). 
* [[Cirrhosis]] can be complicated by refractory hypoxemia due to high rates of blood flow through the lung, resulting in ventilation-perfusion mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agusti|first=AG|author2=Roca, J |author3=Rodriguez-Roisin, R |title=Mechanisms of gas exchange impairment in patients with liver cirrhosis |journal=Clinics in Chest Medicine|date=March 1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=49–66|pmid=8665790|doi=10.1016/s0272-5231(05)70298-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shunting====
[[Shunt (medical)|Shunting]] refers to blood that bypasses the pulmonary circulation, meaning that the blood does not receive oxygen from the alveoli. In general, a shunt may be within the heart or lungs, and cannot be corrected by administering oxygen alone. Shunting may occur in normal states:
* Anatomic shunting, occurring via the [[Bronchial artery|bronchial circulation]], which provides blood to the tissues of the lung. Shunting also occurs by the [[smallest cardiac veins]], which empty directly into the left ventricle.
* Physiological shunts, occur due to the effect of gravity. The highest concentration of blood in the pulmonary circulation occurs in the bases of the pulmonary tree compared to the highest pressure of gas in the apexes of the lungs. [[alveolus|Alveoli]] may not be ventilated in shallow breathing. 
Shunting may also occur in disease states:
* Acute lung injury and [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], which may cause alveolar collapse. This will increase the amount of physiological shunting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=YC|author2=Fracica, PJ |author3=Simonson, SG |author4=Crapo, JD |author5=Young, SL |author6=Welty-Wolf, KE |author7=Moon, RE |author8= Piantadosi, CA |title=VA/Q abnormalities during gram negative sepsis |journal=Respiration Physiology|date=August 1996 |volume=105|issue=1–2 |pages=109–21 |pmid=8897657 |doi=10.1016/0034-5687(96)00039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike many forms of shunting, can be managed by administering 100% Oxygen.
* Pathological shunts such as [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[patent foramen ovale]], and [[atrial septal defect]]s or [[ventricular septal defect]]s. These states are when blood from the right side of the heart moves straight to the left side, without first passing through the lungs. This is known as a [[right-to-left shunt]], which is often congenital in origin.

=== Exercise ===
Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia occurs during exercise when a trained individual exhibits an arterial oxygen saturation below 93%. It occurs in fit, healthy individuals of varying ages and genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|first1=JA|last1=Dempsey|first2=PD|last2=Wagner|date=December 1999|volume=87|issue=6|pages=1997–2006|pmid=10601141|doi=10.1152/jappl.1999.87.6.1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations due to training include an increased cardiac output from cardiac hypertrophy, improved venous return, and metabolic vasodilation of muscles, and an increased VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Max. There must be a corresponding increase in VCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thus a necessity to clear the carbon dioxide to prevent a metabolic acidosis. The hypoxemia occurs in these individuals whereby due to increased pulmonary blood flow:
*'''Reduced capillary transit time''' occurs due to an increased blood flow within the pulmonary capillary. Capillary transit time (tc), at rest is around 0.8s, allowing plenty of time for the diffusion of oxygen into the circulation and the diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the circulation.  After training, the capillary volume is still the same however cardiac output is increased, resulting in a decreased capillary transit time, reducing to around 0.16s in trained individuals at maximal work rates. This does not give sufficient time for gas diffusion and results in a hypoxaemia.
*'''Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts''' are dormant capillaries within the lungs that become recruited when venous pressures become too high. They are normally located within deadspace area thus the blood passing through does no become oxygenated resulting in a hypoxemia.

==Physiology==
{{Main|Hypoxia (medical)#Physiological compensation}}
Key to understanding whether the lung is involved in a particular case of hypoxemia is the [[Alveolar–arterial gradient|difference between the alveolar and the arterial oxygen levels]]; this A-a difference is often called the A-a ''gradient'' and is normally small. The arterial oxygen partial pressure is obtained directly from an arterial [[Blood gas|blood gas determination]].  The oxygen contained in the alveolar air can be calculated because it will be directly proportional to its fractional composition in air. Since the airways humidify (and so dilute) the inhaled air, the [[barometric pressure]] of the [[atmosphere]] is reduced by the vapor pressure of water.

==History==
The term hypoxemia was originally used to describe low blood oxygen occurring at high altitudes and was defined generally as defective oxygenation of the blood.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11666">The '''International Critical Commentary''' (or '''ICC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the text of the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. It is currently published by the [[T&amp;T Clark]].

Initially started over one hundred years ago, the International Critical Commentary series has been a highly regarded academic level commentary on the bible. It aims to marshall all available aids to exegesis; linguistic, textual, archaeological, historical, literary and theological. No unifying scheme is sought but each scholar has been free to express their expertise.&lt;ref name=TTC&gt;{{cite web|title=Current publisher's introduction|work=bloomsbury.com|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/international-critical-commentary/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICCReview&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the series|work=readingacts.com|url=http://readingacts.com/2011/08/23/more-free-books-the-international-critical-commentary-icc/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally edited by [[Samuel Rolles Driver]], [[Alfred A. Plummer]], and [[Charles Augustus Briggs]] the series has been in the hands of various editors since.
[[Graham Stanton]] was General Editor of the International Critical Commentaries (from 1984 until 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9917">The '''kappa effect''' or perceptual time dilation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldreich|first1=Daniel|title=A Bayesian Perceptual Model Replicates the Cutaneous Rabbit and Other Tactile Spatiotemporal Illusions|journal=PLoS ONE|date=28 March 2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e333|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000333}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Time perception|temporal perceptual illusion]] that can arise when observers judge the elapsed time between sensory [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] applied sequentially at different locations. In perceiving a sequence of consecutive stimuli, subjects tend to overestimate the elapsed time between two successive stimuli when the distance between the stimuli is sufficiently large, and to underestimate the elapsed time when the distance is sufficiently small.

==In different sensory modalities==
The kappa effect can occur with visual (e.g., flashes of light), auditory (e.g., tones), or tactile (e.g. taps to the skin) stimuli. Many studies of the kappa effect have been conducted using visual stimuli. For example, suppose three light sources, X, Y, and Z, are flashed successively in the dark with equal time intervals between each of the flashes. If the light sources are placed at different positions, with X and Y closer together than Y and Z, the temporal interval between the X and Y flashes is perceived to be shorter than that between the Y and Z flashes.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS"&gt;TAU- AND KAPPA-EFFECTS. Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories. Oxford: Elsevier Science &amp; Technology, 2006. Credo Reference. 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The kappa effect has also been demonstrated with auditory stimuli that move in frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=MJ|author2=McAuley, JD|title=Evaluation of an imputed pitch velocity model of the auditory kappa effect.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=April 2009|volume=35|issue=2|pages=551–64|pmid=19331507|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.35.2.551}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some experimental paradigms the auditory kappa effect has not been observed. For example, Roy et al. (2011) found that, opposite to the prediction of the kappa effect, "Increasing the distance between sound sources marking time intervals leads to a decrease of the perceived duration".&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;Roy, M., Kuroda, T., &amp; Grondin, S. (2011). Effect of space on auditory temporal processing with a single-stimulus method. Advances in Sound Localization, 95-104&lt;/ref&gt; In touch, the kappa effect was first described as the "S-effect" by Suto (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suto|first=Y|title=The effect of space on time estimation (S-effect) in tactual space|journal=Japanese Journal of Psychology|year=1952|volume=22|pages=45–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; refers to the kappa effect as "perceptual time dilation" in analogy with the physical [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]].

==Theories based in velocity expectation==
Physically, traversed space and elapsed time are linked by velocity. Accordingly, several theories regarding the brain's expectations about stimulus velocity have been put forward to account for the kappa effect.

===Constant velocity expectation===
According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), the brain incorporates a prior expectation of speed when judging spatiotemporal intervals. Specifically, the brain expects temporal intervals that would produce constant velocity (i.e., [[Kinematics|uniform motion]]) movement.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, B. &amp; Huang, Y. L. (1982). Space-time dependencies in psychophysical judgment of extent and duration: algebraic models of the tau and kappa effects. Psychological Bulletin, 91(1), 128-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuda"&gt;Masuda, T., Kimura, A., Dan, I. &amp; Wada, Y. (2011). Effects of environmental context on temporal perception bias in apparent motion" ''Vision Research'' 51, 1728-1740&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the kappa effect occurs when we apply our knowledge of motion to stimulus sequences, which sometimes leads us to make mistakes.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Dr. Molly J. Henry, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences; Leipzig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the role of a uniform motion expectation in temporal perception comes from a study&lt;ref name="Sarrazin"&gt;Sarrazin, J. C., Giraudo, M. D., Pailhous, J., &amp; Bootsma, R. (2004). Dynamics of balancing space and time in memory: tau and kappa effects revisited. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 30(3), 411-430,&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants observed eight white dots that successively appeared in one direction in a horizontal alignment along a straight line. When the temporal separation was constant and the spatial separation between the dots varied, they observed the kappa effect, which follows the constant velocity hypothesis. However, when both the temporal and spatial separation between the dots varied, they failed to observe the response pattern that the constant velocity hypothesis predicts. A possible explanation is that it is difficult to perceive a uniform motion from such varying, complicated patterns; thus, the context of observed events may affect our temporal perception.

===Low-speed expectation===
A [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] perceptual model&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|title=A Bayesian perceptual model replicates the cutaneous rabbit and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Mar 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e333|pmid=17389923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000333|pmc=1828626}}&lt;/ref&gt; replicates the tactile kappa effect and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions, including the tau effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]]. According to this model, brain circuitry encodes the expectation that tactile stimuli tend to move slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speed movement. The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual overestimation of the time elapsed between rapidly successive taps applied to separate skin locations. Simultaneously, the model perceptually underestimates the spatial separation between stimuli, thereby reproducing the cutaneous rabbit illusion and the tau effect. Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; speculated that a Bayesian slow-speed prior might explain the visual kappa effect as well the tactile one. Recent empirical studies support this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Youguo|last2=Zhang|first2=Bangwu|last3=Kording|first3=Konrad Paul|authorlink3=Konrad Kording|last4=Luo|first4=Wenbo|title=Speed Constancy or Only Slowness: What Drives the Kappa Effect|journal=PLOS ONE|date=21 April 2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0154013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0154013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuroda|first1=Tsuyoshi|last2=Grondin|first2=Simon|last3=Miyazaki|first3=Makoto|last4=Ogata|first4=Katsuya|last5=Tobimatsu|first5=Shozo|title=The Kappa Effect With Only Two Visual Markers|journal=Multisensory Research|date=31 October 2016|volume=29|issue=8|pages=703–725|doi=10.1163/22134808-00002533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion in different contexts===
The kappa effect appears to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The kappa effect gets bigger as stimuli move faster.&lt;ref name="Masuda"/&gt; Observers tend to apply their previous knowledge of motion to a sequence of stimuli. When subjects observed vertically arranged stimuli, the kappa effect was stronger for sequences moving downward. This can be attributed to the expectation of downward acceleration and upward deceleration, in that the perceived accelerated downward motion causes us to underestimate temporal separation judgments.

==Related illusions==
If observers interpret rapid stimulus sequences in light of an expectation regarding velocity, then it would be expected that not only temporal, but also spatial illusions would result. This indeed occurs in the [[tau effect]], when the spatial separation between stimuli is constant and the temporal separation is varied. In this case, the observer decreases the judgment of spatial separation as temporal separation decreases, and vice versa. For example, when equally spaced light sources X, Y, and Z are flashed successively in the dark with a shorter time between X and Y than between Y and Z, X and Y are perceived to be closer together in space than are Y and Z.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS" /&gt; Goldreich (2007) &lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; linked the tau and kappa effects to the same underlying expectation regarding movement speed. He noted that, when stimuli move rapidly across space, "perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events".&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; termed these two fundamental perceptual distortions "perceptual length contraction" (tau effect) and "perceptual time dilation" (kappa effect) in analogy with the physical [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]]. Perceptual length contraction and perceptual time dilation result from the same Bayesian observer model, one that expects stimuli to move slowly.&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Analogously, in the theory of relativity, length contraction and time dilation both occur when a physical speed ([[Speed of light|the speed of light]]) cannot be exceeded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11819">A '''law  degree''' is an academic degree conferred for studies in [[law]]. Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority, they do not themselves confer a license. A legal license is granted (typically by examination) and exercised locally; while the law degree can have local, international, and world-wide aspects- e.g., in Britain the [[Legal Practice Course]] is required to become a British [[solicitor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/becomingasolicitor.law|title=Becoming a Solicitor|publisher=The Law Society (UK)|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/students.page|title=Solicitor's Regulation Authority Student and Training information|publisher=Solicitor's Regulation Authority|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) to become a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |title=How to Become a Barrister |publisher=The Bar Council (UK) |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134750/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees-and the first law degrees were [[doctorate]]s. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, et al. (1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. It is from this history that it is said that the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; And at the [[University of Bologna]] from its founding in the 12th century until the end of the 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive study after secondary school. The rising of the doctor of philosophy to its present level is a modern novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, A. (1921). "Training for the Public Profession of the Law, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15." Boston: Merrymount Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its origins, a doctorate was simply a qualification for a [[guild]]—that of teaching law.&lt;ref&gt;van Ditzhuyzen, R. (2005). [http://ugle.svf.uib.no/svfweb1/filer/1309.pdf The 'creatio doctoris': Diversity or convergence of ceremonial forms]? Unknown publisher. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Bologna]] served as the model for other law schools of the [[medieval]] age.&lt;ref&gt;García y García, A. (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA399&amp;lpg=RA1-PA399&amp;dq=bologna+doctor+title&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ov98N_ekq2&amp;sig=nAvm4JUEZJg389NCdSNfX1Gc-7s&amp;hl=en#PPP1,M1 "The Faculties of Law,"] [[A History of the University in Europe]], London: Cambridge University Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of [[Roman law]] (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court) and although the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] did teach [[canon law]] until the [[English Reformation]], its importance was always superior to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;García y García (1992), 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval Islamic [[madrasah]]s, there was a doctorate in the Islamic law of the [[Sharia]], called the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa 'l-ifta']]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions").&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G. (1989). "Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West," Journal of the American Oriental Society 109, 2, pp. 175–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of degrees==
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction.  Some examples include;

[[Image:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Juris Doctor diploma from the United States, here from [[Suffolk University Law School]] in 2008.]]

* ''[[Bacharel em Direito]]'' (Bachelor of Laws) or ''[[Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais]]'' (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in [[Brazil]], is an undergraduate degree. The abbreviation for Bachelor is ''Bel.''. To be a Lawyer and be admitted at the [[Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil]] (Brazilian Bar Association), the Bachelor must be approved at the Brazilian Bar Exam, if the Selection and Registration Committee accept the new member he/she will be consider an [[Advogado]] (Attorney at Law/Advocate).
* [[Bachelor of Laws]] also referred to as a B.A. in Law (B.L.) or an LL.B. (Hons) in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  It is an [[undergraduate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Langbein, “Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (B.C.L.) degree is similar in nature, historically distinguished from [[canon law]].
* [[Master of Laws]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister. It is an advanced academic degree pursued by those holding a professional law degree or a degree in a relevant field.

From 1947 to 1962, he also had a private veterinary practice in [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]].&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com1"/&gt;  In 1962, [[Marlin Perkins]] left as director of Lincoln Park Zoo for St. Louis.  Fisher succeeded him as the zoo's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoovideoarchive.org/dr-lester-fisher/|title=Dr. Lester E. Fisher|website=Zoo &amp; Aquarium Video Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued in that role until his retirement in 1992.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt;  Fisher is now Director Emeritus for the zoo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoovideoarchive.org/dr-lester-fisher/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and movie appearances==
Fisher appeared in the documentaries ''Artic Window'' (1985), ''Otto: Zoo Gorilla'', and ''Zookeepers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7898382/|title=Lester Fisher|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He frequently appeared on Chicago area television shows to promote the Lincoln Park Zoo, animals cared for by the zoo, and conservation topics.  Shows on which he regularly appeared include ''[[Zoo Parade]]'', ''The Ray Rayner Show'', and ''[[The Bozo Show|Bozo`s Circus]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt;  One of his later television appearances was in an episode of ''[[Pritzker Military Presents]]'' entitled ''Soldier's Best Friends: Animals in the Military'' which aired on WYCC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/front-center-john-callaway-soldiers-best-friends/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards ==
Fisher received the R. Marlin Perkins Award in 1996, which is the highest award given by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association.&lt;ref name="Animal care"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animal Care and Management at the National Zoo: Final Report|date=2005|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0309095832|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8lTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Lincoln Park Zoo has named the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes after Fisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpzoo.org/lester-e-fisher-center-study-and-conservation-apes|title=Lester E.

==Notable luang pho phet images==
[[File:Luang Pho Phet (Wat Tha Thanon).jpg|thumb|Luang pho phet at Wat Tha Thanon]]
Notable luang pho phet Buddha images include the luang pho phet of [[Uttaradit]] (in Wat Tha Thanon), the luang pho phet of [[Phichit]] (in Wat Tha Luang), and the luang pho phet of [[Nakhon Thai Subdistrict|Nakhon Thai]] (in Wat Na Phra That).  The luang pho phet in Uttaradit is believed to have been constructed between 800 and 900 years ago.&lt;ref name="Chimburi.com"&gt;[http://www.chimburi.com/thai485.htm Wat Tha Thanon temple on Chimburi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==luang pho phet in prayer==

An English translation of a common Pali chant to be said before a luang pho phet image is as follows:&lt;ref name="Wat Pradhātu"&gt;See, e.g., [http://vipassanasangha.free.fr/ChantingBook.pdf Chanting Book of Wat Pradhātu Srī Chomtong Voravihāra]&lt;/ref&gt;
:By body, by speech, and by mind, I will always revere the image named luang pho phet,
:the Buddha statue, working wonders of psychic power.  May I be blessed forevermore.

The text of the chant in Pali is as follows:
:Kāyena vācāya va cetassa vā vajiraü nāma pañimaü iddhi-pāñihāriyakaraü buddha-rūpaü ahaü vandāmi sabbaso; sadā sotthī bhavantu me.

[[File:MIMO1.png|thumb| A photograph showing the test set-up of a MIMO test on a wind turbine rotor. The blades are excited using three mechanical shakers and the response is measured using 12 accelerometers mounted to Blade 3; in the next stage of the test, the accelerometers can be moved to Blade 2 and 3 to measure response at those locations.&lt;ref name="MIMO-SIMO-IMPACT"&gt;"Comparison of Modal Parameters Extracted Using MIMO, SIMO, and Impact Hammer Tests on a Three-Bladed Wind Turbine, Experimental Mechanics Series 2014, pp 185-197 [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-04774-4_19]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Modal analysis''' is the study of the dynamic properties of systems in the [[frequency domain]]. Examples would include measuring the vibration of a car's body when it is attached to a [[shaker (testing device)|shaker]], or the [[White noise|noise pattern]] in a room when excited by a loudspeaker.

Modern day experimental modal analysis systems are composed of 1) sensors such as [[transducer]]s (typically [[accelerometer]]s, [[load cell]]s), or non contact via a [[Laser vibrometer]], or [[Photogrammetry|stereophotogrammetric cameras]] 2) data acquisition system and an analog-to-digital converter front end (to [[digitize]] [[Analog signal|analog]] instrumentation signals) and 3) host PC ([[personal computer]]) to view the data and analyze it.

Classically this was done with a SIMO (single-input, multiple-output) approach, that is, one excitation point, and then the response is measured at many other points. In the past a hammer survey, using a fixed accelerometer and a roving hammer as excitation, gave a MISO (multiple-input, single-output) analysis, which is mathematically identical to SIMO, due to the principle of [[reciprocity (engineering)|reciprocity]]. In recent years MIMO (multi-input, multiple-output)  have become more practical, where [[coherence theory (optics)|partial coherence analysis]] identifies which part of the response comes from which excitation source. Using multiple shakers leads to a uniform distribution of the energy over the entire structure and a better coherence in the measurement. A single shaker may not effectively excite all the modes of a structure.&lt;ref name="MIMO-SIMO-IMPACT" /&gt;

Typical excitation signals can be classed as [[impulse function|impulse]], [[broadband]], swept [[sine]], chirp, and possibly others. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

The analysis of the signals typically relies on [[Fourier analysis]]. The resulting [[transfer function]] will show one or more [[resonances]], whose characteristic [[mass]], [[frequency]] and [[damping]] can be estimated from the measurements.

The animated display of the mode shape is very useful to [[noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness)]] engineers.

The results can also be used to correlate with [[finite element analysis]] normal mode solutions.

==Structures==

In [[structural engineering]], modal analysis uses the overall mass and stiffness of a structure to find the various periods at which it will naturally resonate.  These periods of vibration are very important to note in [[earthquake engineering]], as it is imperative that a building's natural frequency does not match the [[frequency]] of expected earthquakes in the region in which the building is to be constructed. If a structure's natural frequency matches an earthquake's frequency{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, the structure may continue to [[resonate]] and experience structural damage.  Modal analysis is also important in structures such as bridges where the engineer should attempt to keep the natural frequencies away from the frequencies of people walking on the bridge.  This may not be possible and for this reasons when groups of people are to walk along a bridge, for example a group of soldiers, the recommendation is that they break their step to avoid possibly significant excitation frequencies.  Other natural excitation frequencies may exist and may excite a bridge's natural modes. Engineers tend to learn from such examples (at least in the short term) and more modern suspension bridges take account of the potential influence of wind through the shape of the deck, which might be designed in aerodynamic terms to pull the deck down against the support of the structure rather than allow it to lift.  Other aerodynamic loading issues are dealt with by minimizing the area of the structure projected to the oncoming wind and to reduce wind generated oscillations of, for example, the hangers in suspension bridges.

Although modal analysis is usually carried out by [[computers]], it is possible to hand-calculate the period of [[vibration]] of any high-rise building through idealization as a fixed-ended cantilever with lumped masses. For a more detailed explanation, see "Structural Analysis" by Ghali, Neville, and Brown, as it provides an easy-to-follow approach to idealizing and solving complex structures by hand.

==Electrodynamics==

The basic idea of a modal analysis in [[electrodynamics]] is the same as in mechanics. The application is to determine which electromagnetic wave modes can stand or propagate within conducting enclosures such as [[waveguide]]s or [[resonator]]s.

==Superposition of modes==

Once a set of modes has been calculated for a system, the response at any frequency (within certain bounds) in response to many inputs at many points with different time histories can be calculated by superimposing the result from each mode. This assumes the system is linear.

==Reciprocity==

If the response is measured at point B in direction x (for example), for an excitation at point A in direction y, then the transfer function (crudely Bx/Ay in the frequency domain) is identical to that which is obtained when the response at Ay is measured when excited at Bx. That is Bx/Ay=Ay/Bx. Again this assumes (and is a good test for) linearity. (Furthermore this assumes restricted types of damping and restricted types of active feedback.)

According to Prof. Mikail Bayram who made an extensive research on Nasreddin, his full name is Nasir ud-din Mahmood al-Khoyi, his title Ahi Evran (as being the leader of the ahi organization). According to him, Nasreddin was born in the city of [[Khoy]] in [[West Azerbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]], had his education in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and became the pupil of famous Quran mufassir [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in Herat. He was sent to Anatolia by the Khalif in Baghdad to organize resistance and uprising against the Mongol invasion. He served as a [[kadı]] (an Islamic judge and ombudsman) in [[Kayseri]]. This explains why he addresses judicial problems in the jokes not only religious ones. During the turmoil of the Mongol invasion he became a political opponent of [[Persia]]n [[Rumi]]. He was addressed in [[Masnavi]] by juha anecdotes for this reason. He became the [[vizier|vazir]] at the court of [[Kaykaus II]]. Having lived in numerous cities in vast area and being steadfastly against the Mongol invasion as well as having his witty character, he was embraced by various nations and cultures from Turkey to Arabia, from Persia to Afghanistan, and from Russia to China, most of which suffered from those invasions.

As generations have gone by, new stories have been added to the Nasreddin corpus, others have been modified, and he and his tales have spread to many regions. The themes in the tales have become part of the folklore of a number of nations and express the national imaginations of a variety of cultures. Although most of them depict Nasreddin in an early small-village setting, the tales deal with concepts that have a certain timelessness. They purvey a pithy [[folk wisdom]] that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The oldest manuscript of Nasreddin dates to 1571.

Today, Nasreddin stories are told in a wide variety of regions, especially across the [[Muslim world]] and have been translated into many languages. Some regions independently developed a character similar to Nasreddin, and the stories have become part of a larger whole. In many regions, Nasreddin is a major part of the culture, and is quoted or alluded to frequently in daily life. Since there are thousands of different Nasreddin stories, one can be found to fit almost any occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ohebsion, Rodney (2004) ''A Collection of Wisdom'', Immediex Publishing, {{ISBN|1-932968-19-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasreddin often appears as a whimsical character of a large [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Chinese, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Russian, and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] [[Folklore|folk]] tradition of [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s, not entirely different from [[zen]] [[koan]]s.

1996–1997 was declared International Nasreddin Year by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=170&amp;art=27256 ''"...UNESCO declared 1996–1997 the International Nasreddin Year..."''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arabic-speaking countries this character is known as "Juha", "Djoha", "Djuha", "Dschuha", "Chotzas", "Goha" ({{lang|ar|جحا}} ''juḥā''). Juha was originally a separate folk character found in Arabic literature as early as the 9th century, and was widely popular by the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|volume=1: A–K | editor=Josef W. Meri | year=2006 | page=426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA426 | isbn=0-415-96691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lore of the two characters became amalgamated in the 19th century when collections were translated from Arabic into Turkish and Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales | volume=2: G–P | editor=Donald Haase | year=2008 | page=661 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sj5cJz0_OsC&amp;pg=PA661 | isbn=978-0-313-33443-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sicily and Southern Italy he is known as "[[Giufà]]".

In the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] and [[Indonesia]]n culture, many of his stories are being told under the name of "Abunuwasi" or "Abunawas", though this confuses Nasreddin with an entirely different man – the poet [[Abu Nuwas]], known for homoerotic verse.

In China, where stories of him are well known, he is known by the various [[transliteration]]s from his [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] name, 阿凡提 (Āfántí) and 阿方提 (Āfāngtí). The Uyghurs believe that he was from [[Xinjiang]], while the [[Uzbeks]] believe he was from [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=fedai /&gt; Shanghai Animation Film Studio produced a 13-episode Nasreddin related animation called 'The Story of Afanti'/ 阿凡提 in 1979, which became one of the most influential animations in China's history. The musical Nasirdin Apandim features the legend of Nasreddin [[effendi]] ("sir, lord"), largely sourced from Uighur folklore.

In Central Asia, he is commonly known as "Afandi". The Central Asian peoples also claim his local origin, as do Uyghurs.

== Tales ==
The Nasreddin stories are known throughout the Middle East and have touched cultures around the world. Superficially, most of the Nasreddin stories may be told as jokes or humorous anecdotes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and [[caravanserai]]s of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasreddin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, followed by a moral and usually the little extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic a little further on the way to realization.&lt;ref&gt;Idris Shah (1964), ''The Sufis'', London: W. H. Allen {{ISBN|0-385-07966-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== The Sermon ====
:Once Nasreddin was invited to deliver a [[sermon]]. When he got on the pulpit, he asked, ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' The audience replied ''"no"'', so he announced, ''I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about!'' and left.
:The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time, when he asked the same question, the people replied ''yes''. So Nasreddin said, ''Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time!'' and left.
:Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mulla to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question – ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered "yes" while the other half replied "no". So Nasreddin said ''Let the half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the half who don't,'' and left.&lt;ref&gt;Many written versions of this tale exist, for example in {{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Alice|title=Once the Hodja|year=1943|publisher=David McKay Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Nasrettin Hoca 05981 nevit.jpg|thumb|Nasreddin Hodja in [[Ankara]]]]
:A neighbour came to the gate of Mulla Nasreddin's yard. The Mulla went to meet him outside.
:"Would you mind, Mulla," the neighbour asked, "can you lend me your donkey today? I have some goods to transport to the next town."
:The Mulla didn't feel inclined to lend out the animal to that particular man, however. So, not to seem rude, he answered:
:"I'm sorry, but I've already lent him to somebody else."
:All of a sudden the donkey could be heard braying loudly behind the wall of the yard.
:"But Mulla," the neighbour exclaimed. "I can hear it behind that wall!"
:"Whom do you believe," the Mulla replied indignantly, "the donkey or your Mulla?"&lt;ref&gt;Widely retold, for instance in {{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=[[The Sufis]]|year=1964|publisher=Jonathan Cape|isbn=0-86304-074-8 |pages=78–79|authorlink=Idries Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taste the same ====
:Some children saw Nasreddin coming from the vineyard with two baskets full of grapes loaded on his donkey. They gathered around him and asked him to give them a taste.
:Nasreddin picked up a bunch of grapes and gave each child a grape.
:"You have so much, but you gave us so little," the children whined.
:"There is no difference whether you have a basketful or a small piece. They all taste the same," Nasreddin answered, and continued on his way.&lt;ref&gt;A similar story is presented in {{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The subtleties of the inimitable Mulla Nasrudin|year=1985|publisher=Octagon Press|location=London|isbn=0-86304-040-3|page=60|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reaching enlightenment ====
:Nasreddin was walking in the [[bazaar]] with a large group of followers. Whatever Nasreddin did, his followers immediately copied. Every few steps Nasreddin would stop and shake his hands in the air, touch his feet and jump up yelling "Hu Hu Hu!". So his followers would also stop and do exactly the same thing.
:One of the merchants, who knew Nasreddin, quietly asked him: "What are you doing my old friend? Why are these people imitating you?"
:"I have become a [[Sufi]] [[Sheikh]]," replied Nasreddin. "These are my [[Murid]]s [spiritual seekers]; I am helping them reach enlightenment!"
:"How do you know when they reach enlightenment?"
:"That’s the easy part! Every morning I count them. The ones who have left – have reached enlightenment!"
:{{Cite quote|date=May 2011}}

==== Nasreddin's ring ====
:Mulla had lost his ring in the living room. He searched for it for a while, but since he could not find it, he went out into the yard and began to look there. His wife, who saw what he was doing, asked: “Mulla, you lost your ring in the room, why are you looking for it in the yard?” Mulla stroked his beard and said: “The room is too dark and I can’t see very well. I came out to the courtyard to look for my ring because there is much more light out here.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/11/better-light/|title="Did You Lose the Keys Here?"

== Azerbaijani literature ==
[[File:Mollanas2.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Molla Nasraddin cover (1910, #22).]]
{{Main article|Molla Nasraddin (magazine)}}
Nasreddin was the main character in a magazine, called simply [[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]], published in [[Azerbaijan]] and "read across the Muslim world from Morocco to Iran". The eight-page [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[satire|satirical]] periodical was published in [[Tiflis]] (from 1906 to 1917), [[Tabriz]] (in 1921) and [[Baku]] (from 1922 to 1931) in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] and occasionally Russian languages. Founded by [[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]], it depicted [[social inequality|inequality]], [[cultural assimilation]], and [[Police corruption|corruption]] and ridiculed the backward lifestyles and values of clergy and religious fanatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/43_folder/43_articles/43_mollamag.html Molla Nasraddin – The Magazine: Laughter that Pricked the Conscience of a Nation] by Jala Garibova.

BBC Persian. 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== European and Western folk tales, literary works and pop culture ==
Some Nasreddin tales also appear in collections of [[Aesop's fables]]. ''[[The miller, his son and the donkey]]'' is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1215.html|title=The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey|work=pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are "The Ass with a Burden of Salt" ([[Perry Index]] 180) and "[[The Satyr and the Traveller]]."

In some [[Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk tales that originated during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, the name appears as an [[antagonist]] to a local wise man, named ''[[Sly Peter]]''. In [[Sicily]] the same tales involve a man named ''[[Giufà]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIGsU7bJ9ZcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=giufa&amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;q=giufa&amp;f=false|title=Mal'uocchiu|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]]&lt;ref&gt;Ottoman Legends, Ankara Folklore Convention, Austin Legrasse, Book of Abstracts, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; culture, spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, a character that appears in many folk tales is named ''[[Djohá]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ladinokomunita.tripod.com/articles/djoha.html Tripod.com], Djoha – Personaje – Ponte en la Area del Mediterraneo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/judeoespagnol/matilda/matilda.php/id/46/ Sefarad.org], European Sephardic Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Republic of Romania|Romanian]], the existing stories come from an 1853 verse compilation edited by [[Anton Pann]], a philologist and poet renowned for authoring the current [[Romanian anthem]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/N%C4%83zdr%C4%83v%C4%83niile_lui_Nastratin_Hogea|title=Năzdrăvăniile lui Nastratin Hogea|work=wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasreddin is mostly known as a character from short tales; whole novels and stories have later been written and production began on a never-completed [[The Thief and the Cobbler#Development and early production on Nasreddin (1964-1972)|animated feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Mike (1996), [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.animation/msg/e7fd132fc8aa689f "An Arabian Knight-mare"], Animato! (35)&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, Nasreddin is known mostly because of the Russian work ''Возмутитель спокойствия'' by [[Leonid Solovyov]] (English translations: "The Beggar in the Harem: Impudent Adventures in Old Bukhara", 1956, and "The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin: Disturber of the Peace", 2009&lt;ref name="translit"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The composer [[Shostakovich]] celebrated Nasreddin, among other figures, in the second movement (''Yumor'', "Humor") of his Symphony No. 13. The text, by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], portrays humor as a weapon against dictatorship and tyranny. Shostakovich's music shares many of the "foolish yet profound" qualities of Nasreddin's sayings listed above.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Graeco-Armenian mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] often referred to "our own dear Mullah Nasr Eddin", also
calling him an "incomparable teacher", particularly in his book ''[[Beelzebub's Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endlesssearch.co.uk/gurdjieff_eddin.htm |title=The 86 Sayings of Mullah Nassr Eddin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi philosopher [[Idries Shah]] published several collections of Nasruddin stories in English, and emphasized their teaching value.

He is known as ''Mullah Nasruddin'' in South Asian children's books.&lt;ref name="Naqvi 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Naqvi | first=Hassan | title=Problems with privatisation | website=Pakistan Today | date=2016-02-06 | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/02/06/features/problems-with-privatisation/ | accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SENSEX 1977"&gt;{{cite web | author=SENSEX | title=Ranga Shankara to provide professional help to amateur theatre companies in Karnataka | website=The Economic Times | date=1977-02-15 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/ranga-shankara-to-provide-professional-help-to-amateur-theatre-companies-in-karnataka/articleshow/50636879.cms | accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uzbek Nasreddin Afandi ==
For [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] people, Nasreddin is one of their own; he is said to have lived and been born in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=fedai&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol16/mulla.pdf|format=PDF|author=Hixarid Fedai|title=Mulla or Hodja Nasreddin as seen by Cypriot Turks and Greeks|website=folklore.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gatherings, family meetings, and parties they tell each other stories about him that are called "latifa" of "afandi".
There are at least two collections of stories related to Nasriddin Afandi.

Books on him:

* "Afandining qirq bir passhasi" – (Forty-one flies of Afandi) – Zohir A'lam, [[Tashkent]]
* "Afandining besh xotini" – (Five wives of Afandi)

In 1943, the Soviet film ''[[Nasreddin in Bukhara]]'' was directed by [[Yakov Protazanov]] based on Solovyov's book, followed in 1947 by a film called ''The Adventures of Nasreddin'', directed by Nabi Ganiyev and also set in the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mubi.com/lists/treasures-from-the-deep-cinema-of-uzbekistan Cinema of Uzbekistan list on mubi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;«Большой Словарь: Крылатые фразы отечественного кино», Олма Медиа Групп. 2001г., {{ISBN|978-5-7654-1735-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S4ymeA9V2dYC&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D0%91%D1%83%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0+1963&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h9YSTueyKZCimQXYtrzJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD&amp;f=false p. 401.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyre2 has been designed (funded by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council|BBSRC]]){{citation needed|date=February 2014}} to ensure a user-friendly interface for users inexpert in protein structure prediction methods.

==Description==

The Phyre and Phyre2 servers predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein sequence using the principles and techniques of [[homology modeling]].
Because the structure of a protein is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence, a protein sequence of interest (the target) can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related sequence of known structure (the template), provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through [[sequence alignment]]. Currently the most powerful and accurate methods for detecting and aligning remotely related sequences rely on [[position-specific scoring matrix|profiles]] or [[hidden markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]. These profiles/HMMs capture the mutational propensity of each position in an amino acid sequence based on observed mutations in related sequences and can be thought of as an 'evolutionary fingerprint' of a particular protein.

Typically, the amino acid sequences of a representative set of all known three-dimensional protein structures is compiled, and these sequences are processed by scanning against a large protein sequence database. The result is a database of profiles or HMMs, one for each known 3D structure. A user sequence of interest is similarly processed to form a profile/HMM. This user profile is then scanned against the database of profiles using profile-profile or HMM-HMM alignment techniques. These alignments can also take into account patterns of predicted or known secondary structure elements and can be scored using various statistical models. See [[protein structure prediction]] for more information.
 
The first Phyre server was released in June 2005 and uses a profile-profile alignment algorithm based on each protein's [[position-specific scoring matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/prot.21688| title = Exploring the extremes of sequence/structure space with ensemble fold recognition in the program Phyre| journal = Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics| volume = 70| issue = 3| pages = 611–25| year = 2007| last1 = Bennett-Lovsey | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Herbert | first2 = A. D. | last3 = Sternberg | first3 = M. J. E. | last4 = Kelley | first4 = L. A. | pmid=17876813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phyre2 server was publicly released February 2011 as a replacement for the original Phyre server and provides extra functionality over Phyre, a more advanced interface, fully updated fold library and uses the [[HHpred / HHsearch]] package for homology detection among other improvements.

==Standard usage==
After pasting a protein amino acid sequence into the Phyre or Phyre2 submission form, a user will typically wait between 30 minutes and several hours (depending on factors such as sequence length, number of homologous sequences and frequency and length of insertions and deletions) for a prediction to complete. An email containing summary information and the predicted structure in [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB format]] are sent to the user together with a link to a web page of results. The Phyre2 results screen is divided into three main sections, described below.

=== Secondary structure and disorder prediction ===
[[Image:Phyre2 secondary structure and disorder.png|thumb|border|Example Phyre2 output for secondary structure and disorder prediction]]
The user-submitted protein sequence is first scanned against a large sequence database using [[PSI-BLAST]]. The profile generated by PSI-BLAST is then processed by the neural network secondary structure prediction program PsiPred&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.404| title = The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server| journal = Bioinformatics| volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 404–5| year = 2000| last1 = McGuffin | first1 = L. J.| last2 = Bryson | first2 = K.| last3 = Jones | first3 = D. T. | pmid=10869041}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the protein disorder predictor Disopred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/prot.10528| title = Prediction of disordered regions in proteins from position specific score matrices| journal = Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics| volume = 53| pages = 573–8| year = 2003| last1 = Jones | first1 = D. T. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J. J. | pmid=14579348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predicted presence of alpha-helices, beta-strands and disordered regions is shown graphically together with a color-coded confidence bar.

=== Domain analysis ===
[[Image:Phyre2 domain analysis.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 output showing multiple domains and pop-up model viewer]]
Many proteins contain multiple [[protein domains]]. Phyre2 provides a table of template matches color-coded by confidence and indicating the region of the user sequence matched. This can aid in the determination of the domain composition of a protein.

=== Detailed template information ===
[[Image:Phyre2 main results table.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 detailed template information table]]
The main results table in Phyre2 provides confidence estimates, images and links to the three-dimensional predicted models and information derived from either [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|Structural Classification of Proteins database (SCOP)]] or the [[Protein Data Bank|Protein Data Bank (PDB)]] depending on the source of the detected template. For each match a link takes the user to a detailed view of the alignment between the user sequence and the sequence of known three-dimensional structure.

=== Alignment view ===
[[Image:Phyre2 alignment view.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 detailed view of the alignment between a user sequence and a known protein structure.]]
The detailed alignment view permits a user to examine individual aligned residues, matches between predicted and known secondary structure elements and the ability to toggle information regarding patterns of sequence conservation and secondary structure confidence. In addition [[Jmol]] is used to permit interactive 3D viewing of the protein model.

== Improvements in Phyre2 ==
Phyre2 uses a fold library that is updated weekly as new structures are solved. It uses a more up-to-date interface and offers additional functionality over the Phyre server 
as described below.

=== Additional functionality ===

==== Batch processing ====
The batch processing feature permits users to submit more than one sequence to Phyre2 by uploading a file of sequences in [[FASTA format]]. By default, users have a limit of 100 sequences in a batch. This limit can be raised by contacting the administrator.
Batch jobs are processed in the background on free computing power as it becomes available. Thus, batch jobs will often take longer than individually submitted jobs, but this is necessary to allow a fair distribution of computing resources to all Phyre2 users.

==== One to one threading ====
One to one threading allows you to upload both a sequence you wish modelled AND the template on which to model it. Users sometimes have a protein sequence that they wish to model on a specific template of their choice. This may be for example a newly solved structure that is not in the Phyre2 database or because of some additional biological information that indicates the chosen template would produce a more accurate model than the one(s) automatically chosen by Phyre2.

==== Backphyre ====
Instead of predicting the 3D structure of a protein sequence, often users have a solved structure and they are interested in determining if there is a related structure in a genome of interest. In Phyre2 an uploaded protein structure can be converted into a hidden Markov model and then scanned against a set of genomes (more than 20 genomes as of March 2011). This functionality is called "BackPhyre" to indicate how Phyre2 is being used in reverse.

==== Phyrealarm ====
Sometimes Phyre2 can't detect any confident matches to known structures. However, the fold library database increases by about 40-100 new structures each week. So even though there might be no decent templates this week, there may well be in the coming weeks.
Phyrealarm allows users to submit a protein sequence to be automatically scanned against new entries added to the fold library every week. If a confident hit is detected, the user is automatically notified by email together with the results of the Phyre2 search. Users can also control the level of alignment coverage and confidence in the match required to trigger an email alert.

==== 3DLigandSite ====
Phyre2 is coupled to the 3DLigandSite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq406| title = 3DLigand ''Site'': Predicting ligand-binding sites using similar structures| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 38| pages = W469| year = 2010| last1 = Wass | first1 = M. N.| last2 = Kelley | first2 = L. A.| last3 = Sternberg | first3 = M. J. E. | pmid=20513649 | pmc=2896164}}&lt;/ref&gt; server for protein binding site prediction. 3DLigandSite has been one of the top performing servers for binding site prediction at the [[CASP|Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP)]] in ([[CASP]]8 and [[CASP]]9). Confident models produced by Phyre2 (confidence &gt;90%) are automatically submitted to 3DLigandSite.

==== Transmembrane topology prediction ====
The program memsat_svm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl677| title = Improving the accuracy of transmembrane protein topology prediction using evolutionary information| journal = Bioinformatics| volume = 23| issue = 5| pages = 538–44| year = 2007| last1 = Jones | first1 = D. T.| pmid=17237066}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to predict the presence and topology of any transmembrane helices present in the user protein sequence.

==== Multi-template modelling ====
Phyre2 permits users to choose 'Intensive' modelling from the main submission screen. This mode:
	
* Examines the list of hits and applies heuristics in order to select templates that maximise sequence coverage and confidence.
* Constructs models for each selected template.
* Uses these models to provide pairwise distance constraints that are input to the ''ab initio'' and multi-template modelling tool Poing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.074| title = Protein Folding Requires Crowd Control in a Simulated Cell| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology| volume = 397| issue = 5| pages = 1329–38| year = 2010| last1 = Jefferys | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = L. A. | last3 = Sternberg | first3 = M. J. E. | pmid=20149797 | pmc=2891488}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Poing synthesises the user protein in the context of these distance constraints, modelled by springs. Regions for which there is no template information are modelled by the ''ab initio'' simplified physics model of Poing.
* The complete model generated by Poing is combined with the original templates as input to [[MODELLER]].

==Applications and performance==
Applications of Phyre and Phyre2 include protein structure prediction, function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding [[site-directed mutagenesis]] and solving protein crystal structures by [[molecular replacement]]. In the [[CASP]]8 blind protein structure prediction experiment, Phyre_de_novo (the predecessor of Phyre2) was ranked 4th out of 71 automatic structure prediction servers. In [[CASP]]9, Phyre2 was ranked 5th on all template-based modelling (TBM) targets and 2nd on the more difficult TBM/FM (free modelling) targets out of the 79 participating servers.

==History==
Phyre and Phyre2 are the successors to the 3D-PSSM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2000.3741| title = Enhanced genome annotation using structural profiles in the program 3D-PSSM| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology| volume = 299| issue = 2| pages = 501–522| year = 2000| last1 = Kelley | first1 = L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">'''Planetary-surface construction''' is the construction of artificial habitats and other structures on [[planetary surface]]s. Planetary surface construction can be divided into three phases or classes, coinciding with a phased schedule for habitation (Kennedy 2002, Smith 1993):

• Class I: Pre-integrated hard shell modules ready to use immediately upon delivery.

• Class II: Prefabricated [[kit-of-parts]] that is surface assembled after delivery.

• Class III: [[in-situ resource utilization]] (ISRU) derived structure with integrated Earth components.

Class I structures are prepared and tested on Earth, and are designed to be fully self-contained habitats that can be delivered to the surface of other planets. In an initial mission to put human explorers on Mars, a Class I habitat would provide the bare minimum habitable facilities when continued support from Earth is not possible.

The Class II structures call for a pre-manufactured kit-of-parts system that has flexible capacity for demountability and reuse. Class II structures can be used to expand the facilities established by the initial Class I habitat, and can allow for the assembly of additional structures either before the crew arrives, or after their occupancy of the pre-integrated habitat.

The purpose of Class III structures is to allow for the construction of additional facilities that would support a larger population, and to develop the capacity for the local production of building materials and structures without the need for resupply from Earth.

To facilitate the development of technology required to implement the three phases, Cohen and Kennedy (1997) stress the need to explore robust robotic system concepts that can be used to assist in the construction process, or perform the tasks autonomously. Among other things, they suggest a roadmap that stresses the need for adapting structural components for robotic assembly, and determining appropriate levels of modularity, assembly, and component packaging. The roadmap also sets the development of experimental construction systems in parallel with components as an important milestone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], a '''quasi-static process''' is a [[thermodynamic process]] that happens slowly enough for the system to remain in internal [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. An example of this is quasi-static compression, where the [[volume]] of a system changes at a slow rate enough to allow the [[pressure]] to remain uniform and constant throughout the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Thermal Physics|last = Schroeder|first = Daniel|publisher = Addison Wesley Longman|year = 2000|isbn = 0-201-38027-7|location = United States|pages = 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] is necessarily a quasi-static one. However, quasi-static processes involving entropy production are irreversible. An example of a quasi-static process that is not reversible is a compression against a system with a piston subject to friction&amp;mdash;although the system is always in thermal equilibrium, the friction ensures the generation of dissipative entropy, which directly goes against the definition of reversible. A notable example of a process that is not even quasi-static is the slow [[heat transfer|heat exchange]] between two bodies at two finitely different temperatures, where the heat exchange rate is controlled by an approximately [[adiabatic]] partition between the two bodies&amp;mdash;in this case, no matter how slowly the process takes place, the states of the two bodies are never infinitesimally close to equilibrium{{clarify|reason="being close to equilibrium is not part of the definition"|date=February 2015}}, since thermal equilibrium requires that the two bodies be at the same temperature.

Some ambiguity exists in the literature concerning the distinction between quasi-static and reversible processes, as these are sometimes taken as synonyms. The reason is the theorem that any reversible process is also a quasi-static one, even though (as we have illustrated above) the converse is not true. In practical situations, it is essential to differentiate between the two: any engineer would remember to include friction when calculating the dissipative entropy generation, so there are no reversible processes in practice. The definition given above is closer to the intuitive understanding of the word &amp;ldquo;quasi-&amp;rdquo; (almost) &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo;, and remains technically different from reversible processes.

==PV-Work in various quasi-static processes==

# Constant pressure: [[Isobaric process]]es,

# Constant volume: [[Isochoric process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \int P dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Constant temperature: [[Isothermal process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \int P dV,&lt;/math&gt; where ''P'' varies with ''V'' via &lt;math&gt;\quad PV = P_1 V_1 = C&lt;/math&gt;, so

# [[Polytropic process]]es,

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

'''''Smith's Bible Dictionary''''', originally named ''A Dictionary of the Bible'', is a 19th-century [[Bible]] dictionary containing upwards of four thousand entries that became named after its editor, [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]. Its popularity was such that condensed dictionaries appropriated the title, "Smith's Bible Dictionary".

The original dictionary was published as a three-volume set in 1863, in London and [[Boston, USA]]. This was followed by ''A Concise Dictionary of the Bible'' (1865), intended for the general reader and students, and ''A Smaller Dictionary of the Bible'' (1866), for use in schools. ''A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible'' (1868), was published simultaneously in London and New York, and a four-volume ''Dictionary of the Bible'' (1871), was published in Boston, amongst other things incorporating the appendices of the first edition into the main body of the text.

In the UK, a corresponding second edition of the first volume in two parts, edited by Smith and [[J. M. Fuller]], was published in 1893.

The original publications are now in the [[public domain]]; some derivative, commercial versions are still in copyright.

One of the contributors to the dictionary was [[George Edward Post]] (of the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB)).&lt;ref&gt; Robert E. Thompson. {{Google books|KV6vCwAAQBAJ|A History of the Presbyterian Churches in the United States|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social gravity''' was an application of [[Newtonian gravity]] to the system of commerce influence.

For instance, in ''The Administration of the Colonies'' (1764), [[Thomas Pownall]] (1722–1805) used the Newtonian concept of "attraction" to form the basis of his political and commercial theory of empire. Pownall's vision provided an important explanation of the mechanism by which colonial theorists understood the possibility of empire being "transferred" from one state to another. Pownall applied the Newtonian concept of gravity to his theory of empire, as evident in his suggestion that the "laws of nature" held the colonies to [[Great Britain]] in a manner "analogous in all cases, by which the center of gravity in the solar system" held the planets in their orbits. In making this analogy, Pownall's notion of 'social gravity' drew upon earlier visions of social cohesion, particularly ideas of sociability in eighteenth-century Britain. These ideas, in turn, were often predicated upon Stoic notions of [[cosmopolitanism]], expressed by the key term [[oikeiôsis]], in order to stress the "moral" imperative for like-minded humans to forge bonds dedicated to the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breuninger |first=Scott |date=Summer 2006 |title='Social Gravity' and the Translatio Tradition in Early American Theories of Empire |journal=Southern Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spy Booth''''' was an artwork by [[Banksy]] in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBCJun14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28032154|title=Fears Banksy Cheltenham 'spies' artwork will be removed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece has been seen as a critique of the [[global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Morris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/10/banksy-creator-spy-booth-wall-art-gchq|title=Banksy confirms he is creator of Spy Booth wall art near GCHQ |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robin Barton and [[Bankrobber London]] helped with the preservation of the artwork,&lt;ref name=BBCJun29_6_14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28078938 |title=Cheltenham Banksy: Deal to save it 'close to agreement'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to broker the removal and sale of the piece. However the artwork was painted onto a Grade II [[listed building]] - [[153-159 Fairview Road]] - and the council prevented it from being removed, giving it retrospective listed building consent in 2015 and affording it some protection from removal. Despite this, the artwork was either removed or destroyed in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-37148473&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Stephen Foster’s sketchbook''' is the hand-written book authored by early American [[composer]] and [[lyricist]] [[Stephen Collins Foster]]. It spans a nine-year period beginning on June 26, 1851. It was donated to the [[University of Pittsburgh Library System]] by the Foster family in the early 1930s. The National History Education Clearinghouse considers it a " useful resource for those researching Foster or the history of 19th-century American music and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stephen Foster's Sketchbook | publisher= National History Education Clearinghouse | url = http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/website-reviews/22662# | accessdate = 2016-12-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe at the archives.jpg|thumb|left|The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe at the archives]]
The sketchbook measures {{convert|12|by|8|in|cm|abbr=off}} and contains 113 leaves of half-bound paper. The papers are of the same material and contained in a cover of thick paper boards, covered in red and blue marbleized paper and brown [[leather]]. Eight pages are missing. One page had been cut out by the composer’s granddaughter but was restored to its original place in the sketchbook. The entries are consistent, similar and handwritten with pencil. The book is inscribed “Allegheny City June 26, 1851” in Foster’s hand on page 1.&lt;ref name="aid1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Stephen Foster's Sketchbook|url=http://images.library.pitt.edu/s/sketchbook/songs.html|year=|publisher=Foster Hall Collection, Center for American Music, University of Pittsburgh Library System, University of Pittsbrugh|access-date= 14 August 2016|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The sketchbook contains handwritten draft texts for sixty-four different songs. Some of these were some of his most popular. Some pages contain musical notations, draft lyrics are for unpublished songs, scribbles, doodles, and exercises. In some places it appears that Foster practiced his signature and initials.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=blake&gt;{{cite web|first=Sharon |last = Blake|title=Stephen Foster's Personal Sketchbook Now Online, Pages show original lyrics and doodles of America's first professional songwriter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=&amp;pg=PA|year=2005|publisher=University of Pittsburgh News Service |access-date= 14 August 2016|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the digital version, a photostat of the sketchbook was published by the staff of the Foster Hall Collection in 1933. This full transcript of the book was created by Deane L. Root and edited by Kathryn Miller Haines in June 2000. The Transcript field within the database contains the text and is searchable. Foliation (recto and verso) numbers were supplied in 1986 using archival techniques.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;

The draft and original text for Foster's song "[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]" is contained in the sketchbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foster | first = Stephen | title = Stephen Foster collection : 10 early American songs for solo voice and piano&amp;nbsp;— medium high edition | publisher = Alfred Publishing Company | location = Van Nuys, CA | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781470635886 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Foster records his meeting with [[Charles Dickens]] while Dickens was visiting in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powel|first1=John|title=Biographical dictionary of literary influences: the nineteenth century, 1800-1914|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=031330422X|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digitizing the Sketchbook==

Dr. Julia Craig-McFeeley of the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford, England created the digitized version of the sketchbook in March 2005. The digitizing was performed by a PhaseOne PowerPhase FX digital scanning back mounted on a Fuji GX 680 III professional SLR camera body and medium format lens at a resolution of 800dpi.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;

Stephen Foster's sketchbook was used as a display and exhibition for recent visits from library archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Manuscript Society gets a new look at some very old writings in Pittsburgh |publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Anya |last=Sostek| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/05/23/Historical-documents-put-on-display-here-Group-gets-a-new-look-at-some-very-old-writings/stories/201405230069 | date= 22 May 2014

{{Quote box|width=80em|align=center|quote=The Public Broadcasting organization describes the sketchbook:
"''Stephen spent much of his life in Pittsburgh where he worked consistently at his songwriting, keeping a thick sketchbook to draft ideas for song lyrics and melodies. As a professional songwriter of unparalleled skill and technique &amp;ndash; not an untutored musical genius &amp;ndash; he had made it his business to study the various music and poetic styles circulating in the immigrant populations of the new United States. His intention was to write the people's music, using images and a musical vocabulary that would be widely understood by all groups. Foster worked very hard at writing, sometimes taking several months to craft and polish the words, melody, and accompaniment of a song before sending it off to a publisher. His sketchbook shows that he often labored over the smallest details, the right prepositions, even where to include or remove a comma from his lyrics."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = American Experience, Stephen Foster | publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/p_sfoster.html | accessdate = 2016-12-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{div col end}} }}

In the first fourteen SSEP flight opportunities, 86,800 students in grades 5 through 16 ([[Senior (education)|senior undergraduate]] in the [[higher education in the United States|U.S. higher education system]]) participated in experiment design and proposal writing. Of 18,759 proposals received, a total of 240 experiments were selected for flight, with one from each community participating in each flight opportunity. {{As of|2017|8|14}}, 206 of these experiments have been successfully launched.&lt;ref name="experiments_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Experiments Selected for Flight | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 experiments comprising Mission 6 to the ISS were lost when the [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]] vehicle exploded shortly after launch on 28 October 2014.&lt;ref name=bever&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=Lindsey|title=Students lost science experiments in Antares explosion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/students-lost-science-experiments-in-antares-explosion/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The competition to select student projects for flight is designed to resemble a standard [[research proposal]] process. Interested groups must submit proposals in response to [[request for proposal|announced criteria]]; these proposals are then [[peer-review]]ed against the criteria in a two-stage selection process, with the vast majority of proposals rejected.&lt;ref name="the_competition"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Flight Experiment Design Competition | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education  | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/the-flight-experiment-design-competition/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each selected experiment is provided with one mini-laboratory, which is flown on the ISS and then returned to Earth for analysis.&lt;ref name="mission7"/&gt; Experiments selected for flight have included research into [[crystal growth]], [[composting]], [[cell division]], [[seed germination]], and [[calcium metabolism]].&lt;ref name="mission4_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 4 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-4-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission5_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 5 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-5-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission6_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 6 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-6-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of each experiment is on the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]24,500, which must be raised by the community developing the experiment.&lt;ref name="bass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/ssep-program-costs/|title=SSEP Program costs|last=|first=|date=|work=ncesse.org|publisher=National Center for Earth and Space Science Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have an opportunity to share their research at a national conference sponsored by the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]], NCESSE, and the Clarke Institute.&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; Students participating in the program have also been given the chance to participate in a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]] with space station astronauts.&lt;ref name="nasm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grove | first = Tim | title = An Out-of-This-World Program | work = nasm.si.edu | publisher = Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | date = April 26, 2013 | url = http://blog.nasm.si.edu/education/an-out-of-this-world-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], the term '''subspecies''' refers to a unity of populations of a [[species]] living in a subdivision of the species' global range and varies  from other populations of the same species by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |year=1982 |title=Of what use are subspecies? |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=593−595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Monroe, B. L. |year=1982 |title=A modern concept of the subspecies |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=608−609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A subspecies cannot be recognized independently. A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated '''subsp.''' in [[botany]] and [[bacteriology]], or '''ssp.''' in [[zoology]]. The [[plural]] is the same as the singular: ''subspecies''.

In [[zoology]], under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], other [[infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks]], such as [[variety (botany)|variety]], may be named. In [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]], under standard [[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|bacterial nomenclature]] and [[virus classification|virus nomenclature]], there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies or not. A common criterion for a subspecies is its ability of [[interbreeding]] with a different subspecies of the same species and producing fertile offspring. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to their [[Allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] and [[sexual selection]]. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
In [[zoology]], the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (4th edition, 1999) accepts only one rank below that of species, namely the rank of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp "Index"]. ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''. Fourth Edition. [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. January 1, 2000. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groupings, "[[infrasubspecific]] entities" do not have names regulated by the ''ICZN''. Such forms have no official ''ICZN'' status, though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical [[Cline (biology)|clines]], [[pet]] [[breed]]s, [[Transgenic animals#Transgenic animals|transgenic animals]], etc. While the scientific name of a species is a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomen]], the scientific name of a subspecies is a [[trinomen]] - a binomen followed by a subspecific name. A [[tiger]]'s binomen is ''Panthera tigris'', so for a [[Sumatran tiger]] the trinomen is, for example, ''Panthera tigris sumatrae''.  ''Subspecies'' is generally abbreviated as "ssp." in zoology, but is not used in scientific name.

In [[botany]], subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[subvariety]], [[form (botany)|form]], and subform. The subspecific name is preceded by "subsp.", as in ''Schoenoplectus californicus'' subsp. ''[[Totora (plant)|tatora]]''. A botanical name consists of at most three parts. An [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]] includes the species binomial, and one infraspecific epithet, such as subspecies or variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Mallet |title=Subspecies, semispecies, superspecies |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Sp/Sub-semi.pdf |website=ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Microbiology|bacteriology]], the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is ''subspecies'', but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of ''variety'' are taken to be names of subspecies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=icnb&amp;part=A185 "Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations"]. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes]]'').  As in botany, ''subspecies'' is conventionally abbreviated as "subsp.", and is used in the scientific name: ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' subsp. ''spizizenii''.&lt;ref name="ICNP 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |at="Names of Subspecies: Rule 13a"&lt;!--This document is not page-numbered.--&gt; |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision) |date=20 November 2015 |orig-year=2008 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |edition=ICSP Matters |volume=|issue=&lt;!--Appears to have been a special stand-alone issue; no vol./issue numbers specified.--&gt; |first1=Charles T. |last1=Parker |first2=Brian J. |last2=Tindall |first3=George M. |last3=Garrity |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000778|pmid=26596770 }} Full text available from PDF link at this page; direct URL to PDF is auto-generated and expires.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominotypical subspecies, and subspecies autonyms===
{{anchor|Nominate subspecies|Autonymous subspecies|Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms|reason=previous section names, and term anchors}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subspecies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=true&amp;article=47 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominate subspecies", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, ''Motacilla alba alba'' (often abbreviated ''M. a. alba'') is the nominotypical subspecies of the [[white wagtail]] (''Motacilla alba'').

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in [[botanical nomenclature]] as the subspecies "[[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]", and the subspecific taxon as the "autonymous subspecies".&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeill |first1=J. |last2=Barrie |first2=F. R. |last3=Buck |first3=W. R. |last4=Demoulin |first4=V. |last5=Greuter |first5=W. |last6=Hawksworth |first6=D. L. |last7=Herendeen |first7=P. S. |last8=Knapp |first8=S. |last9=Marhold |first9=K. |last10=Prado |first10=J. |last11=Prud'homme Van Reine |first11=W.F. |last12=Smith |first12=G. F. |last13=Wiersema |first13=J.

J. |date=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus ''Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus'' means the [[American herring gull]]; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger [[European herring gull|herring gull]] species and therefore call it ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', while others consider it a full species and therefore call it ''Larus smithsonianus'' (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only recognized rank in the zoological code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |title=ICZN Glossary |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |editor1-first=Gary |editor1-last=Rosenberg |display-editors=etal |url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter J. |last1=Russell |first2=Paul E. |last2=Hertz |first3=Beverly |last3=McMillan |title=Biology: The Dynamic Science |publisher=Brooks/Cole California |date=2011 |chapter=21: Speciation |page=456 |isbn=978-1133418849 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
[[File:One horned Rhino.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis'') is a [[monotypic]] species]]
In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a ''[[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]]'' species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, [[Race (biology)|races]], or more generally speaking, [[population]]s that need a separate description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, E. |author-link=Mayr, Ernst |title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution |year=1970 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed, although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone, but which may interbreed if given the chance to do so. These subspecies, races, or populations, can be named as subspecies by zoologists, or in more varied ways by botanists and microbiologists.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]]'' species has no distinct population or races, or rather one race comprising the whole species. A taxonomist would not name a subspecies within such a species. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation always indicates substantial [[gene flow]] among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8066">The '''University of Washington Department of Global Health''' is a department jointly run by the schools of [[University of Washington School of Medicine|Medicine]] and [[University of Washington School of Public Health|Public Health]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. Its aim is to provide a multidisciplinary venue to address issues of [[global health]] at the university.

The department was begun with funding supplied by the [[Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Nick. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2002346623&amp;zsection_id=2002111777&amp;slug=globalhealth24m&amp;date=20050624 “UW to add global health studies.”] ''The Seattle Times'', 24 June 2005, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/256259_globalhealth19.html “UW gets global-health shot in the arm $30 million from Gates Foundation.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 19 Jan. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the Department ==
The Department of Global Health was launched in January 2007 with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the state of Washington, and the University of Washington, with a mandate to harness the extraordinary expertise, energy, and creativity of faculty across all 17 UW schools and colleges to create one of the most comprehensive academic global health programs in the world.[1]

The pioneering work of UW researchers in sexually transmitted diseases in the 1970s and 1980s paved the way for the University's leading role in HIV/AID research and training, and, now, global health.

The Department is housed in both the School of Medicine and School of Public Health and has formed linkages across campus and throughout the world to help address not only infectious diseases but a host of pressing global health issues, including health metrics and evaluation; the health of women, children, and adolescents; [[health system strengthening]] and implementation science; climate change and health; global trauma and violence prevention; and global medicines safety with a cross-cutting focus on social justice and equity. The Center for Integrated Health of Women, Children, and Adolescents, for example, includes at least 22 collaborations (13 on campus and partnerships in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mexico, and Peru). And the initiative on Climate Change and Global Health involves more than 25 collaborations on campus and beyond.

Its closely affiliated centers also include the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME), the International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), the International Clinical Research Center (ICRFC), the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Health Alliance International (HaI), and the Global Health Resource Center (GHRC).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Global Health brochure, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department has strong ties in Kenya, Peru, Mozambique, and Ethiopia. But worldwide, the Department works with nearly 250 collaborating organizations, including universities and hospitals, NGOs, government agencies, and ministries of health.

Quote from Howard Frumkin MD, MPH, Dean of the UW School of Public Health: "Global health represents the best of academic health sciences -- transdisciplinary systems thinking, cross-cultural sensitivity, rigorous scientific research, hands-on participatory training, effective service delivery with impact empirically measured, and sustainable collaboration. This Department is outstanding. "

== Education ==
'''Master's Level:''' The Department offers several global health tracks for a master of Public Health degree: General; Leadership, Policy, and Management; Health Metrics and Evaluation; Peace Corps; Epidemiology; and concurrent degrees.

'''Doctoral Programs:''' The Department offers a doctoral program in Pathobiology. A doctoral program in global health with emphases on health metrics and evaluation and implementation science is in development.

'''Fellowship Programs:''' The Department offers post-bachelor and post-graduate fellowship programs with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

'''Certificate Programs:''' The Department has a certificate program in Global Health and a program in AIDS and STIs. Medical students also can take a Global Health Pathway.

'''Undergraduate Programs:''' An undergraduate minor in global health was launched in January 2011.

== Selection of the Chair ==
[[Jim Yong Kim]], formerly of [[Partners in Health]] and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[HIV/AIDS]] program, was originally a candidate for director of the department, but was not selected.  A controversial second selection process involving three new candidates took place in late 2005 and early 2006. The process was criticized for not being open, and there was concern&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/259935_uwglobalhealth17.html “Concern over new UW department.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 17 Feb. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erkkinen, Meghan. [http://dailyuw.com/2006/2/23/student-voices-an-issue/ “Student voices an issue.”] ''The Daily of the University of Washington'', 23 Feb. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; among the student body and faculty about the chosen chair. Some feared that the department would be too heavily oriented towards [[biomedical research]] and [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[vaccine]] development) and would neglect the broader issues of public health, such as [[social justice]], [[health disparities]], [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], [[health promotion|promotion]], human resources in health, and [[public policy]]. Some also feared that the areas of education and service would be sacrificed for a research agenda, and pointed to the fact that one of the first steps in implementing the department was the leasing of a large facility off campus in Seattle's [[South Lake Union]] neighborhood - an area being developed as a biotechnology hub.&lt;ref&gt;Engleman, Eric. [http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/01/09/daily13.html?jst=b_ln_hl “UW signs lease at Seattle’s South Lake Union.”] ''Puget Sound Business Journal'' (Seattle), 11 Jan. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Those within the process argued that planning was open and that the department would be multidisciplinary and would live up to its stated vision of taking a broad approach to global health. They also noted that while the department would have some facilities off campus, it would be primarily based at the university; the deans of the schools committed to finding on-campus space to house the department's administrative offices, although much of the lab space was planned to be located in a building in the Eastlake neighborhood.

In Spring, 2006, Michael Merson of [[Yale University]] was offered the position of director. However, in July of that year it was announced that Merson had been appointed direct of [[Duke University]]'s Global Health Institute.

On September 8, University of Washington announced King K. Holmes, MD, PhD, a world leader in AIDS and infectious disease research and training, to become the first chair of the University of Washington's new Department of Global Health.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/284329_globalhealth08.html “UW picks Holmes to lead new global health program.”] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 8 Sept. 2006, (accessed July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; His leadership in global health research and training, and experience as a public-health practitioner, will serve Holmes well in leading the Department of Global Health, according to Paul G. Ramsey, dean of the School of Medicine.

In large scale oceanic [[civil engineering]], '''vacuum-anchors''' are ocean bottom fasteners used to anchor deep seas oil platforms (example: See [[Troll A platform|Troll A Oil Platform]]) and other [[gravity base structure|gravity base technology]] based structures&lt;ref name="NGSD"&gt;A National Geographic Channel production, documentary 2007(?), rebroadcast 2009-10-02, 12-13:00 hrs EDST (Comcast Cable Television system)&lt;/ref&gt; in the soupy soft bottomed muck found on many oil bearing continental shelves and the world's shallower seas. Gravity based anchor legs flare out forming a wider footprint where they contact the bottom&lt;ref name="NGSD" /&gt; much as the webbed feet of many aquatic animals increase the surface area above the vacuum-anchors which are open ended long cylindrical shaped deep cups&lt;ref name="NGSD" /&gt; with a sealed top end closed by a valve which connects and anchors mechanically to the legs of the gravity based structure. The valve is used to exhaust any gases and liquid which seeks to escape the trapped sea bottom materials entering the open end of the anchor.

Physically, these are the upscaled analog of a tall drinking glass filled with water then turned upside down and secured in place bottom-side-up. When a lifting or sideways force is applied to such a container, the [[weight]] and [[inertia]] of the enclosed mass (The mushy gravel, mud, water, and rock solution of the sea bed) must also be displaced (lifted or moved sideways) which anchors them firmly in place within the surrounding materials of the soft bottom. When lifted, any enclosed material attempting to spill out of the enclosure creates a vacuum, just as does the container in the kitchen sink, giving the anchor their name.

'''Vibration''' is a mechanical phenomenon whereby [[oscillation]]s occur about an [[equilibrium point]]. The word comes from Latin ''vibrationem'' ("shaking, brandishing"). The oscillations may be [[periodic function|periodic]], such as the motion of a pendulum—or [[random]], such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.

Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a [[tuning fork]], the [[Reed (music)|reed]] in a [[woodwind instrument]] or [[harmonica]], a [[mobile phone]], or the cone of a [[loudspeaker]].

In many cases, however, vibration is undesirable, wasting [[energy]] and creating unwanted [[sound]]. For example, the vibrational motions of [[engine]]s, [[electric motor]]s, or any [[Machine|mechanical device]] in operation are typically unwanted. Such vibrations could be caused by [[Engine balance|imbalances]] in the rotating parts, uneven [[friction]], or the meshing of [[gear]] teeth. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.

The studies of sound and vibration are closely related.  Sound, or pressure [[wave]]s, are generated by vibrating structures (e.g. [[vocal cords]]); these pressure waves can also induce the vibration of structures (e.g. [[ear drum]]).  Hence, attempts to reduce noise are often related to issues of vibration.

==Types of vibration==

''' Free vibration''' occurs when a mechanical system is set in motion with an initial input and allowed to vibrate freely.  Examples of this type of vibration are pulling a child back on a swing and letting it go, or hitting a tuning fork and letting it ring. The mechanical system vibrates at one or more of its [[resonance|natural frequencies]] and [[damping|damps]] down to motionlessness.

'''Forced  vibration''' is when a time-varying disturbance (load, displacement or velocity) is applied to a mechanical system. The disturbance can be a periodic and steady-state input, a transient input, or a random input. The periodic input can be a harmonic or a non-harmonic disturbance. Examples of these types of vibration include a washing machine shaking due to an imbalance, transportation vibration caused by an engine or uneven road, or the vibration of a building during an earthquake. For linear systems, the frequency of the steady-state vibration response resulting from the application of a periodic, harmonic input is equal to the frequency of the applied force or motion, with the response magnitude being dependent on the actual mechanical system.

'''Damped vibration:''' When the energy of a vibrating system is gradually dissipated by friction and other resistances, the vibrations are said to be damped. The vibrations gradually reduce or change in frequency or intensity or cease and the system rests in its equilibrium position. An example of this type of vibration is the [[Vehicle suspension|vehicular suspension]] dampened by the [[shock absorber]].

==Vibration testing==

Vibration testing is accomplished by introducing a forcing function into a structure, usually with some type of shaker. Alternately, a DUT (device under test) is attached to the "table" of a shaker. Vibration testing is performed to examine the response of a device under test (DUT) to a defined vibration environment. The measured response may be fatigue life, resonant frequencies or squeak and rattle sound output ([[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]). Squeak and rattle testing is performed with a special type of ''quiet shaker'' that produces very low sound levels while under operation.

For relatively low frequency forcing, servohydraulic (electrohydraulic) shakers are used.  For higher frequencies, electrodynamic shakers are used.  Generally, one or more "input" or "control" points located on the DUT-side of a fixture is kept at a specified acceleration.&lt;ref name="Tustin06"&gt;Tustin, Wayne. ''[https://www.evaluationengineering.com/where-to-place-the-control-accelerometer Where to place the control accelerometer: one of the most critical decisions in developing random vibration tests also is the most neglected]'', EE-Evaluation Engineering, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other "response" points experience maximum vibration level (resonance) or minimum vibration level (anti-resonance). It is often desirable to achieve anti-resonance to keep a system from becoming too noisy, or to reduce strain on certain parts due to vibration modes caused by specific vibration frequencies .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Polytec InFocus 1/2007 | url =http://www.polytec.com/fileadmin/user_uploads/Applications/InFocus/Documents/OM_InFocus_2007_01_US.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of vibration testing services conducted by vibration test labs are Sinusoidal and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are performed to survey the structural response of the device under test (DUT). A random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.

Most vibration testing is conducted in a 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously.  MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The ''vibration test fixture'' used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may be present in the future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called [[vibroscope]]s.

==Vibration analysis==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Vibration Analysis (VA), applied in an industrial or maintenance environment aims to reduce maintenance costs and equipment downtime by detecting equipment faults.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Art; Simplified Handbook of Vibration Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eshleman, R 1999, Basic machinery vibrations: An introduction to machine testing, analysis, and monitoring&lt;/ref&gt; VA is a key component of a Condition Monitoring (CM) program, and is often referred to as Predictive Maintenance (PdM).&lt;ref&gt;Mobius Institute; Vibration Analyst Category 2 - Course Notes 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly VA is used to detect faults in rotating equipment (Fans, Motors, Pumps, and Gearboxes etc.) such as Unbalance, Misalignment, rolling element bearing faults and resonance conditions.

VA can use the units of Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration displayed as a [[Waveform|time waveform]] (TWF), but most commonly the spectrum is used, derived from a [[fast Fourier transform]] of the TWF. The vibration spectrum provides important frequency information that can pinpoint the faulty component.

The fundamentals of vibration analysis can be understood by studying the simple [[Mass-spring-damper]] model.  Indeed, even a complex structure such as an automobile body can be modeled as a "summation" of simple mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper models.  The mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model is an example of a [[simple harmonic oscillator]]. The mathematics used to describe its behavior is identical to other simple harmonic oscillators such as the [[RLC circuit]].

Note: This article does not include the step-by-step mathematical derivations, but focuses on major vibration analysis equations and concepts.  Please refer to the references at the end of the article for detailed derivations.

===Free vibration without damping===

[[File:Mass spring.svg|200px|right|Simple Mass Spring Model]] To start the investigation of the mass–spring–damper assume the damping is negligible and that there is no external force applied to the mass (i.e. free vibration). The force applied to the mass by the spring is proportional to the amount the spring is stretched "x" (assuming the spring is already compressed due to the weight of the mass). The proportionality constant, k, is the stiffness of the spring and has units of force/distance (e.g. lbf/in or N/m). The negative sign indicates that the force is always opposing the motion of the mass attached to it:
:&lt;math&gt;
F_s=- k x. \!
&lt;/math&gt;
The force generated by the mass is proportional to the acceleration of the mass as given by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]:
:&lt;math&gt; 
\Sigma\ F = ma = m \ddot{x} = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the forces on the mass then generates this [[ordinary differential equation]]: &lt;math&gt;  \ m \ddot{x} + k x = 0.&lt;/math&gt; 
[[File:Simple harmonic oscillator.gif|thumb|100px|right|Simple harmonic motion of the mass–spring system]] Assuming that the initiation of vibration begins by stretching the spring by the distance of ''A'' and releasing, the solution to the above equation that describes the motion of mass is: 
:&lt;math&gt;
x(t) =  A \cos (2 \pi f_n  t). \!
&lt;/math&gt;
This solution says that it will oscillate with [[simple harmonic motion]] that has an [[amplitude]] of ''A'' and a frequency of ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The number ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the '''undamped natural frequency'''. For the simple mass–spring system, ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
f_n = {1\over {2 \pi}} \sqrt{k \over m}. \!
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: [[angular frequency]] ω (ω=2 π ''f'') with the units of radians per second is often used in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to [[ordinary frequency]] (units of [[hertz|Hz]] or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness of the system is known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.

====What causes the system to vibrate: from conservation of energy point of view====

Vibrational motion could be understood in terms of [[conservation of energy]]. In the above example the spring has been extended by a value of x and therefore some [[potential energy]] (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} k x^2&lt;/math&gt;) is stored in the spring. Once released, the spring tends to return to its un-stretched state (which is the minimum potential energy state) and in the process accelerates the mass. At the point where the spring has reached its un-stretched state all the potential energy that we supplied by stretching it has been transformed into [[kinetic energy]] (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;). The mass then begins to decelerate because it is now compressing the spring and in the process transferring the kinetic energy back to its potential. Thus oscillation of the spring amounts to the transferring back and forth of the kinetic energy into potential energy. In this simple model the mass continues to oscillate forever at the same magnitude—but in a real system, ''damping'' always dissipates the energy, eventually bringing the spring to rest.

===Free vibration with damping===
[[File:Mass spring damper.svg|thumb|right|Mass–spring–damper model]]

When a "viscous" damper is added to the model this outputs a force that is proportional to the velocity of the mass.  The damping is called viscous because it models the effects of a fluid  within an object.  The proportionality constant ''c'' is called the damping coefficient and has units of Force over velocity (lbf⋅s/in or N⋅s/m).

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{d}  =  - c v  = - c \dot{x} =  - c \frac{dx}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + kx = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation depends on the amount of damping.  If the damping is small enough, the system still vibrates—but eventually, over time, stops vibrating.  This case is called underdamping, which is important in vibration analysis. If  damping is increased just to the point where the system no longer oscillates, the system has reached the point of [[critical damping]]. If the damping is increased past critical damping, the system is [[overdamped]].   The value that the damping coefficient must reach for critical damping in the [[mass-spring-damper model]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{c} = 2 \sqrt{\text{km}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To characterize the amount of damping in a system a ratio called the [[damping ratio]] (also known as damping factor and % critical damping) is used.  This damping ratio is just a ratio of the actual damping over the amount of damping required to reach critical damping.  The formula for the damping ratio (&lt;math&gt;\zeta &lt;/math&gt;) of the mass-spring-damper model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = { c \over 2 \sqrt{\text{km}} }.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, metal structures (e.g., airplane fuselages, engine crankshafts) have damping factors less than 0.05, while automotive suspensions are in the range of 0.2&amp;ndash;0.3. The solution to the [[underdamped system]] for the mass-spring-damper model is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=X  e^{-\zeta \omega_n t} \cos\left( \sqrt{1-\zeta^2} \omega_n t - \phi \right) , \qquad \omega_n = 2\pi f_n. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Damped Free Vibration.png|thumb|right|Free vibration with 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratio]]

The value of ''X'', the initial magnitude, and &lt;math&gt; \phi, &lt;/math&gt; the [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]], are determined by the amount the spring is stretched.  The formulas for these values can be found in the references.

====Damped and undamped natural frequencies====
&lt;!--A link from Damping links here--&gt;

The major points to note from the solution are the exponential term and the cosine function.  The exponential term defines how quickly the system “damps” down – the larger the damping ratio, the quicker it damps to zero.  The cosine function is the oscillating portion of the solution, but the frequency of the oscillations is different from the undamped case.

The frequency in this case is called the "damped natural frequency", &lt;math&gt; f_\text{d}, &lt;/math&gt; and is related to the undamped natural frequency by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{d}= f_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The damped natural frequency is less than the undamped natural frequency, but for many practical cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are often dropped when stating the natural frequency (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio, the damped natural frequency is only 1% less than the undamped).

The plots to the side present how 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratios effect how the system “rings” down over time. What is often done in practice is to experimentally measure the free vibration after an impact (for example by a hammer) and then determine the natural frequency of the system by measuring the rate of oscillation, as well as the damping ratio by measuring the rate of decay. The natural frequency and damping ratio are not only important in free vibration, but also characterize how a system behaves under forced vibration.{{multiple image

===Forced vibration with damping===
The behavior of the spring mass damper model varies with the addition of a harmonic force. A force of this type could, for example, be generated by a rotating imbalance.

:&lt;math&gt;F= F_0 \sin(2 \pi f t). \!&lt;/math&gt;

Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + k x = F_0 \sin(2 \pi f t). &lt;/math&gt;

The [[steady state]] solution of this problem can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)= X \sin(2 \pi f t +\phi). \!&lt;/math&gt;

The result states that the mass will oscillate at the same frequency, ''f'', of the applied force, but with a phase shift &lt;math&gt; \phi. &lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude of the vibration “X” is defined by the following formula.

:&lt;math&gt;X= {F_0 \over k} {1 \over \sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2 \zeta r)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where “r” is defined as the ratio of the harmonic force frequency over the undamped natural frequency of the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model.

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{f}{f_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase shift, &lt;math&gt;\phi,&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following formula.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= \arctan\left (\frac{-2 \zeta r}{1-r^2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Forced Vibration Response.png|700px|Forced Vibration Response]]

The plot of these functions, called "the frequency response of the system", presents one of the most important features in forced vibration.  In a lightly damped system when the forcing frequency nears the natural frequency (&lt;math&gt;r \approx 1 &lt;/math&gt;) the amplitude of the vibration can get extremely high.  This phenomenon is called '''[[mechanical resonance|resonance]]''' (subsequently the natural frequency of a system is often referred to as the resonant frequency).  In rotor bearing systems any rotational speed that excites a resonant frequency is referred to as a [[critical speed]].

If resonance occurs in a mechanical system it can be very harmful – leading to eventual failure of the system. Consequently, one of the major reasons for vibration analysis is to predict when this type of resonance may occur and then to determine what steps to take to prevent it from occurring. As the amplitude plot shows, adding damping can significantly reduce the magnitude of the vibration.  Also, the magnitude can be reduced if the natural frequency can be shifted away from the forcing frequency by changing the stiffness or mass of the system. If the system cannot be changed, perhaps the forcing frequency can be shifted (for example, changing the speed of the machine generating the force).

The following are some other points in regards to the forced vibration shown in the frequency response plots.

*At a given frequency ratio, the amplitude of the vibration, ''X'', is directly proportional to the amplitude of the force &lt;math&gt;F_0 &lt;/math&gt; (e.g. if you double the force, the vibration doubles)
*With little or no damping, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and 180 degrees out of phase when the frequency ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1
*When ''r''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1 the amplitude is just the deflection of the spring under the static force &lt;math&gt;F_0. &lt;/math&gt;  This deflection is called the static deflection &lt;math&gt;\delta_{st}.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1 the effects of the damper and the mass are minimal.
*When ''r''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1 the amplitude of the vibration is actually less than the static deflection &lt;math&gt;\delta_{st}.&lt;/math&gt;  In this region the force generated by the mass (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ma'') is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, ''X'', is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kx'') to the base is reduced. Therefore, the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the mounting base – referred to as [[vibration isolation]]. More damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1 because the damping force (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''cv'') is also transmitted to the base.
* whatever the damping is, the vibration is 90 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which is very helpful when it comes to determining the natural frequency of the system.
* whatever the damping is, when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1, the vibration is 180 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency
* whatever the damping is, when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency

====Resonance causes====

Resonance is simple to understand if the spring and mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As in the case of the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.

The damper, instead of storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping force is proportional to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.

====Applying "complex" forces to the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model====

In a previous section only a simple harmonic force was applied to the model, but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools. The first is the [[Fourier transform]] that takes a signal as a function of time ([[time domain]]) and breaks it down into its harmonic components as a function of frequency ([[frequency domain]]). For example, by applying a force to the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model that repeats the following cycle – a force equal to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|newton]] for 0.5&amp;nbsp;second and then no force for 0.5&amp;nbsp;second. This type of force has the shape of a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz [[square wave]].

[[File:Square wave frequency spectrum animation.gif|thumb|300px|How a 1 Hz square wave can be represented as a summation of sine waves(harmonics) and the corresponding frequency spectrum. Click and go to full resolution for an animation]]

The Fourier transform of the square wave generates a [[frequency spectrum]] that presents the magnitude of the harmonics that make up the square wave (the phase is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not plotted). The Fourier transform can also be used to analyze non-[[periodic function|periodic]] functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The Fourier transform is almost always computed using the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) computer algorithm in combination with a [[window function]].

In the case of our square wave force, the first component is actually a constant force of 0.5 newton and is represented by a value at 0&amp;nbsp;Hz in the frequency spectrum. The next component is a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.64.  This is shown by the line at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. The remaining components are at odd frequencies and it takes an infinite amount of sine waves to generate the perfect square wave.  Hence, the Fourier transform allows you to interpret the force as a sum of sinusoidal forces being applied instead of a more "complex" force (e.g. a square wave).

In the previous section, the vibration solution was given for a single harmonic force, but the Fourier transform in general gives multiple harmonic forces.  The second mathematical tool, "the principle of [[superposition principle|superposition"]], allows the summation of the solutions from multiple forces if the system is [[linear system|linear]]. In the case of the spring–mass–damper model, the system is linear if the spring force is proportional to the displacement and the damping is proportional to the velocity over the range of motion of interest.  Hence, the solution to the problem with a square wave is summing the predicted vibration from each one of the harmonic forces found in the frequency spectrum of the square wave.

====Frequency response model====

The solution of a vibration problem can be viewed as an input/output relation – where the force is the input and the output is the vibration.  Representing the force and vibration in the frequency domain (magnitude and phase) allows the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(i\omega)=H(i\omega)\cdot F(i\omega) \text{ or } H(i\omega)= {X(i\omega) \over F(i\omega)}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H(i\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[frequency response]] function (also referred to as the [[transfer function]], but not technically as accurate) and has both a magnitude and phase component (if represented as a [[complex number]], a real and imaginary component). The magnitude of the frequency response function (FRF) was presented earlier for the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system.

:&lt;math&gt;|H(i\omega)|=\left |{X(i\omega) \over F(i\omega)} \right|= {1 \over k} {1 \over \sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2 \zeta r)^2}}, \text{ where } r=\frac{f}{f_n}=\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase of the FRF was also presented earlier as:

:&lt;math&gt;\angle H(i\omega)= -\arctan\left (\frac{2 \zeta r}{1-r^2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

For example, calculating the FRF for a mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system with a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg, spring stiffness of 1.93&amp;nbsp;N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7&amp;nbsp;Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1&amp;nbsp;Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7&amp;nbsp;Hz. The frequency response of the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper therefore outputs a high 7&amp;nbsp;Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7&amp;nbsp;Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.

[[File:Frequency response example.png|thumb|left|300px|Frequency response model]]

The figure also shows the time domain representation of the resulting vibration. This is done by performing an inverse Fourier Transform that converts frequency domain data to time domain. In practice, this is rarely done because the frequency spectrum provides all the necessary information.

The frequency response function (FRF) does not necessarily have to be calculated from the knowledge of the mass, damping, and stiffness of the system—but can be measured experimentally. For example, if a known force over a range of frequencies is applied, and if the associated vibrations are measured, the frequency response function can be calculated, thereby characterizing the system. This technique is used in the field of experimental [[modal analysis]] to determine the vibration characteristics of a structure.

==Multiple degrees of freedom systems and mode shapes==

The simple mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model is the foundation of vibration analysis, but what about more complex systems?  The mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model described above is called a single [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] (SDOF) model since the mass is assumed to only move up and down.  In more complex systems, the system must be discretized into more masses that move in more than one direction, adding degrees of freedom.  The major concepts of multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF) can be understood by looking at just a 2 degree of freedom model as shown in the figure.
[[File:2dof model.gif|thumb|300px|right|2 degree of freedom model]]

The equations of motion of the 2DOF system are found to be:

:&lt;math&gt;
m_1 \ddot{x_1} + (c_1+c_2) \dot{x_1} - c_2 \dot{x_2}+ (k_1+k_2) x_1 - k_2 x_2= f_1,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
m_2 \ddot{x_2} - c_2 \dot{x_1}+ (c_2+c_3) \dot{x_2} - k_2 x_1+ (k_2+k_3) x_2 = f_2. \!
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be rewritten in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] format:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}m_1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; m_2\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x_1}\\ \ddot{x_2} \end{Bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} c_1+c_2 &amp; -c_2\\ -c_2 &amp; c_2+c_3\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\dot{x_1}\\ \dot{x_2}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}k_1+k_2 &amp; -k_2\\ -k_2 &amp; k_2+k_3\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} f_1\\ f_2\end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A more compact form of this matrix equation can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\dot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} f \end{Bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are [[symmetric matrices]] referred respectively as the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices.  The matrices are NxN square matrices where N is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

The following analysis involves the case where there is no damping and no applied forces (i.e. free vibration). The solution of a viscously damped system is somewhat more complicated.&lt;ref name="MaiaSilva97"&gt;Maia, Silva. ''Theoretical And Experimental Modal Analysis'', Research Studies Press Ltd., 1997, {{ISBN|0-471-97067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation can be solved by assuming the following type of solution:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: Using the exponential solution of &lt;math&gt; \begin{Bmatrix} X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; is a mathematical trick used to solve linear differential equations. Using [[Euler's formula]] and taking only the real part of the solution it is the same cosine solution for the 1 DOF system.  The exponential solution is only used because it is easier to manipulate mathematically.

The equation then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}-\omega^2 \begin{bmatrix} M \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} K \end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; cannot equal zero the equation reduces to the following.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}-\omega^2 \begin{bmatrix} M \end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} X \end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Eigenvalue problem===

This is referred to an [[eigenvalue]] problem in mathematics and can be put in the standard format by pre-multiplying the equation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}-\omega^2 \begin{bmatrix} M \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and if: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=\omega^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}-\lambda\begin{bmatrix}I\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the problem results in N '''eigenvalues''' (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^2,\omega_2^2,\cdots\omega_N^2&lt;/math&gt;), where N corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom.  The eigenvalues provide the natural frequencies of the system. When these eigenvalues are substituted back into the original set of equations, the values of &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; that correspond to each eigenvalue are called the '''eigenvectors'''.  These eigenvectors represent the [[mode shape]]s of the system. The solution of an eigenvalue problem can be quite cumbersome (especially for problems with many degrees of freedom), but fortunately most math analysis programs have eigenvalue routines.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are often written in the following matrix format and describe the modal model of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}^\diagdown \omega_{r\diagdown}^2 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \omega_N^2 \end{bmatrix} \text{ and } \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_1 \end{Bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_2 \end{Bmatrix} \cdots \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_N \end{Bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example using the 2 DOF model can help illustrate the concepts. Let both masses have a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg and the stiffness of all three springs equal 1000 N/m.  The mass and stiffness matrix for this problem are then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2000 &amp; -1000\\ -1000 &amp; 2000\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2000 &amp; -1000\\ -1000 &amp; 2000\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues for this problem given by an eigenvalue routine is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown \omega_{r\diagdown}^2 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1000 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 3000 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The natural frequencies in the units of hertz are then (remembering  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega=2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f_1=5.033 \mathrm {\ Hz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f_2=8.717 \text{ Hz}.&lt;/math&gt;

The two mode shapes for the respective natural frequencies are given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_1 \end{Bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_2 \end{Bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} -0.707 \\ -0.707 \end{Bmatrix}_1 \begin{Bmatrix} 0.707  \\ -0.707  \end{Bmatrix}_2 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the system is a 2 DOF system, there are two modes with their respective natural frequencies and shapes.  The mode shape vectors are not the absolute motion, but just describe relative motion of the degrees of freedom.  In our case the first mode shape vector is saying that the masses are moving together in phase since they have the same value and sign.  In the case of the second mode shape vector, each mass is moving in opposite direction at the same rate.

===Illustration of a multiple DOF problem===
When there are many degrees of freedom, one method of visualizing the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as [[Femap]] or [[ANSYS]]. An example of animating mode shapes is shown in the figure below for a [[cantilever]]ed [[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]] as demonstrated using [[modal analysis]] on ANSYS. In this case, the [[finite element method]] was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Vibration analysis|discrete eigenvalue problem]]. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes{{ref|1|†}}. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.

===Multiple DOF problem converted to a single DOF problem===

The eigenvectors have very important properties called orthogonality properties.  These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of multi-degree of freedom models.  It can be shown that the eigenvectors have the following properties:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]] that contain the modal mass and stiffness values for each one of the modes.  (Note: Since the eigenvectors (mode shapes) can be arbitrarily scaled, the orthogonality properties are often used to scale the eigenvectors so the modal mass value for each mode is equal to 1.  The modal mass matrix is therefore an [[identity matrix]])

These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of multi-degree of freedom models by making the following coordinate transformation.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x \end{Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end{Bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this coordinate transformation in the original free vibration differential equation results in the following equation.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \ddot{q} \end{Bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} K \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking advantage of the orthogonality properties by premultiplying this equation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The orthogonality properties then simplify this equation to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown}\end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is the foundation of vibration analysis for multiple degree of freedom systems. A similar type of result can be derived for damped systems.&lt;ref name="MaiaSilva97"/&gt; The key is that the modal mass and stiffness matrices are diagonal matrices and therefore the equations have been "decoupled".  In other words, the problem has been transformed from a large unwieldy multiple degree of freedom problem into many single degree of freedom problems that can be solved using the same methods outlined above.

Solving for ''x'' is replaced by solving for ''q'', referred to as the modal coordinates or modal participation factors.

It may be clearer to understand if  &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x \end{Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end{Bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x_n \end{Bmatrix}= q_1\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_1  +q_2\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_2  +q_3\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_3 +\cdots +  q_N\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_N.&lt;/math&gt;

Written in this form it can be seen that the vibration at each of the degrees of freedom is just a linear sum of the mode shapes.  Furthermore, how much each mode "participates" in the final vibration is defined by q, its modal participation factor.

=== Rigid-body mode ===
An unrestrained multi-degree of freedom system experiences both rigid-body translation and/or rotation and vibration. The existence of a rigid-body mode results in a zero natural frequency. The corresponding mode shape is called the rigid-body mode.
