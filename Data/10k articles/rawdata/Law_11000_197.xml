'''''Adams v. Burke''''', 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court first elaborated on the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]]. According to that doctrine, a so-called authorized sale of a patented product (one made by the patentee or a person authorized by it to sell the product) liberates the product from the patent monopoly. The product becomes the complete property of the purchaser and "passes without the monopoly." The property owner is then free to use or dispose of it as it may choose, free of any control by the patentee. ''Adams'' is a widely cited, leading case. A substantially identical doctrine applies in copyright law and is known as the "[[first sale doctrine]]".

As the Supreme Court recently explained, in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'', 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013), the principle comes from early English common law of property, explained in [[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke on Littleton]] early in the 17th Century. Under the common law, if a man is possessed of a chattel (item of personal property) and he transfers his property in it to another, no restriction against the use or disposition of the chattel will be effective, for that would hinder trade and commerce – it would interfere with bargaining among men. If once a patented product was sold and allowed to enter the stream of commerce, if it could be subject to restrictions (perhaps secret) on its use or further disposition, businessmen would not be able to know whether transactions in the product were effective and business certainty would be greatly impaired.

==Factual background==

In 1863, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US38713.pdf U.S. Patent No. 38,713] issued to the inventors Merrill and Horner for a  coffin lid that permitted interested persons to view the name-plate and inscription of the decedent in the coffin, irrespective of whether the coffin cover is open or closed. In 1865 they assigned to Lockhart &amp; Seelye of Cambridge. Massachusetts, the ownership of the patent in a circular area around Boston having a ten-mile radius. Adams, the plaintiff in this case, was the assignee of the patent in an area outside this circle which included the town of Natick, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p0crAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=patented+coffin+lid+Merrill&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=emeYj6_2sD&amp;sig=4uJqkCD5X-Vg6UUrcgIYuK_sT_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y1I4Vc2sDIWvggTw-IG4Bw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=patented%20coffin%20lid%20Merrill&amp;f=false ''Adams v. Burks''], 1 Fed. Cas. 100 (Case No. 50) (C.C.D. Mass. 1871).&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke, the defendant, was an undertaker doing business in Natick, Massachusetts, seventeen miles from Boston. Burke purchased some patented coffin lids from Lockhart &amp; Seelye, who had manufactured them. Burke then took them to Natick (more than ten miles from Boston), and used them in his business. Adams then sued him.&lt;ref&gt;1 Fed. Cas. at 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial court opinion==

The circuit court for the district of Massachusetts dismissed the case. It said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a patented product passes lawfully into the hands of a purchaser without condition or restriction, it is no longer within the monopoly or under the protection of the patent act, but outside of it. ...It is clear that by such a sale the purchaser acquires an absolute title to the manufactured product which is the subject of a patent, and may deal with It in the same manner as if dealing with any other kind of property. He may use it, repair it, Improve upon it, or sell it. Subsequent purchasers acquire the same rights as the seller had, and may do with the article, or its materials, whatever the first purchaser could have lawfully done if he had not parted with the title.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. Burks'', 1 Fed. Cas. 100 (Case No. 50) (C.C.D. Mass. 1871).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supreme Court opinion==

Adams appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed. The Court began by observing that this was a case of first impression in the Supreme Court although the governing principle had been involved in other patent cases.&lt;ref&gt;"The question presented by the plea in this case is a very interesting one in patent law, and the precise point in it has never been decided by this Court, though cases involving some of the considerations which apply to it have been decided and others of analogous character are frequently recurring." ''Adams'', 84 U.S. at 455.&lt;/ref&gt; That principle was this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he sale by a person who has the full right to make, sell, and use .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. a machine carries with it the right to the use of that machine to the full extent to which it can be used in point of time. &amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [I]n the essential nature of things, when the patentee, or the person having his rights, sells a machine or instrument whose sole value is in its use, he receives the consideration for its use and he parts with the right to restrict that use. The article, in the language of the Court, passes without the limit of the monopoly. [citation omitted] That is to say the patentee or his assignee having in the act of sale received all the royalty or consideration which he claims for the use of his invention in that particular machine or instrument, it is open to the use of the purchaser without further restriction on account of the monopoly of the patentees.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams'', 84 U.S. at 455-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, the Court ruled that "we hold that in the class of machines or implements we have described, when they are once lawfully made and sold, there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees."&lt;ref&gt;''Adams'', 84 U.S. at 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Supreme Court cases following the doctrine of the ''Adams'' case include:
* ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]'', 243 U.S. 502 (1917).
* ''Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co.'', 243 U.S. 490 (1917).
* ''[[Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States]]'', 309 U.S. 436 (1940).
* ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241 (1942).
* ''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'', 365 U. S. 336 (1961).
* ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 553 U.S. 617 (2008).

But see:
* ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]'', 272 U.S. 476 (1926).&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the Court ruled that the ''Adams'' patent exhaustion doctrine applied to sales, but not to agency agreements or licenses to manufacture.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 175 (1938).&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the Court ruled that the ''Adams'' patent exhaustion doctrine did not apply to a sale made by a licensee to manufacture a patented product only for use or sale in a defined field, where the licensee's customer had notice of the license limitation or restriction.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6051">The '''Animal Procedures Committee''' advised the British [[Home Secretary]] on matters related to [[animal testing]] in the UK. The function of the committee was made a statutory requirement by the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]] (the ASPA), which mandated that it should have at least 12 members, excluding the chair.&lt;ref name="archive.official-documents.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/hoc/321/321-xa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419225300/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/hoc/321/321-xa.htm |archivedate=2009-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The APC no longer exists as the ASPA has been revised in accordance with EU legislation. It was disbanded on 31 December 2012 and was replaced by the [[Animals in Science Committee]] in 2013.

==Composition of members==
The Act stipulated that at least two-thirds of the members had full registration as [[Physician|medical practitioners]] or [[Veterinarian|veterinary surgeons]], or that they be qualified in a relevant [[Biology|biological]] subject; that one member be a [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or advocate; that at least half the membership should not have held an animal-testing licence during the last six years; and that the interests of [[animal welfare]] should be adequately represented.&lt;ref name="archive.official-documents.co.uk" /&gt;

There was normally an academic [[philosopher]] on the committee, although this was not required by the Act. 

Members were appointed for terms of up to four years and may be re-appointed once. Apart from the Chair, members received only expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apc.gov.uk/aboutapc/composition.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work of the committee==

The committee advised the Home Secretary on matters concerned with the Act and his functions under it; and also to examine other related subjects considered worthy of further study.

There were four sub-committees: The Applications Sub-committee considered licence applications referred to the Committee for advice; the Education and Training Sub-committee advised on the requirements for training and education of those who held responsibilities under the Act or who carried out duties under the controls of the Act; the Housing and Husbandry Sub-committee considered housing and husbandry issues on a case by case basis as requested by the Committee; the Primate Sub-committee advised on issues relating to the acquisition, housing, care and use of non-human primates in regulated procedures.

In addition, a number of working groups were established. They were created for a particular task and then disbanded. As of March 2010 there were two working groups: The Revision of Directive 86/609 working group is reviewing the directive; the Suffering and Severity working group is reviewing aspects of the system of severity limits and bands.

==Membership==
As of March 2010, the committee members (and their professional affiliations) were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.gov.uk/members/interest.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208183004/http://www.apc.gov.uk/members/interest.htm |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur "Dick" Callum''' was a New Zealand [[rugby football]]er who was part of the professional [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain]].

==Early years==
Callum was an insurance agent.&lt;ref name=book&gt;John Haynes ''From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers'', Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996. {{ISBN|0-473-03864-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby Football==
Callum played [[rugby union]] for the Melrose Club and represented [[Wellington Rugby Union|Wellington]] in 1905 and 1907.

==Rugby League==
Callum was selected for the [[New Zealand Kiwis|professional All Blacks]] in their [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain|1907–08 tour of Great Britain and Australia]].&lt;ref name=book /&gt; Like all members of the tour, Gilchrist subsequently received a life ban from the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]]. Callum barely played on the tour and instead assisted [[Albert Baskerville]] in an administrative capacity. Despite this he played in two test matches near the end of the tour, when injuries had taken their toll.

==Early life==
Ayesha Mary Barbara Vardag was born in London, daughter of an English mother and Pakistani father Asaf Vardag, who is a direct descendent of the Lodhi royal family that ruled India in the 16th century. Vardag’s grandfather was active in the [[Indian National Congress]] and as its candidate was twice elected mayor of [[Karachi]] in undivided India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/latest-peerages-announced|title=Latest peerages announced|publisher=Gov.UK |date =November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vardag grew up in Oxfordshire and read [[English law|Law]] at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], with a [[Duke of Edinburgh]] award for membership of the [[Inner Temple]], and took a [[Master's degree|Masters]] as a Cambridge Wiener Anspach scholar in [[European Law]] at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], where she worked extensively on expert research projects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and at the UN (IAEA) Legal Division in Vienna.&lt;ref name=thevintagemagazine&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thevintagemagazine.com/business-finance/ayesha-vardag-divorce-diva-2/ |title=Ayesha Vardag – Divorce diva |work=The Vintage Magazine|location=London

==Legal career==
Vardag qualified as a solicitor in 1996 and was initially trained as a finance solicitor at [[Linklaters]], where she became the leading specialist in nuclear energy law aged 26.[[File:Ayesha Vardag in Bell Yard - geograph.org.uk - 1651800.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.73|Ayesha Vardag|Ayesha Vardag's Offices in Bell Yard, December 2009]] Prior to becoming a family lawyer, she worked for the New York law firm [[Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges]].&lt;ref name=eveningstandart&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/meet-londons-alist-female-divorce-lawyers-from-helen-ward-to-davina-katz-a3310346.html |title=The ex factor: meet London's A-list female divorce lawyers |work=ESMagazine|date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vardag’s training in matrimonial law was as a mini-pupil to [[Nicholas Mostyn]] and as one of two assistants to [[Raymond Tooth]], senior partner at Sears Tooth and co-founder of the International Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, an invitation-only organisation which now consists of over 500 of the world's leading family lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.tfreview.com/news/family/divorce/leading-family-lawyer-loses-high-profile-client|title=Leading family lawyer loses high-profile client |publisher=Solicitors Journal |date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vardag founded Ayesha Vardag solicitors in 2005, which incorporated as Vardags in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://mowbraybydesign.com/interview-with-ayesha-vardag-divorce-lawyer|title=Interview with Ayesha Vardag, Divorce Lawyer |publisher=NowBrayByDesign |date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first case of note was that of ''Radmacher v Granatino'', which strengthened the law on prenuptial agreements in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.lawfuel.com/blog/uks-13-women-litigators-not-want-cross-court

She is also known as the "Diva of Divorce" |publisher=Law Fuel |date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vardag founded Ayesha Vardag LLP in 2005, which incorporated as Vardags Ltd in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://mowbraybydesign.com/interview-with-ayesha-vardag-divorce-lawyer|title=Interview with Ayesha Vardag, Divorce Lawyer |publisher=NowBrayByDesign |date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In September 2011 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that [[Raymond Tooth]], accused Vardag of trying to "pinch" celebrity clients from him which resulted in an agreed settlement &lt;ref name=dailymail.co.uk&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2568177/Jaws-bites-diva-two-Britains-high-profile-divorce-lawyers-battle-celebrity-clients.html 'Jaws' bites the 'Diva' as two of Britain's most high-profile divorce lawyers battle over celebrity clients – ''MailOnline']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable cases===
In 2010 Vardag made history in a landmark Supreme Court case that changed the law on [[prenuptial agreement]]s. Acting for German heiress Katrin Radmacher, she won a ruling that the prenup she drew up to protect her £100 million fortune from her French-born husband was legally binding.&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;{{cite news| url=

|date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Vardag helped former Malaysian beauty queen Pauline Chai secure a settlement of £64 million, one of the largest in history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/06/homemaker-ex-wife-laura-ashley-boss-wins-third-200m-income-payout/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Vardag is married to Stephen Bence, a [[financial consultant]] and a former [[astrophysicist]] who is director of strategy at Vardags Ltd. The couple have two sons and a daughter, and the family lives in [[North London]].&lt;ref name=MailOnline&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-3547704/Divorce-lawyer-Ayesha-Vardag-charming-absent-father-shaped-life.html |title=Top divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag |work=Daily Mail |date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">'''Blank endorsement''' of a financial instrument, such as a [[cheque]], is only a [[signature]], not indicating the [[payee]]. The effect of this is that it is payable only to the [[bearer instrument|bearer]] – legally, it transforms an [[order instrument]] ("pay to the ''order of'' (the payee)") into a [[bearer instrument]] ("pay to the bearer"). It is one of the types of endorsement of a [[negotiable instrument]].

It is "an endorsement consisting of nothing but a signature and allowing any party in possession of the endorsed item to execute a claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/5421/blank_endorsement.html Investor Words web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

A blank endorsement is a commonly known and accepted term in the legal and business worlds.&lt;ref name="Answers.com"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/blank-endorsement Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/blank+endorsement The Free Dictionary web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also called an ''endorsement in blank''&lt;ref name="Answers.com"/&gt; or ''blank endorsement''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Brown and Paul A. Sukys, ''Business law with U.C.C. Applications'' pp. 491, 929 (McGraw-Hill, 11th ed. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prevalent spelling in American English is ''en''dorsement; the minority convention, ''in''dorsement, is found in older American documents, although the revised [[Uniform Commercial Code]] Article on negotiable instruments retains the older spelling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">A '''budget process''' refers to the process by which governments create and approve a [[budget]], which is as follows:

* The Financial Service Department prepares worksheets to assist the department head in preparation of department budget estimates
* The Administrator calls a meeting of managers and they present and discuss plans for the following year’s projected level of activity.
* The managers can work with the Financial Services, or work alone to prepare an estimate for the departments coming year.
* The completed budgets are presented by the managers to their Executive Officers for review and approval. 
* Justification of the budget request may be required in writing.  In most cases, the manager talks with their administrative officers about budget requirements.  Adjustments to the budget submission may be required as a result of this phase in the process.

Budgeting is the setting of expenditure levels for each of an organization’s functions. It is the estimation and allocation of available capital used to achieve the designated targets of a firm.

== Terminology ==
* '''Revenue Estimation''' performed in the executive branch by the finance director, clerk's office, budget director, manager, or a team.
* '''Budget Call''' issued to outline the presentation form, recommend certain goals.
* '''Budget Formulation''' reflecting on the past, set goals for the future and reconcile the difference.
* '''Budget Hearings''' can include departments, sections, the executive, and the public to discuss changes in the budget.
* '''Budget Adoption''' final approval by the legislative body.
* '''Budget Execution''' amending the budget as the fiscal year progresses.

== Constitutional economics ==

[[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]] which in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is completely controlled by the executive.  It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.  The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit.  The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Certification label ulc roxul 4lbs per ft3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Canada|Canadian]] certification label on a bag of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]]]]
[[File:Counterfeit electrical cords.jpg|thumb|right|Counterfeit electrical cords with false UL certification marks]]

A '''certification mark''' (or '''conformity mark''') on a commercial product indicates the existence of an accepted product [[Standardization|standard]] or [[regulation]] and a claim that the manufacturer has verified compliance with those standards or regulations. The specific [[specification]], [[test method]]s, and frequency of testing are published by the standards organization. [[Certification listing]] does not necessarily guarantee fitness for use.

== Certification marks distinguished from other marks ==
Certification marks differ from [[collective trade marks]]. Collective trade marks may be used by particular members of the organization that owns them, while certification marks are the only evidence of the existence of follow-up agreements between manufacturers and nationally accredited testing and certification organizations. In some occasions, the certification organization will charge for the use of their labels and will require that the manufacturer reports the exact production quantities.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In this case, the certification organization can be seen to earn a commission from sales of products under their follow-up regimes. In return, the use of the certification marks ''enables'' the product sales in the first place.

Certification is often mistakenly referred to as an ''approval'', which is not true. Organizations such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]], [[ TUV Rheinland]], [[NTA Inc]], and [[CSA International]] will test the products according to standard procedures, and "list" them as compliant to that standard. They do not ''approve'' anything except the use of the mark to show that a product has been certified for compliance with such specific standard. Thus, for instance, a product certification mark for a [[fire door]] or for a spray [[fireproofing]] product, does not signify its universal acceptance for use within a [[building]]. Approvals are up to the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector or fire prevention officer. Conversely, [[FM Global]] does use the term "Approvals" for its certification listings, which are intended for use of the products within [[building]]s that are insured by FM Global. The German accreditor Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dibt.de/|title=DIBt - Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; issues "Approvals" for [[system]]s. All of these listed products must conform to [[listing and approval use and compliance]].

For various reasons, usually relating to technical issues, certification marks are difficult to register, especially in relation to services. One practical [[workaround]] for trademark owners is to register the mark as an ordinary trademark in relation to quality control and similar services.

Certification marks can be owned by independent companies absolutely unrelated in ownership to the companies, offering goods or rendering services under the particular certification mark.

== Regulations ==
[[Trademark law]]s in countries, such as the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/sct/en/comments/pdf/sct21/cert_us.pdf|title=Submission of the United States of America Certification and Collective Marks Formalities|last=|first=|date=February 2009|website=World Intellectual Property Organisation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/applying-for-exemptions/certification-trade-marks|title=Certification trade marks|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others that provide for the filing of applications to register certificate marks also usually require the submission of regulations, which define a number of issues,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} including:

* People authorized to use the certification mark
* Characteristics that the certification mark certifies
* How the certification or standards tests these characteristics and supervises use of the mark
* What the dispute resolution procedures are

The main purpose of the regulations is to protect consumers against misleading practices.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== International treaties and certification marks ==
Many jurisdictions have been required to amend their trade mark [[legislation]] to accommodate protection of certification marks under the [[TRIPs]] treaty.

Some jurisdictions recognise certification marks from other jurisdictions. This means good manufactured in one country may need not go through certification in another. One example is the [[European Union]] recognition of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] marks based on an [[International treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1999/2.html “Agreement on Mutual Recognition in relation to Conformity Assessment, Certificates and Markings between Australia and the European Community ATS 2 of 1999“]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cases ==
Cases involving certification marks include:
* ''[[Re Legal Aid Board's Trade Mark Application]]'' (unreported 3 October 2000, UK CA)
*the [[Sea Island Cotton case]] [1989]RPC 87

Charter for Compassion International, the Charter's supporting organization, has enrolled 311 communities in 45 countries in its Compassionate Communities campaign and has partnered with more than 1,300 organizations to spread the Charter's message of compassion in 10 sectors: the arts, business, education, environment, healthcare, peace, religion/spirituality/interfaith, science &amp; research, social sciences and restorative justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/2015-annual-report|title=2015 Annual Report|last=Price|first=Reed|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no cost to affirm the Charter.

== History ==
On February 28, 2008, acclaimed scholar and bestselling author [[Karen Armstrong]] won the [[TED (conference)|TED]] Prize. In her acceptance speech she called for help in creating, launching and propagating a Charter for Compassion, based on the fundamental principle of the [[Golden Rule]].&lt;ref name="WebsiteHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/karen_armstrong_makes_her_ted_prize_wish_the_charter_for_compassion|title=My Wish: The Charter for Compassion|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open writing process to create the Charter began in November 2008 with the launch of the Charter for Compassion [http://www.charterforcompassion.org website.]  People of all faiths, nationalities and backgrounds submitted ideas on what the Charter should include. Individuals from more than 100 countries added their voices to this process and their submissions were read and commented upon by more than 150,000 visitors to the site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/charter/historic-moments-for-the-charter|title=Historic Moments for the Charter|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Council of Conscience''', a multi-faith, multi-national group of religious thinkers and leaders, then met in Vevey, Switzerland, to craft the final Charter for Compassion. The Councilors sorted and reviewed the thousands of written submissions, considered the meaning of compassion, determined key ideas to include in the Charter and created a plan for how the Charter will live in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.ted.com/council_of_conscience_m/|title=Writing the Charter for Compassion: The Council of Conscience meets in Geneva|date=2009-03-13|newspaper=TED Blog|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter for Compassion was unveiled by Karen Armstrong and the Council of Conscience on November 12, 2009, at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, DC. That day, more than 75 launch events took place around the globe and more than 60 Charter for Compassion plaques designed by [[Yves Béhar|Yves Behar]] were hung at significant religious and secular sites around the world. At its launch, the Charter was endorsed by the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Desmond Tutu|Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-charter-for-compassion-launches-to-promote-the-golden-rule-69851072.html|title=International Charter for Compassion Launches to Promote The Golden Rule|last=Conferences|first=TED|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charter for Compassion -- The Organization ==
Just a few months after Armstrong was awarded the TED Prize, a partnership of individuals and organizations around the world began coalescing to bring the Charter for Compassion to life. On May 4, 2009, the '''Compassionate Action Network''' (CAN) was launched in [[Seattle]]. CAN's intention, expressed in its founding document, was to create "an association of like-minded programs, projects and organizations that collectively represent the power of thousands of relationships."

CAN became the home for the Charter for Compassion from the summer of 2012 through December 2013 and provided a wealth of startup assistance to the Charter organization, including staff, fundraising, resource development, and strategic planning.

With the support of CAN, the [[Fetzer Institute]] and many other groups and individuals committed to the Charter's ideals, the Charter for Compassion grew steadily in scale and scope. In January, 2014, almost six years after the TED Prize award, a group of leaders in the movement organized as the '''Global Compassion Council''' and formed the Charter for Compassion (CFC) as a non-profit(c)(3) organization. The Global Compassion Council became CCI's advisory panel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== CFC Vision, Mission and Logo ===
Charter for Compassion's vision is to foster a world where everyone is committed to living by the principle of compassion.

Its mission is to support the emergence of a global movement that brings the Charter for Compassion to life. It does this by being a network of networks—connecting organizers and leaders from around the world; providing educational resources, organizing tools and avenues for communication; sharing lessons, stories and inspiration; and providing an umbrella for Charter for Compassion conferences, events, collaborations, conversations and initiatives to create compassionate communities and institutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/about-overview|title=About|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFC logo incorporates the ancient symbol for [[infinity]]. The symbol has long been used to represent the concept of endless love. CFC's use of the symbol in the context of the Charter for Compassion represents the limitless potential of compassion to transform human relationships, institutions and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-Organizing Structure ===
Traditional organizational structures are hierarchical: a leader, sometimes in consultation with a board of directors, determines a goal for an enterprise and directs other people to carry out the steps necessary to reach that goal. CFC supports self-organization, believing that sustainable change emerges organically from communities. As such, it facilitates connections between resources, individuals and organizations with the intent of supporting (not controlling) outcomes of increasing compassion. Because it has more than 2,000 partners, and those partners support networks as well, CFC describes itself as a "network of networks." CFC sees networks as the first, critical step in systemic reorganization of the type necessary to make compassion an organizing, luminous force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/faq#how-is-the-charter-a-network|title=Frequently Asked Questions|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advisory body for CFC is the Global Compassion Council, which consists of leaders in the global compassion movement from the realms of government, business, education, philanthropy, religion and spirituality, healthcare, the environment, peace and social justice. The CFC governing Board of Trustees is drawn from members of the Council. Board members (2016) are: Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, president; Dr. James Doty, M.D., vice-president; Toni Murden McClure, treasurer; and the following members: Allan Boesak, Amin Hashwani,  Imam Mohamed Magid and Amy Novogratz. Karen Armstrong is an ex-officio member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/global-compassion-council|title=Global Compassion Council|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFC activities largely are delegated to [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/about1/charter-for-compassion-team] made up primarily of volunteers. Located all over the world, the teams function virtually and, where there are several people in one geographic area, in person. There is a weekly teleconference staff meeting where participants review their work and contribute to and make decisions on current CFC initiatives. Also, many of the volunteers are facilitators on CFC's regularly scheduled sector- and theme-based conference calls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/the-charter-for-compassion-international-teams|title=The Charter for Compassion Team|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|date=|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-gb|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Teams help support the daily operational work of the Charter, which includes overseeing and contributing to the Charter's website. Additionally, they support and help grow CCI's partner network and its campaigns to encourage compassionate cities and communities. Team volunteers also work on special Charter initiatives such as the '''[https://www.charterforcompassion.org/out-of-the-box Charter Community Tool Box],''' the '''[https://www.charterforcompassion.org/charter-for-compassion-education-institute Charter Education Institute]''' and informational materials on the Charter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Major Initiatives ==

=== Compassionate Communities ===
At the heart of the Charter for Compassion's work is its '''[https://www.charterforcompassion.org/communities Campaign for Compassionate Communities]'''. In the beginning, this effort was focused on building a network of cities, but it soon became evident that communities both larger and smaller than cities wanted to join the movement to embrace compassion as a core value. The Charter's growing network of Compassionate Communities encompasses nearly 50 countries and includes cities, towns, townships, shires, hamlets, villages, neighborhoods, islands, states, provinces, and counties. Of these, more than 76 cities globally have affirmed the Charter for Compassion through city, community councils or other government entities. Affirming the Charter means that a community has identified issues on which they are working, and have committed to a multi-year action plan. A list of participating communities can be found [http://charterforcompassion.org/communities/participating-communities here].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/compassionate-cities-and-communities-report-may-3-2016|title=Compassionate Cities and Communities Report May 3, 2016|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFC's Compassionate Communities program is not a certificate program that offers a seal of approval, nor does it subscribe to a single definition of a compassionate community. Instead, the Charter invites communities of all sizes to bring compassion to life in practical, specific ways through compassion-driven actions—in neighborhoods, businesses, schools and colleges, healthcare, the arts, local government, peace groups, environmental advocacy groups and faith congregations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/communities|title=Communities|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any individual, group or organization that recognizes the need for greater compassion in a community is encouraged to begin the process for creating a Compassionate Community. While the Charter does not prescribe any one path, it does recommend that the process be designed and carried out by a diverse and inclusive coalition of people so that all voices within the community are heard, and the significant issues are addressed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Charter for Compassion has developed a four-part model or framework, called the [http://www.charterforcompassion.org/charter-tool-box-framework Charter Community Tool Box], to help communities build a compassionate society. The Tool Box is intended to provide communities with a starting point and a process to follow, though it is adaptable to the unique circumstances of any community that seeks to become a Compassionate Community. There are four broad phases: Discover and Assess; Focus and Commit; Build and Launch; Evaluate and Sustain. For each of the phases the Tool Box inclludes more specific steps as well as stories and examples. Depending on the community, its particular issues and available resources, this process may take one or more years.

Within the Charter Tool Box are relevant references to the '''[http://ctb.ku.edu/en University of Kansas’ Community Tool Box],''' with which the Charter collaborated on this project. The Charter's model for building Compassionate Communities resides on the University of Kansas’ Community Tool Box website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/communities/charter-tool-box-framework|title=Charter Tool Box: A Framework for Getting Started|last=Turkovich|first=Marilyn|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities and communities that sign on to become Compassionate Cities and Communities often begin their work by identifying issues that are troubling the community and need to be addressed through compassionate action. For example, a community may discover a significant issue related to social justice for women, immigrants or some other marginalized group. Other communities may want to address issues of drug use, gang violence, the lack of equitable healthcare, or the effects of racism. Others may decide to work to empower youth or to educate their communities about the need for compassion in addressing environmental issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Louisville, KY—Model City ====
Louisville, KY, is a shining example of a Compassionate Community, having been named the ICC’s Model City of the year for four consecutive years (2012–2015).

Louisville was the seventh city to sign on to the Compassion Charter, and Mayor [[Greg Fischer]] created '''[http://compassionatelouisville.org/ Compassionate Louisville]''' to help develop and implement a city-wide campaign to nurture and champion the growth of compassion. One of its signature events is the annual '''Mayor's Give a Day Week''', in which the entire city makes time for volunteering, service and compassion. In 2015, the city broke its own world record, with more than 166,000 volunteers and acts of compassion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://louisvilleky.gov/news/louisville-named-2015-model-city-compassion|title=Louisville Named 2015 Model City for Compassion|website=LouisvilleKy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassionate Louisville’s education team launched the '''Compassion Bench''' project, which is designed to provide safe spots in the community where children are encouraged to express compassion. The first was installed at the [https://us.mohid.co/ky/louisville/lic Louisville Islamic Center] on the heels of an act of vandalism there that ultimately served only to unify the community. Mayor Fischer noted that the vandalism at the mosque illustrates the heart of compassion in Louisville. Within hours of the terrible act, dozens of community and religious leaders showed up at an 8 a.m. press conference to denounce the hate and make plans for a community cleanup the next day. That cleanup drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 people—men, women and children; people of all color, nationality, religion and political leanings. “If the vandals’ goal was to highlight division, they failed miserably,” said Mayor Fischer. “This is a city that rejects hate, and the response to the incident at the mosque was a beautiful illustration of the work we’ve done to become a community of even greater compassion.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other examples of the city’s commitment to compassion in 2015 include:
* The community’s '''[https://givelocallouisville.org/ Give Local Louisville]''' effort brought in almost $3 million for local charities in one day.
* Members of Compassionate Louisville’s Coordinating Circle have mentored more than 40 other communities interested in joining the Compassionate Cities movement, including surrounding counties like Henderson, Ky., as well as large cities like Detroit.
* In April, Mayor Fischer announced that Louisville and [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Jefferson County Public Schools]] will serve as the site of an independently funded, $11 million health and wellness project focused on teaching caring for oneself and others. 
* Louisville supported and competed in the '''[http://compassiongames.org/ “Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest!”]''' in September, joining cities across the nation in vying to post the greatest number of good deeds in an 11-day stretch in September.
* Nearly 100 local organizations and businesses have made a commitment to compassion this year, including the international [[YUM! Brands]] and [[Brown-Forman]].
* Metro Louisville has lined up almost 100 volunteer mentors to work one-on-one with at-risk youth in a program called “Right Turn.” And [[Government of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville Metro Governmen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t itself launched Metro Mentors, which allows and encourages city employees to spend two hours of paid time each week working with at-risk youth.
* In March, area nonprofits worked with Liberians in our community to fill a huge {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} ocean-going container with emergency meals, water purification and medical supplies and equipment for [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] victims and families and for those suffering the aftermath of the civil war in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Charter for Compassion Partners ===
Charter for Compassion believes it is possible—and indeed, urgently necessary—to tap into humanity's common desire for a more compassionate and peaceful world by building a vast interconnected network of compassion among the peoples of the [[Earth]]. It encourages groups, organizations, and institutions to join the Charter for Compassion’s network of networks by signing on as a partner, at no cost, in any one of its current sectors: [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/arts Arts], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/business Business],  [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/education Education], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/environment Environment], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/healthcare Healthcare], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/religion-spirituality-interfaith Peace and Non-violence, Religion/Spirituality/Interfaith], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/restorative-justice Restorative Justice], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/science-and-research Science and Research], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/social-justice Social Justice], [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/social-services-sector Social Service], and [https://www.charterforcompassion.org/women-and-girls-sector Women and Girls].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charterforcompassion.org/partners/overview-sectors|title=Partner Sectors Overview|last=Saez|first=Isabel|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These partners represent a vast range of activities. In the science and research field, for example, '''[http://ccare.stanford.edu/ Stanford University’s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education]''' is conducting research into mapping compassion in the brain and developing compassion training programs for adults. In the [[Netherlands]], an impassioned group of medical students has written a charter focused on medical ethics and compassion in healthcare. They are working to make compassion training a required part of the medical school curriculum.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-armstrong/charter-for-compassion-progress_b_1382844.html|title=The Surprising Progress Of The Charter For Compassion|last=Author|first=Karen Armstrong Former Roman Catholic nun;|last2=Gate'|first2='Through the Narrow|date=2012-03-27|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, partners around the globe have translated the Charter for children and many schools are using compassionate curricula developed for all age levels. [[Pakistan]], one of the most active Charter partners, introduces a compassionate character into the Pakistani Sesame Street, ''Sim Sim Harama''. Pakistan is working closely with [[Jordan]], on the other side of the Gulf, in education efforts. In Jordan one compassionate school is housed in a tent and follows nomads through the Jordanian desert.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another project trains prison officers to treat inmates with more respect and care. When it was put into practice in a jail in Washington State, the goal was to decrease violence by 2.5 percent; in fact the project was so successful that violence was decreased by 100 percent. Now the creators are evaluating just what the federal government could save by implementing this program across the United States.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== The Charter for Compassion Education Institute ===
'''The Charter for Compassion Education Institute''' was formed in 2016 to educate and prepare people of the world to live a compassionate life, to understand the power of compassion to transform the inequities and injustices of human civilization, and to spread compassion and compassionate action throughout the world.

The Education Institute successfully launched its first online course in September 2016 with students from six countries and has several exciting courses lined up for Spring 2017. These first courses deal with how to develop compassion for others, how to learn self-compassion, and how to become a part of the growing compassion movement and the Charter for Compassion. Eventually, CFC will offer courses that address the work of compassion in many contexts—in communities, healthcare, business, education, religion and interfaith, the arts, restorative justice, environment, and science. Instructors from several countries are in the process of developing online courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charterforcompassion.org/charter-for-compassion-education-institute|title=The Charter for Compassion Education Institute|last=Price|first=Reed|newspaper=Charter for Compassion|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Copyright Licensing International''' ('''CCLI''') is a privately owned company that was founded in the US in 1988 by Howard Rachinski.  CCLI was launched after being developed by Rachinski for 3½ years while he was a music minister at a large church in Portland, Oregon.  This prototype, called Starpraise Ministries, began in May 1985. CCLI offers [[copyright]] licensing of songs and other resource materials for use in Christian worship.

Since its foundation, CCLI has expanded around the world to Australia, Botswana, Canada, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, South Korea and as of 2016 can now serve most countries.

The mechanism of copyright solution invented by CCLI has been cited by the governments of United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/news/publications/copyrightgreenpaper.pdf|title = COPYRIGHT POLICY, CREATIVITY, AND INNOVATION IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY|date = |access-date = January 1, 2016 |website = |publisher = THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE INTERNET POLICY TASK FORCE|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and official copyright organization in United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.britishcopyright.org/information/useful-links/|title = the British Copyright Council useful links|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when introducing the relevant policy.

==Copyright issues in worship==
The performance of works in copyright (for example, playing music) as part of an act of worship is specifically exempted from copyright laws in several countries. 

US Copyright Law [17 USC §110], for example, explicitly states that performances of "religious nature" during a service "at a place of worship or other religious assembly" are "not infringements of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|last=Office|first=U.S. Copyright|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are no exemptions for creating copies (e.g. printed, projection slides, recordings), translating, or making new arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Board of Canada : Copyright Act subsection 32.2(3) |url=http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/info/act-e.html#32.2 |access-date=April 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331222050/http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/info/act-e.html#32.2 |archivedate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 110]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.ccli.com/about-copyright/copyright-law/|title=Copyright Law – CCLI|author=|date=|website=CCLI.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==When a CCLI license is not needed==
No license is needed if all music is in the [[public domain]] or covered by something like the [[Creative Commons]] licenses. As an example, most sufficiently old hymns are in the public domain. CCLI maintains a list of songs that are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://songselect.ccli.com/|title=SongSelect by CCLI|author=|date=|website=CCLI.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If all of the songs that an organization uses are in that list, then the organization does not need to pay the CCLI license fee. As of March 2015, CCLI's list contained nearly 24,000 public domain songs.

{{Politics of Chile}}
'''The Constitutional Court of Chile''' (''Tribunal Constitucional de Chile'' in Spanish) is [[Chile]]'s [[constitutional court|constitutional tribunal]]. It is not part of the judicial branch and is functionally independent of the [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]] and the [[President of Chile|President]].

== History ==
The Constitutional Court was created in 1970, under the [[Constitution of 1925]]. In 1973, after the coup d'état, it was dissolved, but the [[Constitution of Chile|1980 Constitution]] reinstated it.

Until 2005, some members were designated by the National Security Council (a civic-military committee).

== Attributions ==
According to the Chilean constitution, its principal attribution is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e., whether they conflict with constitutionally established rights and freedoms. This function not only applies to legislative acts, but also to judicial decrees (''autoacordados''), presidential decrees (''Decretos con Fuerza de Ley''), or even ordinary decrees when the [[Comptroller General of Chile|Comptroller-General]] deems it to be unconstitutional.

Also, the Court has attributions on the convocation to referendums, outlawing groups or parties which seriously violate the institutional order, deposing members of Congress who seriously infringe the constitution, resolving conflicts between lower courts and administrative agencies, and many others.

== Ministers ==
The Constitutional Court is composed of ten members, called Ministers:

* 3 appointed by the [[President of Chile|President of the Republic]]
* 3 elected by the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]]
* 2 elected by the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by a two-thirds majority
* 2 proposed by the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by a two-thirds majority and confirmed by the Senate by the same margin

Members have nine-year terms, renewed by thirds every three years, and can not be re-elected.

The Constitutional Court can work as a United Court (''Pleno'') or divided in two Chambers (''Salas'').

In the event a quorum is below the legally required, deputy ministers (''ministros suplentes''), or substitute attorneys (''abogados integrantes'') are designated.

The court's president has the power to break a tie.

The '''Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees''', also known as the '''1951 Refugee Convention''', is a [[United Nations]] [[multilateral treaty]] that defines who is a [[refugee]], and sets out the rights of individuals who are granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and the responsibilities of nations that grant asylum. The Convention also sets out which people do not qualify as refugees, such as [[war crime|war criminals]]. The Convention also provides for some visa-free travel for holders of [[travel document]]s issued under the convention. Although the Refugee Convention was agreed in [[Geneva]], it is considered incorrect to refer to it as "the Geneva Convention" because that term is more widely understood as referring to any of [[Geneva Conventions|four treaties regulating armed conflict]].

The Refugee Convention builds on Article 14 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries. A refugee may enjoy rights and benefits in a state in addition to those provided for in the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;'''Convention relating to the Status of Refugees''', Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Convention was approved at a special [[United Nations]] conference on 28 July 1951. [[Denmark]] was the first state to ratify the treaty on 4 December 1952, which entered into force on 22 April 1954. It was initially limited to protecting European refugees from before 1 January 1951 (after [[World War II]]), though states could make a declaration that the provisions would apply to refugees from other places.

The 1967 [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|Protocol]] removed the time limits and applied to refugees "without any geographic limitation", but declarations previously made by parties to the Convention on geographic scope were grandfathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/UNTS/Volume%20606/v606.pdf|title=Treaty Series - Treaties and international agreements registered or filed and recorded with the Secretariat of the United Nations|volume=606|number=8791|date=1970|accessdate=2013-10-19|publisher=[[United Nations]]|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at 1 July 2013, there were 145 parties to the Convention, and 146 to the Protocol.&lt;ref name=convrat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=UNTSONLINE&amp;mtdsg_no=V~2&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en#Participants |title=Chapter V – Refugees and Stateless Persons |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |publisher=[[United Nations Treaty Series]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114081432/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=UNTSONLINE&amp;mtdsg_no=V~2&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=protrat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=V-5&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en#Participants |title=Chapter V – Refugees and Stateless Persons |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |publisher=[[United Nations Treaty Series]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401214403/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=V-5&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b73b0d63.pdf UNHCR: ''States Parties to the Convention and Protocol''], retrieved 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the [[President of Nauru|President]] of [[Nauru]], [[Marcus Stephen]], signed both the Convention and the Protocol on 17 June 2011&lt;ref name="RNZI_61276"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=61276 |title=Nauru signs UN refugee convention |date=17 June 2011 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/naurus-un-move-on-refugee-convention-adds-to-pressure-on-labor/story-fn59niix-1226077250521 "Nauru's UN move on refugee convention adds to pressure on Labor"], ''The Australian'', 17 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and acceded on 28 June 2011.  [[Madagascar]] and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] are parties only to the Convention, while [[Cape Verde]], the [[United States of America]] and [[Venezuela]] are parties only to the Protocol. Since the US ratified the Protocol in 1968, it undertook a majority of the obligations spelled out in the original 1951 document (Articles 2-34), and Article 1 as amended in the Protocol, as [[Supremacy Clause|"supreme Law of the Land"]].&lt;ref&gt;Joan Fitzpatrick, [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&amp;context=bjil "The International Dimension of U.S. Refugee Law"], ''15 Berkeley J. Int'l. Law 1'', Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights promulgated by the Convention generally still stand today. Some have argued that the complex nature of 21st century refugee relationships calls for a new treaty that recognizes the evolving nature of the nation-state, population displacement, [[environmental migrants]], and modern warfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2768162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2617336&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ideas like the principle of [[non-refoulement]] (Article 33) are still applied today, with the 1951 Convention being the hallmark of such rights.

==Definition of refugee==
Article 1 of the Convention, as amended by the 1967 Protocol, defines a refugee as this:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commission for Refugees. (2012). [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/refugees.htm Text of Convention]. Retrieved 5 May 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607013438/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/refugees.htm |date=7 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What is a Refugee?[https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/what-is-a-refugee/ What is a Refugee?]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.}}

Several groups have built upon the 1951 Convention to create a more objective definition. While their terms differ from those of the 1951 Convention, the Convention has significantly shaped the new, more objective definitions. They include the 1969 [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]] by the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (since 2002 [[African Union]]) and the 1984 [[Cartagena Declaration]], while nonbinding, also sets out regional standards for refugees in Central America, Mexico and Panama.

==Rights and responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention==
In the general principle of international law, treaties in force are binding upon the parties to it and must be performed in good faith. Countries that have ratified the Refugee Convention are obliged to protect refugees that are on their territory, in accordance with its terms.&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx UNHCR: ''Refugee protection: A Guide to International Refugee Law''], 2001, {{ISBN|92-9142-101-4}}, retrieved 19 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of provisions that States parties to the Refugee Convention must adhere to.

=== Refugees shall ===
* abide by the national laws of the contracting states (Article 2)

=== The contracting states shall ===

* exempt refugees from reciprocity (Article 7): That means that the granting of a right to a refugee should not be subject to the granting of similar treatment by the refugee's country of nationality, because refugees do not enjoy the protection of their home state.&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"/&gt;
* be able to take provisional measures against a refugee if needed in the interest of essential national security (Article 9)
* respect a refugee's personal status and the rights that come with it, particularly rights related to marriage (Article 12)
* provide free access to courts for refugees (Article 16)
* provide administrative assistance for refugees (Article 25)
* provide identity papers for refugees (Article 27)
* provide travel documents for refugees (Article 28)
* allow refugees to transfer their assets (Article 30)
* provide the possibility of assimilation and naturalization to refugees (Article 34)
* cooperate with the UNHCR (Article 35) in the exercise of its functions and to help UNHCR supervise the implementation of the provisions in the Convention.&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"/&gt;
* provide information on any national legislation they may adopt to ensure the application of the Convention (Article 36).&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"/&gt;
* settle disputes they may have with other contracting states at the International Court of Justice if not otherwise possible (Article 38)

=== The contracting states shall not ===
* discriminate against refugees (Article 3)
* take exceptional measures against a refugee solely on account of his or her nationality (Article 8)
* expect refugees to pay taxes and fiscal charges that are different to those of nationals (Article 29)
* impose penalties on refugees who entered illegally in search of asylum if they present themselves without delay (Article 31), which is commonly interpreted to mean that their unlawful entry and presence ought not to be prosecuted at all&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Yewa Holiday|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2017/03/problem|title=The Problem with the Prosecution of Refugees|publisher=University of Oxford, Faculty of Law|date=March 24, 2017|access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* expel refugees (Article 32)
* forcibly return or [[Non-refoulement|"refoul"]] refugees to the country they've fled from (Article 33). It is widely accepted that the prohibition of forcible return is part of customary international law. This means that even States that are not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention must respect the principle of non-refoulement.&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"/&gt; Therefore, States are obligated under the Convention and under customary international law to respect the principle of [[non-refoulement]]. If and when this principle is threatened, UNHCR can respond by intervening with relevant authorities, and if it deems necessary, will inform the public.&lt;ref name="UNHCR Guide"/&gt;

=== Refugees shall be treated at least like ''nationals'' in relation to ===
* freedom to practice their religion (Article 4)
* the respect and protection of artistic rights and industrial property (Article 14)
* rationing (Article 20)
* elementary education (Article 22)
* public relief and assistance (Article 23)
* labour legislation and social security (Article 24)

=== Refugees shall be treated at least like ''other non-nationals'' in relation to ===
* movable and immovable property (Article 13)
* the right of association in unions or other associations (Article  15)
* wage-earning employment (Article 17)
* self-employment (Article 18)
* practice of the liberal professions (Article 19)
* housing (Article 21)
* education higher than elementary  (Article 22)
* the right to free movement and free choice of residence within the country (Article 26)

==Noncompliance==

Although the Convention is "[[legally binding]]" there is no body that monitors compliance. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) has supervisory responsibilities, but cannot enforce the Convention, and there is no formal mechanism for individuals to file complaints. The Convention specifies that complaints should be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Convention relating to the Status of Refugees''', Article 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that no nation has ever done this.

An individual may lodge a complaint with the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], or with the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] under the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], but no one has ever done so in regard to violations of the Convention. Nations may levy [[international sanctions]] against violators, but no nation has ever done this.

At present, the only real consequences of violation are 1) [[public shaming]] in the press, and 2) verbal condemnation of the violator by the UN and by other nations. To date these have not proven to be significant deterrents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crikey.com.au/2012/11/29/crikey-clarifier-does-australias-refugee-policy-breach-un-rules/ Rose Moloney, "Does Australia's refugee policy breach UN rules?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26219">The '''Cork Local Government Review''' was a 2015 review carried out by the '''Cork Local Government Committee''' of the operation of [[Cork County Council]] and [[Cork City Council]] in Ireland. Its report recommended merging them into a single "super-council" with effect from  the [[Irish local elections, 2019|2019 local elections]].&lt;ref name="eveningecho704605" /&gt; The recommendation was controversial and in 2017, after a review, it was dropped in favour of extending the city boundary into territory of the county.&lt;ref name="ind35808144"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/how-corks-super-council-has-been-dismissed-and-the-city-is-getting-a-border-extension-35808144.html|title=How Cork's 'super council' has been dismissed - and the city is getting a border extension|last=Riegel|first=Ralph|date=9 June 2017|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The most recent extension of the boundary of the city council area was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1965/si/141/made/en/print|title=S.I.

==Committee==
The committee's [[terms of reference]] were specified by minister [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]].&lt;ref name="termsofreference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corklocalgovernmentreview.ie/cork_terms_of_reference.html|title=Terms of Reference|publisher=Cork Local Government Review|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could recommend either merging the two councils into a single local government area for [[County Cork]], or else adjusting the boundary between [[Cork (city)|Cork city]] and the county. The five committee members were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corklocalgovernmentreview.ie/committee_members_biographies.html|title=Committee Members’ Biographies|publisher=Cork Local Government Review|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alf Smiddy, formerly [[managing director]] of [[Beamish and Crawford]] brewery in Cork, who chaired the committee
* Tom Curran, former [[Chief executive (Irish local government)|county manager]] with [[Kerry County Council]]
* John Lucey, a [[Senior Counsel]]
* [[Dermot Keogh]], history professor at [[University College Cork]] (UCC)
* Theresa Reidy, politics lecturer at UCC

==Report==
After a public consultation, its report was submitted in September 2015. The majority report, by Smiddy, Curran, and Lucey, recommends a single council, with more powers than existing county councils have under the 2001 act and the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The super-council would have three subunits called "divisions", one being a "metropolitan division" around Cork city, the others respectively covering the north and east of the county and the south and west of it. The divisions would be further divided into  [[municipal district (Ireland)|municipal district]]s as defined under the 2014 act.

Keogh and Reidy submitted a minority report arguing for retention of separate city and county councils, with a boundary adjustment increasing the area of the city council. The minority report interpreted the "metropolitan division" proposed in the majority report as nothing more than a municipal district with no budgetary powers.

===City/metropolitan boundary===
The majority report recommended that the "metropolitan division" around the city should correspond to the existing [[Metropolitan Cork]] statistical area, with a population of 289,739, as far out as [[Ballinhassig]], [[Minane Bridge]], [[Cloyne]], [[Midleton]], [[Watergrasshill]], and [[Dripsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cork Local Government Committee 2015, pp.58,84&lt;/ref&gt; It did not specify a boundary for the "metropolitan district" within the metropolitan division, but said all municipal district boundaries should be redrawn by an implementation committee.&lt;ref&gt;Cork Local Government Committee 2015, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority report recommended that the city boundary be extended to the [[satellite town]]s of [[Ballincollig]], [[Blarney]], [[Carrigtwohill]], and [[Carrigaline]], but not Midleton or [[Cobh]]. It would have a population between 230,000 and 235,000, the precise boundary to be negotiated between the city and county councils.&lt;ref&gt;Cork Local Government Committee 2015, Appendix 6 (Minority Report), pp.33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
In general, politicians from the county agreed with the majority report, while politicians and civic groups from the city favoured retaining a separate city council.&lt;ref name="eveningecho704605"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/merger-of-cork-councils-to-be-in-place-for-2019-elections/704605/|title=Merger of Cork councils to be in place for 2019 elections|date=7 September 2015|work=[[Evening Echo]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cork South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork South- Central]] TD [[Ciarán Lynch]] commissioned a poll of the constituency showing 59 percent support for boundary extension and 23 percent for amalgamation, which county mayor John Paul O’Shea criticised as a "biased survey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/mayor-urges-withdrawal-of-poll-showing-few-back-council-merger-1.2356018|title=Mayor urges  withdrawal of poll showing few back council merger|last1=Roche|first1=Barry|first2=Olivia |last2=Kelleher|date=17 September 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen former [[Lord Mayor of Cork|Lord Mayors of the city]] signed a letter opposing any merger with the county.&lt;ref&gt;Cork Local Government Committee 2015, Appendix 6 (Minority Report), pp.83–85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eveningecho704605" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/cork-city-must-retain-power-to-self-govern-say-18-former-mayors-1.2305978 |title=Cork city must retain power to self-govern, say 18 former mayors|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=4 August 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specially convened meeting of the city council on 22 September 2015 resolved by 29 votes to none to seek a [[judicial review]] in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] of the proposal's constitutionality, and to write to the Taoiseach and minister demanding a halt to the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/city-council-goes-to-court-to-prevent-merger/772009/|title=City Council goes to court to prevent merger|date=15 September 2015|work=Evening Echo|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0922/729475-cork-city-council-merger/|title=Legal challenge against Cork City Council merger|date=22 September 2015|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county council endorsed the majority report on 28 September 2015, with only [[Sinn Féin]] councillors opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/cork-county-council-favours-merger-356414.html|title=Cork County Council favours merger|last=O’Riordan|first=Sean|date=28 September 2015|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kelly, the responsible minister, backed the majority report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/alan-kelly-backs-report-on-cork-councils-merger-1.2362185|title=Alan Kelly  backs report on Cork councils merger|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=23 September 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Coveney]], a [[Government of the 31st Dáil|government minister]] from near Carrigaline, advised voters to read the full report before passing judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/cork-merger-report-in-full/705405/|title=Cork merger report in full|date=8 September 2015|work=Evening Echo|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Dáil, [[Micheál Martin]] and [[Jonathan O'Brien]] opposed it while Kelly supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2015-09-22a.598|title=Local Government Reform|date=22 Sep 2015|work=Dáil debates|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Seanad, [[Paul Bradford]] opposed while junior minister [[Jimmy Deenihan]] replied that there were "obviously pros and cons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/sendebates/?id=2015-09-23a.24|title=Local Government Reform|date=23 Sep 2015|work=Seanad debates|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael McCarthy (politician)|Michael McCarthy]], Labour TD for [[Cork South-West (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-West]], and chair of the [[Dáil committee|Dáil Committee]] on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, invited the review committee members to address the Dáil committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/cork-merger-plan-to-go-to-committee-357282.html|title=Cork merger plan to go to committee|last=English|first=Eoin|date=3 October 2015|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork [[chamber of commerce]], which straddles both council areas, favours amalgamation.&lt;ref name="eveningecho704605" /&gt; The Cork branch of [[Ibec|IBEC]] made a submission in favour of retaining separate councils but subsequently endorsed the majority report, denying this was a [[U-turn (politics)|U-turn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/cork-ibec-defends-decision-to-change-position-on-merger-of-councils-1.2362064|title=Cork Ibec defends  decision to change position on merger of councils|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=23 September 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cork Institute of Technology]] president Brendan Murphy backed the merger; UCC did not initially take a position, while defending the right of the UCC faculty on the committee to express a minority view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/university-boss-michael-murphy-says-ucc-considering-council-merger-stance-354499.html|title=University boss Michael Murphy says UCC considering council merger stance|last=English|first=Eoin|date=18 September 2015|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 debate before [[Irish general election, 2016|the general election]], eight of nine Cork candidates were opposed to the merger, with Fine Gael's [[Dara Murphy]] saying "It has been too divisive. What we are left with now is the status quo, which is the worst of both worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/candidates-no-to-council-merger/1859604/|title=Candidates ‘no’ to council merger|date=16 February 2016|work=Evening Echo|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC commissioned Tony Bovaird of the [[University of Birmingham]] to review both majority and minority reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucc.ie/en/about/uccnews/fullstory-715560-en.html|title=Bovaird Report on Cork Local Government|date=18 October 2016|work=News and Views|publisher=University College Cork|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bovaird said the minority report was "much better substantiated", while Alf Smiddy dismissed Bovaird's review as "a continuation of an ongoing orchestrated saga from certain narrow quarters to frustrate the Government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lord-mayor-criticises-smiddy-for-dismissing-experts-cork-merger-review-426224.html|title=Lord mayor criticises Smiddy for dismissing expert’s Cork merger review |last=English|first=Eoin|date=18 October 2016|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expert advisory group==
Early in 2016, the Cork report was considered by the government's Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform, along with another recommending merging Galway [[Galway|City]] and [[County Galway|County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2016-06-28a.612|title=Local Authority Boundaries Review|date=28 Jun 2016|work=Written answers|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/galway_report_final_27.11.2015.pdf#page=9 |format=PDF|title=Local Government Arrangements in Galway|author=Galway Local Government Committee|date=November 2015|publisher=Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government|page=9|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2016 election, Simon Coveney became Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in the [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|Fine Gael–led government]]. In June, he announced that a new expert group would take "a fresh look" at the Cork question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/review-of-controversial-merger-plan-for-cork-city-and-county-councils-407692.html|title=Review of controversial merger plan for Cork city and county councils |last=English|first=Eoin|date=30 June 2016|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he appointed an "expert advisory group" with detailed terms of reference including "having regard particularly to the review carried out by the Cork Local Government Review Committee and its report".&lt;ref name="expertgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/advisory_group-cork_-tors-membership.pdf |format=PDF|title=Expert Advisory Group on local government arrangements in Cork - Terms of Reference|date=6 October 2016|publisher=Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the original committee, the review group's terms referred to the city's "strategic role" as a "regional and national growth centre".&lt;ref name="expertgroup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it3075486"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/report-on-cork-local-government-reform-due-before-june-1.3075486|title=Report on Cork local government reform due before June|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=8 May 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's members were:&lt;ref name="expertgroup"/&gt;
* Jim Mackinnon, chief planner of the [[Scottish Government]]
* Paul Martin, chief executive of the councils of the [[London borough]]s of [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]] and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], which merged their staff in October 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council/news/press_office/older_news/october_2016/historic_moment_for_richmond_and_wandsworth_councils_as_new_shared_staff_team_launched.htm?viewmode=pr|title=Historic moment for Richmond and Wandsworth Councils as new shared staff team launched |date=3 October 2016|publisher=London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craig v East Coast Bays City Council''' [1986] 1 NZLR 99  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding council liability for negligent inspection.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Craig owned a house in Murrays Bay. On the section in front of his house, his neighbour started building a new house, within 3.8 metres of his boundary.

During construction, he realized that when completed, the house would obstruct his views, and he complained to the council without success.

He later discovered, that according to the District Plan, any building constructed within 6 metres of a property boundary, must be publicly notified, which if this had happened Craig could have filed an objection.

And the house was originally planned to be built 6 metres from Craigs property, however this would have involved building over a council sewer line. To avoid difficulties of building over a sewer line, the  site plan was moved to within 3.8 metres.

Whilst this was still outside the District Plan, the council had powers to give exemptions to complying with the District Plan, and gave an exemption in this case.

However, it later transpired that due to a misinterpretation of the rules, the council did not have the legal authority to grant an exemption in this instance.

Craig sued the council for $40,000 in damages for negligence.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal upheld the High Courts award of damages of $2,250.

'''Footnote:''' The Court of Appeal decided Craig v East Coast Bays City Council on the same day as [[Brown v Heathcote County Council]] and [[Stieller v Porirua City Council]], which also involved negligent council building inspections.

These measures were enacted by the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states at the turn of the 20th century, and by [[Oklahoma]] when it gained statehood in 1907,&lt;ref name="Kentucky"/&gt; although ''not'' by the former [[border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]]. Their actions were designed to frustrate the objective of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], [[ratified]] in 1870, which sought to protect the [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] of [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]].

During the later elections of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, beginning in the 1870s, [[White people|white]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] used violence by [[paramilitary]] groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters and turn Republicans out of office.  After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many [[Poor White|poor whites]] in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Valelly, Richard M.; ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'' University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 {{ISBN|9780226845302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party regular, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected as the first southern [[President of the United States|President]] since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] throughout federal government workplaces, as well as [[racial discrimination]] in hiring.&lt;ref name="Teachingamericanhistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=1115 |title=Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson W.E.B. DuBois, September, 1913 |publisher=Teachingamericanhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], American military forces were segregated, with black soldiers poorly trained and equipped.

Disenfranchisement had far-reaching effects in Congress, where the Democratic [[Solid South]] enjoyed "about 25 extra seats in Congress for each decade between 1903 and 1953."{{refn|Despite the South's excessive representation relative to voting population, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] resulted in [[Mississippi's congressional districts|Mississippi]] losing seats in Congress due to reapportionment following the [[1930 United States Census|1930]] and [[1950 United States Census|1950 Censuses]], while [[South Carolina's congressional districts|South Carolina]] and [[Alabama's congressional districts|Alabama]] also lost Congressional seats after the former Census and [[Arkansas's congressional districts|Arkansas]] following the latter.|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="valelly146-147"&gt;Valelly; ''The Two Reconstructions''; pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Democratic dominance in the South meant that southern [[U.S. Senate|Senators]] and [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representatives]] became entrenched in Congress. They favored seniority privileges in Congress, which became the standard by 1920, and Southerners controlled chairmanships of important [[Congressional committee|committees]], as well as leadership of the national Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="valelly146-147"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], legislation establishing numerous national social programs were passed without the representation of [[African Americans]], leading to gaps in program coverage and discrimination against them in operations. In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from [[jury duty|serving in local courts]]. Juries were [[all-white jury|all white]] across the South.

Political disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering of electoral boundaries]], as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map]&lt;/ref&gt; Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/gerrymander-court-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal? Why the Courts Are Divided.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865, marking the start of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] in the eleven former &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/chronol.htm|title=Chronology of Emancipation during the Civil War|publisher=University of Maryland: Department of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate states. Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]], starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction.

During the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]], were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the [[freedmen]]'s exercise of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J. Chin &amp; Randy Wagner, "The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty," [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963036&amp;high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868 presidential election]], Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states.

White supremacist [[paramilitary]] organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their [[civil and political rights]] in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was formed in 1865 in [[Tennessee]] (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret [[vigilante]] group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included [[vandalism]] and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and [[lynching]]s. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well.

The toll of Klan murders and attacks led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book

Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend ''[[habeas corpus]]'' under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the [[Carolinas]] in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s.

New paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1876 in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', arising from trials related to the [[Colfax Massacre]], that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights.

The [[paramilitary]] organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing [[insurgency]] in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the [[White League]], formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white [[militias]], with chapters forming in other Southern states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in [[North Carolina]] and South Carolina; and other "White Liners," such as [[rifle clubs]] and the [[Knights of the White Camellia]]. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize [[freedmen]] to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as "the military arm of the Democratic Party."&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

They were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the [[United States presidential election, 1876|controversial 1876 elections]]. As a result of a national [[Compromise of 1877]] arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] – they identified as the [[Redeemers]]. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called "the Redemption". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 "The Great Betrayal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Events in the Presidency of Rutherford B.

==Post-Reconstruction disenfranchisement==
Following continuing violence around elections as insurgents worked to suppress black voting, the Democratic-dominated Southern states passed legislation to create barriers to voter registrations by blacks and [[Poor White|poor whites]], starting with the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in 1877. Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican-Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions.

To secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most "consistently competitive political system in the South".&lt;ref name="shaping"&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880–1910'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt; A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex.

In 1890 Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and pass a [[literacy test]]. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] challenge in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the "Mississippi plan." By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, ‘Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon’], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000,  Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Such constitutional provisions were unsuccessfully challenged at the Supreme Court in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903). In practice, these provisions, including [[white primaries]], created a maze that blocked most blacks and many poor whites from voting in Southern states until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="p10"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon'], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, p. 10, Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Voter registration and turnout dropped sharply across the South, as most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system.

The disenfranchisement of a large proportion of voters attracted the attention of Congress, and as early as 1900 some members proposed stripping the South of seats, related to the number of people who were barred from voting. Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.&lt;ref name="committee"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf ‘COMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT’], ''The New York Times'', 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the "[[Solid South]]", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make [[lynching]] a federal crime.&lt;ref name="p10"/&gt;

==New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908==
{{See also|Voting rights in the United States}}
Despite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1868–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century.

[[Florida]] approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions. All included provisions that effectively restricted voter registration and suffrage, including requirements for poll taxes, increased residency, and subjective [[literacy tests]].&lt;ref name="Michael Perman 2001"&gt;Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908''. Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

With educational improvements, blacks had markedly increased their rate of literacy. By 1891, their illiteracy had declined to 58 percent, whilst the rate of white illiteracy in the South at that time was 31 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp 1878–1895: Disenfranchisement (sic), Southern Education Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074413/http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp |date=2008-06-07 }}, accessed 16 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some states used [[grandfather clause]]s to exempt white voters from literacy tests altogether. Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to "fail" the literacy tests administered by white registrars.

The historian [[J. Morgan Kousser]] noted, "Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|black belt]] members," whom he identified as "always socioeconomically privileged." In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the [[planter (American South)|planter]] and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, "They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote."&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls.&lt;ref name="Michael Perman 2001" /&gt;

With the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also "would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well – and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South."&lt;ref name="p10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136"&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

The new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,&lt;ref&gt;Mickey, Robert; ''Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972'', p. 87 {{ISBN|1400838789}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to assert white supremacy, establish [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, and treat blacks as second-class citizens. The landmark court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) held that "separate but equal" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the [[white primary]]. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states.

For the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the "Solid South" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives{{clarify|date=February 2017}} desired since the days of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Woodrow Wilson#Segregation in the federal government|Woodrow Wilson]], one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was the first Southerner elected after 1856.{{refn|Wilson began his political career as [[list of governors of New Jersey|Governor of New Jersey]] in 1910 and remained Governor until he was elected President, but he grew up in a slaveholding family in Virginia.|group="nb"}} He benefited by the disenfranchisement of blacks and crippling of the Republican Party in the South.&lt;ref name="valelly146-147" /&gt; Soon after taking office, Wilson directed the segregation of federal facilities in the District of Columbia, which had been integrated during Reconstruction.

===Louisiana===
With a population evenly divided between races, in 1896 there were 130,334 black voters on the Louisiana registration rolls and about the same number of whites.&lt;ref name="p12"/&gt;
Louisiana State legislators passed a new constitution in 1898 that included requirements for applicants to pass a [[literacy test]] in English or his native language in order to register to vote, or to certify owning $300 worth of property, known as a [[property requirement]]. The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a [[grandfather clause]], which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that "Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty." Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer [[residency requirement]] in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers.

The effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. "In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was."&lt;ref name="p12"/&gt;

===North Carolina===
In 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through [[electoral fusion]].&lt;ref name="fusion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/58/entry|title=Fusion Politics - North Carolina History Project|first=Website design and web development by Mango Web Design|last=http://mangowebdesign.com|website=northcarolinahistory.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican [[Daniel Lindsay Russell]] won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of [[George Henry White]] to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives.

At the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on [[White Supremacy]] and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by [[Furnifold McLendel Simmons]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], editor and publisher of ''[[The News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]].'' The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920.

The Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again.&lt;ref name="shaping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fusion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|title=The North Carolina Election of 1898 · UNC Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They passed laws restricting voter registration. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration, and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied) and prepayment of a [[poll tax]]. A [[grandfather clause]] exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867.&lt;ref name="Pildes"/&gt; The legislature also passed [[Jim Crow]] laws establishing racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public facilities and transportation.

The effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black voters from voter rolls by 1904. Contemporary accounts estimated that seventy-five thousand black male citizens lost the vote.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=McACAAAAYAAJ Albert Shaw, ''The American Monthly Review of Reviews'', Vol.XXII, Jul-Dec 1900, p.274]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, ‘Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon’], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 blacks numbered 630,207 citizens, about 33% of the state's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the thriving black middle class was slowed. In North Carolina and other Southern states, there were also the insidious effects of invisibility: "[W]ithin a decade of disenfranchisement (sic), the white supremacy campaign had erased the image of the black middle class from the minds of white North Carolinians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', 2000, p.12 and 27], Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia===
In Virginia, Democrats sought disenfranchisement in the late 19th century after a coalition of white and black Republicans with populist Democrats had come to power; the coalition had been formalized as the [[Readjuster Party]]. The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks.&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dabney"/&gt; The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and the collapse of the [[Byrd Organization]] machine.

===Border States: failed disenfranchisement===
The five [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s.

The causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore. This city had many free blacks before the Civil War and they had established both economic and political power.&lt;ref name="Here"&gt;Smith, C. Fraser; ''Here Lies Jim Crow: Civil Rights in Maryland''; p. 66 {{ISBN|0801888077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state legislature passed a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]] in 1904, but incurred vigorous opposition and repealed it in 1911. Despite support among conservative whites in the conservative [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], referenda for bills to disenfranchise blacks failed three times in 1905, 1908 and 1910, with the last vote being the most decisive.&lt;ref name="Here"/&gt; The existence of substantial [[Italian Americans|Italian immigration]] completely absent from the Confederacy meant that these immigrants were exposed to the possibility of disfranchisement, but much more critically allowed for much stronger resistance amongst the white population.&lt;ref&gt;Shufelt, Gordeon H.; 'Jim Crow among strangers: The growth of Baltimore's Little Italy and Maryland's disfranchisement campaigns'; ''Journal of American Ethnic History''; vol. 19, issue 4 (Summer 2000), pp. 49-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kentucky, Lexington's city government had passed a poll tax in 1901, but it was declared invalid in state circuit courts.&lt;ref name="Kentucky"&gt;Klotter, Jeames C.; ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox, 1900-1950''; pp. 196-197 {{ISBN|0916968243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, a new state legislative effort to disenfranchise blacks failed because of the strong organization of the Republican Party in pro-Union regions of the state.&lt;ref name="Kentucky"/&gt;

==Methods of disenfranchisement==
===Poll taxes===
Proof of payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] was a prerequisite to voter registration in Florida, [[Alabama]], Tennessee, [[Arkansas]], Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia (1877), North and South Carolina, Virginia (until 1882 and again from 1902 with its new constitution),&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21601.htm |title=Virginia's Constitutional Convention of 1901–1902 |accessdate=2006-09-14 |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002030244/http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21601.htm |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dabney" &gt;{{cite book |last=Dabney|first=Virginius|authorlink=Virginius Dabney|title=Virginia, The New Dominion|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1971|pages=436–437|isbn=978-0-8139-1015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas (1902)&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html "Historical Barriers to Voting"], in ''Texas Politics'', University of Texas, accessed 4 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some northern and western states. The Texas poll tax "required otherwise eligible voters to pay between $1.50 and $1.75 to register to vote – a lot of money at the time, and a big barrier to the working classes and poor."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt; Georgia created a cumulative poll tax requirement in 1877: men of any race 21 to 60 years of age had to pay a sum of money for every year from the time they had turned 21, or from the time that the law took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=1|title=Atlanta in the Civil Rights Movement|website=www.atlantahighered.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll tax requirements applied to whites as well as blacks, and also adversely affected poor citizens. Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.

The poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date.&lt;ref name=Pildes /&gt;

===Educational and character requirements===
Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device.

Alabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes.  After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the "good character clause" (also known as the "[[grandfather clause]]"). An appointment board in each county could register "all voters under the present [previous] law" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and "all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship." This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

South Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the "understanding" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

===Eight Box Law===
&lt;!-- linked from [[Jim Crow laws]] (do not change this header--will break the link) --&gt;
By 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in [[South Carolina]]. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent [[1890 United States Census|in 1890]]),&lt;ref name=rogersJr/&gt; white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] created an indirect literacy test, called the "Eight Box Law."

The law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters.&lt;ref name="Holt"&gt;{{cite book

The multiple-ballot box law was challenged in court. On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention.

The constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population,&lt;ref name=rogersJr&gt;{{cite book | first = George C. and C.

Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], 2000, p.12, accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grandfather clause===
States also used [[grandfather clause]]s to enable illiterate whites who could not pass a literacy test to vote. It allowed a man to vote if his grandfather or father had voted prior to January 1, 1867; at that time, most African Americans had been slaves, while [[free people of color]], even if property owners, and [[freedmen]] were ineligible to vote until 1870.{{refn|Free men of color could vote in North Carolina prior to 1831 if they met property qualifications, but they were barred from voting in 1835 there and elsewhere after fears raised by the [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion of 1831.|group="nb"}}

[[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Benjamin Curtis']] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857)]]'' had noted that [[free people of color]] in numerous states had the right to vote at the time of the [[Articles of Confederation]] (as part of the argument about whether people of African descent could be citizens of the new United States):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of this, there can be no doubt. At the time of the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, all free native-born inhabitants of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, though descended from African slaves, were not only citizens of those States, but such of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed the franchise of electors, on equal terms with other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

North Carolina's constitutional amendment of 1900 exempted from the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867, another type of use of a grandfather clause.&lt;ref name=Pildes&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', 2000, pp.12 and 27] Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia also used a type of grandfather clause.&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dabney"/&gt;

In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court invalidated the [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Constitution|Constitution]]'s "old soldier" and "grandfather clause" exemptions from literacy tests. In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Valelly, ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guinn'' was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules.

In ''[[Lane v. Wilson]]'' (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in ''Guinn.''  This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in ''Guinn.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/268/case.html|title=Lane v.

===White primaries===
{{main|White primaries}}
About the turn of the 20th century, white members of the Democratic Party in some Southern states devised rules that excluded blacks and other minorities from participating in party primaries. These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political  parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional response==
The North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian [[David Blight]] demonstrated in ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the [[Dunning School]] at [[Columbia University]] and other institutions.

Disfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The [[Lodge Bill]] or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by [[George Frisbie Hoar]]. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]], the bill failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Keyssar, Alexander ; ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'', Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 {{ISBN|0465005020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' '' Maine History'', March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1–23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. [[Edgar D. Crumpacker]] (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised. He noted this was provided for in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provided for stripping representation from states that reduced suffrage due to race.&lt;ref name="valelly146-147"/&gt; The Committee and House failed to agree on this proposal.&lt;ref name="committee"/&gt; Supporters of black suffrage worked to secure Congressional investigation of disfranchisement, but concerted opposition of the Southern Democratic bloc was aroused, and the efforts failed.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

From 1896 to 1900, the House of Representatives with a Republican majority had acted in more than thirty cases to set aside election results from Southern states where the House Elections Committee had concluded that "black voters had been excluded due to fraud, violence, or intimidation." Nevertheless, in the early 20th century, it began to back off from its enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment and suggested that state and federal courts should exercise oversight of this issue. The Southern bloc of Democrats exercised increasing power in the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp.19-20], Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They had no interest in protecting suffrage for blacks.

In 1904 Congress administered a [[coup de grâce]] to efforts to investigate disfranchisement in its decision in the 1904 South Carolina election challenge of ''[[Dantzler v. Lever]]''.  The [[House Committee on Elections]] upheld Lever's victory. It suggested that citizens of South Carolina who believed their rights were denied should take their cases to the state courts, and ultimately, the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, ‘Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon’, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp.20-21] Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks had no recourse through the Southern state courts, which would not uphold their rights. Because they were disfranchised, blacks could not serve on juries, and whites were clearly aligned against them on this and other racial issues.

{{anchor|Tinkham}}
Despite the Lever decision and domination of Congress by Democrats, some Northern Congressmen continued to raise the issue of black disfranchisement and resulting malapportionment. For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative [[George H. Tinkham]] from Massachusetts offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks. His intention was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.&lt;ref name="tinkham"/&gt;

In addition, he believed there should be reapportionment in the House related to the voting population of southern states, rather than the general population as enumerated in the census.&lt;ref name="tinkham"/&gt; Such reapportionment was authorized by the Constitution and would reflect reality, so that the South should not get credit for people and voters it had disfranchised. Tinkham detailed how outsized the South's representation was related to the total number of voters in each state, compared to other states with the same number of representatives:&lt;ref name="tinkham"&gt;{{Cite news|title=DEMANDS INQUIRY ON DISFRANCHISING; Representative Tinkham Aims to Enforce 14th and 15th Articles of Constitution.

Tinkham was defeated by the Democratic Southern Bloc, and also by fears amongst the northern business elites of increasing the voting power of Northern urban working classes,&lt;ref name="Doorstep"&gt;Smith, J. Douglas; ''On Democracy's Doorstep: The Inside Story of How the Supreme Court Brought "One Person, One Vote" to the United States''; pp. 4-18 {{ISBN|0809074249}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom both northern business and Southern planter elites believed would vote for large-scale income redistribution at a Federal level.&lt;ref&gt;See Rodden, Jonathan A.; [http://web.stanford.edu/~jrodden/wp/shadow.pdf ‘The Long Shadow of the Industrial Revolution: Political Geography and the Representation of the Left’]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Herbert Hoover]] was elected in a landslide in 1928, gaining support from five southern states, Tinkham renewed his effort in the spring of 1929 to persuade Congress to penalize southern states under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments for their racial discrimination. He suggested reduction of their congressional delegations in proportion to the populations they had disenfranchised. He was defeated again by the [[Solid South]]. Its representatives had rallied in outrage that the [[First Lady]] had invited [[Jessie De Priest tea at the White House|Jessie De Priest for tea to the White House]] with other congressional wives. She was the wife of [[Oscar Stanton De Priest]] from Chicago, the first African-American elected to Congress in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="racialtea"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Davis S.|date=Winter 1980|title=Herbert Hoover and Racial Politics: The De Priest Incident|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=65|issue=1|pages=6–17|jstor=3031544|doi=10.2307/3031544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segregation of the federal service began under President Theodore Roosevelt, and continued under President Taft. President Wilson escalated the process, ignoring complaints by the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier, August, and Elliott Rudwick. 'The Rise of Segregation in the Federal Bureaucracy, 1900–1930.' ''Phylon'' (1960) 28.2 (1967): 178-184. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.

In 1912 [[Woodrow Wilson]] became the first Southerner to win a presidential election since 1856. In 1912, the extra Southern electoral votes were not a decisive factor. Wilson won the election in a landslide, not only winning every Southern and border state electoral vote but also winning a large majority of electoral votes outside the South. However, Southern electoral votes did prove decisive in securing Wilson's re-election in the much closer 1916 presidential election.

==Legislative and cultural effects==
===20th-century Supreme Court decisions===
Black Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. [[Booker T. Washington]], widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, ‘Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon’, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p. 21] Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ruling in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903), the [[United States Supreme Court]] under Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the "most momentous ignored decision" in constitutional history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p.32] Accessed 10 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Trying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts.

With the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases.

===Successful challenges===
In ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the [[white primary]]; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.

Following the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8% of those of eligible age.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Each legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy "understanding tests" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Grofman (1994), ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil Rights Movement==
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}
The NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change.

Widespread violence against the [[Freedom Riders]] in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated.

President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union (USA)|State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to "let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined." On January 23, 1964, the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] in national elections, was ratified with the approval of [[South Dakota]], the 38th state to do so.

On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]], disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Summer Project]]. Forty-four days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials.

When the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the "Southern Bloc" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA), launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Congresslink.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=2014-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell said:

{{quote|We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516142923/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |archivedate=2010-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act prohibited segregation in public places and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It did not explicitly ban [[literacy tests]], which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.

As the [[United States Department of Justice]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of voting-rights activists in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], gained national attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on peaceful marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]], en route to the state capitol in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings began soon thereafter on the bill that would become the [[Voting Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Passed in 1965, this law prohibited the use of literacy tests as a requirement to register to vote. It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives. They have since won numerous seats and offices at local, state and federal levels.

The marker is inscribed on its back as follows, "'''New Mexico Historic Women Marker Initiative'''". The New Mexico Historic Women Marker Initiative was founded in 2005 by members of the New Mexico Women's Forum in a statewide effort to recognize women's contributions to New Mexico history on the state's Official Scenic Historic Markers. The Initiative ensures that women's diverse histories will be remembered and told, and will inspire and provide a guide for future generations. The 2006 Legislature funded the project."

{{Campaignbox Thirty Years' War}}
The '''Edict of Restitution''', passed eleven years into the [[Thirty Years' War]] on March 6, 1629 following [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic]] successes at arms, was a belated attempt by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] to restore the [[religion|religious]] and territorial situations reached in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), whose "[[Reservatum ecclesiasticum|Ecclesiastical Reservation]]" had impeded the [[secularization]] of [[Catholic]] church lands after 1555, as no further Catholic church lands could legally be transferred to [[Protestant]] control. However, for several decades weak emperors had been unable to enforce the "Ecclesiastical Reservation" against Protestant encroachments.

== Background ==

This lack of decisive or effective authority along with the Protestant view of the legal interpretation as well as the value of the land and the characteristic dislike for all things Catholic led several princes to secularize the Catholic church lands under the treaty established and customary practice of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''. This usually occurred when a Catholic head of the church converted to Protestantism.

The [[Peace of Augsburg]], signed in 1555, had confirmed the result of the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)]]&lt;ref name="DOS-BOE"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-559499/Diets-of-Speyer| title= Diets of Speyer (German history) | work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia| accessdate= 2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had, by agreeing to disagree, ended with this principle as a prime result. With that principle confirmed by the Treaty at Augsburg, the violence of that earlier day between the [[Lutherans]] and the Catholics in Germany ended&amp;nbsp;—at least for the generation, until renewed tensions brought about the Thirty Years' War.

Behind all this were the inheritance practices in Europe as a whole and in particular [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|the German states]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Land and control over it was a source of both [[Political power|power]] and [[wealth]], and the [[nobility|noble families]] sought to control as much land within the extended family as was possible, for example by appointing younger sons prince-bishops or prince-abbots.

== The Edict ==
The "Edict of Restitution" was an attempt to ensure that the "[[Reservatum ecclesiasticum|Ecclesiastical Reservation]]" of the Augsburg treaty was retroactively enforced. It had a tremendously polarizing effect causing the approximately 1,800 states of the Holy Roman Empire to shatter into disparate blocks of opposed interests.

If fully effected, it would have affected the already secularized [[archbishop]]rics of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] and [[Magdeburg]], 12 bishoprics and over 100 religious houses around [[the German states]]. The Edict resulted in a great transfer of power and property away from the Protestants to the Catholics, and in effect broadened a divisive religious struggle into that plus a dynastic struggle for power, as seen from the viewpoint of many smaller German princes, who might otherwise have stayed neutral.

Other states were greatly affected when the mercenary armies marched through neutral states or ravaged them in the course of their foraging expeditions.  Thousands of Protestants fled to Protestant controlled states, generally broadening the war, and central Germany was ravaged repeatedly, by some estimates losing between 25–50% of its pre-war population because the competing armies continually took the food—the majority of civilian deaths being caused by the twin side-effects of famine, and deaths from endemic diseases under populations weakened by famine.

The greatest impact was in north-east [[Germany]]. It was here that Ferdinand's power was at its weakest. Ferdinand appointed Imperial administrators to take over the secularized states and cities, re-establishing Imperial authority in an area that had been free of Imperial rule for nearly 100 years. Ferdinand's actions were not well received by the princes. It was a move that alarmed the [[France|French]] and led to the French intervention in the war.

The German princes could do nothing. They had seen the Coalition destroyed. [[Wallenstein]] had a massive army of 134,000 troops in the field to enforce Imperial authority.

Wallenstein disliked the Edict as it trespassed into the region he considered his own but he played his part for the emperor to the full. He stated that "he would teach the [[prince-elector|Electors]] manners. They must be dependent on the emperor, not the emperor on them."  The response of the princes was to rally behind [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximillian of Bavaria]] to pressure Ferdinand into dismissing Wallenstein.

Their chance came in 1630 when Ferdinand called a meeting of the Electors in [[Regensburg]] because he wanted his son, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], elected King of the Romans. According to the law, the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was selected by a vote from the Electorate of German princes. Therefore, Ferdinand needed their cooperation to approve his son as successor. Ferdinand also hoped to persuade the Electors to approve greater Imperial involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War|European wars]].

[[John George I of Saxony]] and [[George William of Brandenburg]] (both Protestant) stayed away to protest the Edict of Restitution. Those Electors present realized that they had little to gain from additional involvement in the wars. However, Maximillian still asked Ferdinand for the dismissal of Wallenstein.

To win over the Electors, Ferdinand sacked Wallenstein in August 1630 though Wallenstein argued that he was allowed to resign to save face. The dismissal of the most powerful military figure in Europe was a major victory for the Electors and Regensburg must be seen as a defeat for Ferdinand.

All of this was overshadowed in July 1630&amp;nbsp;— [[Gustavus Adolphus]] landed in [[Pomerania]] with 4,000 men in response to the persecution of the Protestants. Without Wallenstein, Ferdinand had to turn to Maximillian and [[Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]] to stop the new threat.

In 1635 the Edict of Restitution was effectively revoked, with the terms of the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]].

The '''Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013''' (c. 6) is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0033/2013033.pdf Text of proposed Bill] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; which amended [[electoral law]] in the United Kingdom. It introduced [[Individual Electoral Registration]] (IER).

The Westminster government had introduced IER to [[Northern Ireland]] in 2002 in the [[Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002]], but England, Wales and Scotland continued to use a system of householder registration.&lt;ref name="bbc_20100915"&gt;[[BBC News]], 15 September 2010, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11312362 Individual voter ID plan brought forward to 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] in some doubt following the collapse of the [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012]], there had been some criticism of the money spent on boundary reviews whilst also favouring introducing IER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/10/24/uk-government-wastes-1m-on-plans-to-change-parliamentary-boundaries-91466-32091182/ UK Government 'wastes' £1m on plans to change Parliamentary boundaries] Wales News&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electoral Commission (UK)|Electoral Commission]] suggested that there could be a severe drop in turnout as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20097076 Trouble brewing in the Lords] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; Section 6 of the Bill effectively postpones the Sixth Periodic Review until "not before 1 October 2018".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicshome.com/uk/story/32111/ Peers vote to delay boundary review] PoliticsHome&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three Parts to the Bill.

==Part 1: Individual Electoral Registration in Great Britain==

This part has twelve sections, which introduce and set the administrative structure for IER. The Act amends the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] and the [[Representation of the People Act 2000]].

Alterations and improvements to the annual [[canvassing|canvass]] of voters are introduced in this Part.

==Part 2: Administration and Conduct of Elections etc==
This part alters the timetable of parliamentary elections, modifies the timetable for [[civil parish]] elections in England and Wales, changes the regulations around the register of electors in specific circumstances, and alters the 1983 Representation of the People Act with regard to polling districts.

Section 18 introduces changes to current regulations relating to the 'inadequate performance' of [[returning officer]]s.

Section 19 modifies the rules on [[joint ticket]] candidatures at elections, permitting the use of an emblem of one of the parties or a combined emblem on [[ballot papers]].

Section 22 repeals from the provisions of the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] for the setting up of a [[Coordinated Online Register of Electors]].

==Part 3: Final Provisions==

This section deals with the extent and name of the Bill.

==Proposed amendments==

Committee stage discussion of the Bill commenced on Monday 29 November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2012/october/lords-electoral-registration-committee-day-1/ The Electoral Registration and Administration Bill begins committee stage, line by line scrutiny of the bill, in the House of Lords today (Monday 29 October)] Parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst proposed amendments put forward for debate is a new clause allowing for weekend voting, put forward by [[Chris Rennard, Baron Rennard|Lord Rennard]] and [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Lord Tyler]].

'''European labour law''' regulates basic transnational standards of employment and partnership at work in the [[European Union]] and countries adhering to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

The European Union, under the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], article 153(1) is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes [[wage regulation]] and [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_X:_Social_Policy art 153(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights include (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to [[job security]]. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers.

The fundamental principle of [[labour law]] is that employees' [[unequal bargaining power]] justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive [[social rights]] so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;See further [[O Kahn-Freund]], '[[Hugo Sinzheimer]]' in ''Labour Law and Politics in the Weimar Republic'' (1981) 103, 'The technique of bourgeois society and its law is to cover social facts and factors of social existence with abstractions: [[property]], contract, [[legal person]]. All these abstractions contain within them socially opposed and contradictory phenomena: property used for production and property used for [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], agreements between equal parties and agreements between [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal parties]], capitalist and worker. Through [[abstraction]] it is possible to extend legal rules, which are appropriate to the social phenomenon for which they were originally developed, to other social phenomena, thereby concealing the exercise of social [[power (social and political)|power]] behind a veil of law'. A Supiot, ''Beyond Employment: Changes in Work and the Future of Labour Law in Europe'' (2001). [[S Deakin]] and F Wilkinson, ''The Law of the Labour Market'' (2005) 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989]],&lt;ref&gt;See the Charter's [http://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/community-charter--en.pdf text]&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in the "social chapter" of the [[Treaty of Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], but was acceded to when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While [[free movement of workers]] was central to the first [[European Economic Community]] agreement, the development of European labour law has been a gradual process. Originally, the [[Ohlin Report]] of 1956 recommended that labour standards did not need to be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a "[[race to the bottom]]" in [[international trade]] if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages.

The [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (deriving from the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) lists in article 2(1) the European Union's competence in the field of [[labour law]]. What is conspicuously not included is unjust dismissal of workers, and according to article 153(5) "pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs". As it says, "the Union shall support and complement the activities of the Member States in the following fields:"

{{Cquote|
:(a) improvement in particular of the working environment to protect workers' [[health and safety]];
:(b) working conditions;
:(c) [[social security]] and social protection of workers;
:(d) protection of workers where their [[employment contract]] is terminated;
:(e) the information and [[Public consultation|consultation]] of workers;
:(f) representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers, including [[co-determination]], subject to paragraph 5;
:(g) conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Union territory;
:(h) the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article 166;
:(i) [[Gender equality|equality]] between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work;
:(j) the combating of [[social exclusion]];
:(k) the modernisation of social protection systems without prejudice to point (c).}}

The objectives draw, according to TFEU article 151, inspiration from a number of other treaties and sources, which in turn draw inspiration from the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[Versailles Treaty]].

==Labour and human rights==
{{see also|ILO Conventions|UK labour law|German labour law|French labour law|United States labor law}}
A first group of Directives create a range of individual rights in EU employment relationships. The objective of transnational regulation is to progressively raise the minimum floor in line with economic development.

*[[European Convention on Human Rights]] articles 4, 6, 9, 10 and 11
*[[European Social Charter]] 1961 
*[[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers]] 1989

===Employment contracts===
The [[Employment Information Directive 1991]] requires that every employee (however defined by member state law) has the right to a written statement of their employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;91/553/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;

The consistent jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Justice]] is that an employee is generally to be defined according to the fact that he or she is invariably the weaker party in an employment contract, and works under the direction of another.
*''[[Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Württemberg]]'' (1986) C-66/85, [17] 'the essential feature of an employment relationship … is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration.'
*''[[Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz]]'' (2005) C-397/01, "the worker must be regarded as the weaker party to the employment contract and it is therefore necessary to prevent the employer being in a position to disregard the intentions of the other party to the contract or to impose on that party a restriction of his rights without him having expressly given his consent in that regard."
*''[[Danosa v LKB Līzings SIA]]'' (2010) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62009CJ0232&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-232/09]
*''[[Holterman Ferho Exploitatie BV v Spies Von Büllesheim]]'' (2015) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62014CJ0047&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-47/14]
The European Court of Justice expressly rules that there are generally no exemptions from the term "employee" for [http://www.huemmerich-legal.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Internationales_Labor_Law_Working_Paper_No_1_2018_2_16.pdf executives under European Law], which would allow member states to restrict employee protection on non-executive-employees.

===Free movement===
Articles [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title IV: Free Movement of Persons, Services and Capital|45–48]] state that workers have the right to move freely and work anywhere in the EU, without discrimination on grounds of nationality, subject to exceptions to preserve public policy, security and health.
*[[Citizens Rights Directive]] 2004/38/EC

There is also an old Directive concerning posted workers which has recently become highly contentious given decisions by the ECJ in ''[[The Rosella]]'' and ''Laval''.
*[[Posted Workers Directive]] 96/71/EC

===Working time and child care===
[[File:Antipaxos vrika beach bgiu.jpg|thumb|left|The [[European Social Charter 1961]] art 2(1) requires "the working week to be progressively reduced" with "increase of productivity".&lt;ref&gt;[[European Social Charter 1961]] [http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168006b642 art 2(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Working Time Directive 2003]] requires 28 paid holidays a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] art 7, referring to "four weeks" and arts 5 and 6 referring to the concept of "weekly" as meaning a "seven-day period". The choice to phrase time off as "weeks" was interpreted by the UK Supreme Court to mean employees have the right to take weeks off at a time, rather than separate days in the UK context: ''[[Russell v Transocean International Resources Ltd]]'' [2011] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/57.html UKSC 57], [19]&lt;/ref&gt; With two-day [[weekends]], most people in the EU work two-thirds of the year or less.&lt;ref&gt;See further [[JM Keynes]], ''Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren'' (1930) arguing a 15-hour week was achievable by 2000 if gains in productivity increases were equitably shared.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reflecting basic standards in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[ILO Conventions]],&lt;ref&gt;[[UDHR]] art 24, [[Holidays with Pay Convention 1970]] (no 132) and see also the [[European Social Charter 1961]] art 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Working Time Directive 2003]] requires a minimum of 4 weeks (totalling 28 days) paid holidays each year,&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML art 7]. In the UK, the implementing [[Working Time Regulations 1998]] state "5.6 weeks" is needed, although this is also 28 days, as a "week" was originally taken to refer to a 5-day working week.&lt;/ref&gt; a minimum of 20-minute paid rest breaks for 6-hour work shifts, limits on night work or time spent on dangerous work,&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML arts 2–5 and 8–13]&lt;/ref&gt; and a maximum 48-hour working week unless a worker individually consents.&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML arts 6 and 17] and ''[[Pfeiffer v Deutsches Kreuz, Kreisverband Waldshut eV]]'' (2005) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0397:EN:HTML C-397/01]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parental Leave Directive 2010]] creates a bare minimum of 4 months of unpaid leave for parents (mothers, fathers, or legal guardians) to care for children before they turn 8 years old, and the [[Pregnant Workers Directive 1992]] creates a right for mothers to a minimum of 14 weeks' paid leave to care for children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Boyle v Equal Opportunities Commission]]'' (1998) C-411/96 requires pay be at least the same level as statutory sick pay.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and safety===
The [[Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989]] requires basic requirements to prevent and insure against workplace risks, with employee consultation and participation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31989L0391&amp;from=EN 89/391/EC]) art 11&lt;/ref&gt; and this is complemented by specialised Directives, ranging from work equipment to dangerous industries.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Health and Safety of Atypical Workers Directive 1991]] extends these protections to people who do not have typical, full-time or permanent employment contracts.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all cases, all member states go significantly beyond this minimum.

*[[Health and Safety of Atypical Workers Directive 1991]] 91/83/EEC
*[[Minimum Workplace Safety Directive 1989]] 89/654/EC

===Pensions===
While there is no [[wage regulation]], the [[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]] requires that pension benefits are protected through a national insurance fund, that information is provided to beneficiaries, and minimum standards of governance are observed.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:02003L0041-20130620 arts 11–12, 17–18]&lt;/ref&gt; These include protecting the "pension promise" of employers in the event of business trouble, and require minimum standards of funding. Most member states go far beyond these requirements, particularly by requiring a vote for employees in who manages their money.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Pensions Act 2004]] ss 241–243&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Insolvency Protection Directive]] 2008/94/EC&lt;ref&gt;80/987/EEC&lt;/ref&gt; article 8
*''[[Robins v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]]'' (2007) C-278/05, the member state pension guarantee institution must reimburse at much more than 20% of pension

Since the [[global financial crisis]] beginning in 2007, the EU acted to create a network of transnational financial regulators in an attempt to prevent the undercutting of standards by countries competing on low regulation. One of these is the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]], which replaced a committee known as the "Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors". 
*[[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority Regulation]] [https://eiopa.europa.eu/fileadmin/tx_dam/files/Legal_Framework/EIOPA-Regulation.pdf 1094/2010]

==Collective representation==
{{see also|Codetermination|Collective bargaining}}
The EU is formally not enabled to legislate on [[collective bargaining]], although the EU, with all member states, is bound by the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ECHR]] art 11. This codified traditions in democratic member states before [[World War Two]]. See for example ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1941] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1941/2.html UKHL 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory governance===
[[File:Oxford University, Radcliffe Camera, a Reading room of Bodleian library.jpg|thumb|right|A majority of EU countries have legislation, including the [[Oxford University Act 1854]], which protect employees' right to vote for a corporation's management. This is reflected in the [[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]] for [[European Companies]].]]
If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the [[European Company Regulation 2001]], employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing [[Codetermination|board participation]] laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards.

*[[Employee Involvement Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0086:EN:NOT 2001/86/EC]
*[[European Company Regulation]]

===Information and consultation===
The [[Information and Consultation Directive 2002]] requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected [[work councils]] with a range of binding rights, the [[European Works Council Directive 2009]] enables [[work councils]] transnationally, and the [[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]] requires representation of workers on company boards in some [[European Companies]]. In total, the requirement to inform and consult the workforce (negotiate with a view to agreement) is found in four directives.

*[[European Works Council Directive]] 2009/38/EC{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} art 6(3)
*[[Information and Consultation Directive]] 2002/14/EC art 4(2)
*[[Business Transfers Directive]] 2001/23/EC art 7
*[[Collective_Redundancies_Directive_1998|Collective Redundancies Directive]] 98/59/EC art 2

===Collective bargaining===
Theoretically, only the European Court of Human Rights should have competence to decide issues related to collective bargaining and industrial action, as the European Union treaties do not confer competence on the EU to legislate on such issues. The ECHR's scope extends to collective bargaining given the right to freedom of association under article 11. In ''[[Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] ECHR 552&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECHR|Court]] held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in ''[[Demir and Baykara v Turkey]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2008] ECHR 1345&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECHR|Court]] held "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, become one of the essential elements" of article 11.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Demir and Baykara v Turkey]]'' [2008] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/1345.html ECHR 1345]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental [[right to strike]] in all democratic member states,&lt;ref&gt;See further ''[[Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey]]'' (2009) Application No 68959/01&lt;/ref&gt; has been seen as lying in tension with some of the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s previous case law, notably ''[[ITWF v Viking Line ABP]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2007) C-438/05&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(2007) C-319/05, and C-319/06&lt;/ref&gt; These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. The [[Rome I Regulation]]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services.

==Equality==
{{Clist eu equality}}
Beyond the general principle of equality in [[EU law]], six main Directives protect basic equality rights in EU law. The rules are not consolidated, and on gender pay potentially limited in not enabling a hypothetical comparator, or comparators in outsourced business. Equality rules do not yet apply to child care rights, which only give women substantial time off, and consequently hinder equality in men and women caring for children after birth, and pursuing their careers.

===General principle===
The principle of equality regardless of status is a fundamental value in all European member states, and constitutes a core principle that pervades the objectives of every institution. [[Social equality|Equality]] was affirmed by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] in ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2010) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62007CJ0555 C-555/07]&lt;/ref&gt; to be a general principle of EU law.

*''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' (2010) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62007J0555:EN:HTML C-555/07]

This is reflected in a number of TFEU provisions.

*Article 8 (ex Article 3(2) [[Treaty establishing the European Community|TEC]]) "In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women."
*Article 10, "In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall aim to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."

===Protected grounds===
The [[Race Equality Directive 2000]], [[Equality Framework Directive 2000]] and [[Equal Treatment Directive 2006]] prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, age, race and gender. As well as "direct discrimination", there is a prohibition on "indirect discrimination" where employers apply a neutral rule to everybody, but this has a disproportionate impact on the protected group.

*[[Equality Framework Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0078:EN:HTML 2000/78/EC]
*[[Race Equality Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:EN:HTML 2000/48/EC]
*[[Equal Treatment Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0054:EN:NOT 2006/54/EC]

===Atypical workers===
The [[Part-time Work Directive 1997]], [[Fixed-term Work Directive 1999]] and [[Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008]] generally require that people who do not have ordinary full-time, permanent contracts are treated no less favourably than their colleagues. However, the scope of the protected worker is left to member state law, and the [[TAWD 2008]] only applies to "basic working conditions" (mostly pay, working hours and participation rights) and enabled member states to have a qualifying period.

==Job security==
Minimum [[job security]] rights are provided by three Directives. There are further norms in the Treaties which aspire to create a high level of employment in the EU.

===Business restructuring===
The [[Collective Redundancies Directive 1998]] specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The [[Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001]] require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the [[Insolvency Protection Directive 2008]] requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to ''[[Francovich v Italy]]'', where the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990CJ0006:EN:HTML C-6/90]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unemployment===

[[File:Unemployment rate United states - Europe 1993-2009.svg|thumb|left|US and EU unemployment rates, 1993–2009.]]
Today, the EU is required under [[TFEU]] article 147 to contribute to a "high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States".&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_IX:_Employment#Article_147 art 147]&lt;/ref&gt; This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the [[European Central Bank]]'s [[monetary policy]] has been acutely controversial during the [[Eurozone crisis]]. The EU undertakes ad-hoc initiatives to combat unemployment, but only indirectly through better regulation. It does not have any specific fiscal stimulus programme, outside funds used for general regional development.

*[[TFEU]] Article 9, "In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6404">{{Foreign alliances of France}}
{{Events leading to World War II}}
The '''Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance''' was a bilateral [[treaty]] between the two countries with the aim of enveloping [[Nazi Germany]] in 1935 in order to reduce the threat from central Europe. It was pursued by [[Louis Barthou]], the French foreign minister, but he was assassinated in October 1934, before negotiations were finished. His successor, [[Pierre Laval]], was skeptical of both the desirability and the value of an alliance with the [[Soviet Union]]. However, after the declaration of [[German re-armament|German rearmament]] in March 1935 the French government forced the reluctant foreign minister to complete the arrangements with Moscow that Barthou had begun. The pact was concluded in Paris on May 2, 1935 and ratified by the French government in February 1936. Ratifications were exchanged in Moscow on March 27, 1936, and the pact went into effect on the same day. It was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on April 18, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%20167/v167.pdf vol. 167], pp. 396-406.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 1935, France and the USSR concluded the pact of mutual assistance. Laval had taken the precaution of ensuring that the bilateral treaty agreement was strictly compatible with the multilateral provisions of the [[League of Nations Covenant]] and [[Locarno Treaties]]. What this meant in practice was that military assistance could be rendered by one signatory to the other only after an allegation of [[casus belli|unprovoked aggression]] had been submitted to the League and only after prior approval of the other signatories of the Locarno pact (the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]]) had been attained. The effectiveness of this pact was undermined even further by the French government's insistent refusal to accept a military convention stipulating the way in which the two armies would coordinate actions in the event of war with Germany.

The pact was no longer what [[Louis Barthou]] had originally planned, but it remained to serve the purpose of acting as a hollow diplomatic threat of war on two fronts for Germany, should Germany pursue an aggressive [[foreign policy]]. Most of the Locarno powers felt that it would only act as a means of dragging them into a suicidal war with Germany for Russia's benefit. It marked a large scale shift in Soviet policy in the Seventh Congress of the Comintern from a pro-revisionist stance against the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to a more western-oriented foreign policy as championed by [[Maxim Litvinov]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] justified the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] by the ratification of the treaty in the French parliament, claiming that he felt threatened by the pact. Former World War I [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] stated in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] that Hitler's actions in the wake of this pact were fully justified, and he would have been a traitor to Germany if he had not protected his country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1936-07-27a.1207.1 House of Commons, July 27, 1936]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty contents==
;Article 1
:In the event that France or the U.S.S.R. are subjected to the threat or the danger of aggression on the part of a European state, the U.S.S.R. and France engage themselves reciprocally to proceed to an immediate mutual consultation on measures to take in order to observe the provisions of Article 10 of the League of Nations Pact.

;Article 2
:In the event that, in the circumstances described in Article 15, paragraph 7, of the League of Nations Pact, France or the U.S.S.R. may be, in spite of the genuinely pacific intentions of the two countries, and subject of unprovoked aggression on the part of a European state, the U.S.S.R. and France will immediately lend each other reciprocal aid and assistance.

;Article 3
:Taking into consideration the fact that, according to Article 16 of the League of Nations Pact, every member of the League that resorts to war contrary to the engagements assumed in Articles 12, 13 or 15 of the Pact is ''ipso facto'' considered as having committed an act of war against all the other members of the League, France and the U.S.S.R. engage themselves reciprocally, [should either of them be the object of unprovoked aggression], to lend immediate aid and assistance in activating the application of Article 16 of the Pact.
:The same obligation is assumed in the event that either France or the U.S.S.R. is the object of aggression on the part of a European state in the circumstances described in Article 17, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the League of Nations Pact.
	
'''''Protocole de Signature'''''
;Article 1
:It is understood that the effect of Article 3 is to oblige each Contracting Party to lend immediate assistance to the other in conforming immediately to the recommendations of the Council of the League of Nations as soon as they are announced under Article 16 of the Pact.  It equally understood that the two Contracting Parties will act in concert to elicit the recommendations of the Council with all the celerity that circumstances require and that, if nevertheless, the Council, for any reason whatever, does not make any recommendation or does not arrive at a unanimous decision, the obligation of assistance will nonetheless be implemented....

Not all [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] have [[Ratification|ratified]] the convention; notably, the [[United States]] has [[United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS|signed, but not ratified the convention]].

==History==
Until the [[early modern period]], [[Admiralty law|international maritime law]] was governed by customs that were sometimes codified:  as for example in the 14th-century Catalan ''[[Consulate of the Sea]]'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Consolat de mar''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Consolato del mare''; also known in English as the ''Customs of the Sea''). Such customs governed cases in [[prize court]]s about the capture of goods on the high seas by [[privateer]]s. This rule can be distilled from the ''Consolato'' (and other contemporary codes): "enemy goods can be captured on neutral ships and neutral goods are [[FOB (shipping)|free on board]] enemy's ships." The first part of the rule implies that neutral shipping is not inviolable in time of war, but the second part implies that goods of neutral owners are. The former contradicts what is now called "freedom of navigation." The doctrine, which hereafter will be referred to as the ''consolato'' rule for short, was long observed by [[England]] (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]), [[France]], and [[Spain]], as major naval powers.&lt;ref&gt;Atherley-Jones, pp. 284&amp;ndash;285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, beginning in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Republic]], the dominant European carrier, championed a different rule, known as "a free ship [makes] free goods." This meant that even enemy goods, always excepting [[contraband]], were inviolate in neutral bottoms (i.e. hulls),{{ref|a}} but sometimes the corollary of the rule was that neutral goods carried by enemy ships could be confiscated. The first part of the rule, however, makes neutral ships inviolable and so is the core of the freedom-of-navigation doctrine. 

As the doctrine went against international custom, it had to be embodied in bilateral treaties to become part of international law. The earliest example of such a treaty is actually one concluded between king [[Henry IV of France]] and the [[Ottoman Porte]] in 1609, but that was followed in 1612 by one between the Porte and the Dutch Republic. Once the [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the Dutch Republic had ended during which Spain defended their claim of sovereignty over the oceans against the Dutch claim of "freedom of the high seas," as developed in [[Hugo Grotius]]' [[Mare Liberum]], the two concluded a treaty of commerce in which "free ship, free goods" was enshrined. The Dutch Republic subsequently concluded bilateral treaties with most other European countries, containing the "free ship, free goods" principle, but it sometimes had to use force to obtain that concession, as against England in the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]] and again in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)]]. England, however, also held fast to the ''consolato'' rule in relations with other countries, as did France, until in 1744 it relented and extended the privilege to the neutral Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Atherley-Jones, pp. 286&amp;ndash;287&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch had also, by using treaty law, built up a web of bilateral treaties that extended the privilege of "freedom of navigation" to their ships. During the many 18th-century European wars they remained neutral, serving all belligerents with their shipping services. Great Britain, in particular, chafed under the arrangement, as it was the dominant naval power in the 18th century, and the Dutch privilege undermined the effectiveness of its naval blockades. Matters came to a head during the [[War of the American Revolution]], when the Dutch, shielded by the 1674 Anglo-Dutch treaty, supplied both the Americans and the French. The British made extensive use of their "right of search" of Dutch ships, which led to the [[Affair of Fielding and Bylandt]] by which a British naval squadron, in peacetime, arrested a Dutch convoy despite the objections of its Dutch naval escort.

Soon afterward, the British abrogated the 1674 treaty, which might have meant the death of the "free ship, free goods" doctrine, but Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] had taken up the torch around the same time. In March 1780, she published a manifesto in which (among other things) she claimed the "free ship, free goods" principle, as a fundamental right of [[neutral state]]s. To defend that principle, she formed the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]] to which the Dutch adhered at the end of the year (which sparked the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]). The principles from her manifesto were soon adhered to by the members of the League and by France, Spain and the new American Republic also (even if, as belligerents, they could not become members of the League).&lt;ref&gt;Atherley-Jones, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as a principle of international law (apart from treaty law) "free ship, free goods" was soon again overturned by the practice of both sides in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of the turn of the 19th century. For instance, in the jurisprudence of the American courts of the early 19th-century, the ''consolato'' principle was universally applied in cases not covered by treaties. On the other hand, the US government made it a steadfast practice to enshrine the "free ship, free goods" principle in the treaties of amity and commerce it concluded with other countries (starting with the 1778 one with France and the 1782 one with the Dutch Republic).

In other words, the American view (following the British practice) was that at that time ''consolato'' was customary international law, which, however, could be superseded by treaty law on a bilateral basis. The US, however, earnestly strove for the substitution of ''consolato'' by "free ship" in customary law also.&lt;ref&gt;Atherley-Jones, pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt;

That state of affairs came about when Britain finally gave up its resistance to the principles, first formulated by Empress Catherine in 1780, and acquiesced in the 1856 [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law]], which enshrined "free ship makes free goods" and rejecting "enemy ship makes enemy goods." The Declaration was signed by the major powers (except the US) and it was soon adhered to by most other powers. The new rule (a combination of the "best" parts of ''Consolato'' and "free ship") became that a "neutral flag covers enemy's goods (except contraband); neutral goods are not liable to seizure under the enemy's flag."&lt;ref&gt;Atherley-Jones, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the new principle became part of the broader body of laws of the sea currently embodied in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (1982), as [[Woodrow Wilson]] advocated in Point 2 of his [[Fourteen Points]] (see [[Freedom of the seas]]). The US has not ratified the 1982 treaty, but it is a party to the preceding 1958 [[Convention on the High Seas]]. As the reason for nonratification is not related to the principle of freedom of navigation, which the US now considers to be part of customary international law, it does not imply that the US does not consider itself bound by the principle.

===United States "Freedom of Navigation" program===
The [[United States]] Freedom of Navigation (FON) program challenges territorial claims on the world's oceans and airspace. The position of the United States is that all nations must obey the international law of the sea, as codified in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070515-2.html President's Statement on Advancing U.S. Interests in the World's Oceans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/16/joint-statement-us-asean-special-leaders-summit-sunnylands-declaration Joint Statement of the U.S.-ASEAN Special Leaders’ Summit: Sunnylands Declaration], [[White House Office of the Press Secretary]] (February 16, 2016): "Shared commitment to ...ensuring maritime security and safety, including the rights of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful maritime commerce as described in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) ... &lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of State]] writes: 

{{quote|U.S. policy since 1983 provides that the United States will exercise and assert its navigation and overflight rights and freedoms on a worldwide basis in a manner that is consistent with the balance of interests reflected in the Law of the Sea (LOS) Convention. The United States will not, however, acquiesce in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight and other related high seas uses. The FON Program since 1979 has highlighted the navigation provisions of the LOS Convention to further the recognition of the vital national need to protect maritime rights throughout the world. The FON Program operates on a triple track, involving not only diplomatic representations and operational assertions by U.S. military units, but also bilateral and multilateral consultations with other governments in an effort to promote maritime stability and consistency with international law, stressing the need for and obligation of all States to adhere to the customary international law rules and practices reflected in the LOS Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/e/oes/ocns/opa/maritimesecurity/ Maritime Security and Navigation], [[United States Department of State]] (accessed October 3, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American position is somewhat complicated by the fact that the U.S. is not a signatory to UNCLOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=“Freedom of Navigation Assertions: The United States as the World’s Policeman|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|date=2016|volume=42|issue=3|pages=501-517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. armed forces have conducted FON operations in areas claimed by other countries but considered by the U.S. to be international waters, such as [[Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986)|naval operations]] in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] in the 1980s;&lt;ref&gt;James Gerstrenzang, [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-28/news/mn-624_1_u-s-navy U.S. Navy Ends Maneuvers in Gulf of Sidra], ''Los Angeles times'' (March 28, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in strategically important [[strait]]s (such as [[Strait of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]], and [[Straits of Malacca|Malacca]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nilufer Oral, [https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/16/issue/16/transit-passage-rights-strait-hormuz-and-iran%E2%80%99s-threats-block-passage Transit Passage Rights in the Strait of Hormuz and Iran's Threats to Block the Passage of Oil Tankers], ''Insights'', Vol. 16, [[American Society of International Law]] (May 3, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the notable operations conducted as [[innocent passage]] and part of Freedom of Navigation program&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, "USS ''Caron''’s Black Sea Scrape Furthered International Law, National Interest", ''The Virginias-Pilot and The Ledger Star'', June 12, 1988, at C3, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; was performed by [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'']], during which, on February 12, 1988 she was [[1988 Black Sea bumping incident|"nudged"]] by  Soviet frigate ''Bezzavetnyy'' in an attempt to divert the vessel out of Soviet territorial waters.

==South China Sea==
Beginning in October 2015, as part of the U.S. FON Operations (FONOP) program, U.S. Navy ships have patrolled near the artificial islands China has created in the [[Spratly Islands dispute|disputed]] [[Spratly Islands|Spratly archipelago]] to underscore the U.S.'s position that the artificial islands constructed by China are located in international waters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Green, Bonnie Glaser &amp; Gregory Poling, [https://amti.csis.org/the-u-s-asserts-freedom-of-navigation-in-the-south-china-sea/ The U.S. Asserts Freedom of Navigation in the South China Sea], Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (October 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LowyThird"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2016/05/10/US-Navy-carries-out-third-FONOP-in-South-China-Sea.aspx|title=US Navy carries out third FONOP in South China Sea|website=The Interpreter|publisher=[[Lowy Institute for International Policy]]|date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[guided-missile destroyer]] [[USS Lassen (DDG-82)|USS ''Lassen'']] sailed within 12 nautical miles of reclaimed-land islands (the so-called "[[Great Wall of Sand]]") in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Shalal &amp; David Brunnstrom, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-usa-idUSKCN0SK2AC20151026 U.S. Navy destroyer nears islands built by China in South China Sea], Reuters (October 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-usa-idUSKCN0SK2AC20151027 Angry China shadows U.S. warship near man-made islands], (October 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34647651 China says US warship's Spratly islands passage 'illegal'], BBC News (October 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Two other U.S. ships have followed: the [[USS Curtis Wilbur|USS ''Wilbur Curtis'']] sailed within 12 nautical miles of [[Triton Island]] in the [[Paracel Islands]] in January 2016, and the [[USS William P.

In spring 2017, the Trump administration stopped FON in the South China Sea hoping China might increase its pressure on [[North Korea]] that is [[2017 North Korean missile tests|launching missile tests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-gpf-90np5 FAZ.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Japan sent its [[Izumo-class helicopter destroyer|Izumo helicopter carrier]] on a three-month tour of the South China Sea, marking Japan’s biggest foray into the region since the Second World War.&lt;ref name=IISS/&gt; 

In April 2018, three Australian naval vessels transited the South China Sea towards Vietnam and, along the way, met a ‘robust’ challenge from the Chinese navy.&lt;ref name=IISS/&gt;

A '''grant-in-aid''' is money coming from central government for a specific project. This kind of funding is usually used when the government and parliament have decided that the recipient should be [[public funding|publicly funded]] but operate with reasonable independence from the [[State (polity)|state]].

In the United Kingdom, most bodies in receipt of grants-in-aid are [[non-departmental public body|non-departmental public bodies]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A grant-in-aid is funds allocated by one level of government to another level of government to be used for specific purposes. Such funds are usually accompanied by requirements and standards set by the governing body for how they are to be spent. An example of this would be how the [[United States Congress]] required states to raise the drinking age for alcohol from 18 to 21 in order for the individual states to continue to qualify for federal funds for [[interstate highway]]s located within each state.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Gerhard; Woolley, John T.

Indiana|link=|volume=414|page=105|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] which reaffirmed and clarified the [[imminent lawless action]] test first articulated in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]''. "''Hess'' continues to be cited by the courts to protect speech that threatens future lawless action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fighting words: ''Hess v.

==Background==
The case involved an antiwar protest on the campus of [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. Between 100 and 150 protesters were in the streets. The sheriff and his deputies then proceeded to clear the streets of the protestors. As the sheriff was passing Gregory Hess, one of the members of the crowd, Hess uttered, "We'll take the fucking street later" or "We'll take the fucking street again." Hess was convicted in Indiana state court of disorderly conduct.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court reversed Hess's conviction because the statement at worst "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time. This is not sufficient to permit the State to punish Hess' speech."&lt;ref&gt;''Hess'', 414 U.S. at 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of High Andean Flamingos and their Habitats''' is a multilateral environmental [[memorandum of understanding]] that was concluded under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. The MoU came into effect on 4 December 2008 and provides protection for the populations of high Andean flamingos, which have been subject to drastic reduction and fragmentation of their habitats and have a delicate state of conservation. The MoU covers four range states (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru). As of August 2012, three range states have signed the MoU.

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:Andean flamingo.jpg|thumb|300px|Flamingos foraging in an altiplano lake in Southwest Bolivia]]
To implement the decision of the Fifth Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the high [[Andean flamingo]] (''Phoenicopterus andinus'' and ''P. jamesi'') on Appendix I of the Convention due to its poor state of conservation caused by a drastic reduction and fragmentation of their habitats, an Article IV agreement was concluded and entered into effect on 4 December 2008, following the signature by the third range state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3772&lt;/ref&gt;

Signatories to the High Andean Flamingos MoU:
* Bolivia (4 December 2008)
* Chile (4 December 2008)
* Peru (4 December 2008)

In addition, the CMS Secretariat also signed the MoU.

== Aim of MoU ==
Taking into consideration that the major threats that cause the population of the high Andean flamingo are amongst others the fragility of the high Andean wetlands and the impact caused by human activities such as fresh water contamination caused by the mining industry, the overexploitation of ground water, water treatment projects, the modification of natural river courses for agricultural purposes, unregulated tourism, extraction of eggs and destruction of colonies as well as inadequate management of grazing on the flood plains of the high Andean steppes, the MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species and their habitats through coordinated and concerted actions across the range states.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU protects two species of Andean flamingos, ''Phoenicopterus andinus'' and ''Phoenicopterus jamesi'', both listed on Appendix I of the CMS Convention.

== Fundamental components ==
[[File:Map of Signatories to the High Andean Flamingos Memorandum of Understanding.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of signatories to the High Andean Flamingos MoU, as of 15 August 2012]]
All signatories agree to undertake steps to conserve the high Andean flamingo throughout their range. To this end they will:&lt;ref&gt;Text of High Andean Flamingos Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/flamingos/MoU_Andean_Flamingos_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide effective protection for the population of the high Andean flamingos, and for the habitats upon which they depend to complete their entire lifecycle
# Develop an action plan to protect the species and their habitats, which will guide the conservation actions of the signatories and, which should include measures to promote co-ordination of these actions, international cooperation, improving the knowledge of the species, management, research, awareness and the exchange of information among the signatories
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and action plan at regular meetings of representatives of each of the signatories, and persons or organizations technically qualified in the conservation of these species
# Provide the secretariat with a regular report on their implementation of the MoU and action plan

The MoU took effect immediately after the third signatory (4 December 2008) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all other signatories.

== Meetings ==
The secretariat shall convene regular meetings of signatories to review the population status of the high Andean flamingos and assess the implementation of the MoU.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. The main tasks of the secretariat are organizing the meeting of signatories and providing overview reports of progress made to implement the MoU and its action plan, compiled on the basis of all information available. Furthermore, the secretariat also acts as the depositary.

== Action plan ==
An action plan provides a road map to guide the implementation of conservation actions for the high Andean flamingo in the range states and will be prepared by the signatories, supported by the CMS Secretariat. It will include measures to promote co-ordination of conservation actions, international cooperation, improving the knowledge on the species, management, research, awareness and the exchange of information among the signatories.

== Activities and successes ==
In 2011, CMS and Centro de Estudios en Biología Teórica y Aplicada (BIOTA – Center for Studies in Theoretical and Applied Biology) in Bolivia agreed to cooperate on a large project to monitor the two species of high Andean flamingos (''Phonicopterus andinus'' and ''Phonicopterus jamesi'') within the framework of the MoU and with funding through the CMS Small Grants Programme (SGP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2012/04_apr/nw_250412_flamingos_e.htm ; http://www.cms.int/publications/Bulletin/2012_05_06_e.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt; The objective was to monitor population and their breeding colonies in order to know the current conservation status of these populations and establish the trends of the breeding colonies. Furthermore, the data obtained will be the basis for developing a programme to monitor and protect the species in the future. Monitoring activities started in August 2011 to study reproduction and active nesting sites, count the flamingo’s breeding colonies in priority sites, and identify the principal threats to their conservation, and ended on 31 May 2012.

The monitoring data obtained suggest breeding success of the high Andean flamingos in Bolivia and Argentina in 2011-2012. Some of the results of the monitoring programme were the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2012/04_apr/nw_250412_flamingos_e.htm ; http://www.cms.int/publications/Bulletin/2012_05_06_e.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2012, BIOTA and Yuchan Foundation simultaneously carried out a census of both of the above-mentioned flamingo species in the wetlands of Jujuy and Catamarca in Argentina and southwest Potosí in Bolivia, more than 80 sites altogether. The data collected, suggests that these ecosystems were home to 93 per cent of the entire global population of Phonicopterus jamesi flamingos and 48.7 per cent of the entire Phonicopterus andinus population.
* During the November 2011 to April 2012 breeding period, high Andean flamingos were monitored in 28 wetlands of Southwest [[Potosí, Bolivia]], in an area located in the “Los Lípez”, a Ramsar site located between 4,200 and 6,000 metres above sea level on the Bolivian plateau.
* As of February 2012, a total of 16,106 chicks of the two flamingo species were hatched at five lakes (Capina, Khara, Cachi, Colorada and Guayaques), which included 14,697 chicks hatched on Lake Colorada. This supports the assumption that this flamingo breeding period will be quite successful compared with the breeding period 2010-2011 when only 600 juveniles were recorded at [[Lake Colorada]].

The '''Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876''', also known as the '''Japan-Korea Treaty of Amity''' in Japanese or '''Treaty of Ganghwa Island''' in Korean, was made between representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]] and the Korean [[Joseon|Kingdom of Joseon]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Young-lob. (2005). {{Google books|3h080YYhS3QC|''Korea Under Siege, 1876–1945: Capital Formation and Economic Transformation,'' p. 42.|page=42}}; excerpt, "''... the initial opening of Korea's borders to the outside world came in the form of the Korea-Japan Treaty of Amity (the so-called Ganghwa Treaty)''."&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were concluded on February 26, 1876.&lt;ref name="mission35"&gt;Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921–1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal,'' p. 33.|page=33}}; excerpt, "Treaty between Japan and Korea, dated February 26, 1876."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Ascendancy of the Daewongun===
In January 1864, [[Cheoljong of Joseon|King Cheoljong]] died without an heir and [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, King Gojong was too young and the new king's father, Yi Ha-ŭng, became the Daewongun or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son's name.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=279}} Originally the term Daewongun referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=279}} The Daewongun initiated reforms to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the ''[[yangban]]'' class.

Even before the nineteenth century, the Koreans had only maintained diplomatic relations with its [[suzerain]], China, and with neighboring Japan. Foreign trade was mainly limited to China, conducted at designated locations along the Korean-Manchurian border{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} and with Japan, through the Waegwan in Pusan.{{sfn|Seth|2011|p=193}} By the mid-nineteenth century Westerners had come to refer to Korea as the ''Hermit Kingdom''.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=279}} The Daewongun was determined to continue Korea's traditional isolationist policy and to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} The disastrous events occurring in China, including the [[First Opium War|First]] (1840–1842) and [[Second Opium War|Second Opium wars]] (1856{{ndash}}1860), reinforced his determination to separate Korea from the rest of the world.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}}

===Western Encroachment===
From the early to mid-nineteenth century, Western vessels began to make frequent appearances in Korean waters, surveying sea routes and seeking trade.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} The Korean government was extremely wary, referred to these vessels as ''strange-looking ships.''{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} Several incidents took place. In June 1832, a ship from the British India Company, the ''Lord Amherst'', appeared off the coast of [[Hwanghae Province]] seeking trade. In June 1845 another British warship, {{HMS|Samarang|1822|2}}, surveyed the coast of Cheju-do and Chŏlla province, the following month the Korean government filed a protest with British authorities in Guangzhou through the Chinese government.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} In June 1846, three French warships dropped anchor off the coast of [[Chungcheong Province]] and conveyed a letter protesting persecution of Catholics in the country.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} In April 1854, two armed Russian vessels sailed along the eastern coast of [[Hamgyong Province]], causing some deaths and injuries among the Koreans they encountered. Prompting the Korean government to issue a ban forbidding the people of the province from having any contact with foreign vessels. In January and July 1866, ships manned by the German adventurer Ernst J. Oppert appeared off the coast of Chungcheong Province, seeking trade.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=281}} In August 1866, an American merchant ship, the ''General Sherman'', appeared off the coast of [[Pyongan Province]], steaming along the [[Taedong River]] to the provincial capital of Pyongyang, and asked permission to trade. Local officials refused to enter into trade talks and demanded the ship's departure. A Korean official was then taken hostage aboard the ship, and its crew members fired guns at enraged Korean officials and civilians on the shore. The crew then came ashore, plundered the town, and killed seven Koreans. The governor of the province, Pak Kyu-su, ordered his forces to destroy the ship, and in the event the General Sherman ran aground on a sandbar and Korean forces burned the ship and killed the ship's entire crew of 23.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=282}} In 1866 after the execution of several of its Catholic missionaries and Korean Catholics, the French launched a [[French campaign against Korea|punitive expedition]] against Korea.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=282–283}} Five years later, in 1871, the Americans also launched [[United States expedition to Korea|an expedition to Korea]].{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=283–284}}  Despite this, the Koreans continued to adhere to isolationism and refused to negotiate to open up the country.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=284}}

===Japanese attempts to establish relations with Korea===
During the [[Edo period]], Japan's relations and trade with Korea were conducted through intermediaries with the [[Sō clan|Sō family]] in Tsushima.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=30}} A Japanese outpost, called the ''waegwan'', was allowed to be maintained in Tongnae near Pusan. The traders were confined to the outpost and no Japanese were allowed to travel to the Korean capital at Seoul.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=30}} In the aftermath of the Meiji restoration, during late 1868, a member of the Sō daimyō informed the Korean authorities that a new government had been established and an envoy would be sent from Japan.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=30}} In 1869 the envoy from the Meiji government arrived in Korea carrying a letter requesting to establish a goodwill mission between the two countries;{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=30}} the letter contained the seal of the Meiji government rather than the seals authorized by the Korean Court for the Sō family to use.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} It also used the character ''ko'' (皇) rather than ''taikun'' (大君) to refer to the Japanese emperor.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} The Koreans only used this character to refer to the Chinese emperor and to the Koreans it implied ceremonial superiority to the Korean monarch which would make the Korean monarch a vassal or subject of the Japanese ruler.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} The Japanese were however just reacting to their domestic political situation where the Shogun had been replaced by the emperor. The Koreans remained in the sinocentric world where China was at the centre of interstate relations and as a result refused to receive the envoy.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} The bureau of foreign affairs wanted to change these arrangements to one based on modern state-to-state relations.{{sfn|Jansen|2002|p=362}}

==Ganghwa incident==
{{Main|Ganghwa Island incident}}
[[File:Unyogunboat.jpg|thumb|left|The Japanese gunboat ''[[Japanese gunboat Un'yō|Un'yō]]'']]

In Korea, [[Heungseon Daewongun]], who instituted a policy of closing doors to European powers, was forced into retirement by his son [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and Gojong's wife, [[Queen Min]]. [[Second French Empire|France]] and the [[United States]] had already made several unsuccessful attempts to begin commerce with the Joseon dynasty during [[Heungseon Daewongun]]'s era. However, after he was removed from power, many new officials who supported the idea of opening commerce with foreigners took power. While there was political instability, Japan developed a plan to open and exert influence on Korea before a European power could. In 1875, their plan was put into action: the [[Japanese gunboat Un'yō|''Un'yō'']], a small Japanese warship under the command of [[Inoue Yoshika]], was dispatched to present a show of force and survey coastal waters without Korean permission.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6114963|title=The last phase of the East Asian world order : Korea, Japan, and the Chinese Empire, 1860–1882|last=Key-Hiuk.|first=Kim,|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=0520035569|location=Berkeley|pages=205–209, 228, 231|oclc=6114963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, the ship reached [[Ganghwa Island]], which had been a site of violent confrontations between Korean forces and foreign forces in the previous decade. In 1866, the island was briefly [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|occupied by the French]], and also in 1871 subject to [[Sinmiyangyo|American intervention]]. The memories of those confrontations were very fresh, and there was little question that the Korean garrison would shoot at any approaching foreign ship. Nonetheless, Commander Inoue ordered a small boat launched – allegedly in search of drinkable water. The Korean forts opened fire. The ''Un'yō'' brought its superior firepower to bear and silenced the Korean guns. Then it attacked another Korean fort on [[Yeongjongdo|Yeongjong Island]] and withdrew back to Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treaty provisions==
[[File:Japan Korea Treaty of Amity 26 February 1876.jpg|thumb|Japan–Korea Treaty of Amity, February 26, 1876, [[Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Diplomatic Record Office of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|alt=]]

Japan employed [[gunboat diplomacy]] to press Korea to sign this [[unequal treaty]]. The pact opened up Korea, as Commodore Matthew Perry's fleet of [[Black Ships]] had opened up Japan in 1853. According to the treaty, it ended Joseon's status as a [[tributary state]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and opened three ports to Japanese trade. The Treaty also granted the Japanese people many of the same rights in Korea that Westerners enjoyed in Japan, such as [[extraterritoriality]].

The chief treaty negotiators were [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]], Director of the [[Hokkaidō Colonization Office]], and [[Shin Heon]], General/Minister of Joseon-dynasty Korea.

The articles of the treaty were as follows:
*Article 1 stated that Korea was a free nation, "an independent state enjoying the same sovereign rights as does Japan". The Japanese statement is in an attempt to detach Korea once and for all from its traditional tributary relationship with China.
*Article 2 stipulated that Japan and Korea would exchange envoys within fifteen months and permanently maintain diplomatic missions in each country. The Japanese would confer with the Ministry of Rites; the Korean envoy would be received by the Foreign Office.
*Under Article 3, Japan would use the Japanese and Chinese languages in diplomatic communiques, while Korea would use only Chinese.
*Article 4 terminated Tsushima's centuries-old role as a diplomatic intermediary by abolishing all agreements then existing between Korea and Tsushima.
*In addition to the open port of [[Pusan]], Article 5 authorized the search in [[Kyongsang]], [[Kyonggi]], [[Chungcheong]], [[Jeolla Province|Cholla]], and [[Hamgyong]] provinces for two more suitable seaports for Japanese trade to be opened in October 1877.
*Article 6 secured aid and support for ships stranded or wrecked along the Korea or Japanese coasts.
*Article 7 permitted any Japanese mariner to conduct surveys and mapping operations at will in the seas off the Korean Peninsula's coastline.
*Article 8 permitted Japanese merchants residence, unhindered trade, and the right to lease land and buildings for those purposes in the open ports.
*Article 9 guaranteed the freedom to conduct business without interference from either government and to trade without restrictions or prohibitions.
*Article 10 granted Japan the right of extraterritoriality, the one feature of previous Western treaties that was most widely resented in Asia. It not only gave foreigners a free rein to commit crimes with relative impunity, but its inclusion implied the grantor nation's system of law was either primitive, unjust, or both.

==Aftermath==
[[File:KanfadoKantai.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], in Pusan, on its way to [[Ganghwa Island]], Korea, January 16th, 1876. There were 2 warships (''Nisshin'', ''[[Japanese warship Moshun|Moshun]]''), 3 troop transports, and one liner for the embassy led by [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]].]]
[[File:GatlingGangwa.jpg|thumb|350px|Four [[Gatling gun]]s set up in Ganghwa by Japanese troops, 1876 Kuroda mission]]

The following year saw a Japanese fleet led by Special Envoy [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]] coming over to Joseon, demanding an apology from the Korean government and a commercial treaty between the two nations. The Korean government decided to accept the demand, in hope of importing some technologies to defend the country from any future invasions.

However, the treaty would eventually turn out to be the first of many unequal treaties signed by Korea; It gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, and forced the Korean government to open 3 ports to Japan, specifically [[Busan]], [[Incheon]] and [[Wonsan]]. With the signing of its first unequal treaty, Korea became vulnerable to the influence of imperialistic powers; and later the treaty led Korea to be [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed by Japan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5442">The K.K. Luthra Memorial Moot Court was started in 2005 in the memory of late Senior Advocate Mr. K.K. Luthra. This is the only international criminal law moot court held in India and has seen participation from top law colleges in India and abroad.&lt;ref name=LI1&gt;{{cite news|title=In Conversation with winners of 12th K.K Luthra Memorial Moot Court Competition|url=http://www.livelaw.in/conversation-winners-12th-k-k-luthra-memorial-moot-court-competition/|accessdate=14 Jan 2016|newspaper=Legally India|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held every year in January at the [[Faculty of Law, University of Delhi#Campus Law Centre|Campus Law Centre]] in [[Delhi University]].

The competition is named after late Senior Advocate Mr. K.K. Luthra who was an eminent criminal lawyer and appeared in various trial courts, High Courts and the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a variety of matters during his legal career spanning 49 years. He was designated as a Senior Advocate of the [[Delhi High Court]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=MC1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kkluthramoot.org/moot/profile/ |title= Profile |access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long tenure at the Bar, he was the lead defence counsel in many important cases like the [[Baroda dynamite case|Baroda Dynamite Case]], the [[Lalit Narayan Mishra#Assassination| L.N. Mishra murder case]], Classik Computers Case, St. Kitts Case, the Coomar Narain Espionage Case and in the post-Emergency [[Shah Commission]].&lt;ref name=MC1/&gt;

==Eligibility==
Only one team is allowed to register from any college or law school. The members of the team should be undergraduate law students. The team should comprise two speakers or two speakers and a researcher.&lt;ref name=MC2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kkluthramoot.org/moot/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Rules-of-the-Competition-2017.pdf |title= Rules of the Competition |access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moot Format==
The competition is held in two rounds. The first is a qualification round where the teams are required to submit a memorial for the applicant and the respondent. The teams that score seven more points out of a total of twenty points are invited to participate in the main moot court competition held at the Campus Law Centre in [[Delhi University]].&lt;ref name=MC2/&gt; In 2017, a total of sixty teams qualified to participate in the moot court competition.&lt;ref name = TH17&gt;{{cite news|title=Moot court at DU Law Centre from January 13|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Moot-court-at-DU-Law-Centre-from-January-13/article17020618.ece|accessdate= 14 January 2017|newspaper = The Hindu|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the moot court, the teams are given 30 minutes in the preliminary rounds to present oral arguments before the judges, both for the applicant and the respondent. The teams that win two preliminary rounds qualify for the octafinal rounds which is then succeeded by quarterfinal, semifinal and final rounds. The teams get 40 minutes for their presentations in the semifinal and final rounds.&lt;ref name=MC2/&gt; The participants are judged on their ability to correlate the facts of the alleged crime with the laws that it has been booked under and to use different authorities and precedents to build and support one's arguments. In addition to these skills, the participants also get points for the memorial they submitted and for their oration and advocacy skills.

==2017 Moot Court==
The idea behind 2017's moot court problem was to make participants argue whether or not the actions and speech of a particular political figure qualified as seditious and could be punishable with the death penalty.&lt;ref name=TH17/&gt;&lt;ref name = HT17&gt;{{cite news|title=Budding lawyers debate sedition and death penalty at moot court|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/budding-lawyers-debate-sedition-and-death-penalty-at-moot-court/story-Lkb17OXj32NWcoM5GAjNjO.html|accessdate= 15 January 2017|newspaper = Hindustan Times|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in a fictional democratic country Camelot which became independent in 1947 and adopted a federal constitution. A case of sedition was brought against a popular political leader of Camelot, Ms. Elizabeth Bennet, by the state government of Erehwon, the capital of Camelot. The teams had to argue the appeal which was pending before the Supreme Court of Camelot for final hearing.&lt;ref name=MC3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kkluthramoot.org/moot/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Moot-Problem-2017.pdf |title= Statement of Facts |access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 K.K. Luthra Memorial Moot Court competition was won by [[George Washington University]], USA, while the [[Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law]], Patiala, Punjab, bagged the second prize.&lt;ref name=PT17&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyers should help the poor: Justice Sikri|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/8293592_Lawyers-should-help-the-poor--Justice-Sikri.html|accessdate= 16 January 2017|newspaper = Press Trust of India|date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural address was delivered by [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judge, Justice [[Amitava Roy]] and the valedictory address was given by [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judge, Justice [[Arjan Kumar Sikri]].&lt;ref name=TH17/&gt;&lt;ref name=PT17/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30915">In the [[English law]] of [[homicide]], '''manslaughter''' is a less serious offence than [[murder in English law|murder]], the differential being between levels of fault based on the ''[[mens rea]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty mind") or by reason of a [[partial defence]]. In [[England and Wales]], the usual practice is to prefer a charge of murder, with the [[judge]] or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option (see [[lesser included offence]]). The [[jury]] then decides whether the [[defendant]] is guilty or not guilty of either murder or manslaughter. On conviction for manslaughter, sentencing is at the judge's discretion, whereas a sentence of [[life imprisonment]] is mandatory on conviction for murder. Manslaughter may be either ''voluntary'' or ''involuntary'', depending on whether the accused has the required ''mens rea'' for murder.

==Voluntary manslaughter==
''[[Voluntary manslaughter]]'' occurs when the defendant kills with ''[[mens rea]]'' (an [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill or cause [[grievous bodily harm]]), but one of those partial defences which reduce murder to manslaughter applies (these consist of mitigating circumstances which reduce the defendant's culpability). The original mitigating factors were [[Provocation in English law|provocation]] and [[chance medley]] which existed at [[common law]], but the former has been abolished by statute, the latter has been held no longer to exist&lt;ref&gt;''R v Semini'' [1949] 1 KB 405, 33 Cr App R 51, CCA&lt;/ref&gt; and new defences have been created by statute.

The [[Homicide Act 1957]] now provides two defences which may be raised to allow the court to find the accused guilty of voluntary manslaughter: diminished responsibility and suicide pact. The [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]] creates the defence of "loss of control".

===Diminished responsibility===
{{Main|Diminished responsibility in English law}}
{{See also|Diminished responsibility}}

Under section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 there are three requirements for the defendant to raise the defence of diminished responsibility. The defendant must have suffered from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing caused by one of the causes specified by the Act which substantially impaired the defendant’s mental responsibility for the killing. Under section 2(2) of the Act it is for the defendant to prove he suffered from such a condition on the balance of probabilities.

====Abnormality of mind====

An abnormality of mind has been defined by Lord Parker CJ "as state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal".&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;''R v Byrne'' [1960] 2 QB 396&lt;/ref&gt;  In deciding whether this state of mind exists the jury should consider medical evidence, but also all other evidence including acts and statements of the accused and his demeanour. The jury does not have to accept the medical evidence if other material conflicts with and outweighs it.

====Specified causes====

The Homicide Act specifies three causes one of which must cause the abnormality; they are a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind, any inherent cause or a disease or injury. Whether the abnormality is caused by one of the specified causes is a matter for medical evidence alone.&lt;ref name=Byrne/&gt; Alcoholism is capable of being an abnormality of mind even if there is no physical damage to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wood'' [2009] 1 W.L.R. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substantial impairment of mental responsibility====

Whether the abnormality substantially impaired the defendant’s mental responsibility for the killing is a question of degree for the jury. In ''R v Lloyd'' the Court of Appeal held that the lack of control must simply be ‘more than trivial’.&lt;ref&gt;[1967] 1 Q.B. 175 at 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Premenstrual tension (PMT) has been accepted as a mitigating factor in several high profile cases. In 1980, Sandie Smith was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing a barmaid. Dr. Katharina Dalton who examined Smith before the trial diagnosed her with severe [[Premenstrual syndrome|PMS]]. This diagnosis was accepted as a cause of diminished responsibility. Smith was sentenced to three years probation despite previous convictions for violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-96952-3| last1 = Collins| first1 = Lynn H.| last2 = Dunlap| first2 = Michelle R.| last3 = Chrisler| first3 = Joan C.| title = Charting a New Course for Feminist Psychology| date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of control===
See sections 54 and 55 of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]].

===Suicide pacts===
Section 4(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced the defence of suicide pact. Parliament's intention was to show some compassion for those who had been involved in a suicide pact but failed to die. Section 4(3) defines a suicide pact as "a common agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all of them, whether or not each is to take his own life". Further the accused must have had a "settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact" to avoid the accused entering into a supposed pact with the real intention of committing murder. The Law Commission has proposed abolishing the defence with deserving cases falling within diminished responsibility,&lt;ref&gt;Law Commission Consultation Paper No. 177, ''A New Homicide Act for England and Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; but feels it should be retained pending a review of a new partial defence of mercy killings.&lt;ref&gt;Law Commission Report No. 304, ''Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involuntary manslaughter==

[[Involuntary manslaughter]] arises where the accused did not intend to cause death or serious injury but caused the death of another through [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] or [[criminal negligence]]. For these purposes, recklessness is defined as a blatant disregard for the dangers of a particular situation. An example of this would be dropping a brick off a bridge, landing on a person's head, killing him. Since the intent is not to kill the victim, but simply to drop the brick, the ''mens rea'' required for murder does not exist because the act is not aimed at any one person. But if in dropping the brick, there is a good chance of injuring someone, the person who drops it will be reckless. This form of manslaughter is also termed "unlawful act" or "constructive" manslaughter.

===Manslaughter by gross negligence===
Under English law, where a person owes a duty of care (either by statute or by the neighbour principle&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562&lt;/ref&gt;) and is negligent to such a degree that consequently the law regards it as a crime&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Evans]]'' [2009] EWCA Crim 650&lt;/ref&gt; (namely the person has been grossly negligent) and that person causes the victim to die, she may be liable for gross negligence manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Adomako]]'' [1995] 1 AC 171&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants in such cases are often people carrying out jobs that require special skills or care, such as doctors, teachers, police or prison officers, or electricians, who fail to meet the standard which could be expected from a reasonable person of the same profession.&lt;ref&gt;''[[AG's Reference (No. 2 of 1999)]]'' [2000] QB 796 (Court of Appeal)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[R v Bateman]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Bateman]]'' (1925) 19 Cr App R 8, (1925) ? Cox 33, [1925] All ER Rep 45, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]. ''For an explanation of these abbreviations see [[Case citation]].''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] held that gross negligence manslaughter involved the following elements:
#the defendant owed a duty to the deceased to take care;
#the defendant breached this duty;
#the breach caused the death of the deceased; and
#the defendant's negligence was gross, that is, it showed such a disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime and deserve punishment.
The House of Lords in ''Seymour''&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Seymour]]'' [1983] 2 AC 493, [1983] 3 WLR 349, [1983] 2 All ER 1058, 77 Cr App R 215, [1983] RTR 455, [1983] Crim LR 742, [[House of Lords|HL]], affirming 76 Cr App R 211, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; sought to identify the ''mens rea'' for "motor manslaughter" (negligently causing death when driving a motor vehicle). Reference was made to [[R v Caldwell and R v Lawrence|''R v Caldwell'' and ''R v Lawrence'']]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Caldwell'' [1982] AC 341, HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Lawrence]]'' [1982] AC 510, [1981] 2 WLR 524, 73 Cr App R 1, [1981] 1 All ER 974, [1981] RTR 217, [1981] Crim LR 409, HL, reversing 71 Cr App R 291&lt;/ref&gt; which held that a person was reckless if:
#he did an act which in fact created an obvious and serious risk of injury to the person or substantial damage to property; and
#when he did the act he either had not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or had recognised that there was some risk involved and had nonetheless gone on to do it.
The conclusion was that for motor manslaughter (and, by implication, for all cases of gross negligence), it was more appropriate to adopt this definition of recklessness. Consequently, if the defendant created an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to someone, there could be liability whether there was simple inadvertence or conscious risk-taking. It was no longer a defence to argue that the negligence had not been gross.

In ''Adomako''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Adamoko'' [1995] 1 AC 171, [1994] 3 WLR 288, [1994] 3 All ER 79, 99 Cr App R 362, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; an anaesthetist failed to notice that a tube had become disconnected from the ventilator and the patient died. Lord Mackay disapproved Seymour and held that the Bateman test of gross negligence was the appropriate test in manslaughter cases involving a breach of duty, allowing the jury to consider the accused's conduct in all the surrounding circumstances, and to convict only if the negligence was very serious. Individuals have a duty to act in the following situations:
*to care for certain defined classes of helpless relatives, e.g. [[Marriage|spouses]] must take care of each other, and parents must look after their dependent children. In ''[[R v Stone and Dobinson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Stone and Dobinson'' [1977] QB 354, 64 Cr App R 186, [1977] 2 WLR 169, [1977] 2 All ER 341, [1977] Crim LR 166, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; an elderly woman with [[anorexia nervosa]], came to stay with her brother and his cohabitee, who were both of low intelligence, and subsequently starved herself to death. The Court of Appeal held that the question whether the couple owed a duty to care for the deceased was a question of fact for the jury, which was entitled to take into account the facts that she was a relative of one of the appellants, that she was occupying a room in his house, and that the other appellant had undertaken the duty to care for her by trying to wash her and taking food to her.
*where there is a [[contract]] (even if the person injured was outside the contractual relationship and, in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] would be barred by [[Privity in English law|privity]] from enforcing the contract). In ''[[R v Pittwood]]'' [[Case citation|1902 TLR 37]], a railway crossing gatekeeper had opened the gate to let a cart pass and forgot to shut it again. Later a hay cart was struck by a train while crossing. He was convicted of manslaughter. It was argued on his behalf that he owed a duty only to his employers, the railway company, with whom he had contracted. Wright J, held, however, that the man was paid to keep the gate shut and protect the public so had a duty to act. In contracts relating both to employment and to the provision of services, ''[[R v Yaqoob]]''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Yaqoob'' 2005 EWCA Crim 1269&lt;/ref&gt; considered a partner in a taxi firm who was responsible for making all necessary arrangements for the inspection and maintenance of a minibus which had overturned after its tyre burst, killing one of its passengers. He was convicted of manslaughter because the failure properly to maintain the minibus was the direct cause of the accident and there was an implied duty owed both to other members of the partnership and to those renting the vehicle, to inspect and maintain beyond the standard required for an MOT test, council inspections, and other duties imposed by regulation. The jury was competent to assess whether the failure to discharge that implied duty was gross negligence without hearing any expert evidence; these were not technical issues and they did not need expert help. The sentence of four years imprisonment was within the sentencing band and not excessive.

In ''Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999)'',&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999)'' 2000 3 AER 182&lt;/ref&gt; a case on [[corporate manslaughter]] that arose out of the [[Southall rail crash]], the Court of Appeal decided the defendant's subjective state of mind (i.e. whether there was conscious risk-taking) is irrelevant and, therefore, so is the question of recklessness, leaving the objective test as the only test for liability. Rose LJ, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although there may be cases where the defendant’s state of mind is relevant to the jury’s consideration when assessing the grossness and criminality of his conduct, evidence of his state of mind is not a pre-requisite to a conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence. The Adomako test is objective, but a defendant who is reckless as defined in Stone may well be the more readily found to be grossly negligent to a criminal degree.
In our judgment unless an identified individual’s conduct, characterisable as gross criminal negligence, can be attributed to the company, the company is not, in the present state of the common law, liable for manslaughter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Civil negligence rules are not apt to confer criminal liability…the identification principle remains the only basis in common law for corporate liability for gross negligence manslaughter. (see [[imputation (law)|imputation]]). This was only persuasive authority for the law of manslaughter at large, but ''[[R v DPP, ex p Jones]]''&lt;ref&gt;''R v DPP, ex p Jones'' 2000 (QBD) IRLR 373&lt;/ref&gt; which said that the test of negligent manslaughter is objective, confirmed ''Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999)'' as a correct general statement of law.

===Death by dangerous driving===
Because of a reluctance by juries to convict when the charge was manslaughter, a statutory offence of "[[causing death by dangerous driving]]" was introduced. Following the Road Traffic Law Review Committee (1988), the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]] abandoned recklessness in favour of the pre-statutory objective test of "dangerousness", i.e. did the driving fall far below the standard of the competent and careful driver. The Committee also recommended that manslaughter should be an optional charge for the more serious driving cases. There is the possibility of charging an [[TWOC|aggravated taking without consent]] for less seriously dangerous driving where death results.  An equivalent, in many American states, to motor manslaughter, is [[vehicular homicide]].  An equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving in Canada under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Law/Offences/Criminal_Negligence Causing death by criminal negligence].

===Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act===
Under English law, according to ''[[R v Creamer]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[R v Creamer]]'' [1966] 1 QB 72, 49 Cr App R 368, [1965] 3 WLR 583, [1965] 3 All ER 257, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt; a person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when he or she intends an unlawful act that is likely to do harm to the person, and death results which was neither foreseen nor intended. The name for this crime is 'manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act' (MUDA). The term 'constructive manslaughter' is commonly and correctly used as a synonym. Although the accused did not intend to cause serious harm or foresee the risk of doing so, and although an objective observer would not necessarily have predicted that serious harm would result, the accused's responsibility for causing death is ''constructed'' from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act.

The case of ''[[R v Goodfellow]]''&lt;ref&gt;''(1986) 83 Cr App R 23, per Lord Lane CJ at p.27&lt;/ref&gt; laid out a four-part requirement which if satisfied could lead to liability for MUDA. The person's action must:
# Be intentional
# Be unlawful
# Lead the reasonable person to realise that some other person is at risk of physical harm
# Be the cause of death

A number of authorities clarify the test from ''R v Goodfellow'':
* As to (1): either did the person intend to bring about the commission of the offence,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Mohan]]'' [1976] QB 1&lt;/ref&gt; or was the outcome a virtual certainty that the person knew was a virtual certainty?.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Woollin]]'' [1999] 1 AC 82&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer to either of these questions is yes then the person's action was intentional. 
* As to (2): a full 'base offence' must be established, or else there can be no liability for MUDA.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Lamb]]'' [1967] 2 QB 981&lt;/ref&gt;
* As to (3): the test is one of objective reasonableness and is a question for the jury to determine (i.e. to answer the question: "Would a reasonable person realise that the defendant's act was bound to subject some other person to the risk of physical harm?")
* As to (4): was the act a cause in fact and in law? (see [[Causation (law)]] for details)

In ''[[R v Dawson]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Dawson'' (1985) 81 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 150, CA&lt;/ref&gt; a petrol station attendant with a weak heart died of heart failure when the appellant attempted a robbery of the station. In judging whether this act was sufficiently ''dangerous'', the Court of Appeal applied a test based on the "sober and reasonable" bystander who could be assumed to know that the use of a replica gun was likely to terrify people and so be a danger to those with a weak heart. Note the aggravated form of criminal damage with intent to endanger life under section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] which could provide the unlawful act if the damage actually causes death. But ''[[R v Carey, C and F]]''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Carey, C and F'' 2006 EWCA Crim 17&lt;/ref&gt; limits the scope of unlawful act manslaughter. An argument became violent and the first defendant punched and kicked one victim. The second defendant assaulted the deceased by pulling her hair back and punching her in the face. The third defendant assaulted another. The deceased was one of the first to run away, after which she felt faint, and later died of a heart condition ([[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]) which was congenital but which had not been diagnosed before her death. The unlawful act was said to be the affray and the judge held that it was legitimate to aggregate the violence by the other defendants in order to decide whether the affray had subjected the deceased to the threat of at least some physical harm, and so had been a cause of death. On appeal, it was inappropriate to hold the defendants liable for the death. There must be an unlawful act that was dangerous in the sense that sober and reasonable persons would recognise that the act was such as to subject Y to the risk of physical harm. In turn, that act must cause the death. When deciding whether an act is dangerous, knowledge of the victim's characteristics may be relevant. In this case, no reasonable person would have been aware of the victim's heart condition which distinguishes this case from ''Dawson'', and from ''[[R v Watson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Watson]]'' [1989] 1 WLR 684&lt;/ref&gt; in which the victim's approximate age (he was 87 years old) and frail state would have been obvious to a reasonable person. A sober and reasonable person would not have foreseen that an apparently healthy person of 15 years would suffer shock as a result of it. The court held that the deceased's death was not caused by injuries that were a foreseeable result of the affray. The assault by the second defendant was an unlawful act causing death. The other two defendants could have been convicted  by virtue of [[common purpose]] given that the death was an accidental departure from the general plan of the affray. But the Crown did not elect to present the case in this way, but pleaded the case as a public order group activity. The result would be that if anyone died in a general disturbance amounting to an affray, all those who participated could be convicted of manslaughter which would be against public policy. Deaths in a general disturbance are too remote to be caused by all participants.

Thus, a punch which causes a person to fall will almost inevitably satisfy the test of dangerousness, and where the victim falls and suffers a fatal head injury the accused is guilty of manslaughter. It is foreseeable that the victim is at risk of suffering some physical harm (albeit not serious harm) from such a punch and that is sufficient. Physical harm includes shock. The reason why the death resulting from the attempted robbery of the 60-year-old petrol station attendant was not manslaughter was that the attempted robbery was not dangerous in the relevant sense. It was not foreseeable that an apparently healthy 60-year-old man would suffer shock and a heart attack as a result of such an attempted robbery. But the jury properly found that it was foreseeable that an obviously frail and very old man was at risk of suffering shock leading to a heart attack as a result of a burglary committed at his home late at night.

In ''[[R v Charles James Brown]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Charles James Brown]]'' 2005 EWCA Crim 2868&lt;/ref&gt; following the break-up of his relationship with his girlfriend, at about 3 pm., the defendant sent a text message to his mother saying that he did not want to live any more. He then drove his car against the flow of traffic along the hard shoulder of the A1(M) at high speed, before moving into the carriageway, still accelerating and straddling the centre line. He then crashed, head on, into an oncoming car, killing the passenger and injuring many others in the resulting consequential crashes. A sentence of 10 years' detention in a young offender institution was upheld because although the intentional focus might have been only on suicide, the defendant must have known from the way he was driving that he would kill or injure at least one other person (thus enforcing an objective standard on the defendant).

===Unlawful (constructive) act manslaughter and the liability imposed on drug suppliers===
The law on those who supply the (post) deceased with drugs had been uncertain until the case of ''[[R v Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Kennedy'' 2007 UKHL 38&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant supplied heroin to a drug user that asked for something to help them sleep. An hour after administering the drug the victim died. Kennedy was found guilty of manslaughter and appealed on the grounds that there must be an unlawful act which caused the victim's death. In this case the defendant set up the drug and supplied it but did not administer it, therefore it was an act of the victim himself that caused his own death. Kennedy was acquitted of manslaughter. Prior to this [[House of Lords]] ruling, the lower courts (in particular the [[Court of Appeal]]) struggled to strike a balance between those suppliers considered to have administered the drug (in the subsequent cases, [[heroin]]) to the victim themselves, and those suppliers who simply "supply" the drug for the victim to then voluntarily administer themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII

==Defence==
Infanticide is a partial defence to manslaughter under the [[Infanticide Act 1938]] (as amended by section 57 the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]] to confirm the decision in ''[[R v Gore]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Gore]]'' [2007] EWCA Crim 2789&lt;/ref&gt;) and reduces the manslaughter to the crime of [[infanticide]].

==Mode of trial and sentence==
Manslaughter is an [[indictable-only offence]].

A person guilty of manslaughter is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 5; [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Voluntary manslaughter - former partial defence of provocation===
{{Main|Provocation in English law}}
{{See also|Provocation (legal)}}
[[Provocation in English law]] was abolished on 4 October 2010&lt;ref&gt;The [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010]] (S.I. 2010/816 (C. 56)), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/816/article/6/made article 6(b)]; and see [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402160106/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/coroners-justice-act-implementation-10.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/56 section 56(1)] of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7762405.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Queen's Speech: Bill-by-bill|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but replaced by the similar partial defence of "loss of control".

====Acts constituting provocation====
At common law, acts of provocation had to be actual violence towards the defendant; words could not amount to provocation. The two exceptions to this rule were a husband discovering his wife committing adultery and a father finding someone [[buggering]] his son. There were two limbs to the defence, first the defendant had to have actually been provoked, and second the provocation had to be such as would have made the reasonable man act as the defendant did. The Homicide Act 1957 removed all limits on what could amount to provocation and allowed it to include provocation from someone other than the victim,&lt;ref&gt;''R v Davies'' [1975] QB 691&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed at someone other than the accused.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Pearson'' [1992] Crim LR 193&lt;/ref&gt; Further the defence was not defeated by the fact that the defendant induced the provocation.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v R'' [1973] AC 648&lt;/ref&gt; Section 56&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/56|title=Coroners and Justice Act 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states that the common law defence of provocation is abolished and replaced by sections 54 and 55; and that section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 is also abolished and replaced with sections 54 and 55.

====Subjective limb: provocation in fact====
This was a question of fact for the jury. The loss of control had to be sudden and temporary,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Duffy]]'' [1946] 1 All ER 932n&lt;/ref&gt; however it could be the result of slow burn; the final straw needed not be very bad as long as it led to an actual sudden and temporary loss of control. A delay between the act of provocation and the killing did not always defeat the defence, but often would.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Ahluwalia]]'' [1992] 4 All ER 889&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective limb: the reasonable man test====
Under section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 the second question to be answered by the jury in order for the defence to succeed was ‘whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man act as [the defendant] did?’. The reasonable man for the purposes of this test had the same sex and age as the defendant and shared such characteristics as affect the gravity of the provocation to the defendant, but characteristics irrelevant to the provocation such as unrelated mental disorders were not given to the reasonable man.&lt;ref&gt;''[[A-G for Jersey v Holley]]'' [2005] UKPC 23, as affirmed in ''[[R v James and Karimi]]'' [2006] EWCA Crim 14&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the reasonable man always had reasonable powers of self-control&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Lesbini]]'' [1914] 3 KB 1116&lt;/ref&gt; and was never intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Newell]]'' (1980) 71 Cr App R 331&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Mauritania]] on June 25, 2006 and approved by nearly 97% of voters. Following the August 2005 ouster of long-time president [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], the new transitional military regime called the [[referendum]] on a new [[constitution]], which limits presidents to two five-year terms; previously presidential terms were six years and there was no limit on re-election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/English/mauritania/?id=16850 "Mauritania's constitution gets 96.96% yes vote"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020021055/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/mauritania/?id=16850 |date=2006-10-20 }}, Middle East Online, June 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution also establishes a maximum age limit of 75 for presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54145&amp;SelectRegion=West_Africa&amp;SelectCountry=MAURITANIA "Military junta launches pro-democracy poll"], IRIN, June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8244">'''Medieval Roman law''' is the continuation and development of ancient [[Roman law]] that developed in the European [[Late Middle Ages]]. Based on the ancient text of Roman law, the ''[[Corpus iuris civilis]]'', it added many new concepts, and formed the basis of the later [[civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]] that prevail in the vast majority of countries. Some exceptions are, for example, [[common law]] countries of the [[English-speaking world]].

==Rediscovery of ancient Roman law==
Although some legal systems in southern Europe in the [[Early Middle Ages]], such as the [[Visigothic Code]], retained some features of ancient Roman law, the main texts of Roman law were little known until the rediscovery of the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'' in Italy in the late 11th century.{{cn|date=May 2017}} It was soon apparent that the ''Digest'' was a massive intellectual achievement and that the assimilation of its contents would require much time and study. The first European university, the [[University of Bologna]], was set up in large part with the aim of studying it.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', ch. 3; Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The era of the glossators==
The ancient Roman law texts were not very explicit about matters of principle, and the commentators found it necessary to develop the [[scholastic method]] of comparing potentially conflicting texts and inferring principles that would explain the apparent contradictions. The commentators of the 12th and early 13th centuries, called [[glossators]], such as [[Azo of Bologna]] and [[Accursius]], produced a large-scale harmonization and commentary on the texts. They developed new concepts by reflecting on different related texts, such as the concept of [[half-proof]] in the law of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these glosses or interpretations, were compiled into one text around 1220 by the famous glossator Franciscus Accursius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/law-divisions-and-codes/roman-law}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text was known as the Glossa ordinaria and was the staple of the most important commentaries made by the glossators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/law-divisions-and-codes/roman-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossa_Ordinaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

Initially the rediscovered Roman law was not the law of any particular country or institution, but as lawyers trained in the concepts of Roman law came to dominate the legal profession, Roman law came to have an immense effect on law as actually practiced. For example, [[torture]] was reintroduced into Europe as a means of acquiring evidence, usually when there was half-proof or more against a defendant but not yet sufficient proof for conviction.

[[English law]] incorporated a substantial amount of Roman concepts through the works of [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; But it adopted the non-Roman [[jury]] system as the main form of evidence evaluation, thus remaining less influenced by Roman law than continental systems. However, some English courts, such as the [[Admiralty Court|Court of Admiralty]], operated on Roman law principles.

[[Canon law]], the law of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] which governed such matters as marriage, developed in parallel with medieval Roman law and incorporated many of its concepts.

==The era of the postglossators==
The [[postglossator]]s of the 14th century, such as [[Bartolus de Saxoferato]] and [[Baldus de Ubaldis]], developed a more mature and deeper legal theory, less closely tied to the ancient texts. That gave the law sufficient flexibility to incorporate new concepts. For example, the first printed book on [[insurance]] was the Roman law treatise ''On Insurance and Merchants' Bets'' by [[Pedro de Santarém]] (Santerna), written in 1488 and published in 1552.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence==

Roman law often acted (except in England) as a "common law" ([[ius commune]]) that filled the gap where local laws were silent, as well as supplying principles of interpretation for those laws in doubtful cases.&lt;ref&gt;Bellomo, ''The common legal past of Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, [[Scots law]] was heavily influenced by Roman law from the 15th century.

Roman law was in part incorporated in later codifications of continental law such as the [[Napoleonic Code]] and hence formed a core of their successors, the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems of modern European and other countries.

Roman law also had wide influence on Western [[political philosophy|political theory]]. Questions such as the scope and limits of government and the permissibility of [[tyrannicide]] were seen in legal terms and discussed by writers whose primary training was in law.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, ''The Prince and the Law''; Canning, ''The Political Thought of Baldus de Ubaldis''.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas formed the basic of modern [[constitutionalism]], the idea that government should be bound by fixed legal norms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13682">[[File:Mexican Cession.png|thumb|Area Mexico ceded to the United States in 1848, minus [[Texas annexation|Texan claims]]. The Mexican Cession consisted of present-day [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], most of [[Arizona]], about half of [[New Mexico]], about a quarter of [[Colorado]], and a small section of [[Wyoming]].]]

The '''Mexican Cession''' is the region in the modern-day [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] [[United States]] that [[Mexico]] ceded to the U.S. in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848 after the [[Mexican–American War]]. This region had not been part of the areas east of the [[Rio Grande]] which had been claimed by the [[Republic of Texas]], though the [[Texas annexation]] resolution two years earlier had not specified the southern and western boundary of the new [[Texas|State of Texas]]. The Mexican Cession (529,000 sq. miles) was the third largest acquisition of territory in US history. The largest was the [[Louisiana Purchase]], with some 827,000 sq. miles (including land from fifteen present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces), followed by the [[Alaska_Purchase|acquisition of Alaska]] (about 586,000 [[Square mile|sq. miles]]).

Most of the area had been the Mexican territory of [[Alta California]], while a southeastern strip on the [[Rio Grande]] had been part of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico]], most of whose area and population were east of the Rio Grande on land that had been claimed by the [[Republic of Texas]] since 1835, but never controlled or even approached aside from the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]]. Mexico controlled the territory later known as the Mexican Cession, with considerable local autonomy punctuated by several revolts and few troops sent from central Mexico, in the period from 1821–22 after [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain]] up through 1846 when U.S. military forces seized control of California and New Mexico on the outbreak of the [[Mexican–American War]]. The northern boundary of the [[42nd parallel north]] was set by the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] signed by the United States and Spain in 1821 and ratified by Mexico in 1831. The eastern boundary of the Mexican Cession was the Texas claim at the Rio Grande and extending north from the headwaters of the Jojo Rivera, not corresponding to Mexican territorial boundaries. The southern boundary was set by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which followed the Mexican boundaries between Alta California (to the north) and [[Baja California]] and [[Sonora]] (to the south). The United States paid Mexico $15 million dollars for the land which became known as the Mexican Cession.

==War Of Treaty== 
[[File:File-Mexico 1835-1846 administrative map-en-2.svg|upright=1.6|thumb|left|A map of Mexico, 1835–1846, with separatist movements highlighted]]


Alta California and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico]] were captured soon after the start of the war and the last resistance there was subdued in January 1847, but Mexico would not accept the loss of territory. Therefore, during 1847, troops from the United States invaded central Mexico and occupied the Mexican capital of [[Mexico City]], but still no Mexican government was willing to ratify transfer of the northern territories to the U.S. It was uncertain whether any treaty could be reached. There was even an [[All of Mexico Movement]] proposing complete [[annexation]] of Mexico among Eastern Democrats, but opposed by Southerners like [[John C. Calhoun]] who wanted additional territory for their crops but not the large population of central Mexico.

Eventually [[Nicholas Trist]] forced the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], explicitly redefining the border between Mexico and the United States in early 1848 after President Polk had already attempted to recall him from Mexico as a failure. Although Mexico did not overtly cede any land under the treaty, the redefined border had the effect of transferring Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico to the control of the United States. Equally important, the new border also acknowledged Mexico's loss of Texas, both the core eastern portion and the western claims, neither of which had been formally recognized by Mexico until that time.

The U.S. Senate approved the treaty, rejecting amendments from both [[Jefferson Davis]] to also annex most of northeastern Mexico and [[Daniel Webster]] not to take even Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States and Mexico, 1821-1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfhAAAAAIAAJ|author=George Lockhart Rives|pages=634–636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also paid $15,000,000 ($482 million in 2016 dollars) for the land, and agreed to assume $3.25 million in debts to US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Articles XII-XV&lt;/ref&gt; While technically the territory was purchased by the United States, the $15 million payment was simply credited against Mexico's debt to the U.S. at that time.

The Mexican Cession as ordinarily understood (i.e. excluding lands claimed by Texas) amounted to {{convert|525000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}, or 14.9% of the total area of the current United States. If the disputed western Texas claims are also included, that amounts to a total of {{convert|750000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. If all of Texas had been seized, since Mexico had not previously acknowledged the loss of any part of Texas, the total area ceded under this treaty comes to {{convert|915000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}.

Considering the seizures, including all of Texas, Mexico lost 54% of its pre-1836 territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/natacq/pls02/pls1-1_02.pdf Table 1.1 Acquisition of the Public Domain 1781-1867] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929200726/http://www.blm.gov/natacq/pls02/pls1-1_02.pdf |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For only fifteen years from 1821 (when [[Mexican independence]] was secured) and the Texan Revolt in 1836, the Mexican Cession (excluding Texas) formed approximately 42% of the country of Mexico; prior to that, it had been a part of the Spanish colony of [[New Spain]] for some three centuries. Beginning in the early seventeenth century, a chain of Roman Catholic missions and settlements extended into the New Mexico region, mostly following the course of the [[Rio Grande]] from the [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] area to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].

==Subsequent organization and the North-South conflict==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Soon after the war started and long before negotiation of the new [[US-Mexico border]], the question of slavery in the territories to be acquired polarized the Northern and [[Southern United States]] in the bitterest sectional conflict up to this time, which lasted for a deadlock of four years during which the [[Second Party System]] broke up, [[Mormon pioneers]] settled [[Utah]], the [[California Gold Rush]] settled [[California]], and New Mexico under a federal military U.S government turned back Texas's attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the Rio Grande. Eventually the [[Compromise of 1850]] preserved the Union, but only for another decade. Proposals included:

*The [[Wilmot Proviso]], which was created by Congressman [[David Wilmot]], banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas which had been annexed the previous year. Passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Later an effort to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] also failed.
*Failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then [[Stephen Douglas]] extending the [[Missouri Compromise]] line ([[36°30' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific, allowing slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and [[Arizona]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and [[Southern California]], as well as any other territories that might be acquired from Mexico. The line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.
*[[Popular sovereignty]], developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Douglas as the eventual [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] position, letting each territory decide whether to allow slavery.
*[[William L. Yancey]]'s "Alabama Platform," endorsed by the [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]], called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories either by the federal government or by territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws.
*General [[Zachary Taylor]], who became the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate in 1848 and then President from March 1849 to July 1850, proposed after becoming President that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the eventual ones. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], avoiding the question of slavery in the territories.
*The Mormons' proposal for a [[State of Deseret]] seizing areas from portions of the Mexican Cession but excluding the largest populations in [[Northern California]] and central [[New Mexico]] was considered unlikely to succeed in [[United States Congress|Congress]], but nevertheless in 1849 President [[Zachary Taylor|Taylor]] sent his agent John Wilson westward with a proposal to combine California and Deseret as a single state, decreasing the number of new [[Free state (USA)|free states]] and the erosion of Southern parity in the Senate, while legitimizing [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].
*Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in December 1849 or January 1850: Texas's western and northern boundaries would be the [[102nd meridian west]] and [[34th parallel north]].
*Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] (with assent of Texas) in February 1850: New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the [[34th parallel north]] (including today's [[Texas Panhandle]]), and the area to the south (including the southeastern part of today's [[New Mexico]]) would be divided at the [[Colorado River (Texas)]] into two slave states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mNQ1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=34th+parallel+wilmot&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6E2_o5IEwy&amp;sig=bQFK83qaH3FNzW71eSBq-GpwJ-c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA191,M1 google.com/books] Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association, January 1904&lt;/ref&gt;
*First draft of the [[compromise of 1850]]: Texas's northwestern boundary would be a straight diagonal line from the Rio Grande {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1}} north of El Paso to the [[Red River of the South]] at the [[100th meridian west]] (the southwestern corner of today's [[Oklahoma]]).
[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.25]]
*The [[Compromise of 1850]], proposed by [[Henry Clay]] in January 1850, guided to passage by Douglas over Northern Whig and Southern Democrat opposition, and enacted September 1850, admitted California as a free state including Southern California and organized [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] with slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. Texas dropped its claim to the disputed northwestern areas in return for debt relief, and the areas were divided between the two new territories and [[unorganized territory]]. El Paso where Texas had successfully established county government was left in Texas. No southern territory dominated by Southerners (like the later short-lived [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]]) was created. Also, the [[slave trade]] was abolished in [[Washington, D.C.]] (but not slavery itself), and the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was strengthened.

==Gadsden Purchase==
It quickly became apparent that the Mexican Cession did not include a feasible route for a [[transcontinental railroad]] connecting to a southern port. The topography of the New Mexico Territory included mountains that naturally directed any railroad extending from the southern Pacific coast northward, to Kansas City, St. Louis, or Chicago. Southerners, anxious for the business such a railroad would bring (and hoping to establish a slave-state beachhead on the Pacific coast&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''The California Gold Rush and the Coming of the Civil War'', p. 126 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;), agitated for the acquisition of railroad-friendly land at the expense of Mexico, thus bringing about the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1853.

'''''Mullens v Federal Commissioner of Taxation''''',&lt;ref name="Mullens HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|47|1976|litigants=Mullens v Federal Commissioner of Taxation |parallelcite=(1976) 135 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 290 |date=9 September 1976 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1976 [[High Court of Australia]] tax case concerning arrangements where stockbrokers Mullens &amp; Co accessed tax deductions for monies subscribed to a petroleum exploration company.  The [[Australian Taxation Office]] held the scheme was [[tax avoidance]], but the court found for the taxpayer.

In the taxonomy of tax schemes, this was of the kind where a wholly intentional tax benefit is swapped or traded between taxpayers, from someone who can't make full use of it to someone who can.

The principal significance of the case today is its part in judicial interpretation of the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936#Section 260|section 260]] anti-avoidance provisions of the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].

==Background==
===Transaction 1===

In 1968 a company called Vam Limited proposed to explore for [[natural gas]] in fields in [[South Australia]] and in south-western [[Queensland]].  In August 1968 it formed a new company Vamgas [[no liability|NL]] whose sole business would be that exploration.  As a petroleum exploration company, monies subscribed for shares in Vamgas would be tax deductible under section 77A of the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]] as it stood at that time.

Vamgas shares had a par value of $0.50 each and Vam itself took up 5 million part paid to $0.10 each.  Another 5 million, to be fully paid, were offered by way of a [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]]; 3 million to Vam shareholders and 2 million reserved for clients of the underwriting stockbroker and certain other brokers (Mullens &amp; Co was not one of them).  The offer to the Vam shareholders was by way of non-renounceable rights, which meant they could take them up or let them lapse, but could not sell or transfer them to someone else.

Mr Close was [[chairman of the board]] at Vam.  He and his family and friends were substantial shareholders in Vam.  They wanted to have an interest in the Vamgas, but couldn't afford to pay for their full allotment of shares (about 433,800, worth $216,900), and/or didn't have enough other income to make use of the tax deductions to be had by subscribing.  Mullens &amp; Co stockbrokers knew about the offer (and had had other dealings with Vam) and was in the opposite situation, it had access to funds and had income which it could usefully offset with deductions, but had no particular interest in Vamgas.  Close worked with Mullens on the following mutually beneficial arrangement.

The Vam shareholders created [[Trust (law) non-USA|trust]]s under which they took up their Vamgas rights and paid for their new shares with money provided by Mullens.  The shares were in the names of those various Vam shareholders, but as [[trustee]]s, with Mullens (or associates) the beneficial owners.  Mullens granted those shareholders [[Option (finance)|options]] allowing them to buy the Vamgas shares, if they wished, for the issue price (i.e. what Mullens had paid), any time until 15 May 1969 (that being a few months after the issue).  The benefits of this scheme were,

* Mullens got a [[tax deduction]] for the $216,900 subscribed to Vamgas.  But assuming the Vam shareholders did exercise their options, then Mullens got all that money back, its only actual expense would be [[interest]] on the money for the short period until exercise (they financed with a bank [[overdraft]]).
* The Vam shareholders got any market price rise above the issue price of the new Vamgas shares, with no cash outlay or risk.

In effect the Vam shareholders had swapped their potential tax deductions for a combination of short-term finance and protection against the share price falling.  It seems Mullens wasn't too concerned about the latter possibility, and indeed Vamgas did rise when it listed on the stock exchange.&lt;!-- This was almost certainly the [[Sydney Stock Exchange]], where Vam itself was listed (see Supreme Court report), but better not write that without an explicit reference to back it up.  --&gt;

The Vam shareholders exercised their options on 14 May 1969, the day before expiry, and paid Mullens the $0.50 per share strike price.  They got the money by selling some of their shares (having risen in price) or by selling some new further rights which Vamgas had issued.  (Vamgas made a one-for-one rights issue shortly after listing, and under the option conditions such rights belonged to the option holder, i.e. those Vam shareholders, not Mullens.)

One of the Vam shareholders, a Mrs Walser, had on  3 April 1969 sold (at a profit) the Vamgas shares she held in trust.  This was, strictly speaking, before she exercised her option.  Mullens was the selling broker and was obviously unconcerned by formalities of exercise dates, but it did cause Mr Bridges (a partner in Mullens) considerable embarrassment in the court ([[#Court|below]]) because it gave the impression Mrs Walser regarded the shares as hers to trade, and on that basis maybe the trust documents were a sham and she was really the owner.  The latter was what the [[Australian Taxation Office]] contended.

===Transaction 2===

A second similar transaction took place in May 1969, this time between the Vam company itself and the Mullens group.  Vam had to pay the $0.40 balance of its part-paid Vamgas shares, but it had enough of its own [[tax deduction]]s that it didn't need those it would get from section 77A by subscribing money to Vamgas.  So instead it negotiated with Mullens on the following further transaction.

Mullens and several associates on 23 May 1969 bought 1,250,000 of Vam's $0.10 part-paid Vamgas shares, for the paid-up value of $125,000.  Mullens agreed to give Vam first refusal to buy the shares back, at market price.  A few weeks later, on 17 June 1969, they did indeed sell them back to Vam for $0.50 each (with Mullens paying the [[stamp duty]]).  This was just under the prevailing market price of $0.51.

The fact that the sale back to Vam was for exactly what Mullens had paid out seems to have been a happy coincidence, i.e. that the market price was exactly that amount at the time; the price later fell to $0.30.

It appears Vam gave up its potential tax benefit for no more than a three-week deferral of its payment on the Vamgas call.  Such a small consideration might suggest there wasn't an active kind of market in trading such tax benefits.

===Supreme Court of NSW===

Seven partners of the Mullens stockbroking firm and four companies associated with them appealed to the [[Supreme Court of NSW]] against the tax assessments made by the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO). By consent the eleven appeals were heard together and evidence given in each one was treated as evidence in each of the others.&lt;ref name="Bridges SC"&gt;''Bridges v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth)'' (1974) 5 [[Australian Tax Reports|ATR]] 120; [https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=JUD/74ATC4339/00001 74 ATC 4339] (3 December 1974), [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]] (NSW).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATO argued that either the two Vam transactions above were shams, or that if they were real then they came under the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936#Section 260|section 260]] anti-avoidance provisions of the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].

A "sham" in this context would mean there was some different underlying arrangement between the parties, and the documents they made were never meant to be enforced (or worse, written or re-written after the fact).  The actual arrangement the ATO posited was that Mullens had simply lent money.

[[Ian Sheppard|Justice Sheppard]] agreed with the ATO, noting in particular Mrs Walser's dealings, and decided for the ATO as submitted, but without ruling on which alternative was the case (sham or section 260).&lt;ref name="Bridges SC"/&gt;

==High Court==

All eleven people and companies appealed to the High Court.  The initial appeal in the Supreme Court also concerned other transactions relating to share sales on capital versus income account were also decided, but they were not taken further and don't have a bearing on the Vam transactions and section 260. Mullens was chosen as symptomatic of those of other taxpayers associated with him as they all had the same facts and  the result of all appeals was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|47|1976|litigants=Mullens v Federal Commissioner of Taxation |parallelcite=(1976) 135 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 290}} per Barwick CJ at p 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] upheld the appeal and found for the taxpayer in a 2-1 decision, with [[Garfield Barwick|Chief Justice Barwick]] and [[Ninian Stephen|Justice Stephen]] finding for the taxpayer, and [[Edward McTiernan|Justice McTiernan]] finding for the ATO.

McTiernan's judgement was that the transactions formally met the requirements of section 77A for deductibility, but that the only practical purpose of them was to relieve Mullens from tax liabilities and hence they came under section 260 as altering the incidence of taxation.  (This judgement meant he didn't need to consider the alternative that the transactions might have been a sham.)

Barwick and Stephen on the other hand firstly disagreed with Justice Sheppard's initial conclusion that the transactions could have been shams, finding the documentation and negotiations between the parties ample.  They noted in particular that Mullens didn't get the "two-way" option it had wanted (the right to force the Vam shareholders to buy back), so there was a real commercial risk being borne.

Both justices then also disagreed with Sheppard and with McTiernan that section 260 applied.  Their view was that section 77A was unequivocal about giving a tax benefit to those who subscribed for petroleum shares, like Mullens had.  They noted there were no extra conditions in that section to be fulfilled (though perhaps there ought to have been for instance a minimum holding period).

So with Mullens satisfying the requirements of a section of the act, applying section 260 would take away something the act explicitly gave.  Stephen noted [[Douglas Menzies|Justice Menzies]] in ''Ellers Motor Sales Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'' (1969)&lt;ref name="Ellers HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|60|1969|litigants=[[Ellers Motor Sales Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation]] |parallelcite=(1969) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 668 |date=8 December 1969 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who said it could not be that an advantage in one part of the act "was given merely to be taken away by the operation of s.260".

The decision here that section 260 did not apply extended the prior "choice principle" from ''[[Keighery v Federal Commissioner of Taxation]]''.&lt;ref name="Keighery HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1957|litigants=W P Keighery Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation |link=Keighery v Federal Commissioner of Taxation |parallelcite=(1957) 100 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 66 |date=19 December 1957 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That case allowed the taxpayer to choose between two alternatives in the act, the Mullens decision allowed a taxpayer to enter a particular set of circumstances described by the act for the purpose of gaining the effects it described, even if those effects were beneficial.  This latter principle was subsequently used in cases such as ''[[Cridland v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|Cridland]]''.&lt;ref name="Cridland HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|61|1977|litigants=[[Cridland v Federal Commissioner of Taxation]] |parallelcite=(1977) 140 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 330 |date=30 November 1977 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequently ==

Section 77A of the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936|ITAA 1936]] was repealed before the court cases, that tax concession having apparently served its purpose.

A not dissimilar example of tax benefit shifting came with [[dividend imputation]] in the 1990s.  Foreigners were unable to use the imputation credits and so instead "sold" them to Australian institutions by transferring the shares to them just across the dividend record date.  General anti-avoidance provisions didn't apply, because both parties' taxable incomes increased. A holding period rule of the kind alluded to by Barwick and Stephen above had to be instituted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The '''''National Herald'' scam''' is an ongoing case in a Delhi court filed by Indian economist and politician [[Subramanian Swamy]] against politicians [[Sonia Gandhi]] and [[Rahul Gandhi]], their companies and associated persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-court-summons-sonia-rahul-in-national-herald-case/article6151487.ece |title=Delhi court summons Sonia, Rahul in National Herald case |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the complaint filed in the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Associated Journals Limited (AJL) took an interest-free loan of {{INRConvert|90.25|c}} from [[Indian National Congress]].

==Associated Journals Limited==
Associated Journals Limited (AJL) is an unlisted public company limited by shares, incorporated on 20 November 1937, with its registered office at Herald House, 5-A, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. It was the brainchild of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] but it was never his personal property as it was started with the support of about 5,000 freedom fighters who became shareholders of AJL. The company's capital was {{INRConvert|5|l}} divided into 2,000 preferential shares worth {{INRConvert|100}} each and 30,000 ordinary (equity) shares worth {{INRConvert|10}} each. Apart from Nehru, AJL's Memorandum of Association was signed by stalwarts such as [[Purushottam Das Tandon]], Acharya [[Narendra Dev]], [[Kailash Nath Katju]], [[Rafi Ahmad Kidwai]], Krishna Dutt Paliwal and [[Govind Ballabh Pant]]. The company did not belong to any particular person, nor did it want to be associated with any business except news. AJL had 1,057 shareholders as of 29 September 2010&lt;ref name="The Indian Express"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/national-herald-case-loan-write-off-conflict-of-interest-benefiting-takeover-by-family/|title=National Herald case: Loan write-off, conflict of interest, benefiting takeover by family|publisher=[[The Indian Express]]|date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the annual return filed by the company with the Registrar of Companies.

AJL published the [[The National Herald (India)|''National Herald'' newspaper]] in English, ''[[Qaumi Awaz]]'' in Urdu and ''Navjeevan'' in Hindi until 2008.

===Other shareholders allege their shares usurped===
After the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeal of Sonia Gandhi and others against the summons issued by the trial court, many shareholders of AJL have alleged that no notice was served on them by AJL for any meeting of the shareholders and that the shares held by their fathers have been transferred by AJL to Young Indian fraudulently without their consent in December 2010. These shareholders include prominent individuals such as former law minister [[Shanti Bhushan]] and former chief justice of Allahabad and Madras High Courts [[Markandey Katju]].&lt;ref name = shareholders&gt;{{citation|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ajl-did-not-inform-us-or-obtain-approval-for-equity-transfer-say-shareholders|title=AJL did not inform us or obtain approval for equity transfer, say shareholders|date=12 December 2015|publisher=[[The Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case==

On 1 November 2012, [[Subramanian Swamy]] filed a private complaint in a court in Delhi alleging that both [[Sonia Gandhi]] and [[Rahul Gandhi]] have committed fraud and [[land grabbing]] worth {{INRConvert|16|b}} by acquiring a publicly limited company called Associated Journals Limited (AJL) through their owned private company, Young Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lobis.nic.in/ddir/dhc/SUG/judgement/07-12-2015/SUG07122015CRLMM33322014.pdf |title=CRL.M.C.3332/2014 &amp; Crl.M.A.11550/2014 |publisher=lobis.nic.in|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that, through this fraud, they had got the publication rights of the ''[[The National Herald (India)|National Herald]]'' and ''Quami Awaz'' newspapers, with real estate properties in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. He alleged that the acquired properties were given by the government only for the purposes of publishing newspapers, but were used for running a passport office with rental income amounting to millions of rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Delhi, 1 Nov 2012, DHNS: |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/289449/swamy-accuses-sonia-rahul-property.html |title=Swamy accuses Sonia, Rahul of property fraud |work=Deccan Herald |date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sanjay Singh |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/swamy-does-a-kejriwal-targets-sonia-rahul-for-landgrab-511644.html |title=Swamy does a Kejriwal, targets Sonia &amp; Rahul for landgrab |publisher=Firstpost |date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2014, Metropolitan Magistrate Ms. Gomati Manocha summoned Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Satyan Pitroda to appear in the court on 7 August 2014.

The court noted that all accused persons had allegedly acted "in consortium with each other to achieve the said nefarious purpose/design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-is-the-national-herald-case-all-about/1/541733.html|title=What is the National Herald case all about?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/national-herald-case-where-the-matter-stands/|title=National Herald case explained: Everything you need to know|date=8 December 2015|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">'''Of counsel''' is the [[title]] of an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in the [[legal profession]] of the [[United States]] who often has a relationship with a [[law firm]] or an organization but is neither an [[Associate attorney|associate]] nor [[Partner (business rank)|partner]].  Some firms use titles such as "counsel", "special counsel", and "senior counsel" for the same concept. According to [[American Bar Association]] Formal Opinion 90-357, the term "of counsel" is used to describe a "close, personal, continuous, and regular relationship" between the firm and counsel lawyer.&lt;ref name="http://www.lacba.org/showpage.cfm?pageid=12424"&gt;{{cite web|title=County Bar Update|work=Los Angeles County Bar Association|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large law firms, the title generally denotes a lawyer with the experience of a partner, but who does not carry the same workload or business development responsibility.&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Harrison|title=What Law Firm Titles Mean: Of Counsel, Non-Equity Partner, Equity Partner Explained|url=http://www.bcgsearch.com/article/900042747/What-Law-Firm-Titles-Mean-Of-Counsel-Non-Equity-Partner-Equity-Partner-Explained/|publisher=BCG Attorney Search|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Bar Association definitions ==
Formal Opinion 90-357 of the American Bar Association provides four acceptable definitions of the term:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formal Opinion 90-357, May 10, 1990|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/formal_opinion_90_357.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A part-time practitioner who practices law in association with a firm, but on a basis different from that of the mainstream lawyers in the firm. Such part-time practitioners are sometimes lawyers who have decided to change from a full-time practice, either with that firm or with another, to a part-time one, or who have changed careers entirely, as for example former judges or government officials, or attorneys who transition from corporate/in-house practice to law firm practice.

*A retired partner of a firm who, although not actively practicing law, nonetheless remains associated with it and available for occasional consultation.

*A lawyer who is, in effect, a probationary partner-to-be, usually brought in laterally with the expectation of becoming partner after a relatively short period of time.

*A permanent status in between associate and partner, having the quality of [[tenure]], or something close to it, but lacking an expectation of likely promotion to partner status.

== Typical situations ==
The title may be used in a number of situations, including:&lt;ref name="barnes" /&gt;

*Lawyers who have useful experience for a firm (such as knowledge of a particular "niche" practice area) but do not generate enough business to warrant promotion to partnership.

*Senior lawyers seeking relatively low working hours, billable hours and revenue generation requirements.

*Lawyers transitioning from in-house{{what|date=October 2018}} or government roles.

== Other uses ==
Some firms also use the term to refer to attorneys hired on a temporary basis to assist with a particular case.  However, because "of counsel" describes "a close, regular, personal relationship", temporary lawyers used by law firms to engage in document reviews for a specific project or for limited duration are not "of counsel".&lt;ref&gt;The Economics and Ethics of Hiring a Temporary Lawyer by Peter J. Gardner ("A temporary lawyer is not 'of counsel'"); Wisconsin Lawyer ("'Temporary lawyer' does not include a lawyer who has an 'of counsel' relationship with a law firm or who is retained in a matter as independent associated counsel"); National Association for Legal Career Professionals (separately defining "contract attorney/temporary attorney" as substantively distinct from "of counsel"); Washington State Bar Association (expressly distinguishing between "contract lawyer" and "of counsel"); Contract Lawyers in Kentucky (relying upon ABA Formal Opinion 88-356 in specifically distinguishing "contract lawyers" and "temporary lawyers" from the meaning "of counsel"); The Of Counsel Agreement:  A Guide for the Law Firm and Practitioner ("the use of the title 'Of Counsel' is permissible . . . as long as the 'Of Counsel's' relationship with another lawyer or firm is close, regular and personal and the use of the title is not otherwise false or misleading," and among the arrangements specifically excluded from the use of this designation are where the attorney is involved in only "a single case" for the law firm or constitutes an "outside consultant").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
The average annual base salary for “of counsel” in the United States between 2003 and 2009 was US$216,019 (with salary varying depending on size/reputation of the firm, its location, and the attorney’ experience).&lt;ref&gt;Authors unknown (2003 to 2009). Jobs-Salary.com: "A total of 18 real of counsel salary data listed. Salary Average: $216,019 Salary Range: $62,000 $400,000", ranging from 2003 to 2009. Retrieved from http://www.jobs-salary.com/of-counsel-salary.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At highly prestigious law firms, an "of counsel" may make as much as US$375,000 per year.&lt;ref name="barnes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3406">'''Permission culture''' is a term often employed by [[Lawrence Lessig]] and other [[Copyright reform movement|copyright activist]]s such as [[Luis Villa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lu.is/blog/2013/01/27/taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/ Pushing back against licensing and the permission culture] on lu.is (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nina Paley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ninapaley.com/2013/12/07/make-art-not-law-2/ make-art-not-law] on ninapaley.com (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[society]] in which [[copyright]] restrictions are pervasive and enforced to the extent that any and all uses of copyrighted works need to be explicitly leased. This has both economic and social implications: in such a society, copyright holders could require payment for each use of a work and, perhaps more importantly, permission to make any sort of [[derivative work]].

Lawrence Lessig describes permission culture in contrast with [[free culture movement|free culture]]. While permission culture describes a society in which previous creators or those with power must grant people permission to use material, free culture ensures that anyone is able to create without restrictions from the past. An example Lessig cites in his book, ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', is photography. In this example, if the legal environment surrounding the early stages of photography had been stricter with what constituted ownership and leaned more towards permission culture, photography would have developed in a drastically different manner and would be limited.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence. Free Culture. The Penguin Group, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An implication of permission culture is that creators are blocked by systemic procedures and this discourages innovation. Requiring permission in this sense means that creators will have to prove their usage of material is fair, even where legally unnecessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright, Creative Commons and other Calamities in Scientific Publishing|url=http://governancexborders.com/2015/05/10/copyright-creative-commons-and-other-calamities-in-scientific-publishing/|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a process that some would decide not to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masnick |first=Mike |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101227/09520712421/permission-culture-automated-diminishment-fair-use.shtml |title=Permission Culture And The Automated Diminishment Of Fair Use |publisher=Techdirt |date=December 27, 2010 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term is often contrasted with [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|title=Digital Copyright and the Consumer Revolution: Hands Off My iPod|year=2007|publisher=Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-84542-948-5|pages=261–262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=%22permission%20culture%22%20remix%20culture&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">A '''proxy firm''' (also a proxy advisor, proxy adviser, proxy voting agency, vote service provider or shareholder voting research provider) provides services to shareholders (in most cases an [[institutional investor]] of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, quoted companies.

The typical services provided include agenda translation, provision of vote management software, voting policy development, company research, and vote administration including vote execution. According to their websites, not all firms provide voting recommendations and those that do may simply execute client voting instructions.

The votes executed are called "Proxy Votes" because the shareholder usually does not attend the meeting and instead sends instructions - a proxy appointment - for a third party, usually the chairman of the meeting to vote shares in accordance with the instructions given on the voting card.

==Global industry==
Firms in the industry include:

According to their websites, most industry participants offer global coverage.

== Controversial role==
The role of proxy firms has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years, most notably from the US corporate lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/controversy-ignites-competition-among-proxy/story.aspx?guid=BD711286-71DE-4D3B-939F-9C6B9F1BC100|title=Controversy ignites competition among proxy firms|author=Alistair Barr &amp; Jonathan Burton|publisher=Marketwatch|date=2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dent|first=George W.|date=2014-01-01|title=A Defense of Proxy Advisors|ssrn=2451240|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the US Securities and Exchange Commission fined ISS $300,000 for revealing non-public information in respect of clients proxy votes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171574952|title=SEC.gov {{!}} SEC Charges Institutional Shareholder Services in Breach of Clients' Confidential Proxy Voting Information|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts of interest ==
A potential conflict of interest identified by the [[Government Accountability Office]] is that some owners of proxy firms do business with both issuers and investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerdonassociates.com/News-Detail.asp?cid=&amp;navID=&amp;NewsID=198|title=The influence of proxy advisory firms on executive remuneration|date=2007-01-10|publisher=Guerdon Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of executive remuneration, or executive pay, is a notable feature of the work of shareholder voting research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/01/15/proxy-firm-questions-tyson-chiefs-pay/|title=Proxy firm questions Tyson chief's pay|author=Zac Bissonnette|date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some policymakers believe that increasing competition in the industry may improve service quality. For example, in 2010 a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission consultation document asked whether certain issues in the proxy advisory industry, including conflicts of interest, are affected by limited competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2010/34-62495.pdf|title=Proxy Plumbing Concept Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of conduct==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7079">The '''Railroad Track Maintenance Tax Credit''', also known as the '''45G Tax Credit''', is a federal income tax credit for track maintenance conducted by [[short-line railroad|short lines]] and [[regional railroad]]s in the [[United States]]. The credit granted an amount equal to 50% of qualified track maintenance expenditures and other qualifying railroad infrastructure projects. It was inserted into the tax code by the [[American Jobs Creation Act of 2004]], and was taken into effect on January 1, 2005 with an expiration date of December 31, 2009.  Following the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], signed into law on December 17, 2010, the tax credit was retroactively extended for 2010 and the expiration date moved to January 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aslrra.org/legislative/Action_Alert/ |title=45G Short Line Tax Credit Extended through 2011|date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010 | publisher=American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association  |author=Schaick, Jeff V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States fiscal cliff]] legislation retroactively reinstated the tax credit for 2012 when signed into law January 2, 2013.  The tax credit was effective thru December 31, 2013.  &lt;ref name=RR4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssti.us/2013/01/fiscal-cliff-legislation-restores-tax-credit-for-short-line-rail-infrastructure/   |title= Fiscal Cliff legislation restores tax credit for short lines rail infrastructure |publisher=State Smart Transportation Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:THORN-155lb-PS-jointed-joint.jpg|thumb|left|Bonded main line 6-bolt rail joint on a segment of {{convert|155|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}} rail.]]
In the United States, [[short-line railroad|short line]] and regional railroads grew exponentially following [[Staggers Rail Act|railroad deregulation]] in 1980. By 2005 there were more than 500 railroads of this nature, serving small and mid-sized towns that otherwise would have lost rail service. These railroads were responsible for supporting more than 11,000 industrial sites, making them critically important to the local economies of the regions they serve.&lt;ref name=RR2/&gt; Maintenance costs for rail infrastructure is often expensive and difficult for low income railroads to cover, as a result some railroads partnered with the companies they served in order to fund maintenance. In order to assist the railroads with maintaining their infrastructure, the Railroad Track Maintenance Tax Credit was created. With more than $330 million in shortline infrastructure investment made annually, credits of $165 million would be placed back in the hands of the railroads and shippers through the tax credit.&lt;ref name=RR2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/tax_cut_bill_is_good_news_for_short_line_railroads/ |title=Tax Cut Bill is Good News for Shortline Railroads|date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010 | publisher=Logistics Management Modern Materials Handling and Supply Chain Management Review |author=Berman, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Highway and road  infrastructure is maintained by federal and state governments. Freight rail infrastructure is maintained by private sector investments.  Short lines use approximately 184 million gallons of fuel to move 10 million carloads of freight annually.  Trucks would require 540 million gallons to move the same freight.  Short lines keep 30 million truckloads per year off the highway.&lt;ref name=RR3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aslrra.org/legislative/Short_Line_Tax_Credit_Extension/ |title= Short line Tax Credit Extension|publisher=AmericanShort Line and Regional Track Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Jobs Creation Act of 2004==
{{main|American Jobs Creation Act of 2004}}

The tax credit originated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The credit was capped at $3,500 per mile of track, with eligibility for [[Class II railroad|Class II]] and [[Class III railroad|Class III]] railroads, any shippers who transport property using a Class II or Class III railroad, and companies that perform maintenance on or provide material to qualified railroads.&lt;ref name="Tax Almanac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Internal_Revenue_Code:Sec._45G._Railroad_track_maintenance_credit |title=Railroad Track Maintenance Credit|date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010 | publisher=Tax Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of the act in October 2004, the effective date for the credit was December 31, 2004, with a scheduled expiration date of January 1, 2008, a period of 3 years.

==Extension==
{{main|Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010}}

As scheduled, the tax credits expired on January 1, 2008. However, under the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], the tax credit was extended through December 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa-cpa.com/mfa-news-and-resources/tax-alerts/FederalAlert-EmerStableAct-1008.pdf |title=Federal Tax Alert|date=October 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2010 | publisher=Moody, Famiglietti &amp; Andronico |author=DiFilippo, Rosanna }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expiration occurred for the second time as scheduled, however, an extension of the Railroad Maintenance Tax Credit was included in the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]. Under the new legislation, the credit was retroactively applied to the 2010 tax year and extended through January 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=RR/&gt;

==Second Extension==
{{main|American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012}}

[[ United States fiscal cliff]] legislation retroactively reinstated the tax credit for 2012 when signed into law January 2, 2013.  The tax credit was effective thru December 31, 2013.  &lt;ref name=RR6&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssti.us/2013/01/fiscal-cliff-legislation-restores-tax-credit-for-short-line-rail-infrastructure/   |title= Fiscal Cliff legislation restores tax credit for short lines rail infrastructure |publisher=State Smart Transportation Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014 no further extension of the federal tax credit has occurred but proposals in Congress are under consideration.

==IRS Form 8900==
[[Internal Revenue Service]] Form 8900 is used to claim the tax credit by the taxpayer at a maximum of $3500 per short line track mile per year or 50% of qualified railroad track maintenance paid or incurred during the year whichever is less. Form 8900 is used to assign tax credits between eligible taxpayers who have come to an agreement to transfer tax credits.  Eligible taxpayers for this credit are short line railroads, transporters who use the railroad property and any taxpayer who furnishes goods and services to a short line railroad.  Shareholders or partners of these eligible taxpayer may receive a passthru of these credits on form K-1.&lt;ref name=RR5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8900.pdf |title= 2013 Form 8900. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">A '''Request For Evidence''' ('''RFE'''), is a request issued by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] to petitioners for residency, citizenship, family visas, and employment visas. Examples of petitions for which a RFE may be issued are [[Form I-129]] (alien worker authorization), [[Form I-140]] (immigrant worker authorization), and [[Form I-130]] (family visas).&lt;ref name=2005-memo/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013-memo/&gt;

== Situations where it is used ==

The RFE is intended for use in cases where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that there is not enough evidence to approve the petition, but also believes that the petition may be redeemable, and that there is no clear factual or statutory basis for denial.&lt;ref name=2013-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/June%202013/Requests%20for%20Evidence%20%28Final%29.pdf|title = Policy Memorandum|date = June 3, 2013|accessdate = January 16, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RFE, when used, should be as clear as possible about what types of additional evidence are needed to fill in the gap, and what inconsistencies or problems have been found in the evidence submitted so far. It is not intended for use for the adjudicator's reassurance in cases where there is enough evidence to approve the petition.&lt;ref name=2005-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/Archives%201998-2008/2005/rfe021605.pdf|title = Interoffice Memorandum|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = February 16, 2005|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RFE is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or the attorney representing the petitioner, in cases where the petition is filed through an attorney) rather than the beneficiary.

== Related communications ==

=== Differences with NOID ===

The following are some key differences between the RFE and the [[Notice of Intent to Deny]] (NOID):&lt;ref name=2005-memo/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013-memo/&gt;

* ''Likelihood of denial'': The RFE is issued when there is significant uncertainty about whether the petition will be approved, whereas the NOID is generally used when a denial is quite likely.
* ''Accompanying information'': A RFE comes with a list of additional types of evidence needed. A NOID comes equipped with a list of reasons for denial. While the two lists are somewhat related (insofar as a reason for denial translates to a piece of evidence that could overturn the denial) they have different framings.
* ''Time given to respond'': The time given to respond to a RFE is generally greater than that for a NOID.

=== Request for clarification ===

In cases where the USCIS simply needs answers to a few specific questions (such as a complete translation), it simply issues a Request for Clarification instead of a RFE.&lt;ref name=2005-memo/&gt;

== Tips for avoiding RFEs ==

Submitting clear and complete documentation in the petition itself can minimize the need for RFEs. The USCIS website offers the following tips to avoid RFEs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/general-tips-evidence|title = General Tips for Evidence|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = March 3, 2015|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Inconsistencies in documents''' should be explained and evidence to reconcile the incosistencies should be included.
* '''Unavailability of documents''' should be explained with clear evidence.
* '''Probative value''': Some kinds of documents are considered more authoritative and have more probative value. For instance, income tax returns have more probative value than letters from family or friends.
* '''Incomplete translations''' should be avoided. Any documents being submitted in a language other than English must be translated in their entirety.

== Types of evidence requested ==

RFEs typically request one or more of the following types of evidence:
* ability of employer to pay
* periods of current or prior stay in the United States
* prior work experience
* educational details or evaluation
* documents supporting claims of exceptional ability or outstanding research

== Response protocol ==

The time within which the response to a RFE must be sent is indicated on the RFE. It generally varies between 30 and 90 days. If no response is received within the time indicated on the RFE, the USCIS will process the application without considering the additional evidence, which in most cases means a denial (because petitions where there was enough evidence to accept should not have RFEs in the first place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Memorandum: Requests for Evidence  and Notices of Intent to Deny|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/June%202013/Requests%20for%20Evidence%20%28Final%29.pdf|website=USCIS|publisher=United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services|accessdate=20 March 2018|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner has only one chance to respond to a RFE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjudicator's Field Manual, Sec. 10.3 General Adjudication Procedures|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-1067/0-0-0-1166.html|website=USCIS|publisher=United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The petitioner can submit all the requested evidence.
* The petitioner can "partially respond" by submitting some of the requested evidence. The USCIS will use the partial submission along with the earlier submission to evaluate the petition.
* The petitioner can choose not to respond, so a final decision will be based on the original petition. This usually means a denial.
* The petitioner can withdraw the petition.

When responding to a RFE, the petitioner may attach additional pieces of evidence over and above those explicitly requested in the RFE.

== Relation with processing timeline ==

The expected processing time for petitions is generally defined as the time till an approval, denial, RFE, or NOID is issued. Therefore, the time taken while waiting for a response from the petitioner is not counted as part of the processing time. After the petitioner responds, the expected additional processing time is comparable with the processing time for a complete first application.

For petitions that request the [[Premium Processing Service]], the expected processing time to a first response (approval, denial, RFE, or NOID) is 15 days, and the time after receiving a response to the RFE is another 15 days.&lt;ref name=uscis-premium-processing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service|title = How Do I Use the Premium Processing Service?|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Diego County Public Defender''''s office is an agency of the [[government of San Diego County, California]]. It provides [[Legal aid|legal assistance]] to individuals charged with a crime in state court who are financially unable to retain private counsel.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego County Public Defender Website|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/public_defender/|website=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office consists of the Primary Public Defender, the Alternate Public Defender, the Office of Assigned Counsel &amp; the Multiple Conflicts Office.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; Mental health and juvenile court matters are handled by special units within the divisions.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;

Courts within their jurisdiction include the [[California Superior Court|San Diego Superior Court]], the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] for the [[California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District|Fourth District]], and the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]. The [[San Diego County District Attorney]] and the San Diego City Attorney prosecute alleged [[felony]] and [[misdemeanor]] violations of [[California]] [[state law]] that occur within the jurisdiction of [[San Diego County]]. Alleged [[federal law]] violations by indigent defendants are defended by the Federal Defenders of San Diego Inc.

==History==
The San Diego County Public Defender's Office was established in 1988 by a [[San Diego County]] resolution.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; The Alternate Public Defender was established by the Board of Supervisors in 1990.&lt;ref name=apd&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Alternate Public Defender|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/apd/|website=www.sandiegocounty.gov|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases (MCO) was created to represent people who are charged with complicated and serious cases throughout San Diego County and who are financially unable to retain private counsel.&lt;ref name=MCO&gt;{{cite web|title=MCO PD|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/MCO_PD.html|website=www.sandiegocounty.gov|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the County of San Diego consolidated separate [[indigent defense]] offices—Public Defender, Alternate Public Defender, Office of Assigned Counsel, Juvenile Delinquency &amp; Multiple Conflict Office—into one office.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; The office formed a Public Defender Community Outreach Program that strives to connect with partners in San Diego communities to enrich the lives of those less fortunate and assist in securing equal access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SD PD Outreach Program - About Us|url=http://www.pd-outreach.org/about-us.aspx|website=pd-outreach.org|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, San Diego County Public Defenders Kathleen Coyne and Susan Clemens were awarded Public Defender of the Year by the California Public Defender's Association for their work defending Dale Akiki in the [[Faith Chapel Church ritual abuse case]]. Several San Diego County Public Defenders have gone on to become judges in [[California Superior Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Tony|title=Four named San Diego County judges, including son of slain drug agent|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-diego-judges-20140716-story.html|website=latimes.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the office filed over 5,000 petitions—after [[Proposition 47 (2014)]]—to have felony convictions and sentences reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tagharobi|first1=Sherene|title=Prop 47: Nearly 5000 Petitions for Early Release Submitted in San Diego|website=nbcsandiego.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Public Defender==
The San Diego County Primary Public Defender (PPD) provides the majority of indigent defense services in [[San Diego County]]. The Primary Public Defender has five offices in the County: [[downtown San Diego]], [[Vista, California|Vista]] (North County), [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] (South Bay), [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]] (East County), and a Juvenile Office.&lt;ref name=locations&gt;{{cite web|title=SD Public Defender Locations|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/public_defender/locations.html|website=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate Public Defender==
The APD is responsible for defending those cases where the Primary Public Defender has a conflict of interest or is unable to defend the individual for various reasons.&lt;ref name=apd/&gt; The Office of the Alternate Public Defender has two divisions.&lt;ref name=apd/&gt; The Adult Criminal Division—operating out of all APD locations—represents indigent persons accused of a crime.&lt;ref name=apd/&gt; The Juvenile Delinquency Division—out of [[Kearny Mesa]]—represents minors accused of truancy or criminal offenses.&lt;ref name=apd/&gt; The Alternate Public Defender maintains offices in downtown San Diego, El Cajon, South Bay, Vista, and Kearny Mesa.&lt;ref name=apd/&gt;

==Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases==
The Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases (MCO) accepts court appointments that the Public Defender and the Alternate Public Defender are unable to accept due to a [[conflict of interest]] or other order of the court.&lt;ref name=MCO/&gt; MCO represents people who are charged with only the most complicated and serious cases throughout San Diego County.&lt;ref name=MCO/&gt; MCO attorneys possess many years of experience and training for the most serious types of criminal cases.&lt;ref name=MCO/&gt; The MCO is an independent and ethically separate division of the Department of the Public Defender and does not share client information or otherwise interact with attorneys from other divisions on the same case.&lt;ref name=MCO/&gt;

==Office of Assigned Counsel==
If a court finds that the PPD and APD have a [[conflict of interest]], then Office of Assigned Counsel (OAC) will provide the indigent [[defendant]] with a private practitioner who has been pre-screened and placed on a panel managed by the OAC.&lt;ref name=intern&gt;{{cite web|title=Intern, Clerkship &amp; Volunteers|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/public_defender/Volunteers.html|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking''' was a trade treaty between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, signed on 1 December 1887. It is counted by the Chinese as among the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]].

== Background ==
On 13 August 1862, China and Portugal signed the Treaty of Friendship and Trade in [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] (Tianjin). The treaty was largely a trade agreement but it also defined [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]'s political and juridical statue, although it did not directly mention the issue of Portuguese sovereignty.&lt;ref name="mendes"&gt;Mendes, Carmen Amado (2013). ''Portugal, China and the Macau Negotiations, 1986-1999''. Hong Kong University Press. pp. 11–12. {{ISBN|9789888139002}} .&lt;/ref&gt; It contained two clauses regarding Macau's status: Article II annulled earlier agreements and referred to Macau as "formerly in the Province of [[Guangdong|Canton]]", while Article III recognised the status of a "Governor General of Macao". However, China did not ratify the treaty and it become void in 1864.&lt;ref name="ride"&gt;Ride, Lindsay; Ride, May (1989). ''The Voices of Macao Stones''. Hong Kong University Press. pp. 54–56. {{ISBN|9622094872}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1886, a joint Sino-British commission advised that the administrative responsibility for controlling the import of opium into China should be transferred from the [[Hoppo]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) to the Chinese [[Imperial Maritime Customs Service]]. Although Britain and China agreed to this, it could not be fully successful without Portuguese involvement. In 1887, China sent a diplomatic mission to [[Lisbon]], which included James Campbell, a senior British member of the service, representing the superintendent of the customs service [[Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Hart]]. On 26 March 1887, Campbell and Portuguese Foreign Minister [[Henrique de Barros Gomes]] signed the four-point Lisbon Protocol:&lt;ref name="mayers"&gt;[[William Frederick Mayers|Mayers, William Frederick]] (1902). ''[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023464278#page/n177/mode/2up Treaties Between the Empire of China and Foreign Powers]'' (4th ed.). Shanghai: North-China Herald. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Art. 1st.—A Treaty of friendship and commerce with the [[most favoured nation]] clause will be concluded and signed at [[Peking]].

Art. 2nd.—China confirms perpetual occupation and government of Macao and its dependencies by Portugal, as any other Portuguese possession.

Art. 3rd.—Portugal engages never to alienate Macao and its dependencies without agreement with China.

Art. 4th.—Portugal engages to co-operate in opium revenue work at Macao in the same way as England at [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Terms ==
Portugal followed up on this agreement by sending an envoy to Peking (Beijing), where a treaty of amity and commerce based on the protocol was drawn up.&lt;ref name="ride" /&gt; On 1 December 1887, the Treaty of Peking was signed by Chinese representatives [[Prince Ch'ing]] and Sun Iu-uen, and Tomas de Sousa Rosa for Portugal on 1 December 1887. It contained 54 articles and was ratified on 28 April 1888.&lt;ref name="mayers" /&gt; Articles II and III stated:&lt;ref name="ride" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
II. China confirms, in its entirety, the second Article of the Protocol of Lisbon, relating to the perpetual occupation and government of Macao by Portugal.

III. Portugal confirms, in its entirety, the third Article of the Protocol of Lisbon, relating to the engagement never to alienate Macao without previous agreement with China.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Portuguese interpretation, sovereignty over Macau was surrendered to Portugal. In the Chinese interpretation, only administrative rights were transferred.

== Aftermath ==
After December 1887, issues related to rent payments and the presence of a Chinese custom house or resident [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] in Macau became irrelevant outside of academic interest.&lt;ref name="ride" /&gt; The early 20th century marked a new era for both countries, with [[1910 revolution|Portugal's 1910]] and [[1911 revolution|China's 1911]] republican revolutions establishing new governments. A growing nationalist movement in China voiced disapproval of the treaty and questioned its validity. These contentions manifested themselves in the unresolved topic of Macau's border demarcation.&lt;ref name="mendes" /&gt; Although the Nationalist ([[Kuomintang]]) government in China vowed to abrogate the "[[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]", Macau's status remained unchanged. The 1928 Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Friendship and Trade reaffirmed Portuguese administration over Macau.&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;Chan, Ming K. (2003). "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2cf9/860dfb7365dd9b5349b3e3bcafdb4a50ea75.pdf Different Roads to Home: the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty]". ''Journal of Contemporary China'' '''12''' (36): 497–499.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, after the [[Sino-British New Equal Treaty|end of extraterritorial rights]] in China, the Nationalists called for the liquidation of foreign control over Hong Kong and Macau, but they were too preoccupied in the [[Chinese Civil War]] with the Communists to fulfil their goals of a "rights recovery" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Jerome Alan; Chiu, Hungdah (1974). ''People's China and International Law: A Documentary Study''. Vol. 1. Princeton University Press. p. 374. {{ISBN|9780691618692}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 Revolution]] in Portugal, a new decolonisation policy paved the way for Macau's retrocession to the People's Republic of China (PRC).&lt;ref name="chan" /&gt; Portugal offered to withdraw from Macau in late 1974, but China declined the offer in favour of a later time because it sought to preserve international and local confidence in Hong Kong, which was still under British rule, and also because it prioritised the reunification of Taiwan. In January 1975, Portugal recognised the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China and ended ties with the Nationalists in [[Taipei]]. In 1976, Portugal unilaterally changed the legal designation of Macau from a "colony" to "territory under Portuguese administration".&lt;ref name="chan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Ming K.; Chan, Shiu-hing Lo (2006). ''The A to Z of the Hong Kong SAR and the Macao SAR''. Plymouth: Scarecrow Press. p. 283. {{ISBN|9780810876330}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the [[Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration]] was signed and Macau became a "Chinese territory under Portuguese administration".&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, Jorge; Cardinal, Paulo, eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8280">{{Distinguish|rolling election}}

In '''staggered elections''', not all places in an elected body are up for election at the same time. For example, United States [[Senate of the United States|Senators]] have a six-year term, but they are not all elected at the same time. Rather, elections are held every two years for [[Classes of United States Senators|one-third of Senate seats]].

Staggered elections have the effect of limiting control of a representative body by the body being represented, but can also minimize the impact of [[cumulative voting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[companies]] use staggered elections as a tool to prevent [[takeover]] attempts. Some legislative bodies (most commonly [[upper house]]s) use staggered elections, as do some public bodies, such as the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

==Application in business==
A '''staggered board of directors''' or '''classified board''' is a prominent practice in [[US corporate law]] governing the [[board of directors]] of a [[company]], [[corporation]], or other organization, in which only a fraction (often one third) of the members of the board of directors is elected each time instead of en masse (where all directors have one-year terms).  Each group of directors falls within a specified "class"—e.g., Class I, Class II, etc.—hence the use of the term "classified" board.&lt;ref&gt;See Faleye,O., 2007, Classified Boards, Firm value, and [[Management entrenchment|Managerial Entrenchment]], Journal of Financial Economics83, 501-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly held companies, staggered boards have the effect of making hostile [[takeover]] attempts more difficult.  When a board is staggered, hostile bidders must win more than one [[proxy fight]] at successive shareholder meetings in order to exercise control of the target [[corporation|firm]].  Particularly in combination with a [[poison pill]], a staggered board that cannot be dismantled or evaded is one of the most potent takeover defenses available to U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucian Bebchuk]], John C. Coates IV, and Guhan Subramanian, The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards:  Theory, Evidence, and Policy, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 887 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In corporate [[cumulative voting]] systems, staggering has two basic effects: it makes it more difficult for minorities to elect directors, as the fewer directorships up for election requires a larger per cent of the equity to win; and it makes takeover attempts less likely to succeed as it is harder to vote in a majority of new directors.&lt;ref name="corpfinance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillier|first1=David|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|last3=Westerfield|first3=Randolph|last4=Jaffe|first4=Jeffrey|last5=Jordan|first5=Bradford|title=Corporate Finance|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=Berkshire|isbn=9780077139148|pages=34–35|edition=2nd European}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staggering may also however serve a more beneficial purpose, that is provide "institutional memory" — continuity in the board of directors — which may be significant for corporations with long-range projects and plans.&lt;ref name="corpfinance"/&gt;

Institutional shareholders are increasingly calling for an end to staggered boards of directors—also called "declassifying" the boards.  ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in January 2007 that 2006 marked a key switch in the trend toward declassification or annual votes on all directors: more than half (55%) of the S&amp;P 500 companies have declassified boards, compared with 47% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Jared A. Favole, "Big Firms Increasingly Declassify Boards", The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''undress code''' is a [[dress code]] or [[social norm]] which sets an upper limit on the amount of [[clothing]] that can or should be worn. {{cn|date=September 2018}} 

Promoters of the entertainment industry, including sport, attempt to "sex-up" the entertainment by under-dressing the entertainers or sportspeople. For example, in 1999, the [[beach volleyball]] regulatory body set a limit on the amount of clothing allowed for the athletes to wear during competition. These require only swimsuits as uniforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/STYLE/9901/13/vollyball.bikini/ |title=Bikini blues – Beach volleyball makes the swimsuit standard |website=CNN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813055124/http://www.cnn.com/STYLE/9901/13/vollyball.bikini/ |archivedate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to [[Beach volleyball#Uniform controversy|some controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.toxicclub.com/2015/controversy-over-women-athletes-shedding-their-clothes-in-field/ |title=Beach Volleyball dress shed controversy |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, organisers of some [[swimsuit competition]]s set a low maximum threshold for swimwear for contestants.
 
The social norm in some countries is to wear considerably less or briefer clothing than in others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article619936.ece The undress code that’s the height of teen fashion] From The Times August 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions since the mid-20th century has been towards briefer, more [[form-fitting]] styles, as well as thinner and [[See-through clothing|sheer]] materials. In some cultures, including some in Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia/Oceania, traditional dress consists of less clothing than those of the West. Some religious traditions or rituals require the members to be nude, as was the case with the ancient Indian [[Gymnosophists]] or the Christian sect of the [[Adamites]] (the custom is still practised by [[ascetic]]s of certain [[Indian religions]], as in [[Jainism]]). (see also [[Christian naturism]]).

Laws in many countries require a person to undress in some circumstances when requested by a customs or police officer in a [[strip search]].

The employer or the employee often does so for [[tax evasion]] or avoiding or violating other laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the "Shadow Economy"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working contract is made without [[social security]] costs, and does typically not provide [[health insurance]], paid [[parental leave]], paid [[vacation]] or [[pension fund]]s. It is a part of what has been called the [[underground economy]], [[shadow economy]], [[black market]] or the non-observed economy. 

Payments are generally in cash, and the employer often does not check the employee's background or [[credential]]s, as is sometimes required by law or otherwise expected by the industry's client base, such as a [[license]] or [[professional certification]].

While the hiring of the employee may or may not be legal in itself, it is often done when the employer or the employee intentionally fails to obey one or more laws.

==Common jobs==
Common types of [[employment]] sectors of unreported jobs include the following:
*[[Domestic worker|Domestic work]], such as [[homemaking|housekeeping]], [[babysitting]], or [[foodservice]]
*[[Construction worker|Construction work]], [[landscaping]], [[farmworker|farm work]]
*[[Taxicab]] service (sometimes known as [[illegal taxicab operation|hacking]])
*Various types of [[self-employment]], such as [[plumber|plumbing]], [[electrician]], [[window cleaner|window cleaning]], [[house painter and decorator|painting and decorating]], [[street market|street market trading]], and [[gardener|gardening]]
*Short-term work and day laborers
*Short-term youth employment
*[[wikt:barback|Barbacking]] and restaurant work.
*[[Human trafficking]]
*[[Prostitution]]
*Fixing cars, motorcycles, and mopeds

==Reasons==

Reasons one may work or pay a worker cash-in-hand include:
*Avoidance of wage [[garnishment]] or payment of [[child support]] or [[alimony]]
*Cheaper workforce and avoidance of [[minimum wage]] laws
*Convenience for both parties
*Elimination of paperwork, bookkeeping, and regulation compliance
*Reduced/eliminated expenses or need for bookkeepers, human resource specialists, lawyers, accountants, payroll services, insurance agents and other employment specialists
*Not checking or showing a [[criminal record]]
*Protesting actions or policies of the governing authorities (see [[agorism]])
*Evasion of [[insurance]] requirements
*Flexibility in hiring short-term employees without excessive overhead or paperwork
*Avoid allowable income limits by a person receiving certain benefits, such as [[unemployment benefits|unemployment]], [[social security disability|disability]], or [[public assistance]]
*[[Fugitive]], [[illegal immigration]], or [[organized crime]]
*[[Tax noncompliance]], [[tax resistance]], or [[social security]] evasion
* Ability to hire employees according to personal traits not related to suitability for employment (eg gender, sexuality, ethnic/religious affiliations etc)
* Ability to hire those who were formerly qualified, and still potentially able to do the job -- eg blacklisted, disbarred, forced retirement, struck off, etc

==Disadvantages==
Unreported employment can have harmful effects on government, employers, and employees.

Unreported employment directly affects the government's ability to fund resources ([[government spending]]). It causes a tax gap by the reducing tax revenue of a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America’s Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L.  |author2=Cebula, Richard  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[University of California, Los Angeles]] study showed that the economy in [[California]] was particularly weak by more than two million workers being paid without paying taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/09/28/BUG92EURPQ1.DTL&amp;type=business | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Tom | last=Abate | title=Weak outlook for state seen / Many are working under the table, UCLA group says | date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it's estimated that over US $214.6 billion went unreported to the IRS last year alone from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.finder.com/side-hustle | work=finder.com | first=Jennifer | last=McDermott | title=Side hustles and tax evasion: The telling statistics | date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those who are employed under the table, including illegal immigrants, may be denied rights that legally employed workers have, such as minimum wage, various benefits (particularly unemployment benefits), and fair treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/business/19illegals.html | work=The New York Times | first=Eduardo | last=Porter | title=Here Illegally, Working Hard and Paying Taxes | date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under-the-table employees who [[firing|lose their jobs]] may not be entitled to collect unemployment benefits. They have limited causes of action against their employers for mistreatment, on-the-job [[work accident]]s or lack of payment. Employers have limited cause of actions against employees who commit crimes such as [[embezzlement]], [[theft]], or abuse of employer.

If practices are widespread, legitimate businesses may be undercut by and have difficultly competing with those who employ staff illegally.

Government revenue agencies look for lifestyles out of line with the income reported. They have tools that aid in assessing unreported taxes, which can result in large fines or jail time for the employer.

==Advantages==
{{NPOV language|date=December 2014}}
Many new entrepreneurs fail to report their first part-time hired employees. The complexity of employment regulations and large amount of paperwork can be daunting to a new entrepreneur, especially when someone is needed for only a few hours a week. That early underground early employment may be a vital step in the growth of a healthy open economy.

[[Day laborers]] fill immediate gaps during labor shortages in some segments of the construction and landscape industries. Background checks, identification, required paperwork, and government filings for only a day's work can be prohibitive. That encourages unreported employment of short-term laborers.

A large amount of work for only a day or two is unreported. Although nanny laws make allowances for the homeowner, businesses are typically required to fill out and file several hours worth of paperwork even for an hour's worth of work.

The amounts are too small for tax collecting agencies to pursue and the paper work too arduous to file and so legitimate micro-employment among businesses is rare. However, it is an important resource for many small businesses.

In professional fields like architecture, or marketing, unreported work is typically the first step to starting a legitimate business.

Again, paperwork, compliance, and knowledge of labor laws are prohibitive for the small amount of work that is performed. Although illegal, side business generate relatively little revenue and so are rarely the target of tax enforcers. Eventually, professional employees have enough work to be able to leave their employer and become independent. Then, paperwork is usually filed and [[self-employment tax]]es are reported. The business then becomes a legitimate and beneficial part of the economy.

Those who are unlikely to find employment through the reported economy, including those with past criminal records or current warrants as well as illegal immigrants can be reasonably productive and self-sufficient. That keeps them from engaging in less-desirable activities like theft and drug use.

Self-employment in [[cottage industries]] is often unreported at first. A home cook for example, may sell a few pies to friends and co-workers without filing necessary sales taxes or self-employment taxes. Although that is usually illegal, it may lead to a legitimate and beneficial business and is often how small businesses are started.

In some countries, the tax system attempts to set minimum thresholds on the amounts liable. However, there is still the burden of compliance with the bookkeeping requirements to prove that one is exempt.

Short-term youth employment is often unreported but can be very beneficial. A teenager hired to aid in constructing a shed or barn, for example, learns valuable skills and responsibility.{{Citation needed|reason=No proof of teaching responsibility.|date=October 2013}} Most youth would not be employed for short-term projects if employment had to be reported. Government revenue collectors typically ignore enforcement of such of beneficial, unreported employment. Youth-run lemonade stands that have been shut down by police for example have received an enormous amount of bad press and public outcry.

It has been argued that because illegal immigrants are unable or unlikely to take advantage of unemployment, welfare, and retirement benefits, they are less likely to be unemployed and are more likely to contribute to a productive society. That view also argues that in states that rely primarily on [[sales tax]] as revenue instead of [[income tax]], illegal immigrants may contribute more in [[government revenues]] than the government benefits they receive thereby creating a net positive [[revenue stream]] for the governing body.

==Enforcement==
Often, both the employer and employee agree on paying in cash. Frequently, the employer is running an unreported cash-based business. These methods make detection by authorities to be time-consuming and difficult. Most small-scale operations take place without any real enforcement effort. Lawn-mowing is a good example of a cash-based business that is frequently unreported.

In the [[United States]], authorities have focused enforcement resources on large-scale operations like illegal immigrants who are employed by large companies. Discovery and enforcement of small-scaled unreported employment is typically through a secondary indiscretion like fraud, tax irregularities, and unrelated or partially-related civil/criminal violations of the employer or employee.

Although the federal government may arrest, prosecute, and imprison an individual for engaging in commerce without the state's approval, the high cost of such enforcement is usually prohibitive except for the most egregious cases.

==Examples==
===United States===
According to a ''[[The New York Times]]'' report in February 2013, the [[Obama administration]] had demonstrated a new strategy to curb the employment of illegal immigrants by focusing on companies that hire them in the first place. By concentrating on the businesses employing the large numbers of illegal workers, the number of illegal immigrants working in the US would drop dramatically. The U.S. government would be doing so in a less confrontational manner than they had in recent years.&lt;ref name="Illicit Work"&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=Julia|title=US Shifts Strategy on Illicit Work by Immigrants|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03immig.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Apparel incident====
In 2009, [[American Apparel]] was convicted of having workers that partook in illicit work. About 1,800 of American Apparel's employees were illegal immigrants who were not authorized to work in the [[United States]]. No federal agents stormed into the company's factory demanding the employees to be deported, but rather sent a written notice that stated that American Apparel faced civil fines and would have to fire all workers who were unauthorized to be in the [[United States]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The '''Wilmington Ten''' were nine young men and a woman, who were wrongfully convicted in 1971 in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] of [[arson]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. Most were sentenced to 29 years in prison, and all ten served nearly a decade in jail before an appeal won their release. The case became an international ''[[cause célèbre]]'', in which many critics of the city and state characterized the activists as political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://web.mit.edu/esg-conscience/www/resr/mmr-young.shtml |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=July 31, 1978 |page=23 |accessdate=2007-12-14 |title=US Political Prisoners? |author1=Franker, Susan |author2=Smith, Vern E. |author3=Lee, Elliott D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] took up the case in 1976 and provided legal defense counsel to appeal the convictions.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt; In 1978, Governor [[Jim Hunt]] reduced the sentences of the ten defendants. In 1980 in ''Chavis v. State of North Carolina'', 637 F.2d 213 (4th Cir., 1980), the convictions were overturned by the federal appeals court, on the grounds that the prosecutor and the trial judge had both violated the defendants' constitutional rights. They were not retried. In 2012 the surviving members of the Ten were pardoned by Governor [[Beverly Perdue]].

==Background==
In the 1960s and 1970s, black residents of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] were dissatisfied with the lack of progress in implementing integration and other civil rights reforms achieved by the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] through congressional passage of civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965. Many struggled with poverty and lack of opportunity. Despair at the 1968 [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] increased racial tensions, with a rise in violence, including the arson of several white-owned businesses.

Racial tension increased further after the 1969 [[Desegregation|integration]] of Wilmington high schools. The city chose to close the black [[Williston Industrial High School]], a source of community pride. It laid off black teachers, principals, and coaches, transferring students among white-majority schools.&lt;ref name="Siceloff"/&gt; The school board did little to prepare whites or blacks for these changes. The school administration resisted meeting with students to hear their grievances, including separation from friends and the lack of opportunity to play sports in new schools.&lt;ref name="Colatuno"&gt;Laura Colatuno, ''The Wilmington Ten: A Story Retold'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Several clashes between white and black students resulted in a number of arrests and expulsions.

In response to tensions, members of a [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter and other [[white supremacist]] groups began patrolling the streets. They hung an effigy of the white superintendent of the schools and cut his phone lines. Street violence broke out between them and black men.&lt;ref name=Graham2005&gt;

Students decided to boycott the high schools in January 1971. In February, the [[United Church of Christ]] sent [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad|Reverend Benjamin Chavis, Jr.]], from their [[Commission for Racial Justice]], to Wilmington to try to calm the situation and work with the students. He preached non-violence and met with students regularly at [[Gregory Congregational Church]] to discuss black history, as well as to organize the boycott.

==Arson at Mike's Grocery and trial==
On February 6, 1971, Mike's Grocery, a white-owned business, was firebombed. [[Firefighters]] responding to the fire said they were shot at by [[snipers]] from the roof of the nearby Gregory Congregational Church. Chavis and several students had been meeting at the church, which also held other people. The neighborhood erupted in rioting that lasted through the next day, in which two people died.

The North Carolina governor called up the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose forces entered the church on February 8 and removed the suspects. The Guard claimed to have found ammunition in the building. The violence resulted in two deaths, six injuries, and more than [[USD|$]]500,000 in property damage.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt;

Chavis and nine others, eight young black men who were high school students, and an older, [[White American|white]], female anti-poverty worker, were arrested on charges of arson related to the grocery fire. Based on testimony of two black men, they were tried and convicted in state court of arson and conspiracy in connection with the firebombing of Mike's Grocery.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt; They were sentenced to a total of 282 years in prison.

The "Ten" and their sentences: 
* Benjamin Chavis (age 24) - 34 years
* Connie Tindall (age 21) - 31 years
* Marvin "Chili" Patrick (age 19) - 29 years
* Wayne Moore (age 19) - 29 years
* Reginald Epps (age 18) - 28 years
* Jerry Jacobs (age 19) - 29 years
* James "Bun" McKoy (age 19) - 29 years
* Willie Earl Vereen (age 18) - 29 years
* William "Joe" Wright, Jr. (age 19) - 29 years
* Ann Shepard (age 35) - 15 years

==Trial and sentencing==
At the time, the state's case against the Wilmington Ten was seen as controversial both in the state of [[North Carolina]] and in the [[United States]]. One witness testified that he was given a [[minibike]] in exchange for his testimony against the group. Another witness, Allen Hall, had a history of [[mental illness]] and had to be removed from the courthouse after recanting on the stand under [[cross examination]].

Each of the ten defendants was convicted of the charges. The men's sentences ranged from 29 years to 34 years for arson, considered severe punishment for a fire in which no one died.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; Ann Shepard of [[Auburn, New York]], age 35, received 15 years as an accessory before the fact and conspiracy to assault emergency personnel. The youngest of the group, Earl Vereen, was 18 years old at the time of his sentencing. Reverend Chavis was the oldest of the men at age 24. The sentences totaled 282 years.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

==International response==
Several national magazines, including ''[[Time Magazine|Time]],'' ''[[Newsweek]],'' ''[[Sepia Magazine|Sepia]]'' and ''[[The New York Times Magazine]],'' published articles in the late 1970s on the trial and its aftermath. When then [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] admonished the [[Soviet Union]] in 1978 for holding [[political prisoner]]s, the Soviets cited the Wilmington Ten as an example of American political imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt;

==Appeals==
[[Amnesty International]] took on the Wilmington Ten case in 1976.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt;  They classified the eight men still in prison as among 11 black men incarcerated in the U.S. who were considered to be political prisoners, under the definition in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

In 1976 and 1977, three key prosecution witnesses recanted their testimony.&lt;ref name="Siceloff"/&gt; In 1977 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' aired a special about the case, suggesting that the evidence against the Wilmington Ten was fabricated.&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt; In 1978, the ''New York Times'' reporter Wayne King published an investigatory article; based on testimony of a witness whose anonymity he protected, he said that perhaps the prosecution had framed a guilty man, as his source said that he had committed the crimes at the behest of Chavis.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Wayne King, "The Case Against the Wilmington Ten," ''New York Times Magazine,'' 3 December 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Governor [[Jim Hunt]] reduced the sentences of the Ten.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;[https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/jan/15/north-carolina-governor-pardons-wilmington-10/ "North Carolina Governor Pardons Wilmington 10"], ''Prison Legal News'', January 2013; accessed 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1980, the [[4th Circuit Court of Appeals]], a federal court, overturned the convictions, as it determined that (1) the prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, in violation of the defendants' due process rights (the [[Brady rule]]]); and (2) the trial judge erred by limiting the cross-examination of key prosecution witnesses about special treatment the witnesses received in connection with their testimony, in violation of the defendants' [[6th Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]] right to confront the witnesses against them. ''Chavis v. State of North Carolina,'' 637 F.2d 213 (4th Cir. 1980).&lt;ref name=Graham2005/&gt; It ordered a new trial, but the state chose not to prosecute again. Chavis and the other seven prisoners were released.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

A group called the [[Wilmington Ten Foundation for Social Justice]] was established to work to improve conditions in the city.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Pardon ==

In May 2012, Benjamin Chavis and six surviving members of the group petitioned North Carolina governor [[Beverly Perdue]] for a pardon. The [[NAACP]] supported the pardon, as well as arguing for compensation to be paid to the men and their survivors for their years in jail.&lt;ref name="Siceloff"&gt;[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/05/18/3250354/four-decades-later-ben-chavis.html "Four decades later, Ben Chavis and the Wilmington Ten seek a declaration of innocence"], ''Charlotte News Observer'', 18 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 22, 2012 ''The New York Times'' published an editorial titled, "Pardons for the Wilmington Ten", that urged Governor Perdue to "finally pardon" the group of civil rights activists.
 
Perdue granted a pardon of innocence for each of the ten on December 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="Pardon"&gt;[http://www.governor.nc.gov/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=2709 "Gov. Perdue Issues Pardon of Innocence for Wilmington 10"] (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/6DKtWCGSL), Office of the Governor, December 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The pardon qualified each of the ten to state compensation of $50,000 per year of incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Emery P. Dalesio, AP (17 May 2012), [http://bigstory.ap.org/content/wilmington-10-pardons-sought-nc-race-riot-case Wilmington 10: Pardons Sought in NC Race-Riot Case], ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims were approved by the [[North Carolina Industrial Commission]] and signed off on by the [[Attorney General of North Carolina|Attorney General]] [[Roy Cooper]]'s office in May 2013. Total compensation was $1,113,605:  Ben Chavis received $244,470, Marvin Patrick received $187,984, with most of the remaining rewards being $175,000 each.  As four of the Wilmington Ten were deceased at this date, their families received no compensation.  A case is currently pending before the NC Industrial Commission seeking that compensation be awarded to the families of the four deceased; Jerry Jacobs, Ann Shepard, Connie Tindall, and Joe Wright. &lt;ref&gt;(Information obtained from an article in the ''Charlotte Observer'', February 14, 2014)&lt;!-- Provide author and title of article --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
