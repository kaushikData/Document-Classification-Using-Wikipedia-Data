'''Alberto Vilar''', a.k.a. '''Albert Vilar''', (born October 4, 1940) is an American former investment manager who became particularly known as a [[patron]] of [[opera]] companies, performing arts organizations, and educational institutions.  Following the collapse of his investment firm, [[Amerindo Investment Advisors]], he was tried and convicted in November 2008 on charges of [[money laundering]], investment advisor fraud, [[securities fraud]], [[mail and wire fraud]].  He was sentenced in February 2010 to nine years in prison and released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.vaildaily.com/news/former-vail-valley-arts-patron-alberto-vilar-trying-to-enjoy-whats-left-of-his-life-after-10-year-prison-stint/ | title=Former Vail Valley arts patron Alberto Vilar trying to enjoy what;s left of his life after 10-year prison stint | work=Vail Daily | author=Randy Wyrick | date=2018-10-16 | accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Originally from [[West Orange, New Jersey]], Vilar earned an economics degree from [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]], a liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania. He then earned a master's degree in economics at [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] in New Rochelle, New York. In 1979, along with [[Gary Tanaka]], he founded [[Amerindo Investment Advisors]], an investment advisory firm based in San Francisco and New York, with offices in London. In 1981, Vilar made his first $1 million. Amerindo's main investment activities were in technology funds, which the stock market crash of 2000 severely affected.  The value of the Amerindo funds declined sharply, and Vilar began to default on his pledges to arts institutions.&lt;ref name="Wakin1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/arts/22vila.html?pagewanted=all | title=As His Fraud Trial Begins, Fallen Arts Patron Decries His Prosecution | work=New York Times | author=Daniel J Wakin | date=2008-09-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilar has served on the Washington &amp; Jefferson College Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="Crompton"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Janice Crompton | title=Prosecutors fear W&amp;J alumnus will flee | work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette | date=2008-12-14 | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/washington/2008/12/14/Prosecutors-fear-W-J-alumnus-will-flee/stories/200812140265 | accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations to opera companies and other organizations==
The arts organisations to which Vilar pledged donations included:
* [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] (ROH) in central London, where the Floral Hall, one of the major foyers of the redeveloped house, was named the "Vilar Floral Hall" in recognition of a 1999 pledge of £10 million. The ROH changed the name of its atrium to the Floral Hall in September 2005 after Vilar paid only a fraction of his original £10 million pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6638245.stm | work=BBC News | title=£10m pledged to Royal Opera House | date=May 9, 2007 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he pledged money for the "Young Artists Programme", several opera production sponsorships, and for the installation of seat back titles in the main auditorium.
* The [[Salzburg Festival]] received its largest donation in its 81-year history from Vilar. He in turn received a full-page color photo of himself in every program book.
* [[Metropolitan Opera]] was pledged amounts thought to total $45 million. With $12 million actually given to the company, he remains as its third largest donor.
* The Kirov Opera located in the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg, Russia has been another major beneficiary of Vilar's support, which is said to have been around $14 million and was focused primarily on supporting the summer [[White Nights Festival]].
* Washington DC's [[Kennedy Center]], under its President, [[Michael Kaiser]] who had developed a relationship with Vilar when the former was at the Royal Opera House, received donations to create an arts-management program, the "Vilar Institute for Arts Management" plus pledges for a program to bring the Kirov Opera to the Center on an annual basis. In 2001 Vilar pledged $50 million toward the Center's activities. Again, actual payments fell short, and the Center has had to seek alternative sources of financial support.
* The [[Washington National Opera]] and the [[Los Angeles Opera]] both received support from Vilar due to his connection to [[Plácido Domingo]], who was then the General and Artistic Director of both companies. $10 million was pledged to each company.
* The [[Maazel-Vilar Conductor's Competition]].
* [[New York University]] has the ''Alberto Vilar Global Fellows in the Performing Arts'' program, which began in 2002 with a $23.4 million donation to attract and bring young performing artists to study in New York for two years. It has been described by NYU as a [[Rhodes Scholars]]-style program.
* [[Beaver Creek, Colorado]] has the ''Vilar Center for the Arts'' and the Ford Amphitheater/Vilar Pavilion in [[Vail, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="Wyrick"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vaildaily.com/article/20121002/NEWS/121009979 | title=Vail Valley philanthropist Vilar to be free on bail | work=Vail Daily | author=Randy Wyrick | date=2012-10-02 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washington &amp; Jefferson College began construction of a new technology building, which was to be named "[[The Vilar Technology Center]]," based on a multimillion-dollar pledge by Vilar. With the pledge failing to fully materialize, funds were diverted from elsewhere, allowing for the scaled back building, along with its scaled back name of the "Technology Center" to be completed.
* [[Vilar Distinguished Artist Series]] at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, featuring [[Lorin Maazel]] and [[Susan Graham]]&lt;ref name="Crompton"/&gt;

As a result of his philanthropy, in 2002 the [[Americans for the Arts]] organization gave him their National Arts Award, for "Corporate Citizenship in the Arts".

As noted in James Stewart's 2006 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of Vilar, at some point in 2002, Vilar was hospitalized for a series of operations on his back, and he claims to have nearly died as the result of complications: "they were ready to give me the last rites".&lt;ref&gt;James Stewart, "The Opera Lover"&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation that he might have missed some planned donations as the result of his illness.

A lasting effect, however, clearly came from the severe decline in his personal fortune due to the crash in technology stocks around 2000. It is documented that Vilar still continued to make pledges even as his personal and his company's fortunes continued to plunge. Among the pledges were $5 million for money for voice loss research after meeting [[Julie Andrews]] and $30 million to a Berlin opera company: "Asking Alberto for money was like offering an alcoholic a drink".&lt;ref&gt;A close friend of Vilar's quoted in Stewart, "The Opera Lover"&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his pledges were never paid.

==Fraud conviction==
Vilar and Tanaka were arrested on May 26, 2005, on charges of securities fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Mattison, [http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/2162.html "Opera Patron Alberto Vilar Jailed on Fraud Charges"], ''playbillarts'', May 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/27/news/newsmakers/Vilar_investor/index.htm?cnn=yes "Once a billionaire, now a prisoner: Scandal dogs tech investor Alberto Vilar, accused of fleecing investors out of millions of dollars"] money.cnn, May 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The government claimed that the two appropriated as much as $5 million of an Amerindo client Lily Cates' (heiress and mother of actress [[Phoebe Cates]]) money for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golding|first=Bruce|title='Lawsuit Threat' by Opera Guy|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_ovf7LQBdVMiJGYQo5WXt1N|work=New York Post|accessdate=June 5, 2011|date=October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that Vilar used the money to pay for some home repairs and to make good on previously-promised charitable contributions. It was also alleged that Tanaka used money to purchase thoroughbred race horses. The [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] also filed a civil suit.
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/06/alberto_vilar_s.html "Alberto Vilar Spends More Time in Jail While His Amerindo Investment Advisers Teeters on the Brink"] lawprofessrors.typepad.com, June 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stewart's article in ''The New Yorker'', an extensive analysis of Vilar's rise and fall, "Vilar maintains that when he was arrested he was on the brink of a financial comeback. Everything I predicted about the Internet has come true.... I'm ready to go back to work and make money." Stewart continues: "if convicted, Vilar and Tanaka face fines of more than ten million dollars and prison terms of up to a hundred and fifty-five years. But Vilar says, 'We'll sort this out. I'll get beyond this. I will always try to help others.... I still love opera and classical music.... The Met is not going to get my money, but it will not kill my love of music.'"

The charges did not allege wrongdoing at Amerindo's mutual funds, and when the firm was wound up there were no missing funds. But [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]], a fund analysis company, advised investors to withdraw their money in any case, because the funds had been performing very poorly. In fact, as with many other funds investing in internet companies, investors had already been pulling out for some time, reducing assets and causing expense ratios to increase. Extensive seizures of records and computers in the course of the investigation compelled Amerindo's board to merge the fund with Munder Capital Management's fund, ''Munder NetNet'', later renamed ''Munder Internet''. The seizures were ruled excessive by a federal judge in early 2007.

Vilar and Tanaka's trial began in September 2008, with Herald Price Fahringer as Vilar's defence attorney and Glenn Colton representing Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/arts/music/30vilar.html | title=Fraud Trial Starts With Tales of Schemes | work=New York Times | author=Daniel J Wakin | date=2008-09-29 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial concluded on November 19, 2008 with the conviction of Vilar on all 12 counts with which he had been charged and the conviction of Tanaka on 3 counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailyillini.com/features/2008/11/20/jury-convicts-opera-loving-philanthropist-of-fraud/ |first=Larry |last=Neumeister |title=Opera-loving philanthropist convicted in NY of swindling investors out of millions |publisher=[[The Daily Illini]] |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2010, Vilar was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Tanaka was sentenced to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/nyregion/06vilar.html?th&amp;emc=th|work=The New York Times|title=Arts Patron Is Sentenced to 9 Years for Fraud|first=Colin|last=Moynihan|date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were both featured in the fifth season of the television series ''[[American Greed]]''. In October 2012, after having served more than 2 1/2 years at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Federal Correctional Institution, the appeals court, over the objections of the prosecution, ordered his immediate release pending the appeal.&lt;ref name="Wyrick"/&gt;  Vilar and Tanaka were returned to jail in November 2013.&lt;ref name="Wyrick2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vaildaily.com/news/9014987-113/vilar-shevitz-bond-million | title=Alberto Vilar ordered back to jail | work=Vail Daily | author=Randy Wyrick | date=2013-11-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, Vilar was returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional year for preventing the victims' families from recovering their lost funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/opera-scammer-alberto-vilar-year-added-jail-sentence-article-1.1768360 | title=Opera scammer Alberto Vilar gets year added to prison sentence | work=New York Daily News | author=Daniel Beekman and Larry McShane | date=2014-04-24 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of his failures to pay promised donations==
In a 2000 interview with [[Philipp Blom]], Vilar had estimated his donations to [[opera house]]s and other performing arts centers in some 150 million dollars granted over the previous 10 years&lt;ref&gt;''To Have and to Hold - An Intimate History of Collectors and Collecting'', Allen Lane/Penguin, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the organizations to which Vilar had pledged donations gradually began to remove his name from parts of their institutions where it had been prominently placed.

In July 2005 the Royal Opera House announced that, following Vilar's failure to maintain the agreed payment schedule, his name would be removed from the building. Later his name was removed from the young artists program when a new donor stepped forward.

At the Metropolitan Opera, where his name appeared on the "Vilar Grand Tier", it has since been removed. The Washington Opera's young artists program has also been renamed (after additional support was found) as the "Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program", and the Kennedy Center's "Arts Management Fellowship" program has similarly dropped the Vilar name.

==Biography==
Avraham Shifrin was born on October 8, 1923 in [[Minsk]], [[USSR]] (modern [[Belarus]]) into a Jewish family. His father, Isaak Shifrin, was arrested in 1937, sentenced under false charges to ten years of corrective labor in [[Kolyma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=author&amp;i=845 |title=Воспоминания о ГУЛАГе и их авторы |publisher=sakharov-center.ru |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Avraham Shifrin fought in [[Shtrafbat]], Soviet penal battalion, where he was drafted as a son of the [[Enemy of the people]] (Russian language: сын врага народа, "syn vraga naroda").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Soviet Russia Inside Out.

Later, the death sentence was changed to twenty five years in [[Gulag]], five years of exile to remote regions, and five years of revoking civil rights.&lt;ref name="Воспоминания о ГУЛАГе и их авторы"/&gt; In 1963 Shifrin was released from prison; in 1970 repatriated to [[Israel]]. Shifrin testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1973 that American prisoners of war were being held in Soviet prison camps.&lt;ref name="Hartford Courant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1992-12-06/news/0000107350_1_laos-prisoners-pows-in-soviet-union |title=Israeli Who Saw Pows In Soviet Union |publisher=Hartford Courant |date= December 6, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Arnold Beizer]], a Hartford lawyer, the testimony was corroborated by Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1992, who said American soldiers had been transferred to Russian labor camps.&lt;ref name="Hartford Courant"/&gt;

==Russian Gulag on Wrangell Island==
According to Avraham Shifrin's research, massive Russian Gulag concentration camp has been found on the Russian [[Wrangel Island]] in the Arctic Ocean (71° North, 179° West).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statedepartmentwatch.org/GulagWrangell.htm |title=Russian Gulag Found On American Wrangell Island, President and Congress Asked To Investigate and Remove |publisher=State Department Watch |date=December 6, 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407033421/http://www.statedepartmentwatch.org/GulagWrangell.htm |archivedate=2015-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The camps on Wrangell were revealed in the 1982 book "The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union," by Avraham Shifrin (Bantam Books).&lt;ref name="Bantam Books"&gt;{{citation |title=The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union by Avraham Shifrin |publisher=Bantam Books |date= 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His research institute interviewed hundreds of escapees from Soviet gulags.  In his 1973 testimony before the U. S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, Shifrin described three concentration camps with thousands of prisoners, and in one camp was an atomic reactor used in radiation experiments on live prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= USSR Labor Camps Hearings Before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws |publisher=Living Sacrifice Book Co |date= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; American prisoners of war may have been on Wrangell. The Russians are reputed to have taken American and other military prisoners from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War to Siberian slave labor camps.  Even the famed World War II hero [[Raoul Wallenberg]] (who was declared an honorary U. S. citizen along with Winston Churchill) was seen in a camp on Wrangell Island in 1962, according to testimony of imprisoned Soviet [[SMERSH]] officer [[Efim Moshinskiy]] in Shifrin’s book&lt;ref name="Bantam Books"/&gt;

==Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternative theory==
Avraham Shifrin claimed that according to the investigation of his Research Centre for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentration Camps of the USSR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rescue007.org/where_are_they_now.htm |title= Where Are They Now? |publisher=The International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors, Inc. |date= February 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KAL 007]] landed on water north of [[Moneron Island]], and the passengers successfully disembarked on emergency floats. The Soviets collected them and subsequently sent them to camps with the children "separated from their parents and safely hidden in the orphan houses of one of the Soviet Middle Asian republics&lt;ref name="Shifrin1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shifrin|first=Avraham|title=Press Release|url= http://www.rescue007.org/docs/ShifrinPressRelease1991-07-11.pdf|publisher=Research Centre for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentration Camps of the USSR|date=July 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;". According to [[Michel Brun]] this theory is not entirely preposterous. In his book he analyses the first news, communicated by CIA and South Korean government: that KAL 007 landed in Sakalin and all passengers are safe. In his careful searches, he discovered the source of this first information. It was published in a Japanese newspaper: ''Mainichi Shinboun'' September 1, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Brun,''Incident at Sakhline...'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, this observation came from Wakkanai radars. So, he considers that another aircraft, probably military, landed at Sakhalin during the "Sakhalin battle" and that its passengers, American and/or South Korean, were jailed in the Soviet Union.

==Personal life==
Avraham Shifrin was married to the Israeli politician [[Eleonora Shifrin]].

'''Cain Dingle''' is a fictional character from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]''. He is played by [[Jeff Hordley]], and made his first appearance on 30 March 2000. In 2006, Cain was written out of the series when Hordley left the show; however, the door was left open for a return, which occurred when Hordley returned to the cast in February 2009.

Cain's main storylines have focused on discovering his uncle [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) is his father, his relationships with his cousin [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), discovering he is  [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie's]] ([[Charley Webb]]) father, his affair and subsequent relationship with [[Moira Barton]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]), being attacked in a [[whodunit]] storyline where his assailant was eventually revealed to be his father, being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, supporting his nephew [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) after discovering Aaron was sexually abused by his father [[Gordon Livesy]] ([[Gary Mavers]]) as a child, reuniting with his and Chas's mother [[Faith Dingle]] ([[Sally Dexter]]), his relationship with local vicar [[Harriet Finch]] (Katherine Dow Blyton) and building up a relationship with his sons [[Kyle Wyatt]] and [[Isaac Dingle]]. They have also focused on his marriage with (Moira Barton) and his bonding with his stepchildren [[Adam Barton (Emmerdale)|Adam Barton]], [[Matty Barton]] and [[Holly Barton]] and the death of his stepdaughter [[Holly Barton]] from a drug overdose. In October 2018 Cain seemingly kills Joe Tate after punching in him the head, causing Joe to hit the back of his head on a rock, only for [[Graham Foster (2017 character)|Graham Foster]] ([[Andrew Scarborough]]) to finish the job after discovering Joe had survived his earlier injuries.

==Storylines==

===2000–2006===
Cain arrives for his brother [[Butch Dingle|Butch]]'s ([[Paul Loughran]]) funeral, blaming [[Chris Tate]] ([[Peter Amory]]) and police officer [[Angie Reynolds]] (Freya Copeland) for his death. Wanting revenge, he seduces Angie's daughter, [[Ollie Reynolds|Ollie]] ([[Vicky Binns]]), and manipulates her into believing that he cares, despite sleeping with her mother. When Angie dumps Cain, he has her fired, has a steamy session with Ollie and pushes [[Len Reynolds]] ([[Peter Martin (actor)|Peter Martin]]) down a flight of stairs. Determined to get her own revenge, Angie goes along with Cain's plan to rob a Tate Haulage truck but she sets him up and is fatally injured in a car crash. He begs her to tell him she loves him but she tells him how much she loves her children.

As a teenager, Cain had a fling with [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), and attacks her when he learns that she is dating Chris. [[Paddy Kirk|Paddy]] ([[Dominic Brunt]]) and [[Emily Kirk]] ([[Kate McGregor]]) foster [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie Jones]] ([[Charley Webb]]), who befriends the Dingles. When Cain sees a picture of Debbie's biological mother, he realises that Debbie is his and Charity's daughter. He blackmails Charity, threatening to tell Chris, so Charity tells him and spends time with Cain, eventually rekindling their affair and Chris catches them. Cain and Debbie leave the village but return so he can clear his name and admit his love for Charity; she ends the relationship when she realises she cannot live with him while on bail, due to pregnancy. She moves on to [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] ([[Ken Farrington]]), and they plan to marry. [[Sadie King]] ([[Patsy Kensit]]), Tom's daughter-in-law, hires Cain to make Tom think Charity has been unfaithful but Charity clears her name and leaves the village. Sadie and Cain end up in bed; when she rejects him, he kills her dog.

Cain and Debbie move into Butler's Farm with [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]). Debbie briefly dates Andy, resulting in a daughter [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Sarah Sugden|Sarah]]. Unlike Debbie, (who lets Emily adopt Sarah), Cain bonds with her. Cain attempts to hurt Debbie by having a brief relationship with her friend/girlfriend [[Jasmine Thomas]] ([[Jenna Coleman|Jenna-Louise Coleman]]) and ensuring that Debbie sees them together. Debbie and Sadie help Jasmine terminate her pregnancy, knowing that Cain wanted to be a father.

Cain and Sadie damage the King's River Show Home; when Sadie rejects him, he tells Jimmy that she paid him to vandalise the house and they are together. When Sadie confronts him, Cain threatens to tell Matthew as well so Sadie tells Ashley that Cain got Jasmine pregnant. The Dingles throw him out and allow Debbie to return. Cain leaves the village, unaware that he has damaged the show home's gas pipe. Despite Jimmy's temporary repair, the house explodes and kills [[Dawn Woods]] ([[Julia Mallam]]), [[Noreen Bell]] ([[Jenny Tomasin]]) and [[List of minor Emmerdale characters (2006)#David Brown|David Brown]] ([[Peter Alexander (English actor)|Peter Alexander]]). Cain tells the police that he killed Alice so Samson will not lose both parents and his family forgive him (including Debbie), and Sadie bails him out. They plan revenge on Tom and [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] ([[Matt Healy]]) by plotting to [[Major Emmerdale storylines#Tom King kidnap plot September 2006|kidnap Tom]]. Debbie tells Cain that Sadie paid for Jasmine's abortion; after a violent confrontation, Cain follows Sadie and kidnaps her and Tom. [[Chas Dingle|Chastity]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) confronts him but he denies any knowledge of Tom and Sadie's disappearance. With the police closing in, Cain takes them to an abandoned factory and switches cars. They follow him to a quarry, where Cain sends his car over a cliff (with Tom and Sadie supposedly inside). While the police search the lake, Cain disguises himself as an officer. After shooting Sadie, Cain forces Tom to get Chastity to deliver the ransom. Debbie begs Cain to let her go with him and they part in tears. Cain gives some of the ransom money to an old woman, asking her to post it to Debbie. Surprised by the woman's honesty, Cain realises he wants to change. At the airport, he gets on a plane and leaves Sadie behind, telling her that he does not want to continue as he was. He leaves Debbie a message that he has left Sadie, asking her to ignore what others say and telling her that he loves her more than he shows. On her 18th birthday, Cain sends her a silver watch.

==={{anchor|2009—}}2009–===
In February 2009, Cain returns to support Debbie as she is on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] for murdering [[Shane Doyle]] ([[Paul McEwan (actor)|Paul McEwan]]). He is arrested and hires a solicitor for Debbie who tells him that Andy is refusing her access to Sarah. Cain supports Debbie in her successful custody battle and tempts [[Maisie Wylde]] ([[Alice Coulthard]]), despite her parents' disapproval. After having a relationship with Maisie, Cain flirts with [[Faye Lamb]] ([[Kim Thomson]]). When he refuses to return money to [[Jimmy King|Jimmy]] ([[Nick Miles]]) and [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister]]), they beat him up.

Cain dislikes Debbie's boyfriend, Michael, and learns that he is marrying his pregnant fiancée. Cain and Debbie arrive at the church and learn that Charity is Michael's fiancee. When Michael learns about Charity's past (and that she is not pregnant), he jilts her. Debbie invites Charity to stay with her, despite Cain's opposition. Charity and Carl plan to rob Cain but Cain and Debbie catch them and throw Charity out (after giving her the money she tried to steal). Cain returns on 22 December with gifts for Debbie and Sarah, reconciling with Charity on Christmas Day after she proposes to him.

Cain finds [[Mark Wylde]]'s ([[Maxwell Caulfield]]) wallet in the woods after Mark is reported missing and blackmails her and her son [[Nathan Wylde|Nathan]] ([[Lyndon Ogbourne]]). [[Sam Dingle|Sam]]'s ([[James Hooton]]) dog, Alfie, digs up the body and Nathan frames his half-brother, [[Ryan Lamb (Emmerdale)|Ryan Lamb]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) for Mark's murder, and Ryan is convicted. Cain tells Maisie that Nathan and Natasha paid him to keep quiet and he cannot help Ryan without incriminating himself. After seeing Nathan lie in the witness box, Cain kidnaps him. When Maisie learns what her mother and brother did, she calls the police and tells them that her mother killed her father.

In April 2011, Charity ends her relationship with Cain again after he has a one-night stand with Faye and sleeps with [[Amy Wyatt]] ([[Chelsea Halfpenny]]). When he rejects her, she tells him she is pregnant so he "persuades" her to have an abortion but her pregnancy is too far advanced. Amy tells him and [[Victoria Sugden]] ([[Isabel Hodgins]]) that she had the abortion so Cain has an affair with [[Moira Barton]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]) and tells John. Amy gives birth to Cain's son, [[List of Emmerdale characters (2011)#Kyle Wyatt|Kyle]], in a cemetery; thinking he is dead, she panics and leaves him in a phonebox. [[Hazel Rhodes]] ([[Pauline Quirke]]) and [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]) find him, and call an ambulance. Amy admits being his mother and Cain realises she lied about the abortion.

Cain dislikes [[Jai Sharma]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) so when [[Priya Sharma|Priya]] ([[Fiona Wade]]) shows an interest in him, Cain takes advantage of this. Jai accuses Cain of stealing from his parents' house and causing their father's road accident. Cain sends Jai a photo of Priya asleep nude and persuades her to report Jai to the police for assaulting her. Priya forgives Cain until she learns he is the father of Amy's baby and slept with Moira. Cain is arrested when Jai reports his threats to the police but released with a caution. Debbie throws him out and Cain confronts John, Moira, Chas and Amy before leaving the village. Cameron later finds Jai standing over Cain, now badly injured, and calls an ambulance. Cain recovers, claiming that Jai attacked him until Zak admits that he was responsible; he tells the police that a man he knew from Spain attacked him.

Cain saves [[Holly Barton]]'s ([[Sophie Powles]]) life when she relapses on heroin and angers her brother, [[Adam Barton (Emmerdale)|Adam]] ([[Adam Thomas]]). Confronting Cain at the garage, he demands an apology for what Cain has done to his family but Cain refuses. So Adam sets the garage on fire and leaves Cain to die but returns later. Cain's nephew [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) begs Cain to tell the police the fire was an accident, and Cain threatens Adam. In 2012, Moira and Cain get together and on New Year's Day 2013, they announce their relationship by kissing in the Woolpack. In April, Moira learns that she is pregnant but miscarries. Despite this, their relationship gets stronger and Cain moves in with Moira and Adam, who adjusts to the situation.

In August, Debbie reunites with Cameron, angering Cain and Charity. Cain takes Cameron hostage and threatens to kill him but Debbie stops him harming Cameron. Reluctantly, Cain relents but warns Cameron that he'll be watching him. In October 2013, Cain rushes back from holiday when he learns that Cameron has laid siege to The Woolpack and is holding Debbie and Chas hostage. On his return, he is relieved to find Debbie and Chas safe and Cameron died in the siege. Cain supports Debbie through the trauma and eventually nurses her back to health. Cain resumes his romance with Moira, but later that month the man who terrorized [[Laurel Thomas]] arrives at the Bartons, injured. The man is revealed to be [[Ross Barton]] ([[Michael Parr]]), Moira's nephew, who assisted Cain in a crime he committed during his absence. Cain is not happy to see Ross but allows him to stay with him and Moira and gives him a job at the garage.
However, Cain and Moira's life is intruded on furthermore when Ross's father, [[James Barton (Emmerdale)|James]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]), follows him to Emmerdale accompanied by his other sons, [[Pete Barton|Pete]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]) and [[Finn Barton|Finn]] (Joe Gill). Cain and James instantly clash especially when Moira tells Cain that James made a pass at her in March 2014. Cain confronts James and warns him that he is keeping an eye on him. James later apologizes to Cain. Later that month, Moira proposes to Cain and he accepts. The couple get engaged and, assisted by Chas in wedding preparations, Cain and Moira set a date for 15 May 2014. They get married although James gets drunk at their reception.

In December 2014, Cain comes home from a business trip to France with bad pain in his head. He ignores it for a week, at which point he collapses and is found by Charity, who takes him to hospital. Cain is told he has a brain aneurism and needs an operation immediately, but leaves the hospital. Returning to the village, he walks by the river but falls in after a dizzy spell. He is found by [[Vanessa Woodfield]] and [[Kirin Kotecha]] while they was walking out. Eventually, Cain recovers from his condition, but is aware that the aneurysm will still exist inside his brain. Cain saves his sister, [[Belle Dingle]] after she tries to kill herself, and she is diagnosed with possibly [[Schizophrenia]], following recent events which led to the teenager killing her best friend a year previously. Since Belle's diagnosis, Cain has been supportive towards his sister.

In June 2015, Cain and Moira discover that Charity was pregnant when she was sentenced to prison and the baby, [[Moses Dingle]], could possibly be Cain's. Cain visits Charity in prison and questions if he is the father of her child. It is later revealed that [[Ross Barton]] is Moses's father, following a one-night stand with Charity. Cain soon finds out that Ross and Debbie have been having an affair and to stop Debbie from running away with Ross, he tells her that Ross is Moses's father. Debbie's wedding day approaches and Cain threatens Ross and warns him to leave Debbie alone. Debbie marries [[Pete Barton]], but her affair with Ross is discovered on a recorded confession which Ross made on his mobile phone during a conversation with Debbie. Just as everyone finds out, a helicopter comes crashing through the roof of the Village Hall, leaving everyone's lives at risk. Cain and Pete carry Debbie out of the Village Hall, as she is discovered under some debris and therefore begins to fight for her life, due to serious injuries following the crash. But, Cain realises that Kyle is trapped in the debris, and goes in to rescue him, but Kyle hides from him. Cain manages to convince him to come out. Kyle eventually comes out, and Cain rescues him, just before the entire village hall collapses.

In February 2016, Cain was the third person to learn that Aaron was raped by his father, [[Gordon Livesy]] ([[Gary Mavers]]) when he was a child. The first was Aaron's ex-lover [[Robert Sugden]] ([[Ryan Hawley]]), 2 weeks later, Chas was the second person after Aaron told her. After Chas told him about Aaron's abuse, Cain drove to Gordon's house when he plans a revenge on Gordon for what he did to Aaron. The next day, Cain goes to Gordon's house and punches Gordon when he returns. Cain ties him up and forces Gordon to drink vodka and take Chas' sleeping pills to make it look like he was trying to take his own life. Gordon riles Cain up so much that he picks up a chair intending to beat Gordon with it, but Aaron and Chas arrive in the nick of time to stop him.  Aaron informs Cain that he wants to deal with this his way by calling the police on his father.  As Aaron is giving his statement, Cain, instructed by Chas, has told the rest of the Dingles, Moira, Paddy and Adam about Aaron. When he is being questioned, Gordon tells the police that Cain tried to make him take his own life. The police arrive at Butlers to question Cain, but Chas and Moira give him an alibi.

Despite Cain's newfound role as protector of the Dingle name, due to Zak's excommunication, Chas criticizes him, citing that he hasn't bothered even glancing at Aaron since finding out he was abused, and is ashamed of him. Cain tells her that this is utter rubbish, and that he still loves Aaron, the problem being that whenever he looks at him, it reminds him "of what a sick, perverted man Gordon is". Alongside this newfound fatherly duty, Cain also tries to protect Debbie from long term lover (and Moria's nephew) Ross after she leaves the village and he will stop at no lengths to get in contact with her. Cain also supports Lisa as she celebrates turning 60 by divorcing Zak. However, Cain later tries being civil with his estranged father due to his troubles with Chas. Cain was in the pub when Chas accidentally reveals to everybody in the pub that Gordon abused Aaron when he was a child. After the police tell Aaron that they can't get [[Sandra Livesy|Sandra]] to back Aaron up, Cain goes to the scrapyard and finds Aaron taking his frustrations out on a car. Cain tells Aaron that he loves him and wants to see Gordon face justice but not at the cost of what it is doing to Aaron, so persuades him to drop the case. Back at the woolpack Cain is present when the police tell Aaron that another of Gordon's victims has come forward.

In March 2016, Cain's car got stolen, Cain thought it was Charity or Ross. Then Cain and Moira tracks the car with somebody drive it. Cain and Moira chase after the driver before confronting the driver who is Holly. The following months, Cain went to the court to supported Aaron. In May 2016, Cain discover from Chas that Gordon is dead. Later, Chas went to the garage and asks Cain if he was involved of Gordon's death, Cain says no but he believe Robert could be involved. Cain and Chas went to the pub and told Aaron that they believe Robert could have had Gordon killed by paying somebody to do it but later, reveals on the next day that Gordon took his life by hanging himself.

In July 2016,  After Holly relapses and becomes addicted to drugs again Moira confronts her drug dealer but falls onto a used needle causing her to believe she has contracted HIV. With Moira's help Holly becomes clean, however Cain is disgusted when he finds out Holly caused Moira to become contracted with HIV after he finds Moira's tablets. After that Cain walked out he tried to run James off the road the day after he walked out on Moira and kissed Charity at [[The Woolpack]] then after he moved in with [[Lisa Dingle]] and [[Belle Dingle]] at Wishing Well Cottage and after Moira ordered a divorce. Cain saved Charity's life when she tried to find Belle after she went missing following mental breakdown, she ended up with broken rips after a run in with Holly's ex-boyfriend/ drug dealer [[Dean (Emmerdale)|Dean]], back at the garage Cain and Charity kissed then slept together. The following day Cain stood up for Charity in front of Zak and Lisa then he called Charity back to the garage he pulled her in kissed her then had sex. The day after that Cain said that was another on-off Charity quoted 'You'll be sending me dirty Emojis before they days out' they had sex again in a car but [[Holly Barton]] knocked on the garage door they got rid of Holly,after fetching him and Charity drinks she joked 'Same time tomorrow?'.

In February 2017, Cain was shocked when his mother Faith returns to the village and help Robert and Aaron's family for his nephew and Robert's wedding, but turns bad news when his mother was accused for the murder of her husband.

In October 2018, after [[Joe Tate (Emmerdale)|Joe Tate]] ([[Ned Porteous]]) leaves Debbie at the alter on their wedding day, Cain threatens to kill Joe if he ever shows his face again around the village and goes up to Home Farm to search for answers but see's Joe walking back into the grounds after deciding against Graham's wishes to stay away. Cain punches Joe to the ground as he goes down he hits his head on a rock and kills Joe

==Creation and casting==
In 2000, series producer Kieran Roberts introduced three new members of the [[Dingle family]]. The new characters made their first appearance at the funeral of [[Butch Dingle]] ([[Paul Loughran]]). Among them were Cain ([[Jeff Hordley]]), son of [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and [[Faith Dingle]] (Gillian Jephcott). Cain's cousin/one-time lover is [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), and Zak's brother is [[Shadrach Dingle|Shadrach]] ([[Andy Devine (English actor)|Andy Devine]]). In April 2006, it was announced that Jeff Hordley had quit, however the door was left open for a possible return in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Kris |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a31731/jeff-hordley-quits-emmerdale.html|title=Jeff Hordley quits 'Emmerdale'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=18 April 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, it was announced that the character would be brought back in April that year after a three-year break.&lt;ref name=comingback&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Kris |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a141846/cain-dingle-returns-to-emmerdale.html|title=Cain Dingle returns to 'Emmerdale'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to [[Digital Spy]] about his return, Hordley said "I am really looking forward to returning to Emmerdale. The storylines that led to Cain's return are in keeping with his character and a perfect way to bring him back to the heart of the Dingle clan where he belongs".&lt;ref name=comingback /&gt; Hordley later said that he initially turned down a return but when he was approached on the matter he approved of the storyline and felt like "the time was right for me".&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris |title=Jeff Hordley (Cain Dingle, 'Emmerdale') |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/interviews/a153264/jeff-hordley-cain-dingle-emmerdale.html|work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
===Characterisation===
{{cquote|Cain is a master criminal and the bad boy of the village. He's been involved in many scams (mostly involving money) and been to jail on more than one occasion, however, he's not evil to the core and has developed a conscience in recent years but still portrays evil in Emmerdale. Despite his difficult relationship with his daughter Debbie, he would do anything for her.|4=''[[itv.com]] on Cain''.&lt;ref name=itv /&gt;}}
The character was labelled a "ruthless hard man", a "bad boy" and a "villain" by ''Digital Spy''.&lt;ref name=comingback /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Cain Dingle returns to 'Emmerdale'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a141846/cain-dingle-returns-to-emmerdale.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ds&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Corrie actress worries about receiving abuse|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a68387/corrie-actress-worries-about-receiving-abuse.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 July 2007|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Itv.com also described Cain as the "village pariah" and commented that he likes "being in charge" but dislikes "being made a fool of".&lt;ref name=itv&gt;{{cite web|title=Cain Dingle|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/cain-dingle/|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[What's on TV]] described him saying "a villain through and through, Cain Dingle will even cross his own family if it's worth his while!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Soaps Emmerdale Who's Who Cain Dingle|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/whos-who/cain-dingle/1017|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=3 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015042627/http://whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/whos-who/cain-dingle/1017|archivedate=15 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cain has also been described as the "village's unmistakable bad boy".&lt;ref name=return /&gt; When casting a new family for the serial one character specification described Cain's earlier tenure, saying: "much in the early Cain Dingle mould, ruthless, unscrupulous, and extremely promiscuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris |title='Emmerdale' in hunt for new 'bad boy' |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a147206/emmerdale-in-hunt-for-new-bad-boy.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=19 February 2009|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hordley said Debbie is Cain's [[Achilles' heel]] who he would "move mountains for" while "women are his other Achilles heel, but he won't move mountains for them".&lt;ref name=return /&gt;

===Relationship with Charity Tate===
Upon Cain's return to the village he and Charity reunite. Charity proposes on Christmas Day to which Cain accepts. Even though they're family. Hordley explained that the couple can't see they are made for each other as they are "so busy competing and getting one up on each other" which means that they fail to see that they are "the same".&lt;ref name=hordleyatkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Jeff Hordley, Emma Atkins (Cain and Charity, 'Emmerdale')|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/interviews/a189793/jeff-hordley-emma-atkins-cain-and-charity-emmerdale.html |work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=12 December 2009|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins said Charity asked Cain to marry her to "prove a point".&lt;ref name=hordleyatkins /&gt; On a storyline in which Cain and Charity plan to carry out a scam Atkins said it would make the audience question "will they/won't they pull it off" before adding that it is a "[[Bonnie and Clyde]] storyline but without the deaths!"&lt;ref name=hordleyatkins /&gt; Hordley said he and Atkins "spark off and bounce off" each other which Hordley added made it "easier for me to act with her". Atkins added that she felt "having a good rapport in that way both on and off screen is vital".&lt;ref name=chemistry&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Emmerdale' duo enjoying screen chemistry |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a190684/emmerdale-duo-enjoying-screen-chemistry.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=13 December 2009|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Spy described the relationship as "volatile".&lt;ref name=chemistry /&gt;

===Reintroduction===
Hordley said Cain's return is his way of "coming back unannounced", and added, "Cain's style is to surprise people, but there has been involvement in the storyline as he was the one to get Debbie released from prison".&lt;ref name=return /&gt; Hordley felt that upon Cain's return "everyone's moved on". He added that Cain "looks down on" [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]), and that Aaron is "like a little puppy looking up to Cain, thinking that his uncle's the bee's knees". He also stated, "There's a great relationship going to build there. Aaron stands for everything Cain was – he's a younger version of him and Cain recognises that. There's definitely lots of undiscovered territory there".&lt;ref name=return /&gt; On Cain and Chas's relationship Hordley also felt that it "hasn't really been explored"; even though they have been in the serial a long time together the relationship is still "non-existent". This left "so much scope" and "with Aaron being involved, too. There certainly should be more involvement and I'm hopeful there will be".&lt;ref name=return /&gt; On Cain's relationship with Debbie, Hordley said the relationship was "true to the character's roots". He added that Cain will "do whatever it takes to look after that girl. If there's one Achilles heel of Cain, it's his daughter. It's his weakness and he'll move mountains for her". Hordley also felt that Cain's relationship with Charity was "going to be a big thing" and that he expected there would be "a lot of stuff between Charity, Debbie and Cain".&lt;ref name=return /&gt;

===Who Attacked Cain?===
In 2011, it was announced that Cain would become part of a "major" storyline where he is attacked by a "mystery" assailant in a "[[whodunit]]"-style storyline. The storyline developed after Cain had made several enemies throughout the year and forced one of his enemies to "take the ultimate revenge".&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Producers stylised the plot as a "[[whodunit|whodunit storyline]]" which would keep viewers guessing as to whom the attacker was. The potential suspects were revealed to be [[John Barton (Emmerdale)|John Barton]] ([[James Thornton (actor)|James Thornton]]), [[Moira Barton]] ([[Natalie J Robb]]), [[Jai Sharma]] ([[Chris Bisson]]), [[Amy Wyatt]] ([[Chelsea Halfpenny]]), [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and [[Charity Tate]] ([[Emma Atkins]]).&lt;ref name=who/&gt; A spokesperson for the serial stated that the characters had become "sworn enemies" of Cain, all "pushed to the limit after months of manipulation and destruction". ''Emmerdale's'' executive producer Stuart Blackburn said that the climax of Cain's actions "will be one of our most dramatic episodes this year" as viewers decide who took "matters into their own hands".&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Emmerdale' announces shock whodunit storyline|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a351288/emmerdale-announces-shock-whodunit-storyline.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=17 November 2011|date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker was revealed to be Zak Dingle, Cain's father.

She graduated from the [[College of Creative Studies]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in biology in 1983. During this time she also studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and made significant discoveries there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/3240.html?cid=3435 Press release], University of Göttingen (9 December 2009). (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Greider is [[dyslexic]] and states that her "compensatory skills also played a role in my success as a scientist because one has to intuit many different things that are going on at the same time and apply those to a particular problem"&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/greider.html|title=Carol Greider, Scientist, Nobel Prize Winner  |publisher=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity|last=Kathy Crockett|work=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greider initially suspected her dyslexia after seeing patterns of common mistakes such as backwards words when she received back graded work in the first grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/greider-bio.html|title=Carol W. Greider – Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greider started to memorize words and their spellings rather than attempting to sound out the spelling of words.&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic" /&gt; Greider has worked significantly to overcome her [[dyslexia]] to become successful in her professional life, and credits her dyslexia as helping her appreciate differences and making unusual decisions such as the one to work with [[Tetrahymena]], an unusual organism.&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic" /&gt;

Greider initially had difficulty getting in to graduate school due to low GRE scores as a result of her dyslexia. [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]]’s graduate school admission office was able to focus on Greider’s impressive experience and credentials and accepted her.&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic"/&gt; Greider applied to thirteen grad schools and was only accepted to two, [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic"/&gt; She chose the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she would be able to work with [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and the two made their telomerase discovery.&lt;ref name="YaleDyslexic" /&gt;

== Discovery of telomerase ==
She completed her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in molecular biology in 1987 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], under Elizabeth Blackburn. While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered [[telomerase]], a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Blackburn.

Greider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra [[DNA bases]] to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during [[DNA replication]], eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and [[senescence]] or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism ''[[Tetrahymena|Tetrahymena thermophila]]'', a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503019102| pmid = 15928079| year = 2005| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R.| title = Biography of Carol W. Greider| volume = 102| issue = 23| pages = 8077–8079| pmc = 1149435| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.8077N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 25, 1984, Greider first obtained results indicating that a particular enzyme was likely responsible. After six months of additional research Greider and Blackburn concluded that it was the enzyme responsible for telomere addition. They published their findings in the journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in December, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzyme, originally called "telomere terminal transferase," is now known as telomerase. Telomerase rebuilds the tips of chromosomes and determines the life span of cells.&lt;ref name = "jhopkinsresearch"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Carol Greider, Ph.D.| work = Johns Hopkins Medicine – Research – Awards – Nobel| accessdate = 2015-04-07| url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/awards/nobel/nobel_prize_greider.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greider's additional research to confirm her discovery was largely focused in identifying the mechanism that telomerase uses for elongation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1671807685/A52ABEF5DF94215PQ/1?accountid=40980|title=Science Spotlight: Nobel Laureate Carol Greider|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2015|work=University Wire|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greider chose to use RNA degrading enzymes and saw that the telomeres stopped extending, which was an indication that RNA was involved in the enzyme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Greider also used [[telomerase]] deficient [[Mouse|mice]] and saw that her sixth generation of mice had become entirely sterile, she mated them with control mice and the telomerase deficient mice were able to regenerate their [[telomere]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Subsequent career ==
Greider then completed her postdoctoral work, and also held a faculty position, at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]]. During this time, Greider, in collaboration with [[Ronald A. DePinho]], produced the first telomerase [[knockout mouse]], showing that although telomerase is dispensable for life, increasingly short telomeres result in various deleterious phenotypes, colloquially referred to as premature aging. In the mid-1990s, Greider was recruited by [[Michael D. West]], founder of [[biotechnology]] company [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] (now CEO of [[BioTime]]) to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Corporation 10K 1996|url= http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-May/002331.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greider, Blackburn and Jack Szostak, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, shared the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their work on telomeres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Telomere" Expert Carol Greider Shares 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/telomere_expert_carol_greider_shares_2009_nobel_prize_in_physiology_or_medicine|website=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Greider was named a [[Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships|Bloomberg Distinguished Professor]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/02/17/bloomberg-distinguished-professors |title=With Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships, Johns Hopkins aims to foster cross-specialty collaboration |last=Brooks |first=Kelly |date=February 17, 2014 |website = Hub |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greider currently serves as director of and professor at  the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins Medicine]].&lt;ref name="jhopkinsresearch" /&gt; Greider was first promoted to Daniel Nathans Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2004.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenofhopkins.com/greider|title=The Women of Hopkins|website=The Women of Hopkins|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greider's lab employs both student and post-doctoral trainees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323978104578335013555368892|title=NIH Cuts Began Ahead of Sequester|last=Paletta|first=Thomas M.

== Personal life ==
Greider married [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]], a fellow academic, in 1992.  She has two children.  Greider is divorced.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsandsciences.colorado.edu/magazine/2010/03/having-it-all-plus-doing-it-all/|title=‘Having it all’ plus ‘doing it all’|last=Clint Talbott|work=Colorado Arts &amp; Sciences Magazine|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220192119/http://artsandsciences.colorado.edu/magazine/2010/03/having-it-all-plus-doing-it-all/#|archive-date=2015-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Greider's children were born, she competed in triathlons.

==Early life==
Charles Badger Clark was born on January 1, 1883 in [[Albia, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdpb"&gt;[http://www.sdpb.org/BadgerClark/default.aspx South Dakota Public Broadcasting biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Dakota Territory]], where his father served as a [[Methodist]] preacher in [[Huron, South Dakota|Huron]], [[Mitchell, South Dakota|Mitchell]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] and [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt; He dropped out of [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] after he clashed with one of its founders, [[C.B. Clark]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdpb"/&gt; He travelled to [[Cuba]], returned to [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], where he contracted [[tuberculosis]], then moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona]] to assuage his illness with the dry weather.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt;&lt;ref name="truewest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdpb"/&gt; He returned again to South Dakota in 1910 to take care of his ailing father.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt;&lt;ref name="truewest"/&gt; There, he contracted [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt;

==Career==
Clark published his first poetry collection in 1917. In 1925, he moved to a cabin in [[Custer State Park]] in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota, where he lived for thirty years and continued to write poetry.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="truewest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdpb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfp.sd.gov/state-parks/directory/custer/sights/badger-hole.aspx Badger Hole]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark was named the Poet Laureate of South Dakota by Governor [[Leslie Jensen]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="dwu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.badgerclark.org/ Badger Clark Memorial Society, homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; His work was published in ''[[Sunset Magazine]]'', ''[[The Pacific Monthly]]'', ''[[Arizona Highways]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly|Colliers]]'', ''[[Century Magazine]]'', the ''[[Rotarian]]'', and ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]''.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Clark died on September 26, 1957.&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt;

His poem entitled "Lead My America" was performed by the [[Fred Waring|Fred Waring Chorus]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="sdpb"/&gt; In 1969, [[Bob Dylan]] recorded "Spanish is the Loving Tongue".&lt;ref name="blackhills"/&gt; In ''[[America by Heart]]'', [[Sarah Palin]] quotes his poem entitled "A Cowboy's Prayer" as one of the prayers she likes to recite.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Palin, ''America by Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith, and Flag'', New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2010, pp. 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

([http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2468254 cat.instr.fr])&lt;/ref&gt; ([[floruit|fl.]] 1590s) was a notable [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] [[Censorship|censor]] of Hebrew books. His ''Sefer Hazikkuk'', the Hebrew equivalent of ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index Expurgatorius]]'', played an important role in the censorship of Hebrew books in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Coudert (2004), ''Hebraica Veritas?: Christian Hebraists and the Study of Judaism in Early Modern Europe'', University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|9780812237610}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cDFCuuXd1DkC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Domenico+Gerosolimitano 137]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Gerosolimitano was born in [[Safed]] in Ottoman Palestine in about 1550, and died in Italy in about 1620. He was educated at the rabbinical college in his native city, studying not only Talmud, but also medicine. After having been granted the degree of doctor and the title of "Rab", he lectured on Talmudic law in Safed. His fame as a physician spread far and wide, and finally reached the ears of the Sultan [[Murad III]], who summoned him to Constantinople as court physician.

Yerushalmi subsequently became a convert to Christianity; he went to Rome, and was received at the [[College of the Neophytes]], where he taught Hebrew. During the most active period of the expurgation of Hebrew books under the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]] in Italy Dominico's services were in great demand; and first in Venice (1578-92?), later as chief reviser of the censorship commission in Mantua (1595–97), he had opportunity for placing his signature in more books and manuscripts than any other of the Italian expurgators. His activity in this direction continued at intervals—in places, however, not yet identified—almost until his death.

Dominico's works included, according to his own statement, ''Ma'ayan Gannim'' ("Fountain of the Gardens"), on the fundamental principles of the Christian faith. He also translated into Hebrew the whole of the New Testament, and most of the Apocryphal books (1615–17). He was the compiler of the ''Sefer ha-Ziḳḳuḳ'' ("Book of Expurgation"), still in manuscript, one copy of which (in the library of Cardinal Berberini, now part of the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome) shows revision by him as late as 1619.

The record of Dominico's conversion has been discovered, dated 6 August 1593 in Venice.&lt;ref name="Zorattini_1998" /&gt; The seventeenth century authors [[Giulio Bartolocci]] and [[Johann Christoph Wolf]] state that [[Nicolaus Mursius]] in his ''Relatione della Città di Constantinopoli'' (Bologna, 1671) mentions as court physician of the Turkish sultan a Jew who later became converted under the name of "Dominico Ierosolymitano". Wolf holds that he is identical with the subject of this article; Bartolocci, on the other hand, states that Mursius speaks of one whom he (Mursius) had himself seen in his travels, and who was still living as a Christian in Constantinople in direst poverty, though as a Jew he had held, under the name of Pelaso, third place among the sultan's physicians.

=== Migration from China ===
[[File:Karakol-Dungan-Mosque-Gate-4.jpg|thumb|The gate of the Dungan Mosque in [[Karakol]], Kyrgyzstan.

The lower text is [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] in the Cyrillic script: ''Ysyk-Köl oblasttyk Karakol shaaryndagy Ibrakhim Ajy atyndagy borborduk mechit''—Central Mosque in the name of Ibrahim Hajji in the city of Karakol, [[oblast]] of [[Ysyk-Köl Province|Ysyk-Köl]].]]
In the [[Ferghana Valley]], the first Dungans to appear in [[Central Asia]] originated from [[Yining City|Kuldja]] and [[Kashgar]], as slaves captured by raiders; they mostly served in private wealthy households. After the Russians conquered Central Asia in the late 19th century and abolished slavery, most female Dungan slaves remained where they had originally been held captive. Russian ethnographer Validimir Petrovich Nalivkin and his wife said that "women slaves almost all remained in place, because they either were married to workers and servants of their former owners, or they were too young to begin an independent life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=The+Nalivkins+observed+that+Dungan+women+slaves+in+the+Fargana+Valley,+especially+those+taken+as+children,+had+few+choices:+%22women+slaves+almost+all+remained+in+place,+because+they+either+were+married+to+workers+and+servants+of+their#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Nalivkins%20observed%20that%20Dungan%20women%20slaves%20in%20the%20Fargana%20Valley%2C%20especially%20those%20taken%20as%20children%2C%20had%20few%20choices%3A%20%22women%20slaves%20almost%20all%20remained%20in%20place%2C%20because%20they%20either%20were%20married%20to%20workers%20and%20servants%20of%20their&amp;f=false|title= The New Woman in Uzbekistan: Islam, Modernity, and Unveiling Under Communism|author=Marianne Kamp|year= 2008|publisher= University of Washington Press|edition= reprint, illustrated|location= |page= 25|isbn= 0-295-98819-3|pages= |accessdate= 2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dungan women slaves were of low status and not regarded highly in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=QVSVux0wIW0C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=yelia's+mother-in-law+had+married+a+Chechen.+But+such+is+the+stigma+of+the+Chala+identity+that+it+overrode+both+the+low+status+of+the+Dungan+grandmother,+who+arrived+in+Bukhara+as+a+slave,+and+current+political+anxieties+about+Chechens#v=onepage&amp;q=yelia's%20mother-in-law%20had%20married%20a%20Chechen.%20But%20such%20is%20the%20stigma%20of%20the%20Chala%20identity%20that%20it%20overrode%20both%20the%20low%20status%20of%20the%20Dungan%20grandmother%2C%20who%20arrived%20in%20Bukhara%20as%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20current%20political%20anxieties%20about%20Chechens&amp;f=false|title=The other global city|author=Shail Mayaram|editor= Shail Mayaram|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|edition= illustrated|location= |page= 209|isbn= 0-415-99194-3|pages= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dungan in the former Soviet republics are [[Hui people|Hui]] who fled China in the aftermath of the [[Hui Minorities' War]] in the 19th century. According to Rimsky-Korsakoff (1992), three separate groups of the Hui people fled to the Russian Empire across the [[Tian Shan]] Mountains during the exceptionally severe winter of 1877/78:
# The first group, of some 1000 people, originally from [[Turpan]] in [[Xinjiang]], led by Ma Daren (马大人, 'the Great Man Ma'), also known as Ma Da-lao-ye (马大老爷, 'the Great Master Ma'), reached [[Osh]] in southern [[Kyrgyzstan]].
# The second group, originally from Didaozhou (狄道州) in Gansu, led by ''[[ahong]]'' Ma Yusuf (马郁素夫),&lt;ref&gt;As per Ma Tong (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Ah Ye Laoren (阿爷老人, 'the Old Man O'Granpa'), were settled in the spring of 1878 in the village of Yrdyk ({{lang-ru|Ирдык}} or Ырдык) some 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Karakol]] in Eastern Kyrgyzstan. They numbered 1130 on arrival.
# The third group, originally from [[Shaanxi]], led by [[Bai Yanhu]] (白彦虎; also spelt Bo Yanhu; often called by his followers "虎大人", 'The Great Man Hu (Tiger)', 1829(?)-1882), one of the leaders of the rebellion, were settled in the village of Karakunuz (now Masanchi), in modern [[Zhambyl Province]] of Kazakhstan. It is 8&amp;nbsp;km north from the city [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in northwestern Kyrgyzstan. This group numbered 3314 on arrival. Bai Yanhu's name in other romanizations was Bo-yan-hu or Pai Yen-hu; other names included Boyan-akhun ([[Akhund]] or [[Imam]] Boyan) and Muhammad Ayyub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The next wave of immigration followed in the early 1880s. In accordance with the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]], which required the withdrawal of the Russian troops from the Upper [[Ili River|Ili]] Basin (the [[Ghulja, China|Kulja]] area), the Dungan (Hui) and [[Taranchi]] ([[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]) people of the region were allowed to opt for moving to the Russian side of the border. Many chose that option; according to Russian statistics, 4,682 Hui moved to the Russian Empire under the treaty. They migrated in many small groups between 1881 and 1883, settling in the village of [[Sokuluk]] some 30&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Bishkek]], as well as in a number of locations between the Chinese border and Sokuluk, in southeastern [[Kazakhstan]] and in northern [[Kyrgyzstan]].

In the Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and the post-Soviet states, the Dungans continue to refer to themselves as the ''Hui people'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:回族|回族]]}}, Huízú; in Cyrillic Soviet Dungan spelling, xуэйзў).

The name ''Dungan'' is of obscure origin. One popular theory derives this word from Turkic ''döñän'' ("one who turns"), which can be compared to Chinese [[wiktionary:回|回]] (huí), which has a similar meaning. Another theory derives it from the Chinese 东甘 (Dong Gan),  'Eastern [[Gansu]]', the region to which many of the Dungan can trace their ancestry; however the character ''gan'' (干) used in the name of the ethnic group is different from that used in the name of the province (甘).

The term "Dungan" ("Tonggan", "Donggan") has been used by Central Asian [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-and Tajik-speaking people to refer to Chinese-speaking Muslims for several centuries. [[Joseph Fletcher (historian)|Joseph Fletcher]] cites Turkic and Persian manuscripts related to the preaching of the 17th century [[Kashgar]]ian [[Sufi]] master Muhammad Yūsuf (or, possibly, his son [[Afaq Khoja]]) inside the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Empire]] (in today's [[Gansu]] and/or [[Qinghai]]), where the Kashgarian preacher is told to have converted '''ulamā-yi Tunganiyyān'' (i.e., "Dungan [[ulema]]") into [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=lipman&gt;{{cite book

Presumably, it was from the Turkic languages that the term was borrowed into Russian (дунгане, ''dungane'' (pl.); дунганин, ''dunganin'' (sing.)) and Chinese ({{zh|s=东干族|t=東干族|p=Dōnggānzú}}), as well as to Western European languages.

In English and German, the [[ethnonym]] "Dungan", in various spelling forms, was attested as early as the 1830s, sometimes typically referring to the Hui people of Xinjiang. For example, James Prinsep in 1835 mentions Muslim "Túngánis" in "Chinese Tartary".&lt;ref&gt;James Prinsep, "Memoir on Chinese Tartary and Khoten". The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, No. 48, December 1835. P. 655.[https://books.google.com/books?id=nK4IAAAAQAAJ On Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinsep's article is also available in "The Chinese Repository", 1843, p. 234 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXMbAAAAIAAJ On Google Books].  A modern (2003) reprint is available, {{ISBN|1-4021-5631-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] in his German-language account of Russian Empire and adjacent Asian lands has a one-page account of Chinese-speaking Muslim "Dungani" or "Tungani", who had visited [[Orenburg]] in 1827 with a caravan from China; he also mentions "Tugean" as a spelling variant used by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ernst von Baer]], Grigoriĭ Petrovich Gelʹmersen. "Beiträge zur Kenntniss des russischen Reiches und der angränzenden Länder Asiens". Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1839. p. 91. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uN0GAAAAYAAJ On Google Books] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  R.M. Martin in 1847 mentions "Tungani" merchants in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Montgomery Martin, "China; political, commercial, and social; an official report". 1847. p.19. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReEDAAAAQAAJ On Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word (mostly in the form "Dungani" or "Tungani", sometimes "Dungens" or "Dungans") acquired some currency in English and other western languages when a number of books in the 1860-1870s discussed the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan Rebellion]] in [[Northwestern China]]. At the time, one could see European and American authors apply the term ''Tungani'' to the Hui people both in Xinjiang,&lt;ref&gt;
For example, [[Thomas Edward Gordon]] writes about the "Tunganis" with ''taifu'' wall pieces (small cannons) guarding the walls of [[Yaqub Beg]]'s capital [[Kashgar]] (in today's Western Xinjiang) in his book  [https://archive.org/stream/roworldanarrati00gordgoog/roworldanarrati00gordgoog_djvu.txt ''The roof of the world: being a narrative of a journey over the high plateau of Tibet to the Russian frontier and the Oxus sources on Pamir'']. A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' journalist in  "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article883063 Russia and China in Central Asia]" (reprinted by ''The [[Brisbane Courier]]'', Wednesday 8 January 1879) distinguishes "the Tungan Country" (today, eastern Xinjiang) and "Eastern Turkestan" (corresponding to [[Yaqub Beg]]'s state in today's western Xinjiang). He talks about "the Tungani who had erected in the various cities of [[Hami City|Hami]]l, [[Barkol County|Barkul]], [[Qitai County|Guchen]], [[Urumqi|Urumtsi]], and [[Manas County|Manas]] a confederacy of no mean power".&lt;/ref&gt;
and in [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]] (which at the time included today's [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]] as well). Authors aware of the general picture of the spread of [[Islam]] in China, viewed these "Tungani" as just one of the groups of China's Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. an anonymous article, "[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=livn;idno=livn0145-9 Mohammedanism in China]", in ''The Living age'',  Volume 145, Issue 1876. May 29, 1880. Pp. 515-525. Reprinted from the [[Edinburgh Review]]. While using "Mohammedans" as the generic description of Chinese Muslim's throughout the article (including e.g., the [[Panthays]] then recently [[Panthay rebellion|rebelling]] in [[Yunnan]]), the author describes "[a]n [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|insurrection]], beginning in [[Xi'an|Singan-fu]], and spreading to [[Gansu|Kan-suh]] in 1862, in which the Tungani (a mysterious race of Muslims dwelling in that region, supposed to be the remnant of the armies of [[Kublai Khan]]) were the chief actors" (p. 524).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Broomhall]], who has a chapter on  "the Tungan Rebellion" in his 1910 book, introduces "the name Tungan or Dungan, by which the Muslims of these parts [i.e., NE China] are designated, in contradistinction as the Chinese Buddhists who are spoken of as Kithay";
the reference to "[[Names of China|Khitay]]" shows that he was viewing the two terms as used by Turkic speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam in China: a neglected problem|first=Marshall|last=Broomhall|year=1910|publisher=China Inland Mission
|oclc=347514|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ|page=147|ref=harv|postscript=.}}. A 1966 reprint by Paragon Book Reprint is available.  Relatedly, the Russian word for China is also Kitai (Китай), and for Chinese is kitaitsy (китайцы), a label that is not applied to the Dungans (дунгане) in an ethnic sense; that is, Dungans and kitaitsi (Chinese) were regarded as different ethnic groups or nationalities.&lt;/ref&gt;
Broomhall's book also contains a translation of the report on Chinese Muslims by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] writer named Abd-ul-Aziz. Abd-ul-Aziz divides the "Tungan people" into two branches: "the Tunagans of China proper" (including, apparently all [[Hui people]] in "[[China proper]]", as he also talks e.g. about the Tungans having 17 mosques in Beijing), and "The Tungans of Chinese and Russian Turkestan", who still look and speak Chinese, but have often also learned the [[Uyghur language|"Turkish" language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors continued to use the term Dungan (in various transcriptions) for, specifically, the Hui people of Xinjiang.
For example, [[Owen Lattimore]], writing c. 1940, maintains the terminological distinction between these two related groups: "T'ungkan" (i.e. [[Wade-Giles]] for "Dungan"), described by him as the descendants of the Gansu Hui people resettled in Xinjiang in 17-18th centuries, vs. e.g. "Gansu Moslems" or generic "Chinese Moslems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Lattimore]]. ''Inner Asian Frontiers of China''.

===Dungan villages in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan===
The Dungans themselves referred to Karakunuz ({{lang-ru|Каракунуз}}, sometimes Караконыз or Караконуз) as Ingpan ({{zh|c=营盘}}, Yingpan&lt;!--; Dungan: Инпан--&gt;; {{lang-ru|Иньпан}}), which means 'a camp, an encampment'. In 1965, Karakunuz was renamed Masanchi (sometimes spelt as "Masanchin"), after [[Magaza Masanchi]] or Masanchin (Dungan: Магәзы Масанчын; {{zh|c=马三奇}}), a Dungan participant in the [[Communist Revolution]] and a Soviet Kazakhstan statesman.

The following table summarizes location of Dungan villages in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, alternative names used for them, and their Dungan population as reported by Ma Tong (2003). The Cyrillic Dungan spelling of place names is as in the textbook by Sushanlo, Imazov (1988); the spelling of the name in Chinese character is as in Ma Tong (2003).

[[File:E8042-Milyanfan-house.jpg|thumb|In Milyanfan village, [[Chuy Province]] of Kyrgyzstan]]
As Ding (2005) notes, "[t]he Dungan people derive from China's Hui people, and now live mainly in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Their population is about 110,000. This people have now developed a separate ethnicity outside China, yet they have close relations with the Hui people in culture, ethnic characteristics and ethnic identity."

==Language==
{{main|Dungan language}}
{{see also|Xiao'erjing|Sini (script)}}
The Dungan language, which the Dungan people call the "[[Hui people|Hui]] language" (Хуэйзў йүян or ''Huejzw jyian''), is similar to the [[Zhongyuan Mandarin|Zhongyuan dialect of Mandarin Chinese]], which is widely spoken in the south of [[Gansu]] and the west of [[Guanzhong]] in [[Shaanxi]] in China.

Like other [[varieties of Chinese]], Dungan is tonal. There are two main dialects, one with four tones, and the other, considered standard, with three tones in the final position in words and four tones in the non-final position.

Some Dungan vocabulary may sound old-fashioned to Chinese people. For example, they refer to a President as an "[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]" (Хуаңды，''huan'g-di'') and call government offices ''[[yamen]]'' (ямын，''ya-min''), a term for mandarins' offices in ancient China. Their language also contains many loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Turkic language|Turkic]]. Since the 1940s, the language has been written in [[Cyrillic script]], demonstrating that Chinese can be written with an alphabet (compare the [[pinyin]] system).

Unlike other minority nationalities in Central Asia, such as the [[Koryo-saram|local Koreans]], most Dungan people are [[trilingual]]. More than two-thirds of the Dungan also speak [[Russian language|Russian]], and a small proportion can speak [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] or other languages belonging to the [[titular nationality|titular nationalities]] of the countries where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.uit.no/a/trond/sintr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020191853/http://www.hum.uit.no/a/trond/sintr.html |archivedate=2008-10-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{see also|Chinese Islamic cuisine}}
[[File:E7869-Dordoy-Bazaar.jpg|thumb|right|Many restaurants in Bishkek advertise "Dungan cuisine" (Дунганская кухня)]]
[[File:Dungan mosque in Karakol.jpg|thumb|Dungan mosque in [[Karakol]], Kyrgyzstan]]
Nineteenth century explorer [[Henry Lansdell]] noted that the Dungan people abstained from spirits and [[opium]], neither smoked nor took [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] and
&lt;Blockquote&gt;"are of middle height, and inclined to be stout. They have high and prominent foreheads, thick and arched eyebrows, eyes rather sunken, fairly prominent cheek-bones, face oval, mouth of average size, lips thick, teeth normal, chin round, ears small and compressed, hair black and smooth, beard scanty and rough, skin smooth, neck strong, and extremities of average proportions. The characteristics of the Dungans are kindness, industry, and hospitality.
They engage in husbandry, horticulture, and trade. In domestic life parental authority is very strong. After the birth of a child the mother does not get up for fifteen days, and, without any particular feast, the child receives its name in the presence of a [[mullah]] the day succeeding
that of its birth. Circumcision takes place on the eighth, ninth, or tenth day. When a girl is married she receives a [[dowry|dower]]. In sickness they have recourse to medicine and doctors, but never to [[exorcism]]s. 
After a death the mullah and the aged assemble to recite prayers ; the corpse is wrapped in white linen and then buried, but never burned. On returning from the interment the mullah and the elders partake of bread and meat. To saints they erect monuments like little mosques, for others simple hillocks. The widow may re-marry after 90 days, and on the third anniversary of the death a feast takes place."&lt;ref name="Lansdell1885"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Lansdell|title=Russian Central Asia: Including Kuldja, Bokhara, Khiva and Merv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIVlRw3fSOAC|year=1885|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington|pages=209–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

The Dungan are primarily farmers, growing rice and vegetables such as sugar beets. Many also raise dairy cattle. In addition, some are involved in [[opium]] production. The Dungan tend to be [[endogamous]].

The Dungan are well known for their hospitality and hold many ceremonies and banquets to preserve their culture. They have elaborate and colorful observances of birthdays, weddings, and funerals. In addition, schools have museums to preserve other parts of their culture, such as embroidery, traditional clothing, silver jewelry, paper cuts of animals and flowers and tools.

The Dungan still practice elements of Chinese culture, in cuisine and attire, up to 1948 they also practiced [[foot binding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWMyFWAZLCwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=dungan+foot+binding#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora|author1=Touraj Atabaki |author2=Sanjyot Mehendale |year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-415-33260-5|page=31|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative Shaanxi Dungan cling more tightly to Chinese customs than the Gansu Dungan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVZwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Dungans+who+originate+in+Shaanxi+are+often+considered+to+be+the+most+faithful+to+%22tradition&amp;dq=The+Dungans+who+originate+in+Shaanxi+are+often+considered+to+be+the+most+faithful+to+%22tradition|title=China perspectives, Issues 27-32|author=French Centre for Research on Contemporary China|year=2000|publisher=C.E.F.C.|isbn=|page=68|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dungans have retained Chinese traditions which have disappeared in modern China. Traditional marriage practices are still widespread with matchmakers, the marriages conducted by the Dungan are similar to Chinese marriages in the 19th century, hairstyles worn by women and attire date back to the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=shaanxi+dungan+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=shaanxi%20dungan%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania, Volume 1|author=Barbara A.

Shaanxi female attire is still Chinese, though the rest of the Dungans dress in western attire.

Around the late 19th century the Bride Price was between 240 and 400 rubles for Dungan women. Dungans take other women such as Kirghiz and Tatars as brides willingly, or kidnap Kirghiz girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ODXYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=poor+dungans+kirghiz+brides+tatar+sart&amp;q=kirghiz+girls+abduct|title=Asian folklore studies, Volume 51|author=Asian Folklore Institute, Society for Asian Folklore, Nanzan Daigaku.

Shaanxi Dungans are even conservative when marrying with other Dungans, they want only other Shaanxi Dungans marrying their daughters, while their sons are allowed to marry Gansu Dungan, Kirghiz, and Kazakh women.

As recently as 1962, inter-ethnic marriage was reported to be anathema among Dungans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Soviet Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-dHAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%2811%29+Two+ethnic+groups+in+Central+Asia+-+the+Dungans+and+the+local+Central+Asian+Arabs+-+were+highly+intolerant+of+marriages+outside+their+own+millieu+even+to+persons+of+the+same+faith.+As+reported+by+G.+G.+Stratanovich,+%2812%29+the+Dungans+adhered+strictly+to+both+ethnic+and+local+endogamy.&amp;dq=%2811%29+Two+ethnic+groups+in+Central+Asia+-+the+Dungans+and+the+local+Central+Asian+Arabs+-+were+highly+intolerant+of+marriages+outside+their+own+millieu+even+to+persons+of+the+same+faith.+As+reported+by+G.+G.+Stratanovich,+%2812%29+the+Dungans+adhered+strictly+to+both+ethnic+and+local+endogamy.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIguz75oDIyAIVA1U-Ch12uQeJ|year=1962|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]], the term Zhongyuanren ({{zh|c=中原人|l= A person from the [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains of China]]|labels=no}}) was synonymous with being mainstream Chinese, especially referring to [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] in [[Xinjiang]] or Central Asia.

The '''Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon''' (abbreviated as: '''DBUC'''; {{Lang-nl|Hollandsche Burgher Vereeniging van Ceylon}}), known commonly as the '''Dutch Burgher Union''' ('''DBU'''), is an organisation of [[Dutch Burghers]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was established on 18 January 1908 by [[R.G. Anthonisz|Richard Gerald Anthonisz]].&lt;ref name="island" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Jupp, James | year=2001 | pages=940 | isbn=978-0-521-80789-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.island.lk/2002/10/22/featur03.html | title=Remembering Richard Gerald Anthonisz — a pioneer and visionary | last=Brohier | first=Deloraine |newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]] | date=22 October 2002 | accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:DBU - Colombo.jpg|thumb|The memorial plaques at the Dutch Burgher Union building, Colombo]]
On 12 November 1907 Richard Anthonisz organised a preliminary meeting of men and women of the Dutch Burgher community at the Lindsay School Hall in [[Bambalapitiya]] to consider the establishment of a Dutch Burgher Union. A small committee was appointed to draft a constitution for the union. The inaugural general meeting of the union was held on 18 January 1908 at the [[Pettah, Colombo|Pettah]] Public Library, with 267 enrolled members present.&lt;ref name="Brohier"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.island.lk/2008/10/19/features13.html | title=The Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon - its founding and growth | newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]] | date=19 October 2008 | last=Brohier | first=Deloraine |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting [[Frederick Charles Loos]], a [[Proctor]] and [[Legislative Council of Ceylon#Members of the Legislative Council|Member of the Legislative Council]] was elected as the first president of the union, with Anthonisz as Honorary Secretary (a position he retained until 1915).&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/081019/Plus/sundaytimesplus_09.html | title=Keeping alive a rich heritage - The Dutch Burgher Union celebrates 100 years! | newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | last=Colin-Thomé | first=David | date=19 October 2008 | accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second president of the union was [[Henry Lorenz Wendt]] who, however, died two months after his election and in 1912 was replaced by [[Fedrick Henry de Vos]]. In 1913 Sir [[Hector William van Cuylenburg]] was elected as the fourth president of the union. In 1916, Anthonisz was elected President, a position he held for twenty-four years until his death in 1930.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;

The first writ described the vision of union, and it stated ".. promote the moral, intellectual and social well-being of the Dutch and Dutch Burgher descendants in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).. and among many others .. the promotion of fellowship, self-help, self-reliance and thrift."&lt;ref name="island"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=41814 | title=The Dutch Burghers of Ceylon: The Quest to retain a forgotten heritage | newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]] | date=24 December 2011 | accessdate=24 March 2015 | author=Senanayake, Maheen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the Dutcher Burgher Union was governed by strict genealogical qualifications, with members having to demonstrate an uninterrupted line of [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descent from a European employee of the [[Dutch East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Lanka in the Modern Age : A History of Contested Indentities | last=Wickramasinghe |first=Nira | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | date=2006 | page=164 | isbn=978-0-8248-3016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the union [[sublet]] two rooms at Sea View, [[Kollupitiya]]; the union soon set about raising funds to establish a more permanent accommodation.&lt;ref name="Brohier"/&gt; In 1913, the union acquired land in [[Cinnamon Gardens]] on Buller's Road (now Bauddhaloka Mawatha) and Serpentine Road, where it constructed a two-storey building. The ground floor of the building contains a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] which leads to a large public room, with a sprung teak floor, which was used for lectures and dances. A carved wooden staircase leads to the upper floor, which houses a billiard room, bar, card rooms, a drawing room and a reading room.&lt;ref name="Brohier"/&gt; There is also a wing containing residential quarters for outstation members and space at the rear of the building which was initially used for horses and carriages and subsequently for car parking. The grounds also contained tennis courts and a netball court. As the suburb developed, the union was forced to sell much of its grounds for new roads and to pay for increasing property rates.

The Dutch Burgher Union still operates in Colombo as a centre for social and community activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://burgherassocn.org.au/about/ | title=About the Burghers | publisher=Burgher Association (Australia) | first=Brohier | last=Deloraine | accessdate=24 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "once a powerful secret society but now only a gloomy billiard hall near Buller Road, draped in dust and cobwebs".&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt;

The union manages [[St Nikolaas' Home]] (a care home for elderly women of the Burgher community), and the Brohier Memorial Home (for elder men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=101194 | title=Residences for the Senior Citizen in Sri Lanka | publisher=The Island (Sri Lanka) | date=5 April 2015 | accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2006/11/14/fea03.asp | title=Life in an Elders' home | publisher=The Daily News (Sri Lanka) | date=14 November 2015 | accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notability ==
The union has published in excess of 70 volumes of ''The Journal of the Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon''. The first copy was issued on 31 March 1908 and copies were issued regularly until 1968. No volumes were published between 1968 and 1981, mostly due to the exodus of members of the burgher community from Sri Lanka. The journal is now published annually. The journals contain genealogies of over 200 burgher families and played a significant role on pre-migration in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; The journals are considered as good resource for researching the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://coraweb.com.au/Contents/Item/Display/1114?CurrName=India+and+Sri+Lanka+%28Ceylon%29&amp;CurrSlug=categories%2Findia-and-sri-lanka-ceylon | title=Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dündar Kılıç''' (real name '''Dündar Alikılıç''') (1935 – 10 August 1999) was an infamous mob boss in the [[Turkey|Turkish]] underworld. He earned himself the nickname of being the '[[Capo di tutti capi|godfather of godfathers]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Underground Has Been Orphaned|first=Hakan|last=Aslaneli|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202957/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=13705|url=http://turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=13705|archivedate=2007-09-27|date=1999-08-15|work=[[Turkish Daily News]]|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and rise in underworld == 
Dündar Kılıç was born in 1935 in a village of the [[Surmene]] District of [[Trabzon]] in the eastern [[Black Sea Region, Turkey]]. He moved to [[Ankara]] with his family when he was nine years old, and got his first gun a year later. His first arrest was at the age of 14, by the 1960s he was already known as one of Ankara's leading criminals. His primary income came from [[extortion]] and illegal gambling, and he became known as the 'good godfather', allegedly because he would only have his people collect money from those already involved in illegal deals. Eventually the authorities caught up with him and he was arrested and jailed for a murder he committed in 1960.

== Release from prison and continued rise ==
Kılıç was released from prison in 1965. Upon his release, he soon set up various 'offices' around [[Istanbul]] that were to be used as part of an illegal check and bond trading operation. During this period he received financial help from Kurtoglu family. 

After this, Kılıç's run-ins with the law only increased. He was alleged to be involved in at least three murders, narcotics and weapons smuggling and was interrogated by police hundreds of times. Despite going away to prison for long periods, he would easily control his operations from behind bars and his absence was barely felt. Working for Kilic became a sign of prestige in the underworld. He, supposedly got some help from "Derin" Devlet", a phrase used among Turkish for an unknown unit in the state which conducts covert operations. 

Kılıç was arrested as part of a large scale joint operation against organized crime by [[Millî İstihbarat Teşkilâtı|Turkey's National Intelligence Organization]] (MIT) and local police in 1984. Initially arrested on 11 different charges, Kılıç was taken to a prison in Ankara's Mamak.

== Murder of daughter ==
Kılıç's daughter, Uğur Kılıç, was shot dead in January 1995 by a gunman sent by her ex-husband, another mob boss named [[Alaattin Çakıcı]]. Kılıç retreated into his summer house and went into deep mourning. It is still unknown why this did not lead to a full-scale gang war between Kılıç and Çakıcı, and it is rumored that it was in fact an [[honour killing]] jointly ordered by Kılıç and Çakıcı, and this is why he did not take steps to avenge his daughter. Uğur had allegedly betrayed Çakıcı while the two were still married, and Kılıç would not stand for this.

== Charity work ==
Kılıç was known to have used some of his ill-gotten gains on charity work. He had financed the education of over 10,000 students and provided poor neighborhoods with food, drinks and coal during the winter. But he refrained to speak about this side of him in interviews, preferring only to say "Of course, we help certain people".

== Death ==
Kılıç died on 10 August 1999 in the American Hospital in Istanbul at the age of 64. Prior to his death, he was already battling eye cancer, heart and lung problems. Dündar Kılıç was interred in [[Zincirlikuyu Cemetery]] in Istanbul.

'''Marie Effie Wilton, Lady Bancroft''' (1839–1921) was an English actress and [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]]. She appeared onstage as '''Marie Wilton''' until after her marriage in December 1867 to [[Squire Bancroft]], when she adopted his last name. Bancroft and her husband were important in the development of [[Victorian era]] theatre through their presentation of innovative plays at the London theatres that they managed, first the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] and later the [[Haymarket Theatre]].

==Life and career==
Bancroft was born at [[Doncaster]], and as a child appeared on the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] with her parents, who were both actors.  Among her early parts was that of Fleance in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1846).  She made her London début on 15 September 1856, at the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum Theatre]], as the boy Henri in ''Belphegor'', playing the same night in ''Perdita; or, the Royal Milkmaid''.  She won great popularity in several boy roles, in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s at various theatres, as Cupid in two different plays, and notably as Pippo, in ''The Maid and the Magpie'', by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]], at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] (1858).  For several years she remained at the Strand, taking numerous parts of the same general type.

===Prince of Wales's Theatre (1865–80)===
[[File:Marie Effie (née Wilton), Lady Bancroft by Thomas Jones Barker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Bancroft painted by [[Thomas Jones Barker|Thomas Barker]], c. 1870s]]
In April 1865, she began, in partnership with [[Henry James Byron|Henry Byron]], the management of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  For two seasons before her marriage she managed the theatre alone.  She secured as a leading actor [[Squire Bancroft]], whom she had met shortly before in [[Liverpool]] and married in December 1867.   The Prince of Wales's soon became noted for its series of successful comedies by [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]], namely: ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'' (1865), ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869) and ''M. P.'' (1870).

Bancroft regularly took the principal female parts in these pieces, her husband playing the leading man.  Together, Robertson and the Bancrofts are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as 'drawing-room comedy' or 'cup and saucer drama'.  The Bancrofts gave Robertson an unprecedented amount of directorial control over the plays, which was a key step to institutionalizing the power that directors wield in the theatre today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Vorder Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002], accessed 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bancrofts were also responsible for making fashionable the 'box set', which [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris]] had first used at the [[Olympic Theatre]] in the 1830s – this consisted of rooms on stage which were dressed with sofas, curtains, chairs, and carpets on the stage floor.  They also provided their actors with salaries and wardrobes.  Also, the Bancrofts redesigned their theatre to suit the increasingly upscale audience: "The cheap benches near the stage, where the rowdiest elements of the audience used to sit were replaced by comfortable padded seats, carpets were laid in the aisles, and the pit was renamed the stalls."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/cup.php Information about Cup and Saucer realism] (PeoplePlay UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that the Bancrofts produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre were ''Tame Cats'' (1868), ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1874), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), ''The Vicarage'' (1877), and ''Diplomacy'' (1878, an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Dora'').  Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft likewise presented at their theatre a number of prominent actors, among them [[John Hare (actor)|Hare]], [[Charles Francis Coghlan|Coghlan]], the [[William Hunter Kendal|Kendals]], and [[Ellen Terry]].  In 1879, she reprised a favourite role of hers, Nan, in [[John Baldwin Buckstone]]'s ''Good for Nothing'', in a mixed bill alongside [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'', in which she played Jenny Northcott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=2074 Information about ''Sweethearts''] (PeoplePlay UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:ladybancroft.jpg|thumb|upright|As Nan, in ''Good for Nothing'' (1879)]]

In 1879, the Bancrofts moved to the [[Haymarket Theatre]], a larger house, where they continued the successful presentation of modern comedy until both retired from the stage on 20 July 1885, having made a considerable fortune producing theatre.  After that, they rarely appeared onstage.

==Books==
Bancroft was the author of the novel ''The Shadow of Neeme''.  She also collaborated with her husband in the production of two volumes of reminiscences called ''Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft On and Off the Stage, Written by Themselves'' (London, 1888) and ''The Bancrofts: Recollections of Sixty Years'' (Dutton and Co.: London, 1909).

'''Elizabeth Booth''' (born 1674) was a resident of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], who became one of the accusers during the [[Salem Witch Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/asal_ch.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/sal_acct.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
At 18, Booth was a member of the “outer circle” of girls who  supposedly afflicted by witchcraft, and she participated in examinations, inquests, and trials.&lt;ref name=Drake2009&gt;Drake, Samuel G. “Annals of Witchcraft in New England”, ''The Salem Witch Trials Reader'', ed.

Booth's testimony helped lead to the hangings of [[John Proctor (Salem witch trials)|John Proctor]] and [[Wilmot Redd]], the pressing to death of [[Giles Corey]], and the imprisonment and death sentence of the pregnant Elizabeth Proctor. In October 1692, she married Jonathon Pease.&lt;ref name=Drake2009/&gt;

'''Emilio Kosterlitzky''' (1853&amp;ndash;1928) was a [[Russia]]n-born [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]] linguist and [[Mercenary|soldier of fortune]] who eventually became a [[spy]] for the [[United States]]. He also oversaw the [[deportation of Yaqui under the Porfiriato]], an event that lead to the deaths of over 20,000 [[Yaquis]] (over 2/3s of their population.)&lt;ref name=Tukari&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Emil Kosterlitzky was born on November 16, 1853  in [[Moscow]], to a [[Germany|German]] mother and Russian [[Cossack]] father. He was noted for his language ability; he spoke [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

In his teens, Emil joined the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] as a [[midshipman]]. By 1871, at the age of 18, he deserted his ship in [[Venezuela]]. Kosterlitzky then traveled to the [[Mexican state]] of [[Sonora]],  where he changed his name to ''Emilio'' and joined the [[Military of Mexico|Mexican Army]]. During the 1880s he fought in the [[Mexican Apache Wars]]. He also assisted American troops pursuing [[Apaches]] across the border under the 1882 United States&amp;ndash;Mexico reciprocal border crossing treaty. Kosterlitzky became known to the American troops, who called him the "''Mexican Cossack''". In 1885, Kosterlitzky was appointed commander of the ''Gendarmería Fiscal'', the [[Border control|customs guard]] for the Mexican government, by [[Porfirio Díaz|President Porfirio Díaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanderwood, P. J. (1972). Review: Emilio Kosterlitzky: Eagle of Sonora and the Southwest Border. by Cornelius C. Smith, Jr. The Hispanic American Historical Review, 52(2), pp. 304-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Kosterlitzky was [[Battle of Nogales (1913)|captured]] in [[Nogales, Sonora]], by revolutionaries during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. He was jailed until 1914, when he, his wife, Francesca, and two daughters moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in the United States, where he became a translator for the [[U.S. Postal Service]]. During [[World War I]], he pretended to be a [[German Empire|German]] physician. He returned to Mexico in 1927, to investigate a plot against the government of the state of [[Baja California]].

Kosterlitzky died in Los Angeles on March 2, 1928, and is buried in [[Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]].

'''Georg Scherer''' (1540 – 30 November 1605) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[pulpit]] [[orator]] and controversialist.

Born at [[Schwaz]], in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Scherer entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1559. Even before his [[ordination]] he was famed for his preaching powers. For over forty years he labored in the Archduchy of [[Austria]]. To Scherer, in part, it owes the retention of the faith. In 1577 he was Court preacher to the [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]; he retained the post until 1600. In 1590 he was appointed Rector of the Jesuit College at [[Vienna]]; the sternness of his character scarcely fitted him for the office, and he was transferred (1594) to [[Linz]]. The story of his being struck blind in the pulpit, after having exclaimed: "If the Catholic Church is not the True Church, may I become blind," is a pure invention.

Scherer was a man of boundless energy and rugged strength of character, a strenuous controversialist, a genuinely popular orator and writer. He vigorously opposed the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] professors who meditated a union with the Greek Schismatics, refuted Lutheran divines like [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]] and [[Jacob Heerbrand|Heerbrand]], and roused his countrymen against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. Believing like his contemporaries that the State had the right to put [[witch]]es to death, he maintained, however, that since they were possessed, the principal weapons used against them should be spiritual ones, e.g.[[exorcism]]s or [[prayer]]. Scherer's severe attitude towards [[witchcraft]] did not meet the approval of his general, [[Claudio Acquaviva|Acquaviva]]. His eloquence and zeal made many converts, amongst them the future [[Melchior Klesl|Cardinal Khlesl]]. His works were collected and published by the [[Premonstratensians]] of Bruck, [[Moravia]] (1599–1600), and again issued at [[Munich]] (1613–1614).

==The Plainacher Witch Affair==
In 1583, Scherer played a role in Vienna's one and only case of witch-burning.&lt;ref&gt;The account that follows is taken from Gabriele Lukacs and Robert Bouchal, "Unheimliches Wien" (Vienna: Pichlicher Verlag, 2010), pp. 53-54, with background from Johann Szegö, "Alt-Wien neu entdeckt" (Vienna: Metroverlag, 2010), p. 36 &lt;/ref&gt; 70-year-old [[Elisabeth Plainacher|Elise Plainacher]] of [[Mank]], [[Lower Austria]], a Lutheran, had raised her granddaughter Anna Schlutterbauer ever since the girl's mother died. When Anna was 17 her father, Elise's Catholic son-in-law, took custody and moved with Anna to [[St. Pölten]]. There, the girl suffered seizures, probably epileptic, that were blamed on a hex placed by her grandmother. Anna and Elise were brought to Vienna, where Scherer conducted a rigorous "investigation" (exorcisms combined with interrogation) at St. Barbara's Church in Fleischmarkt. Over the course of several days, Scherer claimed to have discovered 12,652 demons inhabiting Anna's body and spirit. At length the exhausted and confused girl agreed that her grandmother had hexed her. Elise was taken to the notorious Rogues' House (''Malefizhaus'') at 10 Rauhensteingasse for interrogation under torture. Her eventual confession was so unconvincing that the mayor of Vienna appealed to Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] to overturn it, but Scherer brought ecclesiastical pressure to bear and the Emperor declined the petition. Elise Plainacher was burned at the stake and her ashes thrown into the Danube on 28 September 1583.

==Death==
Scherer died in Linz of [[apoplexy]].

==iOS device security==
In August 2007, seventeen-year-old George Hotz became the first person reported to carrier-unlock an iPhone.&lt;ref name="Unlocked iPhone"&gt;{{youtube | id=tvJ1RGlxe8Q | title=Unlocked iPhone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/07/120507fa_fact_kushner "Machine Politics: The man who started the hacker wars."],"[[The New Yorker]]", May 7, 2012, accessed April 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHACKED YOU"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kronfeld |first=Melissa Jane |last2=Liddy |first2=Tom |agency=Post Wire Services |title=IHACKED YOU!

On July 13, 2010, Hotz announced the discontinuation of his jailbreaking activities, citing demotivation over the technology and the unwanted personal attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GeoHot says Goodbye to iPhone Community | url=http://www.tech-exclusive.com/geohot-says-goodbye-to-iphone-community/ | website=Tech-exclusive.com | date=July 13, 2010 | access-date=April 15, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013021034/http://www.tech-exclusive.com/geohot-says-goodbye-to-iphone-community/ | archive-date=October 13, 2013 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he continued to release new software-based jailbreak techniques until October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Limera1n iOS 4.1 Jailbreak Released By Geohot | url=https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/limera1n-ios-4-1-jailbreak-released-by-geohot-10-10-2010/ | first=Roland | last=Hutchinson | website=Geeky-gadgets.com | date=October 10, 2010 | access-date=February 26, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016005247/https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/limera1n-ios-4-1-jailbreak-released-by-geohot-10-10-2010/ | archive-date = October 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PlayStation 3 security==
In December 2009, Hotz announced his initial intentions to breach security on the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;!--ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/2009/12/real-challenge.html |title=A Real Challenge |publisher=George Hotz |date=December 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref--&gt; Five weeks later, on January 22, 2010, he announced that he had performed his first theoretical achievement. This consists of the initial read and write access to the machine's system memory as well as [[hypervisor]] level access to the machine's CPU.&lt;!--ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geohotps3.blogspot.com |title=On The PlayStation 3 |publisher=George Hotz}}&lt;/ref--&gt;&lt;!--ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/2010/01/hello-hypervisor-im-geohot.html |title=Hello hypervisor, I'm geohot |publisher=George Hotz |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref--&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8478764.stm |title=PlayStation 3 'hacked' by iPhone cracker |publisher=BBC News |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |first=Jonathan |last=Fildes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2010, Hotz released the [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to the public. On March 28, 2010, Sony responded by announcing their intention to release a PlayStation 3 [[PlayStation 3 system software|firmware update]] that would remove the [[OtherOS]] feature from all models,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/28/ps3-firmware-v3-21-update/ PS3 Firmware (v3.21) Update – PlayStation Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; a feature that was already absent on the newer Slim revisions of the machine.{{fact|date=February 2017}}

On July 13, 2010, never having achieved any method of reading, installing, or modifying software on the PS3, Hotz posted a message on his Twitter account stating that he had abandoned his efforts of trying to crack the PS3 any further due to the system security's extreme difficulty.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt.com"&gt;[http://gamingbolt.com/2010/07/13/the-ps3-just-too-difficult-to-crack/ The PS3 just too difficult to crack – GamingBolt.com: Video Game News, Reviews, Previews and Blog].

On December 29, 2010, notable hacking group [[fail0verflow]], known for the reverse engineering of security models found in consumer electronics devices, performed an academic presentation at the 27th Chaos Communications Congress technical conference, of their accomplishments with the PlayStation 3. They presented the methods they'd devised for having successfully penetrated the device's security model, yielding the root signing and encryption keys. These keys are the essential element of a full (and even minimally usable) breach, capable of installing and running any new software on any PlayStation 3 unit.&lt;ref name="f0f at CCC, PS3News"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4087.en.html |title=Console Hacking 2010: PS3 Epic Fail |publisher=fail0verflow |work=Chaos Communication Congress |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f0f at CCC, YouTube"&gt;{{youtube |id=4loZGYqaZ7I |title=27C3 - Chaos Communication Congress 2010 - fail0verflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to his continued publication of PS3 exploit information, Sony filed on January 11, 2011 for an application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against him in the US District Court of Northern California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/46739945/Motion-for-TRO Motion for TRO].

===Sony lawsuit===
{{main article|Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. v. Hotz}}
After the root keys of the console were published, Sony initiated litigation against George Hotz and predecessor PlayStation 3 hacking group known as fail0verflow. Hotz published his commentary on the case, including a song about the "disaster" of Sony.&lt;ref name="geohot's Sony rap"&gt;{{youtube |id=9iUvuaChDEg |title=The Light It Up Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony in turn has demanded social media sites, including YouTube, to hand over IP addresses of people who visited Geohot's social pages and videos; the latter being the case only for those who "watched the video and 'documents reproducing all records or usernames and IP addresses that have posted or published comments in response to the video".&lt;ref name="wired_201112"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/geohot-site-unmasking/ | title=Judge Lets Sony Unmask Visitors to PS3-Jailbreaking Site | publisher=Condé Nast Digital | work=Wired.com | date=March 4, 2011 | accessdate=December 6, 2011 | author=Kravets, David | quote=A federal magistrate is granting Sony the right to acquire the internet IP addresses of anybody who has visited PlayStation 3 hacker George Hotz’s website from January 2009 to the present. Thursday’s decision by Magistrate Joseph Spero to allow Sony to subpoena Hotz’s web provider (.pdf) raises a host of web-privacy concerns. Respected for his iPhone hacks and now the PlayStation 3 jailbreak, Hotz is accused of breaching the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other laws after he published an encryption key and software tools on his website that allow Playstation owners to gain complete control of their consoles from the firmware on up. Sony also won subpoenas (.pdf) for data from YouTube and Google, as part of its lawsuit against the 21-year-old New Jersey hacker, as well as Twitter account data linked to Hotz, who goes by the handle GeoHot.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PayPal]] has granted Sony access to Geohot's PayPal account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamepolitics.com/2011/03/16/george-hotz-paypal-subpoena-limited-california-court-docs-reveal|title=George Hotz PayPal Subpoena Limited to California, Court Docs Reveal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the judge of the case granted Sony permission to view the IP addresses of everyone who visited geohot.com. In April 2011, it was revealed that Sony and Hotz had settled the lawsuit out of court, on the condition that Hotz would never again resume any hacking work on Sony products.&lt;ref name="joystiq_201112"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/11/sony-and-playstation-3-jailbreaker-george-hotz-settle-out-of-cou/ | title=Sony and PlayStation 3 jailbreaker George Hotz settle out of court | publisher=AOL, Inc. | work=Joystiq | date=April 11, 2011 | accessdate=December 6, 2011 | author=Gilbert, Ben | quote=After a short but rather storied history, infamous PlayStation 3 jailbreaker George "GeoHot" Hotz and Sony Computer Entertainment of America have settled their legal dispute, with a statement on the PlayStation Blog stating the two parties "reached an agreement in principle" around 10 days ago. According to said agreement, Hotz has "consented to a permanent injunction," meaning he super swears he won't do it again (legally speaking, of course), though no other terms are given. We were told by an SCEA rep that the terms of the settlement (beyond what was disclosed) are confidential.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of April 2011, an anonymous hacker broke into the [[PlayStation Network]] and [[PlayStation Network outage|stole personal information of some 77 million users]]. Hotz denied any responsibility for the attack, and said "Running homebrew and exploring security on your devices is cool; hacking into someone else's server and stealing databases of user info is not cool".&lt;ref name="wired_201112"/&gt;

==Rooting the AT&amp;T and Verizon Galaxy S5==
In June 2014, Hotz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=3280118|title=geohot|publisher=|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a [[Rooting (Android OS)|root exploit]] software hack for [[Samsung Galaxy S5]] devices used in the US market.&lt;ref name=ibt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/geohot-towelroot-exploit-roots-galaxy-s5-devices-att-verizon-1602368|title=Geohot Towelroot Exploit Roots Galaxy S5 Devices On AT&amp;T And Verizon|author=Luke Villapaz|date=June 16, 2014|work=International Business Times|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploit is itself built around Linux kernel CVE-2014-3153,&lt;ref name=debian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2014/msg00130.html|title=[SECURITY] [DSA 2949-1] linux security update|publisher=|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oneclick /&gt; which was discovered by hacker Pinkie Pie, and it involves an issue in the Futex subsystem that in turn allows for privilege escalation. The exploit, known as ''[https://towelroot.com towelroot]'', was designated a "one-click Android rooting tool"&lt;ref name=oneclick&gt;[http://thehackernews.com/2014/06/towelroot-one-click-android-rooting.html Towelroot: One-Click Android Rooting Tool Released By Geohot], The Hacker News, June 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; by the hacking community because it was designed to be installed quickly like an [[Mobile app|App]]; other rooting hacks were typically uploaded from a nearby PC with a cable and necessitated rebooting the device with a special set of key presses.

Although originally released for the Verizon Galaxy S5, the root exploit was made compatible with most Android devices available at that time. For example, it was tested and found to work with the AT&amp;T Galaxy S5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S4 Active. Updates continued to be applied to the root exploit to increase its capabilities with other devices running Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2783157|title=I'm throwing a party and you should come **G... - Verizon Samsung Galaxy S 5|work=XDA Developers|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updates to the Android operating system closed the source of the exploit.

In addition to having made a meaningful side income from public donations solicited for his exploits,&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; Hotz has been employed at Facebook and Google.

Since September 2015, Hotz has been working on his own AI startup called comma.ai.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pub/george-hotz/76/664/b38 George Hotz's LinkedIn Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Bloomberg, Hotz revealed he is building vehicular automation technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms.

Tesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a vision chip component from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Bloomberg reporter Ashlee Vance.&lt;ref name="teslamotors.com"/&gt; Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered advice on Hotz's [[autonomous car|self-driving car]] project in a December 2015 interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/|title=Elon Musk Says Tesla Vehicles Will Drive Themselves in Two Years|author=Kirsten Korosec|date=December 21, 2015|work=Fortune|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonçalo Mabunda''' was born on January 1, 1975 in [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. He is an artist and anti-war activist. Mabunda has exhibited in important museums such as the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Center Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[Museum of Arts and Design|Museum of Art and Design]] in New York, [http://www.gwbien.com/eng/main/ Gangwon International Biennale], South Korea, , the [[Museum Kunstpalast|Museum Kunst Palast]] in Dusseldorf, the [https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/andreas-gursky Hayward Gallery] in London, the [[Mori Art Museum]] in Tokyo, the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], the [[Tropenmuseum|Tropen Museum]], Amsterdam, [[Armed Forces Museum (Norway)|Norway Army Museum]], [https://www.nmm.nl/en/ Netherlands Army Museum], [[Swedish Army Museum|Sweden Army Museum]] and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.magnin-a.com/fr/artistes/presentation/858/goncalo-mabunda|title=Gonçalo Mabunda|access-date=2017-06-18|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabunda started his work in the context of a project implemented since 1995, by the Christian Council of Mozambique (CCM) that has been scouring the country and collecting weapons from individuals and communities after a civil war that lasted almost twenty years. In this project some weapons are destroyed while others are deactivated and given to men and women like Mabunda, to sculpt into art. Some 800,000 weapons have been collected since the CCM launched this project, called Transforming Guns into Hopes.

The name, is inspired by a Bible verse from the book of Micah: 'They will hammer their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/katherine-baldwin/goncalo-mabunda-mozambique-turning-weapons-of-war-in_b_1284882.html|title=Turning Weapons of War into Works of Art|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabunda is a partner artist of the African Artists for Development, an organisation that backs community development projects associated with works by contemporary artists.

== Art ==
Gonçalo Mabunda uses Kalashnikovs, rockets, pistols, and shell casing in order to make anthropomorphic figures out of the deconstructed weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2015/06/18/goncalo-mabunda-et-la-guerre-civile-mozambicaine-recyclee_4656813_3212.html|title=Gonçalo Mabunda et la guerre civile mozambicaine recyclée|date=2015-06-18|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-06-16|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt; By turning weapons into life-like figures, Mabunda literally turns death into life. The figurines are also representative of the over 1 million people killed during his country’s civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jackbellgallery.com/artists/29-Gon%C3%A7alo-Mabunda/overview/|title=Gonçalo Mabunda|website=Jack Bell Gallery|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabunda has also lost relatives during the war, which makes working with and deconstructing weapons used during the 16-year war more important for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2014/mar/06/art-of-war-melding-arms-into-weapons-of-mass-attraction-in-pictures|title=Art of war: melding arms into weapons of mass attraction – in pictures|last=Elie|first=Janise|date=2014-03-06|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes thrones and masks out of these deactived weapons used during the [[Mozambican Civil War|Mozambique Civil War.]] The masks are based on traditional Sub-Saharan African masks, however, the original twist on the art form by creating them out of weapons is unique to Mabunda. Representing power, Mabunda’s thrones mock how the traditional power rests on weapons. By using weapons, Mabunda’s work carries the message of how further violence can be prevented, and that destroying the weapons of war can be done in an aesthetic and artistic way.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goncalo-mabunda.com/en/case-studies|title=CASE STUDIES {{!}} gonçalo mabunda|website=www.goncalo-mabunda.com|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabunda’s art directly challenges the absurdity of war. His work has a modernist style to it and has been compared to the work of [[Georges Braque|Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Gonçalo Mabunda’s artwork has been followed by the international press, French Newspaper Le Monde, huffingtonPost from the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/katherine-baldwin/goncalo-mabunda-mozambique-turning-weapons-of-war-in_b_1284882.html|title=Turning Weapons of War into Works of Art|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among medias that followed Mabunda’s work  effect on his local community.

In 2014, Mabunda was one of 20 African artists to figure in French art collector André Magning publication ''African Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.magnin-a.com/fr/artistes/presentation/858/goncalo-mabunda|title=Gonçalo Mabunda|access-date=2017-06-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Mabunda’s works were the main subject of CNN show ''Inside Africa'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/africa/mozambique-art-from-weapons-and-rubble/index.html|title=In Mozambique: Art from weapons and rubble|last=CNN|first=Daisy Carrington and Colin Hancock, for|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a TV series highlighting different economic, social and cultural personalities in Africa.

Former US President [[Bill Clinton]], a fan of Mabunda’s work, commissioned the artist to create trophies for his philanthropic organisation the Clinton Global Initiative.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In July 2017, his pieces were shown in the European Parliament in an exhibition organized by the [[European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES)|European Centre for Electoral Support]] at the occasion of the launch of a handbook produced in the context of a project funded by the European Union on "Preventing Electoral Conflicts and Violence in the countries of the Southern African Development Communities" that includes Mozambique.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The launching seminar in the European Parliament was chaired by the Member of the European Parliament, [[Judith Sargentini]], former Chief Observer to the EU election observation mission in Mozambique and Tanzania and co-chaired by [[Lojze Peterle|Alojz Peterle]], Member of the European Parliament, former Chief Observer to the EU election observation mission in Kenya.

He is a [[Dinka]] tribesman.

Maker competed in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|men's]] [[marathon]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Due to civil war that saw South Sudan split from [[Sudan]], he has refused to compete under the flag of the latter, stating that, "It would be betraying my people". He was one of four athletes competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics under the Olympic flag rather than that of an individual country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012 Olympics: South Sudan's Guor Marial allowed to compete under Olympic flag in London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/9417428/London-2012-Olympics-South-Sudans-Guor-Marial-allowed-to-compete-under-Olympic-flag-in-London.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=21 July 2012 |date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Maker left home at the age of seven to live with his uncle in northern Sudan.&lt;ref name=beeb /&gt; In 1994, at the age of nine, he fled from a refugee camp during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/19225751 |title=BBC Sport - Olympic marathon: Guor Marial, running for the world |publisher=BBC news |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While 28 members of his family were killed during the conflict,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; he was able to escape to [[Egypt]], and then permanently to the [[United States of America|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guor Marial: An Olympian without a country |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-la-la-sp-on-guor-marial-olympics-20120721,0,7071095.story |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[Asylum in the United States|refugee status]] by the United States when he was 16, and now lives and trains in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]. Though his parents survived the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]], at the time of the 2012 Olympics he had not seen them in 20 years.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympian without a country won't march in opening ceremony |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/story/2012-07-26/London-Olympics-Mike-Lopresti-Guor-Marial/56522722/1 |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=28 July 2012 |date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he returned to South Sudan in 2013 and was reunited with his parents.&lt;ref name=beeb /&gt; Eight of his brothers and sisters were killed in the war.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Guor Marial: Marathon Runner Flees Sudan, Heads to London Olympics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joshua-kors/guor-marial-marathon-runn_b_1693767.html |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=28 July 2012 |first=Joshua |last=Kors |date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began participating in track and field while attending [[Concord High School (New Hampshire)|high school]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/346760/going-the-distance&lt;/ref&gt; after being encouraged by his gym teacher&lt;ref name=beeb /&gt; and also competed in college at [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]], where he was an [[All-America]]n athlete.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;

==2012 Summer Olympics==
Marial fulfilled the A-qualification standard for the marathon in October 2011, allowing him to participate in the Olympic marathon event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Marial's case was called "unique" by the IOC,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/guor-marial-is-a-marathoner-without-a-country-running-under-the-olympic-flag/2012/08/10/684df5f2-e322-11e1-89f7-76e23a982d06_story.html Guor Marial is a marathoner without a country, running under the Olympic flag], [[Washington Post]], August 10, 2012. Retrieved August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; as prior to the games South Sudan had yet to form a National Olympic Committee and seek full recognition by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), which would have allowed them to send a team and compete under the [[flag of South Sudan]]. He holds [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent resident status]] in the [[United States]], but not [[Citizenship in the United States|citizenship]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; According to his interview in [[Runner's World]], He applied for naturalization to become a U.S. citizen in 2011 and had his naturalization interview, but his application remains pending: "Technically, I was supposed to be a citizen last June, because I did everything, I did my citizen test, I did my interview, I did my fingerprint, and everything was all set. All I needed to do was go to their office and get my passport and do the ceremony. That was in June 2011, but there has been a security background check...and that's what took everything longer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympics.runnersworld.com/2012/for-south-sudan-runner-country-comes-before-olympics/  For South Sudan Runner, Country Comes Before Olympics], [[Runner's World]],  July 20, 2012. Accessed August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Olympic Committee of [[Sudan]] offered to allow Marial to compete as a member of the Sudanese team, however he rejected this offer, saying, "It's not right for me to do that.  It's not right for me to represent the country I refuged from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For South Sudanese marathoner, Olympics would be the ultimate refuge |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-18/sports/chi-for-south-sudanese-marathoner-olympics-would-be-the-ultimate-refugee-20120717_1_south-sudan-london-olympic-ioc |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=21 July 2012 |date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say, "If I ran for Sudan, I would be betraying my people. I would be dishonoring the two million people who died for our freedom."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

The IOC-executive board announced its decision on 20 July to allow Marial to participate as an [[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Athlete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-executive-board-meets-ahead-of-london-games/168640 |title=IOC Executive Board meets ahead of London Games |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marial's travel documentation could not reach him in time, and so he could not march in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] on 27 July.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;

Marial finished 47th in the marathon, with a time of 2:19:32.&lt;ref name="London2012results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event/men-marathon/index.html?v=20120812-134414552 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128053356/http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event/men-marathon/index.html?v=20120812-134414552 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |title=Men's Marathon - Olympic Athletics, London 2012 |publisher=London 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His personal best is 2:12:55.&lt;ref name="SudanTribune" /&gt;

He competed at the 2012 Olympics using his adopted name of Marial, which was the surname of his uncle, however he has since reverted to his birth name.&lt;ref name=beeb /&gt;

'''Hamza bin Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden''' ({{lang-ar|حمزة بن أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن}}; born 1989), better known as '''Hamza bin Laden''', is a son of [[Osama bin Laden]]. His father, as well as his brother Khalid, were killed in the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|2011 Navy SEAL raid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/may/05/obama-bin-laden-pr-defeat|title=Obama's Bin Laden coup risks becoming PR defeat|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2011-03-05|location=London|first=Paul|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
In January 2001, Hamza (then 12 years old), his father and other family members attended the wedding of his brother Mohammed bin Laden in the southern Afghan city of [[Kandahar]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robinson, ''Bin Laden: Behind the Mask of the Terrorist'', p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage shot in [[Ghazni province]] in November of the same year shows Hamza and some of his siblings handling U.S. helicopter wreckage and working alongside [[Taliban]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1644044.stm|title=Bin Laden sons 'fighting with Taleban'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2007-09-13 | date=2001-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydemocracy.net/counterpunch/osseiran08212006.htm|
title=Osama's Confession; Osama's Reprieve|publisher=mydemocracy.net|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, it was claimed that Hamza and his brother [[Saad bin Laden]] had been wounded and captured in Ribat, Afghanistan.

Hamza married a daughter of [[Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah]] when he was 17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/01/19/New-footage-shows-Hamza-bin-Laden-at-his-wedding-in-Iran.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career with al-Qaeda==
In a 2005 video titled ''The [[Mujahideen]] of Waziristan'', Hamza is shown participating in an [[al-Qaeda]] assault on Pakistani security forces in the south [[Waziristan]] tribal region between Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1345776.cms|title=Hamza Laden is his father's true successor|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=2007-09-13|date=2005-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, it was reported that he was again in the [[Pakistan tribal belt|tribal belt]] that encompasses the Pakistan/Afghanistan border region taking a senior role with al-Qaeda forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22396488-663,00.html |title=Bin Laden son Hamza rises to al-Qaida cause|work=[[The Herald Sun]]|accessdate=2007-09-13 |date=2007-09-11 |first=Fox |last=Ap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGYUj5IDN0XSzX8TSg9TJEjOz7jg|title=Tentacles spread from Al-Qaeda's lair in Pakistan|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |accessdate=2007-09-13|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028171056/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGYUj5IDN0XSzX8TSg9TJEjOz7jg|archivedate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] published a translation of a poem said to be written by Hamza, which had been published on an extremist Islamic Web site. In the poem Hamza wrote "Accelerate the destruction of America, Britain, France and Denmark." In response British MP [[Patrick Mercer]] dubbed Hamza bin Laden the ''Crown Prince of Terror''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1398695.ece#OTC-RSS&amp;ATTR=News|title=Bin Laden's son in web terror rant|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=2008-07-09|location=London|first=Simon|last=Hughes|date=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamza bin Laden was implicated in the 2007 assassination of the former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://haltingarkansasliberalswithtruth.com/2011/05/11/hamza-bin-laden-wants-to-keep-his-fathers-family-business-of-terror-going|title=Hamza bin Laden wants to keep his father’s family business of terror going |date=2011-05-11|work=The Daily Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]], Hamza was under house arrest in Iran when Bhutto was assassinated and was not released until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://kronosadvisory.com/Kronos_US_v_Sulaiman_Abu_Ghayth_Statement.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2015, he released an audio message for the very first time. He called upon followers in Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza to wage jihad, or holy war, on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33927562&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2016 it was reported he had released an audio message focused on the issues of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]]. He said the "blessed Syrian revolution" had made the prospect of "liberating" [[Jerusalem]] more likely. "The Islamic umma (nation) should focus on jihad in al-Sham ([[Syria]]) … and unite the ranks of mujahedin," he said. "There is no longer an excuse for those who insist on division and disputes now that the whole world has mobilised against Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/hamza-bin-laden-could-osamas-son-be-the-future-leader-of-al-qaeda-a7024951.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, media reported that he had issued an audio message threatening the [[United States]] in revenge for [[Death of Osama bin Laden|his father's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/osama-bin-laden-son-hamza-vows-revenge-us-for-killing-his-father-in-video-posted-online-a7129281.html|title=Son of Osama bin Laden issues threat of revenge against the US|author=Asma Alabed|date=10 July 2016|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bin-ladens-son-threatens-revenge-us-40470389|title=Bin Laden's Son Threatens Revenge Against US|author=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21-minute speech entitled "We Are All Osama", he said "We will continue striking you and targeting you in your country and abroad in response to your oppression of the people of Palestine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and the rest of the Muslim lands that did not survive your oppression," Hamza said. "As for the revenge by the Islamic nation for Sheikh Osama, may Allah have mercy on him, it is not revenge for Osama the person but it is revenge for those who defended Islam."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-qaeda-idUSKCN0ZQ0AA&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, a recording by Hamza bin Laden was published by [[As-Sahab]], encouraging terrorist attacks against Western targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/05/hamza-bin-laden-offers-advice-for-martyrdom-seekers-in-the-west.php |title=Hamza bin Laden offers 'advice for martyrdom seekers in the West' |first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |date=May 13, 2017 |quote=Hamza bin Laden, the son of al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, has released a new message offering "advice" for "martyrdom seekers in the West."

In the light of his growing influence within al-Qaeda, the United States classified Hamza bin Laden as Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2017. This effectively put him on a blacklist aimed at restricting his movement and economic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/266536.htm|title=State Department Terrorist Designation of Hamza bin Laden|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, a video was released in which he calls on his followers to attack Jews, Americans, Westerners and Russians, via [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] attacks using any means possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/15/middleeast/al-qaeda-bin-laden-son/ |title=Latest al Qaeda propaganda highlights bin Laden's son |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==May 2011 raid==
Hamza is the son of Khairiah Sabar of Saudi Arabia, one of bin Laden's three wives who were living in the [[Abbottabad]] compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/f/print/news/international/offspringing_away_D8Em36hO54wvw7khw7snOO|title=Osama's youngest son escaped capture|author=Chuck Bennett|publisher=New York Post|date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Osama bin Laden compound1.jpg|thumb|Osama bin Laden's last home, in Abbottabad.]]
Interrogation of the surviving wives of [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] by Pakistani intelligence after the raid on the Abbottabad compound revealed Hamza was the only person missing. He was not among those killed or injured. The raid conducted by the [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group|SEAL team]] was thorough: infrared technology, as well as ground troops, remained confident nobody inside the compound had escaped. There were no hidden exit tunnels from the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1385588/Osama-Bin-Laden-Did-Crown-Prince-Terror-escape-special-forces-raid.html|location=London|work=Daily Mail|title=The Bin Laden who got away: Was 'Crown Prince of Terror' the son who escaped U.S. special forces raid?|date=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/11/hamza-bin-laden-escape-raid_n_860537.html|title=Hamza Bin Laden, 'Crown Prince Of Terror,' May Have Escaped Raid (VIDEO)|author=Dean Praetorius|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter confiscated in the raid, written by bin Laden and addressed to his "Chief of Staff" [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]], bin Laden mentions his desire that Hamza would be educated in [[Qatar]] as a religious scholar so that he could "refute the wrong and the suspicions raised around Jihad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/osama-bin-laden-a-lion-in-winter/2012/03/18/gIQADmAKLS_story.html|title=A lion in winter |author=[[David Ignatius]]|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same letter revealed that Hamza did not escape the raid because he was not even present in Abbottabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/osama-bin-ladens-son-hiding-in-pakistan_773754.html|title=Osama bin Laden’s son hiding in Pakistan?|work=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-106998-Osamas-son-may-be-hiding-in-Pakistan|title=Osama’s son may be hiding in Pakistan|date=7 May 2012|work=The News International, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Letters from the compound also confirmed that Osama was grooming Hamza to be his heir apparent following the death of Hamza's older brother Saad in a 2009 US drone strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8512008/What-next-for-Brand-Bin-Laden.html|title=What next for Brand Bin Laden?|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=David Gardner|date=May 14, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saadirandeath&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/iran-double-crossed-osama-bin-laden/story-fnb64oi6-1226348138493|title=Iran double-crossed Osama bin Laden|publisher=The Australian|author=Christina Lamb|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.googleusercontent.co.in/2016/07/bin-ladens-son-threatens-revenge-220.html|title=Bin Laden's son threatens revenge against US - Google User Contents- Trending Things You Search in Google!|website=www.googleusercontent.co.in|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">'''Henrik Gustaf Ulfvenklou''' (1756–28 September 1819), was a Swedish [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[Mediumship|medium]] who gained a great influence in the circles of [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] by claiming to communicate with the spirits of the dead.

Lieuntenant Ulfenklou arrived in Stockholm in 1783, where he made success in the esoteric circle around Duke Charles. He claimed he stood in contact with the duke's dead mother, [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]], whose spirit he sent to observe Charles's brother the king, [[Gustav III of Sweden]], who was in Italy at that time (1784). He sent a warning with a prediction to Gustav, which is said to have caused damage in the relationship between Charles and Gustav. [[Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm|Reuterholm]] disliked him and had him sent away, and when he returned in 1785, Reuterholm was to have "exposed" him to Charles. His public career then ended, but he continued to have influence over Charles through correspondence.

'''Herbert Richard Baumeister''' (April 7, 1947 – July 3, 1996) was an American man who was suspected of being a [[serial killer]]. A resident of [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]], [[Indiana]], Baumeister was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found human remains on Baumeister's property and issued an arrest warrant, after which he fled to [[Canada]] and subsequently committed [[suicide]] before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his [[suicide note]] made no mention of the murder allegations.&lt;ref name="Albert"/&gt; He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along [[Interstate 70]], which occurred in the early to mid-1980s.

==Early life==
Baumeister was born in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister.&lt;ref name="People1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerome|first1=Richard|last2=Weinstein|first2=Fannie|title=While Julie Was Away|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=December 23, 1996|volume=46|issue=26|url=http://people.com/archive/while-julie-was-away-vol-46-no-26/|accessdate=January 17, 2015|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|issn=0093-7673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Longtime anesthesiologist Herbert E.

By the onset of [[adolescence]], however, he began exhibiting [[anti-social behavior]]; acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk. In his teens, he was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but did not receive further [[psychiatric]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Albert"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Baumeister,%20Herb%20-%20fall,%202005.pdf|title=Herb Baumeister "The I-70 Strangler"|author1=Natasha Albert |author2=Erin Allen |author3=Sherri Armistead |author4=Josh Bradley |date=|website=|publisher=Department of Psychology, Radford University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Baumeister attended [[Indiana University]] for a semester before dropping out, and later returned in 1967.&lt;ref name="People1996"/&gt; In 1972, he attended a semester at [[Butler University]].&lt;ref name="Star15-9-1996"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labalme|first1=Jenny|title=Businessman puzzled people in life and death|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21146253/the_indianapolis_star/|accessdate=June 21, 2018|work=The Indianapolis Star|date=September 15, 1996|pages=41, 49|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic, but also by more and increasingly bizarre behavior.&lt;ref name="Star15-9-1996"/&gt;

Baumeister married Juliana "Julie" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children.&lt;ref name="People1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star15-9-1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meredith|first1=Robyn|title=Seven Skeletons, and a Suburb in Shock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/16/us/seven-skeletons-and-a-suburb-in-shock.html|accessdate=January 4, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage.&lt;ref name="Albert"/&gt; In the 1970s, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father. His wife said he was "hurting and needed help."&lt;ref name="People1996"/&gt; He founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988&lt;!-- People1996 ref says 1989 --&gt; (not affiliated with [[Save-A-Lot]] grocery store chain).&lt;ref name="Star15-9-1996"/&gt;

==Investigation==
By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, investigators were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a [[gay bar]] patron calling himself "Brian Smart" had killed a friend of his and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an [[erotic asphyxiation]] session. Harris eventually happened to see this same man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number.&lt;ref name="Albert"/&gt; From this data, police identified "Brian Smart" as Herb Baumeister.
   
Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. When Baumeister refused, investigators confronted his wife, Julie, who also forbade police to search the house. By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for [[divorce]], she consented to a search.&lt;ref name="People1996"/&gt; The search of the {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation; it turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Will|title=House with dark past fulfills family's dream|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21146336/chillicothe_gazette/|accessdate=June 21, 2018|work=[[Chillicothe Gazette]]|date=October 30, 2012|page=4A|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Dawn|title=Retro Indy: Heinous crimes of serial killers in Indiana|url=http://www.indystar.com/wlna/news/history/retroindy/2014/09/12/indiana-serial-killers/15402833/|accessdate=January 12, 2017|work=The Indianapolis Star|date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a warrant out for his arrest, Baumeister fled to [[Ontario]], Canada, where he committed suicide at [[Pinery Provincial Park]] by shooting himself in the head. In his suicide note, he described his failing marriage and business as his reason for killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labalme|first1=Jenny|title=Suicide note mentions marriage, business but not bones|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21146358/the_indianapolis_star/|accessdate=June 21, 2018|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=July 6, 1996|pages=1–2|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not confess to the murders of the men found in his backyard.&lt;ref name="People1996"/&gt;

Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of [[Interstate 70]] between Indianapolis and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley who was later found dead; like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indiana Businessman Is Linked To 9 Other Killings of Men |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/29/us/indiana-businessman-is-linked-to-9-other-killings-of-men.html |agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=The New York Times |date=April 29, 1998|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugh II''' ({{circa}} 1106 – 1134), also called '''Hugh du Puiset''',{{efn|Also ''de Puiset'' or ''de Le Puiset''}} was a [[Crusade]]r and the [[Count of Jaffa]]. He revolted against King [[Fulk of Jerusalem]] in 1134.

==Arrival in the kingdom==
Hugh was the son of [[Hugh I of Jaffa]] and his wife Mamilia (or Mabilla). According to [[William of Tyre]], his father had come to Jerusalem on a [[pilgrimage]] during the reign of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]], and Hugh was born in [[Apulia]] during the journey. However, according to John L. La Monte, it is more likely that Hugh I came to the east with [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]] in 1106. In any case, Hugh I was named Count of Jaffa after his arrival (by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], if in 1106), but soon died.

When Hugh II came of age he arrived in Jerusalem to claim his inheritance, and married Emelota (or Emma), niece of the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Arnulf of Chocques]]. Hugh was a relative of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]], [[Fulk of Jerusalem|King Fulk]]'s wife, as their fathers Hugh I and Baldwin II were cousins; Melisende's grandmother, also named Melisende, was a sister of Hugh's grandmother Alice. Hugh had a close relationship with Melisende, but he "...was rumoured to be on too familiar terms with the queen..." (William of Tyre, 14.16) and came into conflict with a jealous Fulk. It was also rumoured that Hugh was simply arrogant and refused to pay [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to Fulk. The latter rumour also seems to the basis of the account of [[Orderic Vitalis]]; according to him, Hugh and other nobles were offended by Fulk, who brought [[House of Châteaudun|Angevin]] nobles and counsellors with him when he became king, and ignored the native barons of the kingdom.

==The revolt against Fulk==
In 1134 Hugh seems to have revolted against Fulk, along with [[Roman of Le Puy]], lord of [[Oultrejordain]]. According to William of Tyre, Hugh's stepson [[Walter I Grenier, Lord of Caesarea]] (Emelota's son through her first marriage to [[Eustace Grenier]]) accused Hugh of [[treason]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] at a meeting of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]''; Walter possibly did this with the urging of Fulk himself. Hugh denied the charges, and it was decided that the matter would be settled by [[trial by combat|judicial combat]]. When the appointed day arrived, Hugh did not appear, and he was found guilty ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''.

He allied with the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], and Fulk invaded [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] and besieged the city. Hugh's [[vavasour|rear-vassal]]s, including [[Baldwin I of Ramla|Baldwin of Ramla]] and [[Barisan of Ibelin|Barisan]], constable of Jaffa, deserted him and "wisely betook themselves to the king." (William of Tyre, 14.16) The usual punishment for such actions was permanent exile and confiscation of the rebel's territories, but in this case, perhaps due to Hugh's high status in the kingdom and his relationship with the queen, the Patriarch William mediated in the dispute, and Hugh was exiled for only three years.

==Attempted assassination==
[[File:Tyr1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Breton knight attacking Hugh]]
Hugh was free to remain in Jerusalem while waiting for a ship to take him into exile. One day, while playing [[dice]] on the street, he was brutally attacked by a [[Brittany|Breton]] knight. The knight was quickly apprehended and convicted:

{{quote|No accuser or witnesses were necessary to prove the crime, for it was well known to all. Since the regular process of law was needless, therefore, the king ordered a sentence commensurate with his guilt to be pronounced upon the man. The court accordingly convened, and the assassin was sentenced by unanimous consent to suffer the penalty of mutilation of his members. The judgment was reported to the king, who ordered the sentence to be carried out.| William of Tyre, 14.18}}

Rumours spread that Fulk himself had hired the knight to [[assassination|assassin]]ate Hugh, and public opinion considered Hugh to be innocent of the charges of treason and conspiracy. Fulk ordered "...that the tongue should not be included among the members so mutilated", supposedly so that he would not be accused of trying to silence the knight. In any case, the knight claimed to have acted on his own:

{{quote|It was impossible to extort from the criminal, either in secret or in public, before or after the sentence was carried out, an admission that this monstrous act had been done by the order or with the knowledge of the king. On the contrary, he declared that he had ventured to do the deed on his own initiative in the hope of gaining the king's favor.|William of Tyre, 14.18}}

Nevertheless Fulk no longer had the support of the public in the dispute.

Hugh remained in the kingdom for a short time, while his wounds healed. He then went into exile in Apulia, where his relative [[Roger II of Sicily]] named him Count of Gargan. Hugh never fully recovered, and died soon after his arrival.

==Aftermath==
Whether or not Fulk hired the Breton knight, he has been suspected, by Hans Mayer and other historians, of inciting Hugh to revolt so that he might take personal control of Jaffa. Because Hugh died before his three years of exile were over, his territories were confiscated and added to the royal domain, where they remained for the rest of the 12th century. Fulk began to build numerous castles in the area, including [[Ibelin (castle)|Ibelin]], to defend against Egyptian invasions. As a consequence of the revolt, the former rear-vassals of Jaffa became more powerful, such as [[Lordship of Ramla|Ramla]]. The lords of Ibelin and Ramla would become important in the affairs of the kingdom later in the century.

The dispute also led to a rift between Fulk and Melisende. Melisende, who legally ruled the kingdom in her own right with Fulk as consort, was supported by the Church and various other nobles, and Fulk and his supporters in the dispute for a time felt unwelcome and even unsafe. According to William of Tyre, "from that day forward, the king became so uxorious that...not even in unimportant cases did he take any measures without her knowledge and assistance." (William of Tyre, 14.18)

==Dating of the revolt==
Hugh's revolt was previously dated to 1132, due to the evidence in William of Tyre and Arab historian [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]]. However, William's chronology is probably confused, and al-Qalanisi's references to conflicts in the kingdom probably refer to those between Fulk and [[Pons of Tripoli]] in 1132. Hugh appears as count of Jaffa in [[charter]]s dated to 1133 and 1134, and the date of 1134 is now accepted by most scholars.

'''Jack William Hunter, Jr.''' (born June 1, 1974) is an [[United States|American]] radio host, political commentator and Politics Editor for [[Rare (news website)|Rare.us]], a Washington, D.C.-based news website. He began his career in the late 1990s on alternative rock station WAVF 96.1 FM using the moniker "Southern Avenger", an anonymous pro wrestler/superhero-style character. In 2007, Hunter began appearing every Tuesday and Friday morning on [[WTMA]] News-Talk 1250 AM, and contributed to a weekly column to the ''[[Charleston City Paper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/ArticleArchives?author=1072546 Jack Hunter at the Charleston City Paper]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was also an aide to U.S. Senator [[Rand Paul]], whom Hunter helped write the book ''[[The Tea Party Goes to Washington]]''.&lt;ref name=usatoday0609&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=James R.|last2=Gerth|first2=Joseph|title=Rand Paul staffer expressed support for Lincoln assassination|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is perhaps best known for his decades-old, racially charged writings whose reemergence caused a major media controversy for his boss, Senator Paul.

Hunter's reputation as a political operative was discredited following the ''[[Washington Free Beacon]]'''s revelation in July 2013 that he had repeatedly espoused racist views on a local South Carolina radio station under the Southern Avenger moniker. His racist comments included expressions of contempt for Hispanic immigrants, and a call for NAACP director [[Kweisi Mfume]], whom he referred to as "NAACP Grand Wizard," to be tied to a tree and whipped.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Alana (July 22, 2013).

==Political views==
Hunter is known for often providing commentary from [[libertarian]] and [[conservative]] viewpoints, with a particular focus on Ron Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns as well as Senator Rand Paul's influence within the Republican Party. Hunter has said he sees the [[liberal internationalism]] that is found in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[neoconservatism]] prominent in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to be ultimately indistinguishable from one another, which has led to criticism from both the mainstream left and the mainstream right.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Hunter supports a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy and considers the current U.S. foreign policy a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/foreign-intervention-can-create-more-problems-than-it-solves/Content?oid=3637705&lt;/ref&gt; He is also critical of [[neoconservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theamericanconservative.com/2011/06/23/whats-a-neoconservative/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over writings on race, American Civil War==
Hunter became the center of controversy in 2013 when the ''[[Washington Free Beacon]]'' reported that he had once espoused racist views on a local South Carolina radio station under the Southern Avenger moniker. His comments included expressions of contempt for Hispanic immigrants, and a call for [[NAACP]] director [[Kweisi Mfume]], whom he referred to as "NAACP Grand Wizard," to be tied to a tree and whipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Alana|title=The Confederacy Loses Again|url=http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-confederacy-loses-again/|website=Free Beacon|publisher=The Washington Free Beacon|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Jack|title=Confessions of a Right-Wing Shock Jock|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/confessions-of-right-wing-shock-jock-jack-hunter-100261.html#.VTxrb2RVikp|website=Politico|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these revelations, Hunter resigned from Rand Paul's staff in what the Senator called a "mutual decision."

Hunter's writings were reported by numerous mainstream media outlets on July 9, 2013. The Washington Post noted that Hunter had previously written that "Americans aren't wrong to deplore the millions of Hispanics coming here" and that "a non-white majority America would simply cease to be America." 

The ''Free Beacon'' also noted that Hunter had previously written in support of the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], and formerly had served as a chairman of the [[League of the South]], which advocates [[Secession in the United States|Southern secession]] and, according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], promotes the idea of [[White supremacy|a society dominated by whites]].&lt;ref name=goodman0709&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Alana|title=Rebel Yell: Rand Paul aide has history of neo-Confederate sympathies, inflammatory statements|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/|newspaper=Washington Free Beacon|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was also criticized for suggesting that African-American director Spike Lee be tied to a tree and whipped for his critical comments about Mel Gibson's movie, ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]''.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

Critics on both the political left&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Rachel Maddow Show' for Tuesday July 9, 2013|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52440007/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/#.VTxyc2RViko|website=NBC News|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the political right&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Jennifer|title=Jack Hunter and Rand Paul 'playing the game'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/07/12/jack-hunter-and-rand-paul-playing-the-game/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemned Hunter for the past remarks, and some political analysts said that Senator Rand Paul's continuing association with Hunter would imperil Paul's prospects as a contender in the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].

On July 18, Hunter's former longtime editor at the ''Charleston City Paper'', Chris Haire, wrote an article sharply critical of both Hunter and Paul, denouncing Hunter for having asked Haire, long before the current controversy had erupted, to remove from the internet dozens of past columns that Hunter said no longer reflected his views.&lt;ref name=chrishaire&gt;{{cite news|last=Haire|first=Chris|title=Former editor of Rand Pauls neo-confederate staffer talks about the Southern Avenger; Jack Hunter asked me to delete columns|url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/HaireoftheDog/archives/2013/07/18/former-editor-of-rand-pauls-neo-confederate-staffer-talks-about-the-southern-avenger|newspaper=Charleston City Paper|date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haire called the request cowardly and said that Hunter had made it solely for appearances—to help Paul in the 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=chrishaire/&gt; Noting controversial writings by Hunter "in support of racially profiling Hispanics, praising white supremacist [[Samuel T. Francis|Sam Francis]], blast[ing] the House of Representative's apology for slavery" and calling upon black Americans to "apologize to white people for their high crime rates", Haire characterized Hunter as "the most common kind of racist, the one that doesn't realize that he is one".&lt;ref name="chrishaire" /&gt;

By July 21, less than two weeks after the original ''Washington Free Beacon'' article had been published, Hunter had resigned from his position on Paul's staff, saying he wanted to avoid being a distraction for the senator.&lt;ref name=antle&gt;{{cite news|last=Antle III|first=W. James|title=Jack Hunter leaves Rand Paul staff, returns to punditry|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/21/controversial-rand-paul-aide-leaves-staff-returns-to-punditry/|newspaper=The Daily Caller|date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter also said he would return to political commentary.&lt;ref name=antle/&gt; Paul called the resignation "a mutual decision," agreeing that Hunter's past views had become a distraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brammer|first=Jack|title=Sen.

In a statement written in response to the controversy, Hunter wrote that he was "embarrassed by some of the comments I made precisely because they do not represent me today."&lt;ref name=hunterresponse0709&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Jack|title=My statement on recent attacks|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013|url=http://www.southernavenger.com/uncategorized/my-statement-on-recent-attacks/|publisher=Southern Avenger (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed abhorrence of racism and criticized the ''Free Beacon'' article as "not accurately reflect[ing]" his character or views.&lt;ref name=hunterresponse0709/&gt;
In June 2015, Hunter wrote a piece in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' condemning his past promotion of Confederate iconography in light of the [[Charleston church shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/22/the-southern-avenger-repents-i-was-wrong-about-the-confederate-flag|title=The 'Southern Avenger' Repents: I Was Wrong About the Confederate Flag|last=Hunter|first=Jack|date=2015-06-22|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to express regret about his past views and opposes the alt right and other movements that promote white nationalism or racial hatreds.

'''Jan Trefulka''' (15 May 1929 – 22 November 2012) was a Czech writer, translator, literary critic and publicist.

==Biography==
Trefulka was born in Brno, [[Czech Republic]], where he also died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-writer-dissident-jan-trefulka-dies/869256|title=Czech writer, dissident Jan Trefulka dies|publisher=[[Czech News Agency]]|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school with [[Milan Kundera]] and the pair remained lifelong friends.

Critical of the [[communist]] regime, in 1950 he was expelled from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovakian Communist Party]] for "anti-party activities" along with Kundera. At the same time he was expelled from [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] where he was studying [[literature]] and [[aesthetics]]. Trefulka wrote about his run-in with the communist party in his first novella ''Pršelo jim štestí'' (Happiness Rained on Them, [[1962 in literature|1962]]). Trefulka was involved with [[Samizdat]] - the publishing and distributing of censored literature under communist rule, and was a signatory of [[Charter 77]].

Trefulka found it difficult to find work in the country after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.  He spent time unemployed and working as a manual labourer.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]] and the downfall of the communist regime in 1989, he became more active in public life, becoming president of the Association of Moravian-Silesian Writers and a member of the first Czech Television Council.

'''Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis''' (1 April 1746 – 25 August 1807) was a French [[jurist]] and politician in time of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[First French Empire|First Empire]]. His son, [[Joseph Marie Portalis]], was a diplomat and statesman.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Portalis was born at [[Le Beausset]], currently in the [[Var (département)|Var]] [[Département in France|département]] of  [[Provence]], [[France]] to a [[bourgeois]] family, and was educated by the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] at their schools in [[Toulon]] and [[Marseille]], and then went to the [[Paul Cézanne University|University of Aix]]. As a student, he published his first two works, ''Observations sur Émile'' (on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'') in 1763 and ''Des Préjugés'' in 1764.

In 1765 he became a [[lawyer]] at the ''[[parlement]]'' of [[Aix-en-Provence]], and soon obtained so great a reputation that he was instructed by [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Étienne François de Choiseul]] in 1770 to draw up the decree authorizing the marriage of [[Protestant]]s. From 1778 to 1781, Portalis was one of the four ''[[assessor (law)|assessor]]s'' or administrators of Provence.

===Revolution===
In November 1793, after the [[First French Republic]] had been proclaimed, he came to [[Paris]] and was thrown into prison for being the brother-in-law of [[Joseph Jérôme, comte Siméon|Joseph Jérôme Siméon]], the leader of the [[Girondist|Federalists]] in Provence. He was soon released to a ''[[Psychiatric hospital|maison de santé]]'', where he remained until the fall of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].

On being released he practised as a lawyer in Paris, and, in 1795, he was elected by the capital to the [[Council of Ancients]] of the [[French Directory]], becoming a leader of the moderate party opposed to the directory rule. As a leader of the moderates, he was targeted by the ''[[coup d'état]]'' of 18 Fructidor, but, unlike General [[Charles Pichegru]] and [[François Barbé-Marbois]], he managed to escape to [[Switzerland]], then to [[Holstein]], and did not return until after [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] established himself as the leader of the new [[French Consulate|Consulate]].

===Under Napoleon===
Bonaparte made him a ''[[Council of State (France)|conseiller d'état]]'' in 1800, and then charged him, with [[François Denis Tronchet]], [[Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu]], and [[Jacques de Maleville]], to draw up the ''[[Napoleonic code|Code Civil]]''. Of this commission he was the most notable member, and many of the most important titles, notably those on marriage and [[Inheritance|heirship]], are his work. He gave a famous speech, "Discours préliminaire au projet de code civil" in which he presented the core principles of the civil code: [[legal certainty]] (non-retroactivity), the notion of "ordre public" and the forbidding of the "arrêt de règlement" which was a characteristic production of the Ancien Régime's judges and was contrary to the idea that only the law prevails.

In 1801 he was placed in charge of the Department of Religion or Public Worship, and in that capacity had the chief share in drawing up the provisions of the [[Concordat of 1801]]. In 1803 he became a member of the [[Académie française]], in 1804 [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Public Worship]], and in 1805 a ''[[Legion of Honour|Chevalier Grand-Croix de la Légion d'honneur]]''. He soon after became totally blind, and, after an operation, he died at Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4944">'''John Wroe''' (19 September 1782 – 5 February 1863) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the [[Christian Israelite Church]] in the 1820s after having what he believed were a series of  [[Vision (religion)|visions]].

== Biography ==
Wroe was born in the village of [[East Bowling]], near [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]] to a [[worsted]] manufacturer and farmer, and baptised in the town. After a rather scanty education, he entered his father's business, but later took a farm. He married and brought up a family of seven children.

In 1819 Wroe became ill with a [[fever]] and two doctors who attended him considered his life was in serious danger. Wroe asked for a [[minister of religion|minister]] to come and pray with him. Although his wife sent for four church ministers, each refused his request. Wroe then asked his wife to read a few chapters of the [[Bible]] to him, and after a while, he gradually recovered his bodily health, but his mental distress continued and he "wrestled with God" day and night for some months.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

A short time later, Wroe started having [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], and often became blind and unable to speak — on one occasion remaining blind for six days. During these periods, Wroe said, many remarkable events were foretold and revealed to him: the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] told him to relinquish his worldly employment, so he devoted his life to travelling and preaching, where he gained many followers and persuaded them that he was a messenger of God.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

Wroe, although often persecuted and threatened, travelled throughout [[Europe]] including [[Gibraltar]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]]. He later travelled to the United States, and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Christian Israelite Website 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Melbourne]], Australia, in 1863, aged 81, leaving the church affairs in the hands of his [[trustees]]. The Christian Israelite Church was originally set up in [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], but its headquarters moved to [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Lancashire]], which the church wanted to turn into a "new Jerusalem". From 1822 to 1831 Ashton-under-Lyne was the church's headquarters. Wroe intended to build a wall around the town with four gateways, and although the wall was never constructed, the four gatehouses were, as was a printing press. Popular opinion in the town turned against Wroe when he was accused of indecent behaviour in 1831, but the charges were dismissed. The Church spread to Australia, where it is still active.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tameside.gov.uk/blueplaque/prophetwroe |title=A Tribute to Prophet Wroe 1782&amp;ndash;1863 |publisher=Tameside.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
Wroe’s life was the basis of a novel, ''[[Mr Wroe's Virgins]]'' by [[Jane Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Rogers |authorlink=Jane Rogers |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CF51GvYY2QC

'''Karel Urbánek''' (born 22 March 1941 in [[Bojkovice]], [[Moravia]]) is a retired Czech politician. He was the last [[Communism|Communist]] leader of [[Czechoslovakia]] during the [[Velvet Revolution]].

A former [[Bojkovice]] railway station manager, he replaced [[Miloš Jakeš]] as Secretary General of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] after a swift election on 24 November 1989. The only important decision he made during his very short term was to cancel the clause of the Constitution which gave the Communist Party a monopoly of power, though Communist rule had effectively ended with Jakeš' resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/cs/karel-urbanek|title=Karel Urbánek|publisher=Ústav pro studium totalitních režimů|language=Czech|accessdate=27 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101013038/http://www.ustrcr.cz/cs/karel-urbanek|archivedate=1 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained as party leader until 20 December, when he was succeeded by [[Ladislav Adamec]].

'''Kathleen Collins''' (March 18, 1942 – September 18, 1988) (also known as Kathleen Conwell, Kathleen Conwell Collins or Kathleen Collins Prettyman) was an African-American poet, playwright, writer, filmmaker, director, civil rights activist, and educator from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. Her two feature narratives—''The Cruz Brothers and Miss Malloy'' (1980) and ''[[Losing Ground (1982 film)|Losing Ground]]'' (1982)—furthered the range of Black women's films. Although ''Losing Ground'' was denied large-scale exhibition, it was among the first films created by a Black woman deliberately designed to tell a story intended for popular consumption, with a feature-length narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bobo|first1=Jacqueline|title=black women film and video artists|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-92041-8|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins thus paved the way for Julie Dash's ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'' (1991) to become the first feature-length narrative film created by a Black woman to be placed in commercial distribution. Influenced by [[Lorraine Hansberry]], she wrote about "African Americans as human subjects and not as mere '''race''' subjects" [emphasis in the original].&lt;ref name="Nelson2005"/&gt;

==Background==
Born to Loretta (''née'' Pierce) and Frank Conwell and raised in New Jersey, Kathleen, at the age of 15,

&lt;blockquote&gt;won first prize at an annual poetry reading contest at [[Rutgers University–Newark|Rutgers Newark College of Arts and Sciences]] for her rendition of [[Walt Whitman]]'s 'A Child Goes Forth' and 'I Learned My Lesson Complete'. An article in the March 3, 1958 ''[[Jersey Journal]]'' reported that in addition to working as assistant editor of the [[Lincoln High School (New Jersey)|Lincoln High School]]'s publication the ''Leader'', Conwell was on the editorial staff of the school yearbook, the ''Quill''; a member of the National Honors Society; and a past secretary of the Student Council.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;[http://kathleencollins.org/about/ "About"], Kathleen Collins website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After graduating from high school in 1959, Collins went to [[Skidmore College]], where she received a BA in philosophy and religion in 1963. In 1962, after her campus was visited by two leaders of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), she became active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], canvassing in [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] for black residents to register to vote; as a result, she was arrested twice while working with the [[Albany Movement]].&lt;ref name=biog /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndrewsFoster2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=William L.|last2=Foster|first2=Frances Smith|last3=Harris|first3=Trudier|title=The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9XtCY7cijMC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=August 28, 2012|date=February 15, 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513883-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Clayborne|title=The Student Voice, 1960–1965: Periodical of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIrMMp6_QMcC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=28 August 2012|year=1960|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-88736-323-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she graduated from Skidmore, she taught high-school French in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], while attending graduate school at [[Harvard]] at night. In 1965, she won a scholarship to study in France at [[Paris-Sorbonne University]], where, in 1966, she obtained an MA in French literature and cinema.&lt;ref name=biog /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndrewsFoster2001"/&gt;

==Career==
Collins joined the faculty of City College at the [[City University of New York]] and became a professor of film history and screenwriting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/12/01/what-happened-to-kathleen-collins/|first=Danny|last=King|title=What Happened to Kathleen Collins|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=December 1, 2016|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where cinematographer Ronald K Gray encouraged her to go ahead with a screenplay she had adapted from a [[Henry Roth]] short story. That film became ''The Cruz Brothers and Mrs. Malloy'', which eventually won First Prize at the [[Sinking Creek Film Festival]]. This was followed in 1982 by ''[[Losing Ground (1982 film)|Losing Ground]]'' (starring Seret Scott, [[Bill Gunn (writer)|Bill Gunn]], and [[Duane Jones]]), which she wrote and directed. ''[[Losing Ground (1982 film)|Losing Ground]]'' was the first feature-length drama directed by a black American woman&lt;ref name=1980s&gt;{{cite book | title = Post-Soul Nation: The Explosive, Contradictory, Triumphant, and Tragic 1980s as Experienced by African Americans {Previously Known as Blacks and Before That Negroes} |last = George | first = Nelson | date = 2004 | publisher = Viking | authorlink = Nelson George | isbn = 0670032751 | page = 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won First Prize at the [[Figueroa International Film Festival]] in [[Portugal]], garnering much international acclaim. Both films were shot in [[Rockland County, New York]], and are currently distributed by [[Milestone Films]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentcinemaoffice.org.uk/media/Films/LosingGroundPK.pdf "Losing Ground"], Milstone Film &amp; Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins wrote many other plays and screenplays, but her two most well-known theatrical plays are ''In the Midnight Hour'' (1981) and ''The Brothers'' (1982), both of which are available through [[Samuel French]]. Themes frequently explored in her work are issues of marital malaise, male dominance and impotence, freedom of expression and intellectual pursuit, and her protagonists are cited as "typically self-reflective women who move from a state of subjugation to empowerment."&lt;ref name="Nelson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Emmanuel Sampath|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature: A - C|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWH3wNV5HpQC&amp;pg=PA482|accessdate=August 28, 2012|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33060-5|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous accomplishments===
On Collins' abrupt death in 1988, the bulk of her work, most of it unpublished, was left to her daughter, Nina Collins, who in 2006 began to sift through her mother's enormous archive and began working to have it published, restored and reissued.

In 2015 ''[[A Public Space]]'' posthumously published Collins' short story "Interiors", a fictionalized account of her divorce from her first husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Kathleen|title=Interiors|url=http://apublicspace.org/magazine/detail/interiors_collins|journal=A Public Space|issue=23|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins' 1982 ''Losing Ground'' was restored and reissued in 2015.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kathleen Collins's Lost Masterwork, "Losing Ground"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/lost-found|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its first theatrical release in 2015 at Film Society of Lincoln Center, opening the series "Tell it like it is: Black Independents in New York, 1968-1986".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; It would later be described in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as "the great rediscovery of 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/whatever-happened-to-interracial-love-kathleen-collinss-revelatory-short-stories|title="Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?": Kathleen Collins's Revelatory Short Stories|last=Brody|first=Richard|date=December 1, 2016|work=The New Yorker|access-date=June 28, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Losing Ground'' and ''The Cruz Brothers and Mrs. Malloy'' were released together on two-disc sets (DVD or Blu-ray) by Milestone in April 2016.

In December 2016, a collection of Collins' short stories was published under [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins']] [[Ecco Press|Ecco]] imprint under the title ''[[Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?]]'' The title story was published by ''[[Granta]]'' in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Kathleen|title=Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?|url=https://granta.com/whatever-happened-to-interracial-love/|work=Granta|issue=136: Legacies of Love|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062484154/whatever-happened-to-interracial-love/|title=Whatever Happened to Interracial Love? - Kathleen Collins - Paperback|work=HarperCollins Publishers|access-date=July 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; stories were written in the 1970s and mined some of the same intimate territory of Black women's lives, loves, and losses as ''[[Losing Ground (1982 film)|Losing Ground]].'' Prior to its release, it was listed as one of the most anticipated books of the fall of 2016 by the ''[[HuffPost|Huffington Post]], [[New York (magazine)|New York]], [[The Boston Globe]], [[Lithub|Lit Hub]],'' and ''[[The Millions]].'' The collection received starred reviews in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and was named one of the best books of 2016 by outlets that included ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]],'' [[NPR]]''',''' ''[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]''''',''' ''[[Publishers Weekly]], and'' [[Vice Media|VICE]].

==Personal life==
Collins was married, but divorced in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Nina|title=The Fighter: Domestic Violence Against Men|url=http://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/advice/a11650/the-fighter-562842/|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=March 24, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had two children from her marriage: Nina Lorez Collins and Emilio Collins.

The '''legend of Billy the Kid''' has acquired iconic status in American folklore, yet the outlaw himself, also known as William Bonney, had minimal impact on historical events in [[New Mexico Territory]] of the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Tatum1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Tatum|title=Inventing Billy the Kid: Visions of the Outlaw in America, 1881-1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4jWAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1982|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-0610-4|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More has been written about [[Billy the Kid]] than any other [[Gunfighter|gunslinger]] in the history of the American West,&lt;ref name="MullinWelch1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert N.

When he was still alive, "Billy the Kid" had already become a nationally known figure whose exploits, real and imaginary, were reported in the [[National Police Gazette]] and the large newspapers of the eastern United States. After his death on July 14, 1881, all of New York City's papers ran his obituary, and within days, newspapers around the United States were printing exaggerated and romanticized accounts of Billy the Kid's short career.&lt;ref name="Nolan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The West of Billy the Kid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYhw78YF12IC&amp;pg=PA291|date=1 September 1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3104-7|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifteen or so [[dime novel]]s about his criminal career published between 1881 and 1906, the Kid was an outlaw antihero, customarily depicted as a badman with superior gunslinging skills, or even as a demonic agent of [[Satan]] who delighted in murder.&lt;ref name="Tatum198245"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Tatum|title=Inventing Billy the Kid: Visions of the Outlaw in America, 1881-1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4jWAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1982|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-0610-4|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Gary Anderson|title=American Indian Literature and the Southwest: Contexts and Dispositions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmF2CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|year=1999|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70488-6|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of the legend==
[[File:The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid Title Page.jpg|thumb|Garrett's "The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid" was published in 1882]]
Within six weeks of Bonney's death there appeared the first complete narrative of his life,  ''The True Life of Billy the Kid''. Written by dime novelist John Woodruff Lewis under the pen name "Don Jenardo", this pulp novel depicted Billy the Kid as a sadistic psychopath.&lt;ref name="Nolan2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The Billy the Kid Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwjjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=20 October 2014|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8254-4|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pat Garrett]], smarting from local outrage over his shooting of the Kid,&lt;ref name="Boggs2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnny D. Boggs|title=Billy the Kid on Film, 1911-2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SiXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=20 September 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0335-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; wanted to present his side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, ''[[The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid]]'', in 1882.&lt;ref name="Nolan2014358"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The Billy the Kid Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwjjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA358|date=20 October 2014|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8254-4|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]]'s postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist.&lt;ref name="Keleher2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

The lawman and former ranch hand [[Charlie Siringo]], who in his youth had ridden the range of eastern New Mexico and the [[Texas Panhandle]], the familiar haunts of William Bonney and Pat Garrett, and knew both of them, first told his version of the Kid's story in a chapter of his book,  "A Texas Cowboy" (1885).&lt;ref name="Tuska1994113"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Tuska|title=Billy the Kid, his Life and Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijLXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Charlie%20Siringo%22|date=30 May 1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he published a sympathetic biography, ''History of Billy the Kid'', in which he described the daily life of a cowboy realistically, but romanticized his account of Bonney with fantasies and exaggerations—its title page claimed "His six years of daring outlawry has never been equalled in the annals of criminal history."&lt;ref name="Siringo1920"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles A.

===Emerging symbol of the Old West===
The modern legend of Billy the Kid as an immortal figure of the Old West first developed within a larger cultural context of social upheaval in the late 19th and early 20th century United States.&lt;ref name="Reid2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret K.

By the mid-1920s, however, Bonney's place in the general awareness of the American public had diminished to the point that in 1925 Harvey Fergusson asked in the ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine, "Who remembers Billy the Kid?".&lt;ref name="Nolan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The West of Billy the Kid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdazBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295|date=16 February 2015|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-4887-8|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was revitalized the next year when Walter Noble Burns's book, ''The Saga of Billy the Kid'', appeared as the Book-of-the-Month Club selection for December 1926, and became a bestseller.&lt;ref name="Fishwick1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall William Fishwick|title=American Heroes: Myth and Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrsqAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%E2%80%9CBonney%22|year=1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-8371-6610-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success, and the fact that people who had actually known William Bonney were beginning to talk to reporters and write their memoirs, allowed stories of his exploits to regain a nationwide audience.&lt;ref name="Tatum1982101"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Tatum|title=Inventing Billy the Kid: Visions of the Outlaw in America, 1881-1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4jWAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1982|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-0610-4|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of "The Saga", in spite of its dubious facts and fabricated events, subsequently led to a proliferation of other books, magazines and newspaper articles, and then movies, about the life of Billy the Kid.&lt;ref name="Nolan2014104"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The Billy the Kid Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwjjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104|date=20 October 2014|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8254-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Billy the Kid in popular culture fluctuated between the poles of cold-blooded murderer without a heart and sentimental hero fighting for justice.&lt;ref name="Reid2004" /&gt; Kent Ladd Steckmesser wrote: "There are two Billy the Kids in legend.

The dramatic aspects of William Bonney's short life and violent death still appealed to popular taste, as they had in the heyday of the dime novels, but eventually an idealized image of Billy the Kid, as one who defends the underdog and fights against social injustice, came to the fore.&lt;ref name="Tatum1982190"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Tatum|title=Inventing Billy the Kid: Visions of the Outlaw in America, 1881-1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4jWAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1982|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-0610-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas historian, [[J. Frank Dobie]], wrote in ''A Vaquero of the Brush Country'' (1929): "...because his daring apotheosized youth—youth in the saddle—youth with a flaming gun—and because his daring kept him running and balancing on the edge of a frightful precipice...Billy the Kid will always be interesting, will always appeal to the popular imagination."&lt;ref name="DobieYoung1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

===Billy the Kid in film and on stage===
With the publication in 1926 of [[Walter Noble Burns]]'s book,"The Saga of Billy the Kid", the Kid's legend revived and was consolidated as a standard tale of the American Old West.&lt;ref name="LeemingPage1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Leeming|author2=Jake Page|title=Myths, Legends, and Folktales of America: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNaftfbYp3gC&amp;pg=PA147|date=28 January 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972895-4|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American movie director [[King Vidor]], who had wanted to film a Western-themed movie for some time, was inspired when he read Burns's book, and felt that the Kid's story had considerable dramatic appeal.&lt;ref name="Boggs201327"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnny D.

''[[Billy the Kid (1930 film)|Billy the Kid]]'', the first [[sound film|talking picture]] version of the legend, was released in 1930.&lt;ref name="DurgnatSimmon198896"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raymond Durgnat|author2=Scott Simmon|title=King Vidor, American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpR7J8Qd6z0C&amp;pg=PA96|date=January 1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05798-2|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film featured former college football star [[Johnny Mack Brown]] in the title role and Hollywood character actor [[Wallace Beery]] as Pat Garrett, but it was a box office failure. Nevertheless, Vidor's ''Billy the Kid'' set the pattern for Billy the Kid movies for the next fifty years, as other [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] followed its formula and made the Kid an instrument of justified vengeance and his enemies the villains of the story.&lt;ref name="Wallis2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utley2015107"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert M.

''The Outlaw'', starring [[Jack Buetel]] as Billy the Kid, [[Walter Huston]] as [[Doc Holliday]], and [[Jane Russell]] in her first movie role, was produced by [[Howard Hughes]] and finished in 1941, though not released until 1943.

The studio's drastically cut release version, disowned by Peckinpah, was initially a failure with major critics and the viewing public. Although its depiction of the Kid as a roguish anarchist opposed to illegitimate law (as enforced by Garrett on behalf of a corrupt power structure) was suited to the temper of the times,&lt;ref name="Nolan2014363"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The Billy the Kid Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwjjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA363|date=20 October 2014|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8254-4|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; it quickly left first-run theaters. Soon, however, reviews began to appear in smaller film magazines and journals in the United States and abroad that praised its artistry and breadth of vision. The film's reputation was on the ascendancy long before Peckinpah's preferred cut of the preview version was finally shown at the University of Southern California in 1986,&lt;ref name="Boggs2013209"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnny D.

==Billy the Kid as cultural icon==
The psychoanalyst [[Alfred Adler]] wrote an analysis in 1951 of the mythic aspects of the legend of Billy the Kid in which he compared the Kid to [[Oedipus]], [[King Arthur]], [[Robin Hood]], and other legendary heroes of the past.&lt;ref name="Adler1951" /&gt; Adler was the first writer to discuss the symbolic significance of Billy the Kid's nickname as a cultural totem.&lt;ref name="Fackler2003"/&gt;

[[Arthur Penn]]'s film, ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'' (1958), portrays Billy the Kid as a misunderstood youth, played by Paul Newman in the manner of [[James Dean]] in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', according to the film critic Robert Kolker. It similarly addresses the psychological motivations of those of its characters who resort to violence,&lt;ref name="Kolker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Phillip Kolker|title=A Cinema of Loneliness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJlJjCEk_UYC&amp;pg=PA45|date=7 July 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-973888-5|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a pseudo-[[Freud]]ian treatment of the subject characteristic of certain 1950s movies.&lt;ref name="Herzberg2013134"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Herzberg|title=Hang 'Em High: Law and Disorder in Western Films and Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSJ5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|date=28 August 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6838-6|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Digges''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|g|z}}; 1588 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1635) was an accomplished [[Hispanist]] and minor poet,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Digges, Leonard (1588-1635)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Steinberg, "Digges, Leonard," in: ''Cassell's Encyclopedia of World Literature,'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; a younger son of the astronomer [[Thomas Digges]] (1545&amp;ndash;95, and younger brother of Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (1583&amp;ndash;1639). After his father's death in 1595, his mother married Thomas Russell of Alderminster,&lt;ref&gt;A village about four miles south of Stratford.&lt;/ref&gt; who was named by [[William Shakespeare]] as one of the two overseers of his will.  There are varying opinions about the extent to which the young Leonard Digges might have been influenced in his choice of profession by his stepfather's association with Shakespeare; disagreements about whether he was or was not personally acquainted with the playwright have in recent years eclipsed discussion of the work of Digges himself.

==Life==
Leonard Digges matriculated at [[University College, Oxford]] in 1603, the year of his mother's remarriage, and graduated BA in 1606.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  This was followed by a period of study abroad.  He may have traveled to Spain with fellow Hispanist [[James Mabbe]], whom he knew from Oxford, for he wrote a note on the flyleaf of a book which Mabbe sent from Madrid to Will Baker, also a friend from Oxford days.  The book was a copy of ''Rimas'' by [[Lope de Vega]] (published in 1613); it still survives, in the library of [[Balliol College]].  Digges's inscription reads:

::Will Baker: Knowinge
::that M&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; Mab: was to
::sende you this Booke
::of sonets, w&lt;sup&gt;ch&lt;/sup&gt; with Spaniards
::here is accounted of their
::lope de Vega as in Englande
::wee sholde of o&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;: Will
::Shakespeare. I colde not
::but insert thus much to
::you, that if you like
::him not, you muste neuer
::neuer reade Spanishe Poet
:::::Leo:Digges&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morgan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ws1SAlRJ-Y8C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "'Our Will Shakespeare' and Lope de Vega: An Unrecorded Contemporary Document,"] in Allardyce Nicoll (ed.),''Shakespeare Survey,'' 16,Cambridge University Press, 2002 reprint, pp.118-120: Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life,'' ibid.p.313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony a Wood]] said of Leonard Digges that he "was esteemed by those who knew him in Univ.coll. a great master of the English language, a perfect understander of the French and Spanish, a good poet, and no mean orator."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Anthony, [https://archive.org/stream/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft_djvu.txt ''Athenae Oxonienses: an Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690''], published in London in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood says also that "upon his supplication made to the venerable convocation" of University College Oxford, Digges was made M.A. in 1626, "in consideration that he had spent many years in good letters in transmarine universities."  He lived in the College from then until his death in 1635, and was buried in the College chapel (no longer standing).

==Works==
Digges translated [[Claudian]]'s ''The Rape of Proserpine'' (printed [[1617 in literature|1617]]). His translation of ''Varia fortuna de soldado Píndaro'' by [[Gonzalo de Céspedes y Meneses]], was published in [[1622 in literature|1622]] as  ''Gerardo, the Unfortunate Spaniard'', and was used by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] as a source for his plays ''[[The Spanish Curate]]'' and ''[[The Maid in the Mill]]''.

Digges's publisher was [[Edward Blount]], a close friend of Mabbe's and one of the syndicate which published Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] in 1623.  Digges and Mabbe both contributed prefatory poems to the Folio, as did [[Ben Jonson]]—also published by Blount.  The previous year, Digges and Jonson had both contributed [[commendatory verse]]s to a work translated by Mabbe and published by Blount.&lt;ref name=Freehafer&gt;Freehafer, John, "Leonard Digges, Ben Johnson, and the Beginning of Shakespeare Idolatry", ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Winter, 1970), pp. 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; Commendatory verses by Digges were also included in an edition of Shakespeare's ''Poems'', published by [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] in 1640, five years after Digges had died.  Freehafer suggests that since these verses refer to Shakespeare's plays rather than to his poems, they may have been intended for the Second Folio.&lt;ref name=Freehafer/&gt;

The '''Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia''' ({{lang-gr|Λεβέντιο Μουσείο}}, {{lang-tr|Leventis Müzesi}}) in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], is home to an extensive collection of Cypriot works include archaeological artifacts, costumes, photographs, medieval pottery, maps and engravings, jewels, and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromuse.net/en/museums/museum/view-m/lebenteio-dimotiko/ EuroMuse: The Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LMM - Oinochoe.jpg|thumb|right|260px| [[Oenochoe]] from [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]], 750-600 BC]]
==History==
The '''Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/ipiresies_politistika_leventio2.shtm Leventio Municipal Museum], [http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/greekhome.shtm Nicosia Municipality], Cyprus.&lt;/ref&gt; presents the history and social development of the city of [[Nicosia]] from the [[Chalcolithic]] period (3000BC) to the present day. The museum was founded in 1984 after the initiative of the Mayor of Nicosia, Mr Lellos Demetriades. The museum is named after its donor Anastasios G. Leventis Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leventisfoundation.org/ The A. G. Leventis Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt; which bought and restored the building and its administered by the Municipality of Nicosia. In 1985, the Association of the Friends of the Museum was established. Its main objective is to assist in enriching the museum's collections. Anyone may join this association at an annual subscription fee of 5 Cyprus Pounds.

On April 20, 1989, the Municipality of Nicosia and the Anastasios G. Leventis Foundation opened the museum to the public, the first historical museum in [[Cyprus]]. The collections displayed in its permanent galleries represent over 5.000 years of the capital's history. 
The collection of the Museum were established after 1984. Most of them were gathered from donations, private collections, sponsoring and special funding from the Anastasios G. Leventis Foundation. Donations related with the history and social development of Nicosia are always welcome.

==Today==
The exhibits are arranged so that visitors are guided from the present days of Nicosia, the capital of the Republic of Cyprus, through to the Ancient period (3000BC). Every year the museum organises and hosts a number of temporary exhibitions, lectures, educational programmes and other events. The Shop of the Museum is run by the Association of the Friends of the Museum. Their task is to increase the sales of the shop, so that they buy and then donate to the Museum new objects for its collections. One may buy various souvenirs, copies of antique objects, books and unique gifts for friends. Every school year, since 1989, the museum has organised special educational programmes for school children of all ages.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Special workshops and educational programmes for children and adults are also organised during the year. A small library with publications and other material on the history of Nicosia as well as rare and old publications on Cyprus is open for researchers only by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydestination.com/cyprus/things-to-do/166144/the-leventis-municipal-museum My Destination: The Leventis Municipal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KhomyakovA AvtoportretABR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aleksey Stepanovich Khomyakov, co-founder of the Slavophile movement]]
This is a '''list of 19th-century Russian [[Slavophile]]s''':

'''Slavophilia''' is an intellectual movement originating from the 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. Slavophiles were especially opposed to the influences of Western Europe in Russia.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile Encyclopædia Britannica Slavophile article]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also similar movements in Poland, Hungary and Greece.

== Prominent Slavophiles ==
*'''[[Ivan Aksakov|Ivan Sergeyevich Aksakov]]''' (Russian: Иван Сергеевич Аксаков; {{OldStyleDate|October 8|1823|September 26}} - {{OldStyleDate|February 8|1886|January 27}}, [[Moscow]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[littérateur]] and notable Slavophile. He was the son of [[Sergey Aksakov]] and brother to [[Vera Aksakova]] and [[Konstantin Aksakov]]. He was born in what is now [[Bashkortostan]].
*'''[[Konstantin Aksakov|Konstantin Sergeyevich Aksakov]]''' ({{lang-ru|Константин Серге́евич Аксаков}}) (1817–1860) was a [[Russia]]n critic and writer, one of the earliest and most notable Slavophiles. He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order.&lt;ref name="Russell Bova"&gt;Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters By Russell Bova&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Sergey Aksakov]] and sister [[Vera Aksakova]] were writers, and his younger brother [[Ivan Aksakov]] was a journalist.
*'''[[Aleksey Khomyakov|Aleksey Stepanovich Khomyakov]]''' (''Алексей Степанович Хомяков'') (May 1, 1804, [[Moscow]] – September 23/25, 1860) was a [[Russia]]n religious poet who co-founded the Slavophile movement along with [[Ivan Kireevsky]], and became one of its most distinguished theoreticians.
*'''[[Ivan Kireyevsky|Ivan Vasilyevich Kireyevsky]]''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Васи́льевич Кире́евский}}; 3 April 1806, [[Moscow]]&amp;nbsp;— 23 June 1856) was a [[Russians|Russian]] literary critic and philosopher who, together with [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], co-founded the Slavophile movement.
*'''[[Mikhail Pogodin|Mikhail Petrovich Pogodin]]''' ({{lang-ru|Михаил Петрович Погодин}}, 1800, [[Moscow]] - 1875) was a [[Russia]]n historian and journalist who dominated the national historiography between the death of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] in 1826 and the rise of [[Sergey Solovyov]] in the 1850s. He is best remembered as a staunch proponent of the [[Normanist theory]] of Russian statehood. In 1841 Pogodin joined his old friend [[Stepan Shevyrev]] in editing ''Moskovityanin'', a periodical which came to voice the Slavophile opinions. In the course of the following fifteen years of editing, Pogodin and Shevyrev steadily slid towards the most reactionary form of Slavophilism.
*'''[[Yuri Samarin]]''' (Юрий Фёдорович Самарин; 1819-1876) was a leading Russian Slavophile thinker and one of the architects of the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]].
*'''[[Fyodor Tyutchev|Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev]]''' (Russian: Фёдор Ива́нович Тю́тчев; {{OldStyleDate|December 5|1803|November 23}} - {{OldStyleDate|July 27|1873|July 15}}) is generally considered the last of three great Romantic poets of Russia, following [[Alexander Pushkin]] and [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Politically, he was a militant Slavophile, who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]], or [[Poland]], perceived by him as Judas of pan-Slavic interests. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government.
*'''[[Nikolay Yazykov|Nikolay Mikhailovich Yazykov]]''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Миха́йлович Язы́ков}}, March 4, 1803, [[Simbirsk]] - December 26, 1846, [[Moscow]]) was a Russian poet and Slavophile who in the 1820s rivalled [[Alexander Pushkin]] and [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] as the most popular poet of his generation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">'''Nikephoros the Monk''', also called '''Nikephoros the Hesychast''', was a 13th-century monk and spiritual writer of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. According to [[Gregory Palamas]],&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Nikephoros was originally a [[Roman Catholic]] but travelled to the [[Byzantine Empire]], where he converted to the Eastern Orthodox faith and became a monk at [[Mount Athos]]. Like [[Theoleptos of Philadelphia]], Nikephoros was a strong opponent of the union of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches which was agreed to at the [[Second Council of Lyon|Council of Lyons]] in 1274. Because of this, he was imprisoned and later wrote an account of his ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme of Nikephoros’ spiritual writings in the [[Philokalia]] is ‘nepsis’ (Greek: νήψις) which is usually translated as ''watchfulness'' or ''vigilance''.&lt;ref&gt;Nikephoros the Monk, “Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart”, In: Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, {{page needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those inexperienced in prayer and spiritual self-control, the mind tends to wander and lapse into imagination. Nikephoros described a method of breathing while praying to concentrate the mind within the heart in order to practice watchfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Nikephoros the Monk, “Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart”, In: Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13469">A '''Persian name''' consists of a [[given name]], sometimes more than one, and a [[surname]].

==Given names==
{{see also|Category:Persian masculine given names|Category:Persian feminine given names|Category:Iranian masculine given names|Category:Iranian feminine given names}}
Since the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]], some names in Iran have been derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] although the majority are Persian in origin. Persian Christians have Arabic names indistinguishable from their [[Muslim]] neighbors. They can also use Arabic derivations of Christian names (such as saints' names), or [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Assyrian]], or [[Armenian language|Armenian]] names, as most Christian Iranians are [[Armenian Iranians]].

Many Persian names come from the great Persian literature book, ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (The Epic of Kings).  It was composed in the 10th century by [[Ferdowsi]] and is considered by many the masterpiece of Persian literature.
Approximately 10%-15% of all Persian names are from Shahnameh. A few examples are Abtin, Ardeshir, Armeen, Arzhang, Babak (Papak), Bijan, Bizhan, Bozorgmehr, Darab, Dariush (Darius), Esfandiar, Esfandyar, Javid, Faramarz, Farhad, Fariborz, Farshid, Farzad, and Yazdan.

==Surnames==
{{see also|Category:Persian-language surnames|Category:Iranian-language surnames|Surname law}}
Prior to 1919, the people of [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]) did not use surnames. An act of the [[Vosough od-Dowleh]] government in 1919 [[Surname law|introduced the use of surnames]],&lt;ref&gt;احمد کسروی، تاریخ 18 سالۀ آذربایجان&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice expanded during the reign of [[Reza Shah]] (r. 1925–1941). Prior to that, a person was often distinguished from others by a combination of prefixes and suffixes attached to his or her name. If it was omitted, that person might be taken for someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Salmani, Ustad Muhammad-`Aliy-i, the Barber |others=Gail, Marizieh (trans.) |title=My Memories of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Kalimát Press |year=1982 |location=Los Angeles, USA |isbn=0-933770-21-9 |page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of surnames, [[Ahmadi (surname)|Ahmadi]] has become the most popular surname in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forebears.co.uk/iran#surnames Surnames Found in Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases individuals were known by the name of the district, city, town, or even the village from which they came by using the locality's name as a suffix, for example: Nuri, [[Khorasan Province|Khorasani]], [[Māzandarān Province|Mazandarani]], [[Kordestan]]i, [[Tehran]]i, [[Esfahān|Esfahani]], [[Gilani (disambiguation)|Gilani]], [[Hamedan]]i, and [[Shiraz]]i. The same rule is followed for the many millions of Iranians who have surnames of regions or cities of the [[Caucasus]] region. The latter was forcefully ceded in the course of the 19th century to [[Imperial Russia]] through the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] (1813) and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828). Examples of common [[Iran|Iranian]] surnames in this regard are [[Dagestan|Daghestan]]i, [[Karabagh|Gharabaghi]], [[Derbent|Darbandi]], [[Shirvan]]i, [[Yerevan|Iravani]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhjevani]], [[Lankaran|Lankarani]]. 

Among many other secularization and modernization reforms, surnames were required by Reza Shah, following similar contemporary patterns in [[Turkey]] under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], and later in [[Egypt]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tehranian |first=Majid |title=Disenchanted Worlds: Secularization and Democratization in the Middle East |journal=Paper for Presentation at the World Congress of International Political Science Association |date=August 1–5, 2000 |url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~majid/draft_papers/secularization/secularization.html |accessdate=2006-09-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912101324/http://www2.hawaii.edu/~majid/draft_papers/secularization/secularization.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramón Altarriba y Villanueva, 1st Count of Altarriba, 24th Baron of Sangarrén''' (30 August 1841 – 1 April 1906), was an Aragonese-Catalan [[Carlist]] politician and soldier.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Bergara - Real Seminario 1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Bergara, former Seminario Cientifico]]
Ramón Altarriba y Villanueva was born into a distinguished aristocratic [[Aragon]]ese family of Altarriba, from Catalan origin, possibly from the old distinguished Catalan noble family of [[Altarriba]] in [[Catalonia]], which was part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] at the time, holding [[baron]]ia de Sangarrén since the 14th century&lt;ref&gt;Porfirio Sanz Camañes, ''Del Reino a la Corte. Oligarquías y élites de poder en las Cortes de Aragón a mediados del siglo XVII'', [in:] ''Revista de Historia Moderna.

Upon the outbreak of [[Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60)|Primera Guerra de Marruecos]] in 1859 the young Altarriba volunteered to the army; accepted, he was assigned to the Aragon infantry unit of [[Regimento de Zamora]] and landed in [[Ceuta]] in December 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Estevanez, ''Mis memorias'', Madrid 1975, {{ISBN|8472730883}}, pp. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Details of his service are unclear, though he certainly entered many combat actions against the Moroccan troops. Serving under the command of [[Antonio Ros de Olano]]&lt;ref&gt;Estevanez 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; in January 1860 he might have taken part in the [[battle of Castillejos]]; bypassing Monte Negrón in a dare Spanish maneuver,&lt;ref&gt;Estevanez 1975, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; he then participated in the [[battle of Cabo Negro]].&lt;ref&gt;Estevanez 1975, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; For meritorious service Altarriba was awarded [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz de San Fernando]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ramón Altarriba y Villanueva'' entry [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/19966 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and got promoted to [[teniente]].&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, pp. 171–2; ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' claims he was promoted to capitán&lt;/ref&gt; Late 1860 the unit returned to the Zaragoza barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Estevanez 1975, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently enjoying adventurous life and vivacious company, he demonstrated some gift for rhyming couplets;&lt;ref&gt;compare "Y cuaitdo al castillo vuelven / mis caballos arrogantes, / les doy a comer diamantes / en morrales de tisú", or "Queridisimo rechoncho, / debes pedir una plancha / para quitar esa mancha / que te ha caído en el poncho", quoted after Estevanez 1975, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; at that time he befriended [[:es:Nicolás Estévanez Murphy|Nicolas Estevanez Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Estevanez 1975, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few years Altarriba continued his military career, though no details are known.

Following the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Revolution of 1868]] Altarriba requested and was granted release from military service,&lt;ref&gt;his service in the Isabelline army was later called against him by some Carlists, see Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; though he returned to the army in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Once the [[First Spanish Republic|Republic]] was declared he approached the conspiring Carlists&lt;ref&gt;''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''; in 1871 his brother was a Carlist candidate to the Cortes from Sariñena, Brioso 2000, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and at the outbreak of the [[Third Carlist War]] he was already incorporated in their army.&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 172, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the Northern front and took command of an insurgent volunteer [[Biscay]] battalion, which conquered and cleared the [[Durango (Spain)|Durango]] district in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[Colonel|coronel]], he then commanded primera brigada de Vizcaya and joined the siege of [[Bilbao]] in early 1874; he led the unit routing the Republican forces during the [[:es:Valle de Somorrostro|battle of Somorrostro]]&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; and advancing later to [[Portugalete]],&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; where Altarriba was given the privilege of accepting surrender of the famous [[battalón de Segorbe]].&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Participated in a number of skirmishes at the outskirts of Bilbao, assaulting the forts of Delmas and Volantín.&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Nominated Comandante General del Alto Aragón, Altarriba was the organizer, sponsor and commander of [[Battalón de Almogávares de la Virgen del Pilar]],&lt;ref&gt;Ampelio Alonso de Cadenas y Lopez (ed.), ''Suplemento al Elenco de grandezas y títulos nobiliarios españoles: Títulos vacantes y títulos extranjeros cuyo uso fue autorizado en España.

Unlike many other aristocratic titles awarded by Carlist claimants, often recognised by Franco in the 1950s and functional until today, condado de Altarriba has never been confirmed. It is not clear whether any of Altarriba’s descendants claims the title currently&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early ''Restauración''==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
A widower with no close family, it is not clear where Altarriba settled after the war; in 1877 he was linked to the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] town of [[Avià|Aviá]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.04.77, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000020835&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 he was already married&lt;ref&gt;at that time he was already reported by the press as marqués de Villalegre, see ''La Unión'' 12.09.78, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003886463&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed administration of his wife’s property in Gipuzkoa. The estates slightly exceeding 1,000 ha&lt;ref&gt;the estate did not make an impressive figure by national Spanish standards; as late as in 1919 duque de Peñaranda possessed 51,000 ha, Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''Aristocracia y poder económico en la España del siglo XX'', [in:] ''Vegueta'' 7 (2003), p. 157; in the sole Cordoba district there were around 30 landholders with estates exceeding 1,000 ha, see [http://www.magrama.gob.es/ministerio/pags/Biblioteca/fondo/pdf/14761_2_4.pdf here], p. 80-81 [surface area is listed in fanegas (fgs), a fanega differed from province to province, though one scholar suggests an average of 1 fg = 1,044 ha for the nearby Almeria province, see [http://www.dipalme.org/Servicios/Anexos/anexosiea.nsf/VAnexos/IEA-BN1_c4/$File/BN1-c4.pdf here], p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt; rendered the couple the 4th largest [[Landowners|terratenientes]] in the province&lt;ref&gt;most of the holdings, some 400 ha, was in the district of Azpeitia, see Moreno, Parrondo 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the richest people in Gipuzkoa.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Real Cuesta, ''El Carlismo Vasco 1876-1900'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|978-84-323-0510-8}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His wife held land also in [[Álava]] and Andalusia;&lt;ref&gt;Brioso 2000, p. 74, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; for some time Altarriba managed the [[Pinos Puente]] estate in [[Granada (province)|Granada]], which she possessed jointly with her two unmarried sisters, though with rather mediocre result.&lt;ref&gt;Caballero, Góngora 2007, pp. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 José María Altarriba, unmarried and with no issue,&lt;ref&gt;see ''José María de Altarriba y Villanueva'' entry at ''geneallnet'' service, available [http://geneall.net/es/name/515804/jose-maria-de-altarriba-y-villanueva/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; renounced baronia&lt;ref&gt;but not condado de Robres&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of his younger brother, making Ramón the 24th barón de Sangarrén.&lt;ref&gt;see ''La Unión'' 12.09.78, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003886463&amp;page=3 here], ''La Epoca'' 19.11.78, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000378574&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altarriba seemed pessimistic as to the future of Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;he deemed it necessary that "se modifique la tactica de hacerle hacer el muerto [al partido], porque el simil y la realidad solo se separan ya en esto por un atomo impalable", quoted after Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; considered orphaned, with no political direction&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and managed by ineffective Junta Militar.&lt;ref&gt;Altarriba was not nominated its member, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 he wrote to Carlos VII urging him to appoint a strong political leader.&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As in early 1879 the military rule was terminated and civic rights restored in Gipuzkoa,&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Altarriba – already admitted to a meeting of leading Carlists – spoke in favor of taking part in the [[Spanish general election, 1879|elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The claimant allowed only individual unofficial contenders and authorized Sangarrén.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 59, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 15, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding his candidature in the [[Azpeitia]] district,&lt;ref&gt;most of Altarriba’s estates were in Azpeitia district&lt;/ref&gt; Altarriba was considered one of the 4 "transigentes" running;&lt;ref&gt;some Carlists, firmly opposed to new laws scrapping most of the fuerista establishments and called "intransigentes", ran on the Union Vasconavarra platform, though with no success&lt;/ref&gt; he emerged as the only one victorious.&lt;ref&gt;the defeated ones were Olano Altuna, Pedro de Egańa (Gipuzkoa) and Domingo Martinez de Aragón (Alava), Real Cuesta 1985, p. 42.

The 1880s are marked by growing rivalry within Carlism, divided between the immovilistas and the aperturistas. The former, led by [[:es:Candido Nocedal|Candido Nocedal]], opted for intransigence. The latter, Altarriba included, dismissed either war&lt;ref&gt;despite crushing defeat in 1876, in the 1880s the Carlists still maintained some military potential; it was estimated that within 3 days they were able to mobilise 4,000–6,000 people, and skeleton battalion structures were still maintained with commanders, officers and NCOs appointed, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; or total abstention, preferring conditional alignment with the new political system. The dispute grew into a full-scale conflict, waged also by means of guerra periodistica;&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 24, see ''El Cabecilla'' 09.03.84, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003844914&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; to fight the Nocedalista titles,&lt;ref&gt;principally ''El Siglo Futuro'', Real Cuesta 1985, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Sangarrén founded a Madrid satirical weekly, ''[[El Cabecilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;issued in 1882-1890 and directed by Gonzalez Granada, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish general election, 1884|1884 election]] campaign Altarriba sought Carlos VII’s exemption from "despotism" of Nocedal, who ordered abstention, but this time the claimant did not agree&lt;ref&gt;''Revista Contemporanea'' 3–4 1884, p. 360, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002409566&amp;page=360 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sangarrén loyally&lt;ref&gt;in 1886 Altarriba confessed that he accepted the tyranny of Candido Nocedal only because the latter was appointed by the king, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; withdrew from the race 3 weeks prior to election date.&lt;ref&gt;as usual he intended to run in Azpeitia, see ''El Liberal'' 09.03.84, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001117859&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, already a recognized Carlist leader,&lt;ref&gt;in 1886 he took part in unveiling of the Cegama monument to Zumalacarregui, financed mostly by public subscription, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained the permission&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Spanish general election, 1886|re-elected]] from Azpeitia.&lt;ref&gt;see official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=2-2&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%284410%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; Focused on by the press as a single Carlist in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]],&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; when sworn Altarriba declared in the house that he considered Carlos VII the king of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, pp. 174-177; though fiercely anti-democratic, Altarriba was member of a parliamentary anti-slavery group, see ''La Ilustriación Católica'' 25.04.89, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003175111&amp;page=11 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-Integrist Biscay periodical ''El Vasco'' jumped on this phrase, denouncing Altarriba as anti-Catholic and anti-Traditionalist. The Vascongadas Carlist leader, marqués de Valde-Espina, ordered ''El Vasco'' to backtrack, but the Biscay provinvial jefe, José de Accilona, took an independent stand, which resulted in provincial schism taking place in 1887, followed by the Gipuzkoan one in 1888, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 93–97&lt;/ref&gt; at the decisive moment he stayed loyal to his king.

Following secession of the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integristas]] Altarriba, the only party MP and one of its few aristocrats, found himself in top strata of Carlism and became one if its most distinguished politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; His relations with other party leaders were uneasy, even after departure of the allegedly hated Nocedal. The undisputed [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] leader in Vascongadas&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Juan Nepomuceno de Orbe y Mariaca|marqués de Valde-Espina]],&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; the claimant’s personal secretary [[conde de Melgar]]&lt;ref&gt;fractious Carlists, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and the aspiring political leader, [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marqués de Cerralbo]]&lt;ref&gt;see Altarriba mocking Cerralbo, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; found it difficult to work with Sangarrén and did not spare him harsh words; in the intrigue-ridden world of Carlism of the late 19th century he was accused of envy towards legitimate party leaders&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and turning Gipuzkoa into his personal fiefdom.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; When in late 1888 he was appointed vice-president of the newly established Junta Directiva del Circulo Tradicionalista de Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; he refused the post claiming – probably sarcastically – that he did not merit such an honor.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 118, 180, also ''El Siglo Futuro'' 19.12.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000129043&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marqués de Cerralbo, en Nuevo Mundo.jpg|thumbnail|160px|marqués de Cerralbo]]
In 1889 Carlos VII started to build formal nationwide party structures, initially disguised as an organization to stage celebrations of [[:es:Conversión de Recaredo|Conversión de Recaredo]] centenary; within its Junta Central, soon turned into a permanent collegial executive,&lt;ref&gt;Vascongadas were represented by Valde-Espina, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 146, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sangarrén was nominated to represent [[Castilla la Vieja]].&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El XVII Marqués de Cerralbo (1845–1922). Iglesia y carlismo, distintas formas de ver el XIII Centenario de la Unidad Católica'', [in:] ''Studium: Revista de humanidades'' 18 (2012) [referred to further on as "Fernández Escudero 2012 (2)"], p. 131, Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 145–46&lt;/ref&gt; Like 10 years earlier, he called for a new jefe which would impose the party discipline, though it is not clear whether he himself hoped for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of that year liberal press speculated about a directorate leading the movement and mentioned him one of its 4 members.&lt;ref&gt;along de Cerralbo, Cavero and Menendez de Luarca, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Altarriba’s position was confirmed when he was invited to [[Schloss Frohsdorf|Frohsdorf]] for the wedding of [[Infanta Blanca of Spain|Carlos VII’s daughter]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Though in early 1890 ''El Cabecilla'' mocked marqués de Cerralbo,&lt;ref&gt;causing irritation of Carlos VII, annoyed with what he considered „dirty tricks" of ''El Cabecilla'', Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; when later that year the latter was finally appointed the new Jefe Delegado Sangarrén rushed with congratulations, directed to "mi querido amigo".&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Spanish general election, 1891|1891 elections]] for the first time during Restoration the Carlists decided to take part officially and set up a co-ordinating committee. Details of its work are not known; the outcome was that in Azpeitia, which turned into a prestigious battlefield against the rebellious [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]], Sangarrén had to give way to the aspiring Gipuzkoan leader, [[Tirso Olazábal Lardizábal|Tírso de Olazábal]]. Himself he ran in two districts, [[Aranda de Duero]] ([[Burgos province|Burgos]]) and [[Santo Domingo de la Calzada]] ([[Logroño (province)|Logroño]]),&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 237–38&lt;/ref&gt; losing in both.&lt;ref&gt;For Logroño see ''La Unión Católica'' 02.02.91, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004885740&amp;page=2 here], for Aranda see ''El Imparcial'' 03.02.91, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000680556&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this defeat, he did not renew his electoral bid in any of the successive electoral campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Altarriba is not listed among candidates running after 1891 either by historical studies or by contemporary press, though no source consulted explicitly states that Sangarrén did not run after that date&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-''Restauración''==
[[File:Palacio Sangarren Usurbil.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sangarrén residence, Gipuzkoa]]
Having lost the parliamentary ticket Sangarrén could dedicate more time to his private business, geographically scattered from Vascongadas across [[Castile (historical region)|Castille]] and on to Andalusia. Apart from managing family estates in Gipuzkoa, he invested in mining and metalworking industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas y negocios. Carlistas en Moralzarzal'', [in:] ''Historias de Moral (y Zarzal)'' 01.05.12, available [http://historiasdemoralzarzal.blogspot.com/2012/05/ideales-y-negocios-carlistas-en.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He co-owned exploration rights to a copper mine in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] location of [[Colmenarejo]], North of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;the pit was named "Pilar" after his wife, ''Ideas y negocios'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he took control over the "La Fe" mineral springs in the nearby [[Moralzarzal]],&lt;ref&gt;the previous owner was also a Carlist, Ramón Manrique de Lara, ''Ideas y negocios'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; renaming the site "[[:es:Mudarra|Mudarra]]" and exploiting it until 1900, when he renounced the concession.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas y negocios'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He held stakes in paper mill business in Pyrenaic parts of the [[Lérida Province|Lérida province]]&lt;ref&gt;''Madrid cientifico'' 418 (1903), p. 14, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001757766&amp;page=14&amp;search=sangarren&amp;lang=es%20http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001757766&amp;page=14 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was vice-president of Derecha del Rio Genil, a Granada-based company engaged in irrigation works.&lt;ref&gt;''La Ilustracion Española y Americana'' 22.10.79, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001102670&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Carlist [[Fuero|fuerista]] principles envisaged that a politician should only represent the region where he lives,&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 242-3&lt;/ref&gt; within the party command structures Altarriba formally headed Castilla la Vieja.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Though due to his terrateniente status he exercised largest influence in Gipuzkoa,&lt;ref&gt;Altarriba's prestigious standing in the province was reflected in his role in a number of initiatives, like opening of the Zumarraga-Zumaya railway line, known as "ferrocaril del Urola", see [http://www.spanishrailway.com/2012/05/06/ferrocarril-del-urola-zumarraga-a-zumaya/ spanishrailway.com site]&lt;/ref&gt; Vascongadas was first headed by Valde-Espina, then by Salvador Elío y Ezpeleta&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 285–86&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal|Tirso de Olazábal]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Altarriba’s contribution to Gipuzkoan Carlism, however, remained crucial; local landowners were key to mobilising rural support&lt;ref&gt;for a sample how Sangarrén instructed "his" renters to vote see Real Cuesta 1985, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining – if not straightforwardly financing – provincial party structures.&lt;ref&gt;though according to the fuerista outlook electoral work was to be entrusted to locals, in fact there were many exceptions, with some juntas were simply appointing nominees for different roles, triggering complaints; also Sangerrén used to complain to Valde-Espina, though in general Gipuzkoa adhered to the fuersita principles much closer than the neighboring Biscay, see Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 242–43&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a result of his contribution, in the 1880s and 1890s Gipuzkoa emerged as a Carlist stronghold; in provincial&lt;ref&gt;the number of Traditionalist (mainstream Carlism and Integrism combined) v. Liberal members elected to Diputación Provincial was: 1882 8:8; 1884 10:6; 1886 11:5; 1888 9:11; 1890 9:11; 1892 11:9; 1894 11:9; 1898 9:11, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; and general&lt;ref&gt;the number of Traditionalist (mainstream Carlism and Integrism combined) v. Liberal members elected to the Cortes from Gipzukoa was: 1891 2:3; 1895 3:2; 1896 3:2; 1899 3:2, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; elections the party was striving for domination.
[[File:Don carlos de borbón nypl.jpg|thumbnail|160px|Carlos VII]]
In the early 1890s fellow Traditionalists approached Altarriba cautiously as one of "fractious Carlists".&lt;ref&gt;"Carlistas discolos", Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources report him as championing a militant "de armas tomar" group, consisting mostly of the Navarros and the Gipuzkoanos.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Other episodes seem to counter this thesis indicating that he worked closely with the non-belligerent de Cerralbo,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 192, 199&lt;/ref&gt; together travelling across Spain during innovative political tours and delivering harangues,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 223, Jordi Canal i Morell, ''Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia política del carlismo'', 1876–1939, Madrid 2006, {{ISBN|8496467341}}, 978849646734 , pp. 151-156&lt;/ref&gt; also jointly with Carlist pundits like [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|Vazquez de Mella]];&lt;ref&gt;like it was the case in 1893, see Cristobal Robles Muñoz, ''La Santa Sede y la oposición carlista a la restauración durante los episcopados de José Oliver y Antonio Ruiz-Cabal (1875-1899)'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; residing in Madrid he customarily appeared in events staged in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. during the first Fiesta de los Mártires de la Tradición, see Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 293 or during other events, see Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Spanish–American War|colonial crisis of 1897]] unfolded, he initially seemed leaning towards a bold action; he welcomed general [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí|Weyler]], dismissed from [[Cuba]], amongst the crowd shouting "Viva Cuba Española", but also a somewhat more ambiguous "a caballo mi general".&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Spanish–American War]] Sangarrén was busy denouncing widely circulating rumors about another Carlist insurgency forthcoming as "a fable",&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 387. The government was alarmed by Guardia Civil discovering large Carlist depots of rifles and by increased traffic of Carlist envoys to Carlos VII’s residence in Venice, reported by the Spanish diplomatic service, see Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear whether it was a pre-agreed propaganda smoke-screen or a genuine effort. During [[La Octubrada (Carlist uprising of 1900)|La Octubrada]], the series of minor Carlist revolts of October 1900,&lt;ref&gt;on 28-30 of October 1900 a series of minor and very minor Carlist attempts to seize power locally was recorded in Badalona, Casteldefells, Santa Coloma de Gramanet, Igualada, Sardañola, Alcoy, Berga, Calella, Mantesa and Moncada, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; he was in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;present day scholar interprets the presence of Carlist leaders in Paris as a demonstration, aimed at the Madrid government and intending to prove that they were not involved in any conspiration, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; which did not spare him detention by [[Guardia Civil]] the following month in Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas y negocios 2012'', also ''El Dia'' 09.11.00, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002427342&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Also during persistent rumors of mid-1902&lt;ref&gt;contemporary scholar suggests they were caused by speculators willing to affect the Madrid stock-exchange quotations, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Altarriba spoke publicly against a Carlist military action.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 411; though some newspapers were hysterical about another Carlist war behind the corner, the other titles considered Carlism already "a cadaver", see ''La Epoca'' 20.06.02, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000680946&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The press reported him as an agreed Carlist candidate in the [[Spanish general election, 1903|1903 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia militar'' 30.01.03, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001884261&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not mentioned as running later on. None of the sources consulted mentions him politically active after that date; obituaries claimed he had been suffering from an unidentified longtime "enfermedad crónica";&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 01.04.06, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1906/04/01/010.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; his funeral was attended by the then Carlist political leader, [[Matías Barrio y Mier]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Globo'' 03.04.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001277034&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix''' (24 April 1776 – 5 February 1845) was a [[France|French]] [[Scientific equipment optician|optician]] and [[Scientific instrument|instrument maker]], whose [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] played a part in the race of the [[great refractor]] telescopes in the first half of the 19th century.

==Instruments==
At first Cauchoix produced a wide range of scientific instruments including [[barometer]]s and [[micrometer]]s, but he soon specialized in optics, making [[spherometer]]s and [[Objective (optics)|objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rauantiques.com/library/Artists%20and%20Makers/robert-aglae-cauchoix-CAUCHOIX.html | title=Robert-Aglae Cauchoix | publisher=[http://www.rauantiques.com/ M. S. Rau Antiques] | accessdate=27 February 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145148/http://www.rauantiques.com/library/Artists%20and%20Makers/robert-aglae-cauchoix-CAUCHOIX.html | archivedate=22 February 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a [[telescope]] for the [[Paris Observatory]] in 1820 and in 1825 he made a 6.5 inch (16.5&amp;nbsp;cm) [[refractor]] for the observatory of the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Collegio Romano]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] academy in [[Rome]]. In the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html| title=Sheepshanks telescope | publisher=[[Royal Museums Greenwich]] | location=UK | accessdate=27 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great refractors==
Although the [[reflector telescope]] was invented in the second half of the 18th century, technological difficulties made the refractor the telescope of choice until the mid-1850s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Improvements in lens production, like the introduction of the [[achromatic lens]] by [[John Dollond]], spawned an [[aperture]] size race that started in the early 1820s with a telescope made by the [[Germany|German]] optician [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]. Cauchoix must be credited holding the lens size record three times this period. In 1831, Cauchoix made a 13.3 inch (almost 33.8&amp;nbsp;cm) refractor for the [[Ireland|Irishman]] [[Edward Joshua Cooper]], who used it to observe [[Halley's Comet]] in 1835 and a [[solar eclipse]] in 1836.&lt;ref name="Abrahams"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.europa.com/~telscope/tsfrance.txt | title=Cauchoix biography | first=Peter | last=Abrahams | publisher=[[Antique Telescope Society]] | accessdate=27 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, Cauchoix made an 11.75 inch lens for a French customer, but sold it to the British [[astronomer]] [[James South]].&lt;ref name="Abrahams" /&gt; South used it for his new telescope, which he found defective due to problems with the [[Telescope mount|equatorial mount]]. In 1838, this telescope was dismantled, but the lens by Cauchoix served in other instruments until 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17587">'''Rupert William Simon Allason''' (born 8 November 1951) is a former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician in the [[United Kingdom]] and professional author. He was the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Torbay (UK Parliament constituency)|Torbay]] in [[Devon]], from [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. He writes books and articles on the subject of [[espionage]] under the pen name '''Nigel West'''.

==Background==
Born in [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1543981/ Rupert Allason] IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Allason and his brother, Julian, were brought up as [[Roman Catholic]]s, the faith of their [[Irish people|Irish]] mother, Nuala McElveen (who acted under the name Nuala Barrie), and attended [[Downside School]]. Their father, [[James Allason]], was also a Conservative Party MP.

==Political career==
Rupert Allason contested [[Kettering (UK Parliament constituency)|Kettering]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Battersea (UK Parliament constituency)|Battersea]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] before being elected as Conservative MP for Torbay in 1987.

He was opposed to ceding greater power to [[European Union|Brussels]], in 1993 he was the only [[Tory]] who refused to vote for the [[Maastricht Treaty]] when it was made into a [[1993 vote of confidence in the government of John Major|motion of confidence]]. The vote was narrowly won but Allason's abstention caused him to have the [[party whip]] withdrawn for a year.&lt;ref name="bbc-no-stranger"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rupert Allason: No stranger to the courtroom |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1604713.stm |publisher = BBC News |date = 17 October 2001 |accessdate = 20 August 2006 | quote= As John Major's prime ministership lurched from crisis to crisis, every MP's vote counting as the tiny Conservative parliamentary majority dwindled away after 1992, Mr Allason rebelled over Maastricht and then became the only Tory to refuse to back his government in a no confidence motion.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He left parliament after the landslide [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], when he lost his seat to [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Adrian Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title      = General election results in Torbay, 1997 and 2001 |url        = http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/constit/242.htm |publisher  = Richard Kimber |work       = Political Science Resources |accessdate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is widely considered to have lost because he failed to tip a pub waitress a week before polling day. As a consequence, fourteen waiters who were going to vote for Allason switched to the Liberal Democrats. He lost by twelve votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = A guide to life in a marginal constituency |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25664580 |publisher  = BBC News |date = 9 January 2015 |accessdate = 9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Allason was reported to have considered joining the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title      = Tory Euro-sceptic considers defection |url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/596381.stm |publisher  = BBC News |date       = 9 January 2000 |accessdate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Jon Ronson]] in the first chapter of his book ''[[Them: Adventures With Extremists]]'' briefly analyses Allason's career and character, with particular emphasis on his 1997 electoral loss.

==Literary career==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
As an author, Allason has concentrated on security and intelligence issues and his controversial books have frequently made headlines. He was voted 'The Experts' Expert' by a panel of other spy writers in ''[[The Observer]]'' in November 1989. In 1984 ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' commented: "His information is so precise that many people believe he is the unofficial historian of the secret services. West's sources are undoubtedly excellent. His books are peppered with deliberate clues to potential front-page stories."

Allason has been a frequent speaker at intelligence seminars and has lectured at both the [[KGB]] headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square, [[Moscow]] and at the [[CIA]] headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], Virginia, where he once addressed an audience that included the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy [[Aldrich Ames]]. He continues to lecture to members of the intelligence community at the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies in [[Washington, D.C.]]

His special contribution to the study of modern historical espionage has been in tracking down former agents and persuading them to tell their stories. He traced the wartime double agent [[Joan Pujol Garcia|GARBO]], who was reported to have died in [[Africa]] in 1949. However, Allason found him in [[Venezuela]], and they collaborated on the book ''Operation Garbo'', published in 1985. 

He was also the first person to identify and interview the mistress of [[Admiral Canaris]], the German intelligence chief who headed the [[Abwehr]], and he was responsible for the exposure of Leo Long and Edward Scott as Soviet spies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

His titles include ''The Crown Jewels'', based on files made available to him by the [[KGB]] archives in Moscow; ''VENONA'', which disclosed the existence of a [[GRU]] spy-ring operating in London throughout the war, allegedly headed by [[J. B. S. Haldane|Professor JBS Haldane]] and [[Ivor Montagu|the Hon. Ivor Montagu]]; and ''The Third Secret'', an account of the CIA's intervention in [[Afghanistan]]. ''Mortal Crimes'', published in September 2004, investigates the scale of Soviet espionage in the [[Manhattan Project]], the Anglo-American development of an [[atomic bomb]].

In 2005 he edited ''The Guy Liddell Diaries'', a daily journal of the wartime work of [[MI5]]'s Director of Counter-Espionage. He also published a study of the [[Comintern]]'s secret wireless traffic, ''MASK: MI5's Penetration of the Communist Party of Great Britain'', and the first of a series of counter-intelligence textbooks, ''The Historical Dictionary of British Intelligence'', ''The Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence'' and ''The Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counter-Intelligence''.

==Legal actions==
Allason has been involved in a number of legal cases, in each of which he represented himself [[pro se|without lawyers]]. While in the House of Commons, he campaigned against the use of [[Public Interest Immunity|Public Interest Immunity Certificates]], and exposed the arms-dealing activities of the billionaire publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. He was sued for libel by Maxwell but won the case, winning record damages for a litigant in person by counterclaim.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1996 Allason sued [[Alastair Campbell]] for malicious falsehood with regard to an article printed in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in November 1992. The case was heard by Mr Justice Drake, without a jury. The judge ruled that Allason had failed to demonstrate that the ''Daily Mirror'' article, although inaccurate, had caused him any financial loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campbell denies control freak claim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/138291.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=23 July 1998|accessdate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-1998-23-07"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rupert Allason wins case against Alastair Campbell, PM's aide|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/142548.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=30 July 1998|accessdate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrial in 1998, he was awarded £1,050 in damages and 75% of his legal costs.&lt;ref  name="BBC-1998-23-07"/&gt;

In 1998, he brought and lost a libel action against the [[BBC]] show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' over comments made in a book based on the show published in 1996 that "given Mr Allason's fondness for pursuing libel actions, there are also excellent legal reasons for not referring to him as a conniving little shit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Tory MP loses libel action|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/49430.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=21 January 1998|accessdate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Allason sued [[Random House]], the publishers of ''The Enigma Spy'', the autobiography of the former Soviet agent [[John Cairncross]]. Allason claimed he had [[ghost writer|ghostwritten]] ''The Enigma Spy'' in return for the copyright and 50 per cent of the proceeds. However, Allason lost the case and was ordered to pay costs of around £200,000. In passing judgment the trial judge said that Allason was "a profoundly dishonest man" and "one of the most dishonest witnesses I have ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Tory MP 'profoundly dishonest'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1602821.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=16 October 2001|accessdate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spy writer branded a liar by judge faces prosecution|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359641/Spy-writer-branded-a-liar-by-judge-faces-prosecution.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Telegraph|date=16 October 2001|accessdate=11 October 2007| first=Sean|last=O'Neill|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Lying' former Tory MP faces criminal charge|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,575414,00.html|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=17 October 2001|accessdate=11 October 2007|first=Richard|last=Norton-Taylor|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Allason is the recipient of the U.S. Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO)'s Lifetime Literature Achievement Award, and in 2011 he was elected to the Honorary Board of that association. He is the European Editor of the ''World Intelligence Review'', published in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contact Us|publisher=World Intelligence Review|url=http://www.theworldintelligencereview.com/contact.html|accessdate=11 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120220243/http://www.theworldintelligencereview.com/contact.html|archivedate=20 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1979 Allason married Nikki van Moppes. They divorced in 1996 shortly after Allason was exposed by UK tabloid papers for having an extramarital tryst at [[Sandy Lane Hotel]] in [[Barbados]]. The couple have two children, the elder of whom is entrepreneur [[Tom Allason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-399571/Wealth-women-mobile-phone-king.html | work=Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers | title=Wealth, women and the mobile phone king | date=8 August 2006 | first=Simon | last=Moon | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20011017/ai_n14422341 | title=Rebel without a case "profoundly dishonest" | work = The Independent }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/49430.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ex-Tory MP loses libel action | date=21 January 1998 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Rupert Allason became engaged to violinist [[Nicola Loud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9427610/Spy-author-Rupert-Allason-seduces-Loud-musician.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Spy author Rupert Allason seduces Loud musician | date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24079">'''Sherburne Gillette Hopkins''' (October 5, 1867&amp;nbsp;– June 22, 1932) was an American lawyer and influential lobbyist in Washington DC. His clients included oil tycoon Henry Clay Pierce, financier and "father of trusts" [[Charles Ranlett Flint]], Guatemalan President [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]], and Mexican President [[Francisco I. Madero]] among others. He specialized in connecting American finance with Latin American revolutionaries. "According to ''Who's Was Who in America'', Hopkins specialized 'in internat. matters and settlements with the Govt. Adviser to several Latin Am. govts.; adviser to provision govt. of Mexico (Madero), 1911; constitutionalist govt. of Mexico, 1913–14; to provision govt. of Mexico (de la Huert[a]), 1920."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Peter Calvert, ''The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1914: The Diplomacy of Anglo-American Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1968, p. 75, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most revealing source for Hopkins's activities is his testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.

== Family background and upbringing ==
Born on October 5, 1867 in Washington D.C., he and his baby sister Jessie (born in 1876) could trace their roots to England. Hopkins' father, Thomas Snell Hopkins, had moved to Washington in the 1860s from Maine where the family homestead remains. Sherburne's ancestor Stephen Hopkins (1583–1644) came to Plymouth, Massachusetts on the ''[[Mayflower]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Azel Ames, ''The May-Flower and Her Log, July 15, 1620 – May 6, 1621, Chiefly from Original Sources''; Houghton, Mifflin, Boston and New York, 1907, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Sherburne, his great grandfather, fought for American independence as a lieutenant in the [[New Hampshire Militia]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Cornish, editor, ''National Register of the Society of Sons of the American Revolution'', New York, NY, 1902, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherburne Hopkins' mother was Caroline Eastman whose family came from England to Massachusetts on the ''Confidence'' in 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Virkus, editor, ''Immigrant Ancestors: A List of 2,500 Immigrants to America before 1750'', Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, MD, 1964, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides of Hopkins' family tree count among the oldest families in U.S. history.

Hopkins attended school in Washington, D.C. and then the [[United States Naval Academy]] in Annapolis.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, RG 165 Military Intelligence Division, Correspondence 1917 to 1941, Box 1266, File 2338-997.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a degree in international law from [[Columbia University]] in 1890 and joined his father's practice. While establishing himself as a lawyer in his father's practice, Hopkins married Hester Davis in 1891, with whom he had two children, Sherburne Philbrick on December 3, 1891, and Marjorie on August 5, 1894. Their son, Sherburne Philbrick, later also a lawyer in the family firm, briefly became a social star when he married Margaret Upton, better known as [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], a famous stage actress. The law firm now called Hopkins and Hopkins became one of the top lobbying firms for Wall Street in Washington.

== Early legal career ==
One of their largest clients was the "King of Trusts," [[Charles Ranlett Flint]]. In 1892, Flint, also from an old Massachusetts family, had merged several rubber companies to form the monopolistic conglomerate [[United States Rubber Company]]. His principal lawyer for this merger was Thomas Snell Hopkins. In another famous merger, Flint organized the main bubblegum manufacturers into [[American Chicle Company]] in 1899. In 1911, Flint founded the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]], which later became [[IBM]]. His rubber business necessitated large investments in Latin America, Africa, and India. Flint especially had large real estate interests in southern Mexico. He joined with Henry Clay Pierce to become one of the largest investors in Mexican railways and international shipping companies such as the Pierce Forwarding Company of New Orleans. Pierce had purchased a majority share in the [[National Railroad of Mexico]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 4, 1903 "Railway Earning Prospects."&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, one of Flint's competitors in the rubber industry was Evaristo Madero, the grandfather of future Mexican president [[Francisco I. Madero]]. The Maderos had dealings with Flint in the very beginning of the Mexican Revolution, which rightfully prompted historians to suspect Flint's financing of the upheaval. Flint also held large interests in Pierce's endeavors helping the oil magnate stay clear of hated rival [[John D. Rockefeller]] who owned the [[Standard Oil Company]]. "To the question whether Capt. Sherburne G. Hopkins of Washington had represented him [Pierce] in negotiations with Carranza he declined to answer, though he said that the law firm of Hopkins and Hopkins had looked after his interests in Washington for the last twenty-five years. His acquaintance with Capt. Hopkins is slight, but his father, Thomas S. Hopkins, has long been his attorney in Washington."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', June 28, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hopkins and his son Sherburne provided the legal work for Pierce and Flint. On January 3, 1900, the St. Louis Republic reported that Hopkins and Hopkins negotiated with the U.S. State Department on behalf of Flint. The British had confiscated several loads of flour off the coast of what is today Mozambique. The illegally seized freight had belonged to Flint's shipping concern. In the effort to force the British to release the cargo Hopkins had strong support from the State Department as well as from the German Foreign Office. In addition to Flint's flour, British warships had impounded a German mail steamer bound for home.&lt;ref&gt;''The St. Louis Republic'', January 3, 1900, "State Department Addresses Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; The flour cargo spoiled, but Britain had to reimburse Flint for the damages.

== Military service ==
In 1898, Sherburne Hopkins joined the active navy in the [[Spanish–American War]]. It is unlikely that Hopkins saw much action. As the commander of the District of Columbia Naval Militia, Hopkins seemed to have stayed put while Admiral [[George Dewey]] defeated the Spanish on the other side of the world. Hopkins' name is mentioned in a newspaper article in October 1898, when he took command of the USS ''Fern'', a twenty-five-year-old tugboat. However, rather than being dispatched to the war zone, Hopkins' task was to "bring the ''Fern'' to Washington."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Washington, October 10, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; His rank is given as lieutenant. According to his own testimony to the U.S. Senate in 1912, Hopkins' responsibility "was …in the purchase of some materials of war for our own Government…"&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;United States Senate, Investigation of Mexican Affairs, Subcommittee of the Committee of Foreign Relations, Government Printing Office, 1920, Testimony of Sherburne G. Hopkins, p. 2565.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years of his service in the naval reserves, Hopkins in fact had risen to the rank of lieutenant commander. When in the fall of 1899 Admiral Dewey returned to the United States a hero, Hopkins found mention in the official program of Dewey's Washington, D.C. rally as "Naval Battalion, Lieut. Commander Sherburne G. Hopkins, Commanding."&lt;ref&gt;Official program, Admiral Dewey Reception, October 2 and 3, Washington, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname among military peers was Sherby. Raised to the rank of Commander, Sherby remained in charge of the Washington, D.C. Naval Militia through 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Militia Yearbooks 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his responsibilities as commander both professionally and socially Hopkins came to know the senior military establishment of Washington intricately.

== Lobbying work in Central America ==
The law firm showed its unparalleled manipulative might when it single-handedly shaped Central American history in the following years. After a skirmish between Honduras and Guatemala in 1906, the two countries and El Salvador had concluded the so-called friendship pact that isolated Nicaragua. In the spring of 1907 Nicaragua invaded Honduras in an attempt to unseat President [[Manuel Bonilla]], a puppet of [[United Fruit Company]]. With the help of U.S. marines the Honduran leader survived. Virtually a protectorate of the United States with marines occupying [[Bluefields]] on the Atlantic side of the country, Nicaragua invaded Honduras in 1908 to install a new, less hostile government there. Despite the official support for intervention of the U.S. government, Hopkins and his international clients worked behind the scenes to contain the Nicaraguan Dictator [[José Santos Zelaya]]. The weapon of choice was to provide money for neighboring countries such as Honduras and Guatemala while denying finance to Zelaya. After years of effort, Nicaragua had finally concluded a loan for 1.25 million pounds Sterling (over $100 Million in today's value) from the Ethelburg Syndicate in London in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Manzar Foroohar, ''The Catholic Church and Social Change in Nicaragua'', State University of New York Press, Albany, NY, 1989, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins and Hopkins signed Ethelburg as their client and promptly succeeded in canceling the loan. Apparently, Hopkins leaked crucial information on the impending U.S. intervention to unseat Zelaya to Otto Fuerth, a director of Ethelburg. The loan was cancelled and Zelaya gave up before the Marines landed. Hopkins testified in 1920: "I imparted the information to a friend of mine named Otto Fuerth, whom I had known for a number of years and who had vital interests in that Republic, and I did not want to see him make a loss, and I gave him a little quiet information."&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; While Hopkins and his clients worked with the American government to unseat Zelaya, American mercenaries, the likes of [[Sam Dreben]], Tracy Richardson, [[Tex O'Reilly]], and [[Emil Lewis Holmdahl]], together with forces from Guatemala and Honduras attacked Nicaragua full scale. Everyone expected an imminent invasion of the country by U.S. forces. As Hopkins managed to cancel the loan and American mercenaries began attacking the capital of Managua, the Nicaraguan dictator left.

Hopkins' involvement in the Nicaraguan change of government was critical. He represented his clients and acted on behalf of the U.S. government, especially [[Philander Knox]] who had become Secretary of State in 1909. Hopkins also supported Knox's efforts to properly finance and equip the rebel forces. Guatemalan President and another puppet of the United Fruit Company, [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]], received funds from the United States, mainly in the form of loans. The banana fleets of United Fruit and Pierce transported weapons and ammunition to the Central American republics. The main U.S. port from where tramp steamers sailed was New Orleans, a hot bed for mercenaries, revolutionaries, and intrigue of all kind. After Zelaya fled, the U.S. government installed a new puppet regime. "I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew that nothing could save Zelaya," Hopkins boasted to Senator Smith in 1912.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; Upon the question of whether Hopkins' intimate information about Nicaragua's troubles came from sources in the government, he replied: "I should not say directly from our Government, Senator. I knew what was going to happen before our Government did, and stopped Zelaya's loan from going through. I am also free to say that I received a great many hints that things were going to happen. I knew the sentiment in the State Department and elsewhere …"&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, Investigation of Mexican Affairs, Subcommittee of the Committee of Foreign Relations, Government Printing Office, 1920, Testimony of Sherburne G. Hopkins, p. 2565, p. 2566.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to Francisco I. Madero and the Mexican Revolution ==
Hopkins' obvious success and experience in Central America in the decade prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]] made him the prime candidate to orchestrate a successful uprising for [[Francisco I. Madero]] and American high finance. On the one hand, American investors, especially Hopkins' client Henry Clay Pierce, wanted to unseat British oil tycoon [[Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray]] and his [[Científico]] puppets. On the other hand, the Maderistas needed finance and political support from the highest echelons of the U.S. government. Hopkins's task was to bring these interests together. According to Hopkins, [[Gustavo A. Madero]] and his father Francisco Madero Sr. met with him sometime in October 1910 in the [[Hotel Astor]] in New York. They made a deal. Hopkins received a retainer of $50,000 (over $1 million in today's money) payable upon successful completion of Diaz' overthrow. Since that day in New York, according to Hopkins, he had been in "almost daily" contact with Madero's brother, preparing the revolution. What exactly this responsibility entailed, Hopkins did not elaborate on. Clearly, there were only three areas in which work was required: Procuring loans to finance arms and ammunition purchases; building an organization for the revolutionaries that procured and shipped arms and ammunition; and creating political support in the United States for the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC., 2012, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing how much his connections were worth, Hopkins successfully interceded with his friend, Secretary of State [[Philander Knox]], to allow munitions to pass unchallenged from El Paso to Ciudad Juárez to aid revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;John Skirius, "Railroad, Oil and other Foreign Interests in the Mexican Revolution," ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 1 (February 2003), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Maderos apparently put the well-connected lawyer in charge of the U.S. representation of their efforts, Hopkins had to find personnel quickly. The success of Madero's uprising depended on immediate financing, munitions shipments, and political support in Washington. Historians emphasize Madero's efforts to democratize Mexico and to institute meaningful social reforms, but often do not mention the Madero connection to U.S. interests. There is no hard evidence to suggest that the Maderos did anything other than what they could to advance their own goals. Henry Clay Pierce thought that as president Madero would create a more favorable political environment for his corporate interests than Díaz, so that he supported him. Even without any additional concessions, Pierce and the other U.S. magnates were not idealists. They faced an increasingly impossible work environment under Díaz, since, at the very least, in 1910 at 80 years old Díaz would not likely not last much longer in office and the presidential succession was unclear. When Senator [[Gilbert Hitchcock]] asked Hopkins whether his engagement in Mexico was for "any idealistic purpose," the answer defined the reality: "Of course not altogether, Senator."&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, Investigation of Mexican affairs, Subcommittee of the Committee of Foreign Relations, Government Printing Office, 1920, Testimony of Sherburne G. Hopkins, p. 2535.&lt;/ref&gt;

== American intelligence involvement ==
A representative of the Maderos and other governments, representing at the same time the Flint and Pierce interests, Hopkins also worked as an informant for the [[Military Intelligence Division]] of the US Army. However, the M.I.D. did not entirely trust him. When Hopkins determined that intelligence could be given without hurting the interests of his clients, it was reliable and valuable. Otherwise, he would not impart intelligence to the American government. His contacts in the M.I.D. hierarchy are also interesting. Not a single document could be found where Hopkins corresponded with Colonel Van Deman, the de facto head of the M.I.D. for many years. Hopkins corresponded with people much higher up in the chain of command, usually with the Secretary of War and his Chiefs of Staff. As a result, it appears more often than not that lower tier staff did not know him. From the evaluations of his M.I.D. handlers it becomes clear that they recognized the essence of his value. Informed like no-one else, Hopkins had to be handled with one caveat aptly defined in 1920 by Major Montague of the Military Intelligence Division. "His loyalty shifts with his fee," he cautioned his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, RG 165 Military Intelligence Division, Correspondence 1917 to 1941, Box 1266, File 2338-692, Memorandum for Lieut. Dunn.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to Venustiano Carranza and the Mexican Revolution ==
On Sunday, June 28, 1914, an exposé with wide-ranging consequences exploded on the first page of the ''New York Herald''. A break-in of Hopkins' office in Washington, D.C. netted burglars correspondence between the Hopkins' firm, the U.S. government, and the leader of the Constitutionalist forces, led by [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The details of the scandal were so significant that the details competed for first page headlines with the assassination of the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] and his wife on the same day. The scandal had its origin just around the beginning of May, the time when [[Felix A. Sommerfeld]] and Hopkins shuttled between New York and Washington, trying to sideline Carranza, and arranging the finance for the final push against President Huerta. According to Sherburne Hopkins, burglars entered his Washington D.C. offices at the Hibbs building on 725 15th Street, NW in the middle of the night and "stole a mass of correspondence from his desk." He suspected the burglars to be "[[Cientifico]]s," people who wanted to turn the clock back to [[Porfirio Diaz]]' times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Times'', "Captain Hopkins Charges Letters Were Stolen As Part Of Conspiracy," June 28, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins denied knowing who in particular was to blame for the heist, but "had certain parties under suspicion." Clearly, he was implicating Huerta agents in the crime. Despite the break-in and removal of not a few but hundreds of files from his office, Hopkins did not file a police report.

Hundreds of letters between Hopkins, Carranza, Flint, and Pierce told a story of foreign interests using the Constitutionalists for their own ends. The letters seemed to indicate that the whole revolution had become a competition between Lord Cowdray and Henry Clay Pierce. The Hopkins papers revealed the extent to which American investors fronted by Pierce and Flint had been involved in the Mexican Revolution. Not much of the overall story should have been a surprise. For years American newspapers had reported on the financial dealings of the Maderos with Wall Street. When after President Madero's murder the rest of the family fled to the U.S., their support for Carranza was public knowledge. However, what made the Hopkins papers so combustible was the undeniable link between major parts of the U.S. government, oil and railroad interests headed by Flint and Pierce, and certain factions within the Constitutionalists headed by Carranza and [[Pancho Villa]]. The appearance of impropriety was undeniable. As late as April 1914, President Wilson's special envoy to Mexico, [[John Lind (politician)|John Lind]], negotiated with Hopkins and Carranza with regards to the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]], convened to negotiate the U.S. exit from Mexico.

The exposé suggested also a second, less favorable picture of the Carranza government. The mere fact of Carranza corresponding freely with Hopkins and Pierce seemed to suggest that Carranza was willing to sell Mexico's infrastructure and natural resources to American finance if they helped him win the revolution. In a sense, these revelations threatened to reduce Carranza to the level of Porfirio Díaz whose sell-out had precipitated the revolution. Carranza would not let this stand and quickly issued a categorical denial of his government ever having accepted any financing from U.S. interests. Hopkins, Pierce, Flint, Carranza, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]], [[José Vasconcelos]], Lind, [[Lindley Miller Garrison]], and [[William Jennings Bryan]] all voiced public denials of ever having known anyone or dealt with anyone of the group. Only two parties smiled through the show: Senators Smith and Fall who loved to see the Wilson administration tumble, and Huerta's representatives in Niagara who only had to gain from the revelations.

As the Republican Senators [[William Alden Smith]] and [[Albert Bacon Fall]] correctly assumed, Hopkins had driven a deep wedge of suspicion between President Wilson and his Secretaries [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Lindley Miller Garrison]]. The latter even publicly announced that he never met or dealt with Hopkins, which clearly was untrue. Both cabinet members surreptitiously relented on the arms embargo against Mexico, while publicly proclaiming its enforcement.

== End of Hopkins' power and influence ==
The Carranza scandal devastated Hopkins' public image. He remained a solid soldier for the interests of Pierce and Flint, however, further in the background. His political clout had been on decline throughout the spring of 1914 and finally ended with the exposé of his stolen papers on June 28. In a larger sense, the Hopkins papers confirmed to the American public and international observers alike just how deep the machinations of American finance reached into U.S. foreign policy and Mexican affairs. Suddenly, all the rumors and suspicions voiced for years in newspapers and Senate investigations lay on public display as fact. Hopkins' carefully crafted lobbying schemes, his financing of select revolutionary factions in Mexico, the pushing of his clients' interests while hurting their competitors, and his intricate network of whole layers of government that operated on a system of favors – all of it had broken to pieces. After the scandal, Hopkins remained in the background. His protégé [[Felix A. Sommerfeld]] took the public stage. Throughout the coming world war, Hopkins gave information to the American government when asked. Off and on between 1914 and 1918, he acted as an informant and filed reports with the U.S. [[Military Intelligence Division]]. His influence on the [[Mexican Revolution]] never reached the heights of 1913 and 1914. When Pancho Villa self-destructed on the battlefield a year later, Hopkins had already faded into the background. He supported Villa's resurgence a few years later and supported the rise of [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] in the 1920s. When Hopkins died on June 22, 1932, ''The New York Times'' ran an obituary of the Washington lawyer who had revolutionary chieftains move at his behest like marionettes.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', June 23, 1932, "S.G. Hopkins Dead; Lawyer in Capital."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the anticlimactic ending, Hopkins' influence of American foreign policy towards Latin America and his influence on the [[Mexican Revolution]] are profound. As an MID agent remarked after [[World War I]], "Hopkins has forgotten more about Mexico than any other American will ever learn."&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, RG 165 Military Intelligence Division, Correspondence 1917 to 1941, Box 3692, files 10640-2413.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Brooks started his academic career at [[Newcastle University]]. He was a lecturer in [[political thought]] from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref name="bio - Debrett's" /&gt; From 2004 to 2005, he was also a [[visiting fellow]] at the Centre for Ethics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; In 2007, he was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[Political Philosophy|political]] and [[legal philosophy]].&lt;ref name="bio - Debrett's" /&gt; From 2010 to 2011, he was an academic visitor to the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]], University of Oxford and received a visiting fellowship to [[St John's College, Oxford]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; His "Publishing Guide for Graduate Students" is a popular resource for new academics interested in getting published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thom Brooks, "Publishing Advice for Graduate Students"|ssrn=1085245|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Brooks joined the [[Durham Law School]], [[Durham University]], as a reader in law, and its Philosophy Department as an associate member.&lt;ref name="bio - Debrett's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; He was appointed professor of Law and Government in 2014 – and he is the only Professor of Law and Government in the UK.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; Between 2014 and 2016, he served as Director of the Centre for Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at Durham University.&lt;ref name="bio - Debrett's" /&gt; In 2015, he was a visiting fellow to [[Yale Law School]], [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bio - Durham Law School"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Thom Brooks|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/law/staff/?id=11140|website=Durham Law School|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 August 2016, he has been Head of the Durham Law School and the school's inaugural Dean where he is leading the School's largest transformation in its fifty-year history.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; He has been credited for taking Durham's "academic fame...up a notch".&lt;ref name="Legal Cheek - Is Doxbridge a thing?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Doxbridge a thing?|url=https://www.legalcheek.com/2017/07/is-doxbridge-a-thing/|website=Legal Cheek|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, House of Commons' [[Early Day Motion]] 578 in Parliament recognised the many achievements of Durham Law School in his second year as Dean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/edm/2017-19/875/|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Brooks wrote a report analysing the United Kingdom's new [[citizenship test]]. His report was titled "''The '[[Life in the United Kingdom test]]': Is It Unfit for Purpose?''". He was highly critical of the test, concluding that it was "unfit for purpose". He criticised the test's focus on "British culture and history at the expense of practical knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Citizenship Test For Foreign Nationals Is 'Unfit For Purpose' Says Academic|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/17/british-citizenship-test-unfit_n_2896938.html|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=HuffPost|date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks's report has been cited several times in the UK's Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thom Brooks, Life in the UK Citizenship Report|url=http://www.thombrooks.info/life-in-the-uk-test/|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks publishes widely on criminal justice and sentencing. His "unified theory of punishment" is noted as one of the top 100 Big Ideas for the Future in a report by [[RCUK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCUK Top 100 Big Ideas for the Future|url=http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/publications/reports/bigideas/|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific author, columnist and editor, Brooks has written three books, edited two reports and 23 collections, published over 130 articles and 150 columns.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

His research on capital punishment is quoted and cited approvingly by the Connecticut Supreme Court lead decision in its "watershed" case of ''State v.

'''Women in Israel'''  are women who live in or who are from the [[State of Israel]], established in 1948. Israel does not have a constitution, but the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] states: “The State of Israel (…) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.”

[[Israeli law]] prohibits [[Sexism|discrimination based on gender]] in employment and wages, and provides for [[class action]] suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt; In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions.&lt;ref name="Lior"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lior|first=Gad|title=Israel ranks 24th in number of women executives|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4199179,00.html|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=[[Ynetnews]]|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==

Even before the state of Israel was created, there were women fighting for [[women's rights]] in the land that became the state of Israel, for example women in the [[New Yishuv]]. [[Yishuv]] is the term referring to the body of Jewish residents in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] before the establishment of the state of Israel, and New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] [[walls of Jerusalem]] in the 1860s. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and [[Rosa Welt-Straus]], who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/welt-straus-rosa |title=Welt-Straus, Rosa &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnLnZrwBw-EC&amp;pg=PT396&amp;lpg=PT396&amp;dq=%22rosa+welt-straus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gmq6uBbg2J&amp;sig=ORUYnYHwFCnSZy0BuRGVntKI_00&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ly5xUaD3H9iy4AOBhIGQCg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg |title=Jewish Women in Pre-State Israel: Life History, Politics, and Culture |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/searching-for-the-banner-of-the-hebrew-woman.premium-1.516467 |title=Searching for the Banner of the Hebrew Woman - Week's End - Israel News - Haaretz Israeli News Source |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2013-04-19 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/second-aliyah-womens-experience-and-their-role-in-yishuv |title=Second Aliyah: Women's Experience and Their Role in the Yishuv &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 the [[haredim]], who preferred not to face the possibility of a [[plebiscite]], left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming "equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv - civil, political, and economic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpwFFZG9kDAC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=israel+1926+suffrage+declaration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4YoUgTNKnV&amp;sig=n0M1JeUHD1tVCtBuoaRrrjfuK6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=025xUbjhF4GG8QSN-IDgBw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=israel%201926%20suffrage%20declaration&amp;f=false |title=Pioneers and Homemakers: Jewish Women in Pre-State Israel |page=272 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel was the third country in the world to be led by a female prime minister, [[Golda Meir]], and in 2010, [[Women in governments of Israel|women's parliamentary representation in Israel]] was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent and equals that of the [[U.S. Congress]]. Still, it trails far behind the [[Scandinavian countries]]' 40 percent average

The Israeli parliament, [[The Knesset]], has established “The Committee on the Status of Women,” to address women’s rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat [[violence against women]], and promote equality in [[Politics of Israel|politics]], lifecycle events and [[Education in Israel|education]]. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for "Prevention of [[Sexual Harassment]]".

In 2013, the [[Ministry of Religious Services|Minister of Religious Affairs]] and [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbis]] issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at [[mikveh]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/174499#.UqT7w-Jo2kw |title=End to Forced Inspections for Women at Mikveh - Inside Israel - News - Arutz Sheva |publisher=Israelnationalnews.com |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], in Israel to accept the Genesis Lifetime Achievement award, lamented the segregation of women in Israel at public universities, likening the practice to discriminatory "separate but equal" laws once applied to blacks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-gender-segregation-in-israeli-universities-is-intensifying-1.6317199] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg Compares Exclusion of Women in Israel to Discrimination Against African-Americans in U.S.[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-ginsburg-compares-exclusion-of-women-in-israel-to-separate-but-equal-1.6247002] &lt;/ref&gt;

Since the establishment of the state, Israeli law gives jurisdiction for matters of personal status for [[Israeli Jews|Jews]], including [[Jewish views on marriage|marriage]] and divorce, to the [[Judicial system of Israel|rabbinical courts]].&lt;ref name="toronto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.utoronto.ca/wjudaism/journal/vol1n2/v1n2grae.htm |title=Judaism Confronts Wife Beating |first=Naomi |last=Graetz |publisher=Women in Judaism |year=1998 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce of persons registering as [[Demographics of Israel#Jews|Jews]] would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the "[[Status quo (Israel)|status quo letter]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Ben Simon |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/civil-marriage-israel-jews-secular-orthodox-rabbinical-court.html |title=Israel's Rabbis Keep Lock On Jewish Marriage - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East |publisher=Al-Monitor |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the [[Knesset]] enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html |title=Bet Din and Judges |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 1 of the Law states, "Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts." &lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: "Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law" (din torah).&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;

In the rabbinical courts, which operate according to ''[[halakha]]'' ([[Torah]] law), a [[Women in Judaism|Jewish woman]] is allowed to initiate divorce proceedings, but her husband must give his consent to make the divorce final. If the husband disappears or refuses to grant the divorce, the wife is considered an "''[[agunah]]''" (lit. "chained woman") and may not remarry or give birth to ''halakhically'' legitimate children. Rabbinical tribunals may, and sometimes do, sanction a husband who refused divorce, but still do not grant a divorce without his consent.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

Similarly, a [[Islam in Israel|Muslim]] man is privileged to [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]] his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;  Unless a [[Women in Islam|Muslim woman]] has a [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]] providing for circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, she can only petition for divorce through the [[Sharia]] courts, and if her husband elects to withhold consent, she is denied a divorce absent certain conditions, and when these too are lacking she becomes a chained woman, prevented from moving forward with her life based solely on her gender.

[[Christianity in Israel|Christians in Israel]] may seek official separations or [[Christian views on divorce|divorces]] only through the [[ecclesiastical courts]] of the [[Christian denomination|denomination]] to which they belong.  Gender discrimination in such courts is not so rigid or codified as under Sharia or orthodox rabbinical rules.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a few couples to marry and divorce civilly in Israel, with men and women enjoying equal rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelfman |first=Rachael |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml |title=Civil Marriage in Israel |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Civil Union Law extends this right to only the very small minority of couples in which neither person is registered as a member of any religion.  A poll conducted by Tel Aviv University in 2009 revealed that 65% of the Jewish Israeli community supported the availability of civil, gender-neutral marriage, even though 70% of those polled expressed that a religious ceremony was still personally important for their own wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml?p=3 |title=Civil Marriage in Israel|accessdate=May 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024095054/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml?p=3 |archivedate=October 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]] (a [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the [[Israeli Bar Association]], introduced a [[prenuptial agreement]] meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/new-prenup-aims-to-prevent-agunot |title=Israeli rabbinic, legal groups partner for prenup in bid to prevent agunot &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Knesset]] passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-gives-rabbinical-courts-unprecedented-control-over-diaspora-jew-1.6216340 |title=Israel gives rabbinical courts unprecedented jurisdiction over Diaspora Jews - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women In Politics ==

{{main article|Women in governments of Israel}}
{{See also|Cabinet of Israel|Politics of Israel|Israeli system of government}}
Since the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|founding of the State of Israel]], relatively few women have served in the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]], and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While 
Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman&amp;mdash;[[Golda Meir]]&amp;mdash;has served as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.

Although the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] states: “The State of Israel (…) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,” the Haredi political parties ([[Shas]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]) have never allowed women on their lists for [[Knesset]] [[Elections in Israel|elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/even-china-has-more-female-politicians-than-israel-1.35908 |title=Even China has more female politicians than Israel |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=26 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/Judaism/Article.aspx?id=122076 |title=Ask the Rabbi: Queen for a day |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Novik, Akiva|title='Female haredi activists to haredi factions: Allow us to run, or we'll boycott.

{{As of|2016}}, women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member [[Knesset]], placing it 54th of 185&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in national parliaments|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in [[Scandinavia]] is over 40%, the [[European Union]] average is 17.6%, while in the [[Arab world]] it is 6.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/women2004.html |title=Report on the Status of Women in Israel (2004) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date=2004-11-19 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few  have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Women_in_public_life.html |title=Israeli Women In Politics &amp; Public Life |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/MKIndex_Current_eng.asp?view=3 |title=Current Knesset Members |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986 Israeli female teacher [[Leah Shakdiel]] was granted membership in the religious council of [[Yeruham]], but the Minister of Religious Affairs [[Zvulun Hammer]] canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council.&lt;ref&gt;''Judicial Power and National Politics: Courts and Gender in the Religious-Secular Conflict in Israel'', Patricia Woods, SUNY Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called "[[U'Bizchutan]]: Haredi Women Making Change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/.premium-1.637916|title=Israel's first ever ultra-Orthodox women’s party makes bold debut|date=20 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 1995, while she was a student of [[aeronautics]] at the [[Technion]] as part of the academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot selection phase in the [[Israeli Air Force flight academy]]. Following her appeal, Israeli president [[Ezer Weizman]], a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: "Listen maideleh, have you ever seen a man knitting socks? Have you ever seen a female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.scoop.co.il/article.html?id=16675 |title=Scoop|accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407015611/http://www.archive.scoop.co.il/article.html?id=16675 |archivedate=April 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt; Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense  and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men."&lt;ref name=mfaWomen /&gt; The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was "suitable"  was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.

Women began to apply for combat support and light combat roles in the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. The [[Caracal Battalion]] was formed which allowed men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the [[Israeli Border Police|Border Police]].&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt; Many Israeli women were accepted to the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy some completed it successfully. The first female jet fighter pilot, [[Roni Zuckerman]], received her wings in 2001.&lt;ref name="IAFwomandies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/29471/first-woman-pilot-in-israeli-air-force-dies/ |title=First woman pilot in Israeli Air Force dies|publisher=The Jewish news weekly of Northern California |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers.  When the [[Second Lebanon War]] broke out, women took part in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt; In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-air-force-appoints-first-female-deputy-squadron-commander-1.234139 |title=Israel Air Force appoints first female deputy squadron commander |publisher=Haaretz.com |author=Yuval Azoulay |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are still positions in the IDF that are off limits to women. In 2003 Yaara Stolberg filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court against the IDF's decision not to allow women to serve in the [[Machbet]] anti-aircraft unit. About six months after Stolberg completed her two-year mandatory military service, the court denied the petition, stating it has become "irrelevant and theoretical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3051999,00.html |title=ynet בג"ץ דחה בקשת חיילת לשרת במערך נ"מ קרבי - חדשות |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2011, [[Orna Barbivai]] became the first female [[Aluf|Major-General]] in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the [[Manpower Directorate]].

In response to several incidents where Orthodox Jewish soldiers objected to women singing during military ceremonies, the IDF Chief of Staff's office ruled that soldiers may not walk out of military assemblies to protest women singing, but may request to be excused from cultural events on those grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IDF: Religious soldiers can't walk out on women singing |author=Amos Harel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-religious-soldiers-can-t-walk-out-on-women-singing-1.278593 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IDF: Soldiers cannot skip ceremonies with women singing |author=Amos Harel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-soldiers-cannot-skip-ceremonies-with-women-singing-1.384288 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, female soldiers were asked to leave an official event marking the end of the [[Simhat Torah]] holiday and dance in a separate area.

{{Further information|Gender separation in Judaism}}

In 2013, Israel's attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, advised ministers across the government to end gender segregation in public spaces.  If implemented, the guidelines would change many aspects of daily life in Israel, where gender segregation is allowed on buses, at funerals, in health care and on radio airwaves. The attorney general's guidelines, however, are non-binding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/world/middleeast/israel-moves-to-end-gender-segregation-in-public-spaces.html Israel Moves to End Gender Segregation in Public Spaces ''New York Times'', 8 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Orthodox Judaism]], there are certain situations in which gender separation is practiced for religious and social reasons, with strict rules on mingling of men and women. Before they were banned in 2011, [[Mehadrin bus lines]] operated along routes with large Haredi populations, with seats in the front reserved for men passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Katya Alder|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6584661.stm |title=Israel's 'modesty buses' draw fire|publisher=BBC News|date= 24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irac.org/userfiles/Excluded,%20For%20God%27s%20Sake%20-%20Report%20on%20Gender%20Segregation%20in%20the%20Public%20Sphere%20in%20Israel.pdf |title=Excluded, For God’s Sake: Gender Segregation in Public Space in Israel|publisher=Irac.org\accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/divide-and-rule-1.323075 |title=Divide and Rule|work=Haaretz|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4135718,00.html |title=Court: No sex segregation in Mea Shearim|work= Ynet|date= October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Miriam Shear]], an [[American Jews|American Jewish]] woman, claims she was attacked by ultra-Orthodox men after refusing to move to the back of the bus on a non-segregated line.&lt;ref name="DBerman"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Haaretz|title=Woman beaten on J'lem bus for refusing to move to rear seat| url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=801449 | date=December 17, 2006|accessdate=2011-03-08 |first=Daphna |last=Berman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics likened the “mehadrin” lines to [[racial segregation in the United States]], with Shear compared to [[African American]] icon [[Rosa Parks]].&lt;ref name="DForman"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Jerusalem Post| title=Destination: Montgomery, 1955| url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467776731&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull| date=January 21, 2007|accessdate=2011-03-08 | first=David| last=Forman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, American-Israeli novelist [[Naomi Ragen]] claims she was bullied for refusing to move to the back of the bus.&lt;ref name="YYoaz"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Haaretz|title=Court to hear petition against segregation of sexes on buses.

The Jewish Daily Forward noted that gender segregation has been a tradition in Israel and is actually on the rise, now encompassing gender segregated elevators in some places.&lt;ref&gt;[Israel Gets Gender-Segregated Elevator — Finally! The Jewish Daily Forward] June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Jerusalem where ultra-Orthodox live, advertisements and billboard do not have pictures of women, and some supermarkets have different hours for men to shop than women. Some clinics also have separate hours for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;	
[Gender segregation on rise in Israel YNETNews] Nov 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar problems with gender segregation have surfaced on airlines such as El Al, where ultra-Orthodox male passengers have pressured females to move, and planes have been delayed as a result. The New York Times interviewed [[Anat Hoffman]] on the phenomenon of ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move, noting that IRAC had started a campaign urging Israeli women not to give up their seats. “I have a hundred stories,” said Hoffman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/aboard-flights-conflicts-over-seat-assignments-and-religion.html When a Plane Seat Next to a Woman Is Against Orthodox Faith, ''The New York Times'', 9 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy has also been created by discrimination against women in public spaces. [[Women of the Wall]] have fought for the right of women to pray in their fashion at the [[Western Wall]], including wearing prayer shawls, singing and conducting priestly blessings by daughters of the priestly caste. Women have also been denied the right to sing at some public events, such as memorial services and in the Knesset. The controversy focuses on whether "forbidding women to sing is an insulting act of unacceptable discrimination, or a gesture of sensitivity and consideration to Orthodox Jewish men who believe that listening to a woman’s singing voice is, for them, a violation of religious law. " Some believe such policies endorse religious fundamentalism and silence women or restrict their freedom in the public arena.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.717651 Controversy Rages Over Female Singers at Israeli Memorial Ceremonies] Haaretz, May 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, women protested that they had been discriminated against in Holocaust Remembrance Day observance. [[Bar-Ilan University]], for example,  announced it would allow women to read passages of text and play musical instruments at its Holocaust Remembrance Day, but would bar women from singing in order not to offend Orthodox Jewish males. The city of Sderot also limited women's singing at public events to appease religious males. Other organizations, such as Ne’emanei Torah V’Avodah (NTA), protested that it is an Israeli custom to sing at national ceremonies and that extreme Jewish religious law should not be imposed on the general public.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Bar-Ilan-Univ-bans-women-singing-in-memorial-ceremony-453021 Bar-Ilan Univ. bans women singing in memorial ceremony] The Jerusalem Post, May 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public harassment==
{{Main article|Mishmeret Tzniyut}}
Vigilante "[[Mishmeret Tzniyut|modesty patrols]]" have harassed women perceived as immodestly dressed in Haredi neighborhoods. In 2010, police arrested two Haredi men at the [[Western Wall]] plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a [[Women of the Wall]] group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt; On September 28, 2010, the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's [[Mea Shearim]] neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

==Crimes against women==
{{See also|Violence against women|Crime in Israel}}
[[Rape]], including [[Marital rape|spousal rape]], is a felony in Israel, punishable by 16 years in [[Israel Prison Service|prison]]. [[Israeli law|The law]] doubles the penalty if the perpetrator assaults or rapes a relative.&lt;ref name="hr2010"&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. ''This article incorporates public domain material from this source''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are nine [[rape crisis centers]] that operate a 24-hour crisis line for victims to [[sexual violence]]. The Israeli Ministry of Social Affairs operates a battered women's shelter and an abuse reporting hotline. The police operates a call center to inform victims about their cases. Women's organizations provided counseling, crisis intervention, legal assistance, and shelters.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

A major motivation for homicide in Israel is violence against women (including [[honor killing]]s in Muslim families).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actnow.com.au/Issues/Honour_killings.aspx |title=Looking for ActNow.com.au? &amp;#124; ReachOut.com Australia |publisher=Actnow.com.au |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several honor killings occur yearly in Israel within the Israeli Arab community.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

The indictment and conviction of former president [[Moshe Katsav]] for two counts of rape and other charges was interpreted as a victory for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Katsav mum, women's groups welcome rape indictment |author1=Zvi Zrahiya |author2=Jonathan Lis |author3=Dana Weiler-Polak |author4=Yuval Azoulay |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/katsav-mum-women-s-groups-welcome-rape-indictment-1.271712 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape crisis centers received record number of calls following the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli rape crisis centers get record number of calls following Katsav verdict |author=Dana Weiler-Polak

Sexual harassment is illegal but remains widespread. The law requires that suspected victims be informed of their right to assistance. Penalties for sexual harassment depend on the severity of the act and whether blackmail is involved; range from two to nine years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offence to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy.  Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation that accommodates sexual harassment. Intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment".&lt;ref&gt;Kamir, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey by the Ministry of Industry published in 2010, 35 to 40 percent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment at work, one-third of whom experienced it in the previous 12 months. Among the women who reported harassment, 69 percent said they had received "proposals," 47 percent reported comments of a sexual nature, 22 percent cited physical violation, 10 percent reported humiliation, and 7.7 percent reported extortion and threats.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

Israel, in accordance with Western ethics, has made [[polygamy]] illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eglash |first=Ruth |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225199601867&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Israel 2008: State of Polygamy |publisher=Fr.jpost.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburabia |first=Sarab |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1027756.html |title=Victims of polygamy |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were instituted to allow for existing polygamous families immigrating from countries where the practice was legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=13900&amp;sec=40&amp;con=35 |title=Polygamy's Practice Stirs Debate in Israel|accessdate=December 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414212442/http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=13900&amp;sec=40&amp;con=35 |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's health==
{{as of|2008}}, the [[maternal mortality]] rate in the country was 7 per 100,000 births, one of the lowest in the world. Women and men were given equal access to diagnostic services and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

==Women in the workforce ==

An [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] survey published in 2012 ranked Israel in eleventh place out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions.&lt;ref name="Lior"/&gt; Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt; The OECD reported in 2016 that income disparity between men in women in Israel is particularly high compared with other countries in the OECD. On average, men in Israel make 22 percent more than women, which places Israel among the four OECD (behind Japan, Estonia, and South Korea) with the highest wage inequality between men and women. The OECD average stands at 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4753118,00.html Israel's poverty rates highest among OECD nations, Ynetnews.com, 14 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government enacted a number of programs to improve the status of women in the work place and society. The Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women in the Prime Minister's Office grants scholarships for higher education for [[Druze]], Bedouin, and [[Circassians|Circassian]] female students in the country north. The authority holds professional training courses in Arab, Druze, and Circassian localities.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

In 2013, [[Malka Schaps]] became the first female Haredi dean at an Israeli university when she was appointed dean of Bar Ilan University's Faculty of Exact Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.550156 |title=Malka Schaps Becomes First Female Haredi Dean at Israeli University - National - Israel News - Haaretz Israeli News Source |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2013-10-02 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, Israel’s [[Chief Rabbinate]] promised to remove the obstacles preventing women from working as supervisors in the state [[kosher]] certification system, and [[Emunah]] announced the first supervisor certification course for women in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.561459 |title=Rabbinate Opens Kashrut Supervision to Women - National - Israel News - Haaretz Israeli News Source |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 it was announced that the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] had given the Justice Ministry 30 days to formulate new regulations to allow women to compete equally with men for the position of director of rabbinical courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.696233|title=Israel High Court Rules to Let Women Compete With Men for Rabbinical Court Role|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Niue''' are the female residents of or women who are from [[Niue]]. In terms of division of labor, the women of Niue inherits the tasks that belong to the domestic domain, including caring for children and elder members of the family unit, preparation and cooking of meals, sewing and weaving. Niuean women have "some rights" in relation to land tenure and inheritance of real property, but such rights are not "as strong" as those that belong to the men of Niue. Women in Niue over the age of 18 can vote in politics; they can vote in the so-called "second vote" level to elect 6 "island-wide representatives" known as members of the "Common Roll" (only men can vote to elect a village representative - a voting level known as the "first vote"). There is a trade union composed of women's groups in Niue. As women get older, Niuean women become more influential by taking up "positions of authority" after being educated and by demonstrating having qualities of an effective leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barker|first=Judith C.|title=Niue|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Niue.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
