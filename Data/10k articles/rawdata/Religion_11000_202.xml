'''Adharma'''&lt;ref&gt; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1–6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 64-66 (v 40–41), p 262-263 (v 7)&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Sanskrit]] [[antonym]] of ''[[Dharma]]''. It means 'that which is not in accord with the Dharma'. Connotations include [[naturalness (philosophy)|unnaturalness]], [[wrongness]], [[evil]], [[immorality]], wickedness, and [[vice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Sutta 22:14.'' Wisdom Publications, {{ISBN|0-86171-072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Adharma'' (Sanskrit: अधर्म) is derived from combining "a" with ''"dharma"'', which literally implies "not-''dharma''". It means immoral, sinful, wrong, wicked, unjust, unbalanced, or unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=adharma&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Adharma] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Cologne University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Ariel Glucklich translates ''Adharma'' as chaos, disorder, non-harmonious and explains it as opposite of ''[[Dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Glucklich (2014), The Sense of Adharma, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198024484}}, pages 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; Glucklich states that ''adharma'' isn't the binary opposite of ''Dharma'' or absolutely unethical in Indian philosophy. Rather it is a complex functional subjective term just like ''dharma'', with shades of meaning, that depends on circumstances, purpose and context.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Glucklich (2014), The Sense of Adharma, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198024484}}, pages 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
The [[Vishnu Purana]] recites a Hindu legend that includes ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' as mythical characters, and it is loaded with symbolism about virtues and vices, morality and ethics. The lineage is as follows,&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

{{Quote|
The progeny of ''[[Dharma]]'' (wise) by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by ''[[Sraddhá]]'' (devotion) he had ''[[Kama]]'' (desire); by [[Lakshmi|Lakshmí]] (wealth, prosperity), was born ''Drpa'' (pride); by ''[[Dhriti]]'' (courage), the progeny was ''[[Niyama]]'' (precept); by ''[[Tusht́i]]'' (inner comfort), ''[[Santosha]]'' (contentment); by ''[[Pusht́i]]'' (opulence), the progeny was ''[[Lobha]]'' (cupidity, greed); by ''[[Medhá]]'' (wisdom, experience), ''[[Sruta]]'' (sacred tradition); by ''[[Kriyá]]'' (hard work, labour), the progeny were ''[[Dańd́a]]'', ''Naya'', and ''[[Vinaya]]'' (justice, politics, and education); by ''[[Buddhi]]'' (intellect), [[Bodha]] (understanding); by [[Lajjá]] (shame, humility), Vinaya (good behaviour); by [[Vapu]] (body, strength), [[Vyavasaya]] (perseverance). [[Inner peace|Shanti]] (peace) gave birth to [[Kshama]] (forgiveness); [[Siddhi]] (excellence) to [[Sukha]] (enjoyment); and [[Kírtti]] (glorious speech) gave birth to Yasha (reputation). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, [[Kama]] (love, emotional fulfillment) had baby [[Hersha]] (joy) by his wife [[Nandi (Hindu concept)|Nandi]] (delight).

The wife of '''Adharma''' (vice, wrong, evil) was Hinsá (violence), on whom he begot a son [[Anrita]] (falsehood), and a daughter [[Nikriti]] (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, [[Bhaya]] (fear) and [[Naraka]] (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, [[Máyá]] (deceit) and [[Vedaná]] (torture), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya (fear) and Máyá (deceit) was the destroyer of living creatures, or [[Mrityu]] (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka (hell) and Vedaná (torture). The children of [[Mrityu]] were [[Vyádhi]] (disease), [[Jará]] (decay), [[Soka]] (sorrow), [[Trishńa]] (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, [[Daksha]] and the other [[Rishis]], the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.|Vishnu Purana|Chapter 7, Translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]]&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp041.htm Vishnu Purana], HH Wilson (Translator), Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''Atheist's Wager''', popularised by the philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] and published in his 1990 book ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'', is an [[Atheism|atheistic]] response to [[Pascal's Wager]] regarding the [[existence of God]].

One version of the Atheist's Wager suggests that since a kind and loving god would reward good deeds –&amp;nbsp;and that if no gods exist, good deeds would still leave a positive legacy&amp;nbsp;– one should live a good life without religion.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Michael |title=Atheism: A Philosophical Justification |year=1990 |publisher=[[Temple University]] Press |pages=232–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqxSJcoZVKIC&amp;pg=PA11 |title=So What If...the God of the Bible Exists...Does It Really Matter at the End ... |page=10 |author=Alvin F Berry |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |isbn=9781457500206 |quote= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another formulation suggests that a god may reward honest disbelief and punish a dishonest belief in the divine.&lt;ref name="beginner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Atheism: A Beginner's Handbook: All You Wanted to Know About Atheism and Why |isbn=9780595427376 |author=Philip A Stahl}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The Wager states that if one were to analyze their options in regard to how to live their life, he or she would arrive at the following possibilities:&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/pascals-wager/the-atheists-wager/ |title=The Atheists Wager |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MARPWA-2 |title=Pascal's Wager as an Argument for Not Believing in God |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*You may live a good life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite.
*You may live a good life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite.
*You may live a good life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite.
*You may live a good life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite.
*You may live an evil life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite.
*You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite.
*You may live an evil life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite.
*You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite.

The following table shows the values assigned to each possible outcome:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto"
|+ A benevolent god exists
|-
|
! Belief in god (B)
! No belief in god (¬B)
|-
! Good life (L)
| +∞ (heaven)
| +∞ (heaven)
|-
! Evil life (¬L)
| -∞ (hell)
| -∞ (hell)
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto"
|+ No benevolent god exists
|-
|
! Belief in god (B)
! No belief in god (¬B)
|-
! Good life (L)
| +X (positive legacy)
| +X (positive legacy)
|-
! Evil life (¬L)
| -X (negative legacy)
| -X (negative legacy)
|}

Given these values, Martin argues that the option to live a good life clearly [[dominance (game theory)|dominates]] the option of living an evil life, regardless of belief in a god.

'''Bernard Fellay''', [[Society of Saint Pius X|SSPX]] (born 12 April 1958) is a Swiss [[bishop]] and former [[superior general]] of the [[Traditionalist Catholic]] [[Society of Saint Pius X]]. In 1988, [[Pope John Paul II]] announced that Fellay and three other bishops were [[latae sententiae|automatically]] [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for being [[Ecône Consecrations|consecrated bishop]] by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], an act that the [[Holy See]] described as "unlawful" and "[[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html Apostolic Letter 'Ecclesia Dei'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129194411/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html |date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Lefebvre, and Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] who co-consecrated these four bishops, were also excommunicated. In January 2009, at Fellay's request,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Iz9RduZzw1Q}}[[chrome-extension://ddpephnhacfpgcemhioaejgenlgadnnh/icons/embed.svg|link=|class=ytta-embed-icon]]&lt;div class="ytta-embed-disabled"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt; on &lt;/span&gt;[[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Congregation for Bishops]], on instructions from [[Pope Benedict XVI]], rescinded the excommunication.&lt;ref name="212.77.1.245"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cbishops/documents/rc_con_cbishops_doc_20090121_remissione-scomunica_en.html Decree remitting the excommunication ''latae sententiae'' of the Bishops of the Society of St Pius X] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912115120/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cbishops/documents/rc_con_cbishops_doc_20090121_remissione-scomunica_en.html |date=September 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and ministry==
Fellay was born in [[Sierre|Sierre, Switzerland]] in 1958. In October 1977, at the age of nineteen, Fellay began studies for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at [[the International Seminary of Saint Pius X]] at [[Écône]], [[Switzerland]]. On 29 June 1982 he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. After his ordination, he was named Bursar General of the SSPX and was stationed at [[Rickenbach, Solothurn|Rickenbach]], the headquarters of the SSPX in Switzerland. He continued in that position for the next ten years.

== Consecration and excommunication ==
{{main|Écône consecrations}}
In June 1988 [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]] announced his intention to consecrate Fellay and three other priests ([[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], and [[Alfonso de Galarreta]]) as [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishop]]s. Lefebvre did not have a pontifical mandate for these consecrations (i.e. permission from the [[pope]]), normally required by Canon 1382 of the [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Code of Canon Law]]. On June 17, 1988 [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Bernardin Gantin]], [[prefect]] of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] sent the four priests a formal canonical warning that he would automatically incur the penalty of [[excommunication]] if they were to be consecrated by Lefebvre without papal permission.

On June 30, 1988 Fellay and the three other priests were consecrated bishop by Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]]. On July 1, 1988 Cardinal Gantin issued a declaration stating that Lefebvre, de Castro Mayer, Fellay, and the three other newly ordained bishops "have incurred ''[[ipso facto]]'' the [[excommunication]] ''[[latae sententiae]]'' reserved to the [[Apostolic See]]".

On July 2, 1988, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'', in which he reaffirmed the excommunication, and described the consecration as an act of "disobedience to the [[Roman pontiff]] in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church", and that "such disobedience — which implies in practice the rejection of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|Roman primacy]] — constitutes a schismatic act".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html Apostolic letter ''Ecclesia Dei''] (July 2, 1988). Vatican.va. Accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], head of the commission responsible for implementing ''Ecclesia Dei'', has said this resulted in a "situation of separation, even if it was not a formal schism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360 Interview for ''30 days''] (2005). ''30giorni''. Retrieved May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSPX denied the validity of the excommunications, saying that the consecrations were necessary due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q11_abexcommunicated.htm SSPX FAQ Question 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412031202/http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q11_abexcommunicated.htm |date=2011-04-12 }} (29 June 1987).

==SSPX Superior General==
In July 1994 the General Chapter of the SSPX met at Écône and elected Fellay Superior General in succession to Father [[Franz Schmidberger]]. On 12 July 2006, he was re-elected for another term of 12 years.

On 29 August 2005, Fellay was received in audience by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at [[Castel Gandolfo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Documents/Bishop-Fellay/DICI_Interview_Sept_2005.htm Interview with Bishop Fellay about Papal Audience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224032408/http://www.sspx.ca/Documents/Bishop-Fellay/DICI_Interview_Sept_2005.htm |date=February 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was also attended by [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos|Cardinal Castrillón Hoyos]] and Father Schmidberger. They discussed the present state of the Church and of the SSPX, the Society's concerns about [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] in the Church, the restoration of the [[Tridentine Mass]], and the possible recognition of the SSPX by the [[Holy See]].

By a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority.&lt;ref name="212.77.1.245" /&gt; The canonical situation of the four bishops thus became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended ''a divinis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX.HTM Letter of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei of 29 September 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remissions have not been unanimously welcomed by all members of the SSPX.  Fr. [[Florian Abrahamowicz]], a SSPX's dean of Northeastern Italy, called the action "insulting," since it claimed to remit an excommunication of these four bishops that the Society had officially maintained since 1988 did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agerecontra.it/lasvolta/omelia_pronunciata_da_don_floriano_domenica_25_gen.html Homily on 25 January 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603100024/http://www.agerecontra.it/lasvolta/omelia_pronunciata_da_don_floriano_domenica_25_gen.html |date=3 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrahamowicz was very soon expelled by the Italian chapter of the Society of Saint Pius X for either that comment or his [[Holocaust]]-related remarks.&lt;ref&gt;"Father Florian Abrahamowicz has for some time been expressing opinions differing from the official views of the Society of St. Pius X. The painful decision to expel him has become necessary in order to avoid having the image of the Society of St. Pius X further distorted with consequent harm to its work at the service of the Church." [http://www.ilmessaggero.it/articolo.php?id=45444&amp;sez=HOME_NELMONDO Lefebvriani, Fraternità San Pio X espelle prete negazionista] 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[Antonio Cañizares Llovera]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]], has reported Fellay as declaring that if Archbishop Lefebvre had seen how Mass is celebrated in an abbey near [[Florence]] in strict accordance with the 1970 Missal, he would not have taken the step that he did take.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/cardinal-if-lefebrve-had-seen-proper-mass-he-may-not-have-split/ Catholic News Agency: "Cardinal: If Lefebvre had seen proper Mass, he may not have split"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in relation to the talks with Rome in an interview in July 2009, Fellay said of the significance of the Second Vatican Council, "We will not make any compromise on the Council. I have no intention of making a compromise. The truth does not tolerate compromise. We do not want a compromise, we want clarity regarding the Council." In February 2011, Fellay said that the reconciliation talks with the Vatican would soon be coming to an end, with little change in the views of either side. In addition to disputes over the changes introduced by the [[Second Vatican Council]], new problems have been created by plans for the [[beatification and canonisation of Pope John Paul II|beatification of Pope John Paul II]]. Fellay said the scheduled beatification of Pope John Paul II on 1 May 2011 posed "a serious problem, the problem of a pontificate that caused things to proceed by leaps and bounds in the wrong direction, along 'progressive' lines, toward everything that they call 'the spirit of Vatican II.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110223122652/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1100721.htm |title=Traditionalist bishop cites lack of progress in talks with Vatican |date=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Williamson, in his weekly message, attacked Fellay for being too open to [[dialogue between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eleisonkommentar.blogspot.ca/2012/05/ec-254-untergrabene-doktrin.html Bishop Williamson, "Doctrine Undermined", 26 May 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528015033/http://eleisonkommentar.blogspot.ca/2012/05/ec-254-untergrabene-doktrin.html |date=May 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 12 October 2013, Fellay declared, "We thank God, we have been preserved from any kind of agreement from last year", saying that the society had withdrawn the compromise text that it presented to Rome on 15 April 2012.&lt;ref name="Vennari"&gt;[http://www.cfnews.org/page88/files/14e8cf27a431ca52105cf70b45567b82-149.html John Vennari, "Bishop Fellay on Pope Francis 'What we have before us is a genuine Modernist!'" in] ''[[Catholic Family News]]'', October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same occasion, he spoke of the [[Third Secret of Fatima]] as seemingly foretelling "both a material chastisement and a great crisis in the Church" and described [[Pope Francis]] as "a genuine [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist]]", who, in late July 2013, had begun a series of contacts, regarding which Fellay said: "We may not have the entire picture at this point, we have enough to be scared to death."&lt;ref name=Vennari/&gt; He expressed a different view about Pope Francis on 11 May 2014, saying that he had read twice a biography of Archbishop Lefebvre and enjoyed it: "With the current pope, as he is a practical man, he looks at people. What a person thinks, what he believes, is at the end a matter of indifference to him. What matters is that this person be sympathetic in his view, that he seems correct to him, one may say it like this./ And therefore he read twice Bp. Tissier de Mallerais' book on Abp. Lefebvre, and this book pleased him; he is against all that we represent, but, as a life, it pleased him." He also described how Pope Francis took a tolerant view of the FSSPX in Argentina, even saying that "I will not condemn them, and I will not stop anyone from visiting them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/05/sspx-bp-fellay-on-pope-francis-he-has.html SSPX Bp. Fellay on Pope Francis: "He has read the biography of Abp. Lefebvre ''twice'' and he liked it." And Some Other Important Revelations, Rorate Caeli, May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2012, in a radio interview aired from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Chapel in [[New Hamburg, Ontario|New Hamburg]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], Bishop Fellay declared, “Who, during that time, was the most opposed that the Church would recognize the Society? The enemies of the Church. The Jews, the Masons, the Modernists.” That was taken by various media entities to be an attack on the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/bernard-fellay-jews-enemies-of-the-church-radical-catholic-sect_n_2425711.html |title=Bernard Fellay, Head Of Traditionalist Catholic Sect, Says Jews Are ‘Enemies Of The Church’ |last=Sieczkowski |first=Cavan |date= January 8, 2013 |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |access-date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of St. Pius X issued the following reply: "The word 'enemies' used here by Bishop Fellay is of course a religious concept and refers to any group or religious sect which opposes the mission of the Catholic Church and her efforts to fulfill it: the salvation of souls.... By referring to the Jews, Bishop Fellay's comment was aimed at the leaders of Jewish organizations, and not the Jewish people, as is being implied by journalists. Accordingly the Society of St. Pius X denounces the repeated false accusations of anti-Semitism or hate speech made in an attempt to silence its message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sspx.org/district_news/usa_district_press_release_on_enemies_of_the_church_1-5-2013.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322033753/http://www.sspx.org/district_news/usa_district_press_release_on_enemies_of_the_church_1-5-2013.htm |archivedate=2013-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on May 24, 2017, that SSPX bishops have been authorized by the Vatican to ordain priests without permission of the local bishop.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=31663&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labeled as a "[[Correctio filialis de haeresibus propagatis|Filial Correction]]" of Pope Francis. The twenty-five page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate.&lt;ref name="Conservative Theologians Accuse Pope of Spreading Heresy"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/09/23/world/europe/ap-eu-rel-vatican-heresy.html |title=Conservative Theologians Accuse Pope of Spreading Heresy |work=New York Times |access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellay's term as Superior General concluded on July 11, 2018 upon the election of Fr. Davide Pagliarani as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Superior of the SSPX - Father Davide Pagliarini |url=https://gloria.tv/article/9bq9FBq6x8uL6NNc76641ve68 |publisher=Gloria.tv |date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Judaism''' is the collective term used to describe sects of [[Judaism]] predominantly practiced by the members of the African communities, both within the African Continent and outside Africa (such as North America). It is theologically characterized by the selective acceptance of the Judaic faith (in some cases such selective acceptance has historical circumstances), and that the belief system of Black Judaism is significantly different from the mainstream sects of Judaism. In addition, although Black Judaic communities adopt Judaic practices such as Jewish holidays and Jewish prayers, they are generally not recognized by the mainstream Jewish societies as legitimately Jewish.

Significant examples of Black Judaism include Judaism as practiced by [[Ethiopian Jews]] and Black Hebrew Israelite societies in North America.

== Examples of Black Judaism ==

=== Ethiopian Judaism ===
Ethiopian Judaism is a branch of Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews, which is mainly characterized by its partial acceptance of [[Talmudic law]]s. As what is essentially a "lost tribe", Ethiopian Jewish communities experienced a prolong period of separation from the mainstream Jewish societies, resulting in such partial acceptance.

The first recorded contact between the mainstream Jewish world and the Ethiopian Jews dates back to the 9th century, when Jewish merchant and traveler [[Eldad ha-Dani]] sojourned East Africa. In his account, ha-Dani claims that he came in contact with a group of Jews of sub-Saharan African ethnicity in the land of Ethiopia who were identified as the "Falashas" (derogatory term, lit. "landless wanderers"). For centuries, the Halachic scholars in the mainstream Jewish societies dismissed the reliability of such account, resulting in the lack of further researches about or further contact with the Ethiopian Jews.

The long-term isolation from the mainstream Jewish society resulted in the inconsistency between the Ethiopian version of Judaism and the mainstream versions of Judaism, which is manifested in the Ethiopian Judaism's departure from many Talmudic laws. The laws regarding marriage and divorce, for example, were not strictly observed as represented in reports written by contemporary Israeli Jewish religious authorities when they were debating over the eligibility of Ethiopian Jews as practitioners of the Judaic faith prior to accepting Ethiopian Jewish Immigrants. In addition, the Ethiopian Jews' observation of the Jewish Sabbath, the adherence of dietary laws and the celebration of holidays are all slightly different compared to those of [[Orthodox Jews]].

=== North American Black Judaism ===
North American Black Judaism is a branch of Black Judaism originated as a product of the [[Black Hebrew Israelite]] nationalist movement emerged after the emancipation of the Black slaves following the [[American Civil War]]. According to a number of scholars who support what is referred to as the "identification theory", after centuries of being labeled with pejoratives, the Black American communities' urge to find a new collective identity that will represent them in positive light drove them to congregate under the label "Hebrew Israelite", essentially painting themselves as members of the Jewish community. Along with adopting the new Identity, the "Hebrew Israelite" communities adopted of Judaism (or created the [[syncretist]] religion which is later labeled as "Black Judaism") as the centerpiece of such nationalist movement. Theologically speaking, Black Judaism is widely seen as a branch of African American religion instead of a branch of Western historical Judaism, Judaism in the common sense. Black Judaism is essentially a messianic belief system which labels the Black community as the true Chosen People.

James Landing, one of the most established scholars on the subject matter of Black Judaism, categorized Black Judaism as a form of social protest, having more social value than theological value. By steering away from [[Christianity]] and adopting Judaism as the collective faith, the post-Emancipation (especially [[Jim crow era|Jim Crow-era]]) Black American communities sought to distinguish themselves from the mainstream American society which they deem hostile.

'''Chogha Zanbil''' ({{lang-fa|چغازنبيل}}; [[Elamite]]: Dur Untash) is an ancient [[Elam]]ite complex in [[Khuzestan]] province of [[Iran]]. It is one of the few existent [[ziggurat]]s outside [[Mesopotamia]]. It lies approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Susa]] and {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Ahvaz]].

== History and Etymology ==
The Elamite name of this structure is Ziggurat Dūr Untash,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro Ancestor of the West ، Page 88 , In the thirteenth century king Untash Napirisha built Dur Untash "City of Untash" (in  modern Persian, Chogha Zanbil)&lt;/ref&gt; (/ˈzɪɡəræt/ ZIG-ər-at; from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ziqqurat, based on the D-stem of zaqāru "to build on a raised area"&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Ancient Near Eastern Architecture, Page 246: Most ziggurats (the Akkadian word from which the name is derived means "to be high"&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Dur Untash''' is the combination of Elamite Dur (Place/resident/city) like Arabic "Dur/Dar" with the same meaning
&lt;ref&gt;Right to Passage: Travels Through India, Pakistan and Iran By Zeeshan Khan: page 352: Chogha Zanbil ziggurat is the central instalment, of a city that was originally called Dur Untash after the Elamite king Untash Napirisha, who built a new city here, sometimes in the 13th or 14th century B.C "Dur" means "Place" in Elamite and a Similiraty with the "Arabic" word "Dar"...&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Untash''' the Elamite king who built it. However this structure is known by Its new Persian &lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro Ancestor of the West ، Page 88 , In the thirteenth century king Untash Napirisha built Dur Untash "City of Untash" (in  modern Persian, Chogha Zanbil)&lt;/ref&gt; name today "Chogha Zanbil" that has given to it &lt;ref&gt;Middle East and Africa: International Dictionary of Historic Places By page 186 Trudy Ring : Chogha Zanbil (also spelled Tsoga Zambil) is the "Modern" name for Dur Untash or Al Untash Napirisha, an Elamite city founded in approximately 1250&amp;nbsp;BC Dur-Untash was the capital city of King Untash-Gal (also known as Untash Napirisha)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Encyclopedia Britannica, page 940, City of Dur Untash ("Modern" Chogha Zanbil).&lt;/ref&gt;
''Chogha'' in [[Bakhtiari language|Bakhtiari]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} means "hill" {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. ''Choga Zanbil'' means 'basket mound.'&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, D: ''Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation'', page 82. Century, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built about 1250&amp;nbsp;BC by the king [[Untash-Napirisha]], mainly to honor the great god [[Inshushinak]]. Its original name was ''Dur Untash'', which means 'town of Untash', but it is unlikely that many people, besides priests and servants, ever lived there. The complex is protected by three concentric walls which define the main areas of the 'town'. The inner area is wholly taken up with a great ziggurat dedicated to the main god, which was built over an earlier square temple with storage rooms also built by Untash-Napirisha.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ghirshman, The Ziggurat of Tchoga-Zanbil, ''Scientific American'', vol. 204, pp. 69–76, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
The middle area holds eleven temples for lesser gods. It is believed that twenty-two temples were originally planned, but the king died before they could be finished, and his successors discontinued the building work. In the outer area are royal palaces, a funerary palace containing five [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] royal tombs.

Although construction in the city abruptly ended after Untash-Napirisha's death, the site was not abandoned, but continued to be occupied until it was destroyed by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]] in 640&amp;nbsp;BC. Some scholars speculate, based on the large number of temples and sanctuaries at Chogha Zanbil, that Untash-Napirisha attempted to create a new religious center (possibly intended to replace [[Susa]]) which would unite the gods of both highland and lowland Elam at one site.

The ziggurat originally measured {{convert|105.2|m}} on each side and about {{convert|53|m}} in height, in five levels, and was crowned with a temple. Mud brick was the basic material of the whole ensemble. The ziggurat was given a facing of baked bricks, a number of which have cuneiform characters giving the names of deities in the Elamite and Akkadian languages. Though the ziggurat now stands only {{convert|24.75|m}} high, less than half its estimated original height, its state of preservation is unsurpassed. [http://untoldpersia.com/ContentView/Pid/40226/title/Tchogha-Zanbil---Susa-Iran]

The main building materials in Chogha Zanbil were mud bricks and occasionally baked bricks. The monuments were decorated with glazed baked bricks, gypsum and ornaments of faïence and glass. Ornamenting the most important buildings were thousands of baked bricks bearing inscriptions with Elamite cuneiform characters were all inscribed by hand. Glazed terracotta statues such as bulls and winged griffins guarded the entrances to the ziggurat. Near the temples of Kiririsha and Hishmitik-Ruhuratir, kilns were found that were probably used for the production of baked bricks and decorative materials. It is believed that the ziggurat was built in two stages. It took its multi-layered form in the second phase.

The ziggurat is considered to be the best preserved example of the stepped pyramidal monument by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=It is the largest ziggurat outside of Mesopotamia and the best preserved of this type of stepped pyramidal monument. |title=Tchogha Zanbil |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/113 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Chogha Zanbil became the first Iranian site to be inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].

The '''Christ Heart Church''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 基督心宗教団) is a [[new religious movement]] that was formed in 1927. Its founder, Kawai Shinsui (川合信水, 1867-1962), reinterpreted the faith through the lenses of [[Confucian]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions by claiming that Christianity offers a more complete path of self-cultivation and advocates traditional Buddhist disciplines of [[meditation]] to achieve a Christian [[satori]] (enlightenment). [[Zen meditation]] and ''kyōkenjutsu'' (強健術) became important means of development in the Christ Heart Church. 

In sharp contrast to Protestant missionary policy, the Christ Heart Church allow its members to maintain the traditional Buddhist altar in the home. They also see no conflict between Christian faith and [[ancestor veneration]]. Members are encouraged to show 'proper respect' toward traditional customs, and the church supports participation in Buddhist ancestral rites with non-Christian family members.

[[Eritrea]] is a multi-religious country; Eritrea has two dominant religions [[ Islam ]] and [[Christianity]].According to the [[United States Department of State]] (USDoS) estimated that 50% of the population was Christian, around 48% was Muslim. &lt;ref name="USDoS"&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90096.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 62.9% are followers of [[Christianity]], mostly followers of [[Orthodox Christianity]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Roman Catholic]]ism and [[Eritrean Catholic Church|Eritrean Catholic]]ism.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Citation|editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Tracy |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Muslim Population |format=PDF |url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108194815/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eritrea was one of the first Christian countries in the world having officially adopted [[Christianity]] as the state religion in the 4th century. At the same time, it was the first Muslim settlements in [[Africa]], where a group of Muslims facing persecution in [[Mecca]] travelled through modern day Eritrea. Christians in Eritrea constitute to three main groups; the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]], the [[Eritrean Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Evangelical Church of Eritrea|Evangelical Church]]. The Catholic dioceses in Eritrea are the Eparches of Asmara, Barentu, Keren and Segheneity. In 2002, [[Isaias Afewerki]], the president of [[Eritrea]], declared all independent [[Protestant]] Churches, enemies of the state. For this reason, more than 2000 independent [[Protestants]] are detained due to their faith.

==Oriental Orthodoxy in Eritrea==
{{main|Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church}}
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted [[autocephaly]] by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in 1950. At that time Eritrea was regarded as a province of Ethiopia, so the Coptic Church in Eritrea was simply a division of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].

Following the independence of [[Eritrea]] from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993, the newly independent [[Eritrea]]n government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly.

Tensions were high between the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], and no representative from the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body.  However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the Autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it.  Eritrea's first two Patriarchs were originally Archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, [[Abune Phillipos]] did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two Churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out between the two countries in 1998. The two churches, remain in [[full communion]] with each another and with the other Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], although the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch.

The first Patriarch of Eritrea was [[Abune Phillipos]] who died in 2004 and was succeeded by [[Abune Yacob]]. The reign of [[Abune Yacob]] as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by [[Abune Antonios]] as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea.

[[Abune Antonios]] was elected in 2004-03-05, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 2004-04-24. [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]] presided at the ceremony in [[Asmara]], together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] delegation.

In August 2005, the Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea, [[Abune Antonios]], was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 2006-01-13 Patriarch [[Abune Antonios]] was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed.  In a written response that was widely published the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. [[Abune Antonios|Patriarch Antonios]] also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].  [[Abune Antonios]] was deposed by the Eritrean Holy Synod. Many believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed and still consider him Patriarch. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters.

==Catholicism in Eritrea and Ethiopia==
{{main|Eritrean Catholic Church}}
{{main|Catholic Church in Ethiopia}}
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] voyages of discovery at the end of the fifteenth century opened the way for direct contacts between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Due largely to the behaviour of the Portuguese [[Afonso Mendes]] whom [[Pope Urban VIII]] appointed as [[Patriarch]] of Ethiopia in 1622 and who was expelled from the country in 1636, these contacts, which had seemed destined for success, led instead to the complete closure of Ethiopia to further contact with Rome.

In 1839, Saint [[Justin de Jacobis]] arrived in the country as Prefect Apostolic of Ethiopia, in charge therefore of a [[Latin Rite|Latin-rite]] jurisdiction. He preferred instead to use the [[Ethiopic Rite|Ethiopic]] [[liturgical rite]]. Many Ethiopian priests were attracted to his sanctity and his teaching, thus giving rise to what became in 1930 the Ethiopic Catholic Church, when, in view of its continual growth, an ordinariate for the Ethiopic Rite faithful of Eritrea, entrusted to an Eritrean bishop, was established. Eritrea, an Italian possession since 1894, already had a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, headed by an Italian titular bishop, for Latin-rite Catholics, mainly Italians.

The Latin Rite had become established in the south of Ethiopia in areas that had not been Christian and that were incorporated into the modern country only at the end of the nineteenth century. The Italian occupation of Ethiopia in 1936 gave rise to an increase in the number of Latin Rite jurisdictions, but the expulsion of foreign missionaries at the end of the [[Second World War]] meant that the Ethiopic Rite clergy had to take responsibility for larger areas than before. Accordingly, in 1951, the Ethiopic Rite Apostolic Exarchate of [[Addis Ababa]] was established, and the ordinariate for Eritrea was elevated to the rank of exarchate. Ten years later, on 9 April 1961, an Ethiopic metropolia (ecclesiastical province) was established, with Addis Ababa as the metropolitan see and [[Asmara]] (in Eritrea) and [[Adigrat]] (in Ethiopia) as suffragan eparchies.

In 1995, two new eparchies, [[Barentu, Eritrea|Barentu]] and [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], were established in Eritrea, and the Latin Rite apostolic vicariate was abolished. Eritrea thus became the only country where all Catholics, whatever their personal liturgical rite, belong to an [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] jurisdiction. In 2003, one more eparchy was created in [[Endibir]] in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region]] of Ethiopia, and on Friday, February 24, 2012, according to the list of Pontifical Acts on News.va on the Vatican web site, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] erected the new [[Eparchy of Segheneity]] in Eritrea (area 29,499, population 850,000, Catholics 35,557, priests 52, religious 70), with territory taken from the Eparchy of Asmara. He appointed Father [[Fikremariam Hagos Tsalim]], until now the [[Vicar General]] of the Eparchy of Asmara, as the first [[Bishop]] ([[Eparch]]) of the new [[Diocese]] ([[Eparchy]]). The Bishop-elect was born in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]] in 1970 and ordained a priest in 1996. He studied in [[Rome, Italy]], and has been active in pastoral work in and around Asmara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/other-pontifical-acts-138|title=Pontifical Acts - 24 February|website=www.news.va|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ethiopic Catholic Metropolitan Church now consists of seven sees, three in Ethiopia and four in Eritrea. There are also Latin-Rite jurisdictions in the south of Ethiopia, none of them raised to the rank of diocese. Eight are apostolic vicariates, headed by a titular bishop; one is an apostolic prefecture, headed by a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/country/ET-type.htm#metr|title=Catholic Dioceses in Ethiopia (by Type)|website=www.gcatholic.org|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ge'ez]], a Semitic language fallen out of daily use several centuries ago, is the liturgical language of the Ethiopic Church, whose liturgy is based on the Coptic.

==Protestantism in Eritrea==
{{main|Protestantism in Eritrea}}
Protestants in [[Eritrea]] number about 91,232, which represents 2% of the population. The [[Evangelical Lutheran]] Church is the only recognised [[Protestant]] Church. Torture is used against independent Protestants in Eritrea causing more than 2000 Christians being subject to arrest in 2006. The U.S. State Department names it a Country of Particular Concern due to its violation of religious liberty. It has been reported that entire families are thrown into jail.

In 2009, [[International Christian Concern]] said that over 3,000 Christians were being held prisoner in Eritrea, and alleged a December 2009 mass arrest of 30 mostly elderly women who were praying together in a house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE5B90H020091210 "Eritrea says not aware of mass arrest of Christians"], Reuters, Jeremy Clarke, December 10, 2009, Retrieved June 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Barnabas Fund, in April 2010 a 28-year-old student died after she was held in a metal shipping container for 2 years, after being arrested for attending a [[Protestant]] Bible study.

Eritrea is included in the Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa of the [[Anglican Diocese of Egypt]], though there are no current congregations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioceseofegypt.org/english/churches/hornofafrica The Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206034357/http://www.dioceseofegypt.org/english/churches/hornofafrica |date=February 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Creátor ineffábilis, qui de thesáuris sapiéntiæ tuæ tres Angelórum hiearchías designásti et eas super cœlum empýreum miro órdine collocásti, atque univérsi partes elegantíssime distribuísti: Tu, inquam, qui verus fons lúminis et sapiéntiæ díceris ac superéminens princípium, infúndere dignéris super intelléctus mei ténebras tuæ rádium claritátis, dúplices, in quibus natus sum, a me rémovens ténebras, peccátum scílicet et ignorántiam.

Amen || Ineffable Creator, Who, of the treasures of Thy wisdom hast formed the nine choirs of Angels, and set them on high above the heavens in a wonderful order, and hast exquisitely fashioned and knit together all parts of the universe; do Thou, Who art the true fountain and one principle of light and wisdom, deign to shed the brightness of Thy light upon the darkness of my understanding, and thus to disperse the twofold darkness of sin and ignorance wherein I was born. O Thou, Who makest eloquent the tongues of babes, instruct my tongue, and pour forth on my lips the grace of thy blessing. Grant me acuteness in understanding what I read, power to retain it, subtlety to discern its true meaning, and clearness and ease in expressing it. Do Thou order my beginnings, direct and further my progress, complete and bless my ending; Thou Who art true God and true Man, Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.

'''Deconsecration''' is the act of removing a religious blessing from something that had been previously [[consecration|consecrated]] by a minister or priest of that religion. The practice is usually performed on churches to be rendered to non-religious ([[secular]]) use or demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/03/archives/deconsecration-of-a-london-church.html |title=Deconsecration of a London Church |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1876 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">The '''doctrine of separation''', also known as the doctrine of non-fellowship, is a belief among some [[Protestant]] religious groups that the members of a church should be separate from "the world" and not have association with those who are "of the world".  There are many scriptures in both the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] that provide the basis for this doctrine.  For example:

*[[Book of Amos|Amos]] 3:3 – "Can two walk together except they be agreed?"
*[[Ephesians]] 5:11 – "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness…"
*[[II Corinthians]] 6:14 "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers..."
*[[Book of John|John]] 17:13–16 "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it."
Different groups vary widely in what to them constitutes separation.  Additionally, there is a distinction between first and second degree separation.  For example, many Christians want to live in a way that is distinct from the typical lifestyle of the world (first degree). This was supported by Dennis Costella when he said "We are in the world, but we are not to be a part of it."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Costella, "What Does The Bible Say About Separation?" Accessed August 17, 2013. http://www.truthfulwords.org/articles/separation.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exclusive Brethren]] are an Evangelical Protestant Christian who hold strongly to a doctrine of separation which means that they isolate themselves from those not of their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC - Religions - Christianity: Exclusive Brethren |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/exclusivebrethren_1.shtml |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar but less extreme form is the position held by Fundamental Independent Baptists and biblical Baptist churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biblical Separation, the Doctrine -  What does the Bible teach? - by Cooper Abrams |url=http://bible-truth.org/Separation.html |website=bible-truth.org |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others would claim that not only should one separate from the world, but also from those Christians who would not separate themselves from the world (second degree).  Believers in second degree separation believe that Christians who are tied up with "the world" are themselves guilty of apostasy for their failure to adequately separate.

Practices and areas that should be separated under the more strict interpretations of the doctrine of separation include:

*Mental Life: Thoughts, reading, attitudes
*Physical Life: Dress, physical contact, entertainment, speech
*Social Life: Friendships, courtship, career
*Spiritual Life: Personal devotional life, fellowship with other Christians, the Church

The doctrine of separation often leads to [[ecclesiastical separatism]], in which Christians leave [[Christian denominations]] that they believe are apostate (Rev. 18:4).

'''East Asian Buddhism''' is a collective term for the schools of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] that developed in the East Asia and follow the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. These include the bodies of [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Japanese Buddhism]], [[Korean Buddhism]], and [[Vietnamese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist World, [https://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/east-asia.htm The Buddhist World: Buddhism in East Asia - China, Japan, Korea].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Orzech (2004), ''Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia''. Brill Academic Publishers, pp.&amp;nbsp;3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They constitute the numerically largest body of Buddhist traditions in the world, numbering over half of the world's Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pew Research Center]], [http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-buddhist/ Global Religious Landscape: Buddhists].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Todd M.|last2=Grim|first2=Brian J.|title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography|url=http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2013|year=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=34|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020100448/http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Asian sangha members generally follow the [[Dharmaguptaka Vinaya]]. The major exception is Japan, where monks (now called "priests" in English) received imperial permission to marry during the [[Meiji Restoration]], and thus no longer follow any traditional monastic code.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Eidgah''' or '''Idgah''', also '''Eid Gah''' or '''Id Gah''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|عید گاہ}}}}; {{lang-bn|ঈদগাহ}}) is a term used in [[Islam in South Asia|South Asian Islamic culture]] for the open-air enclosure usually outside the city (or at the outskirts) reserved for [[Eid salah|Eid Salah]], Islamic prayer offered in the morning of [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]. It is usually a public place that isn't used for prayers at other times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Special prayers in Idgah seeking divine blessings, eternal peace|author= |url= http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/10/stories/2010091057440200.htm|newspaper= The Hindu|date= |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of Eid, the first thing Muslims do in the morning is gather usually at a large open ground and offer special prayers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Traffic curbs on Eid|author= |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/idgah|newspaper= Times of India|date= |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Traffic restrictions imposed for Eid prayers|author= |url= http://www.siasat.com/english/news/traffic-restrictions-imposed-eid-prayers|newspaper= Siasat Daily|date= |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the [[Sunnah]] (traditions of [[Muhammad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamsa.org.za/library/eidgah.html|title=Eidgah|author=|date=|website=islamsa.org.za|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term ''Eidgah'' is of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] origin, due to lack of any specific Arabic word this term may be used for similar open spaces around the world where Muslims perform Eid prayers. The Eidgah is mentioned in the famous [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poem by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[O Mon Romzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe]].

==Prescriptions in the Sharia==
[[File:Idgah Padmani Enclave.JPG|thumb|200px|14th-century Idgah, built during [[Tughlaq dynasty]] rule in Delhi]]

The very first "Eidgah" was located at the outskirts of [[Medina]] nearly 1,000 footsteps from [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|Masjid al Nabawi]].&lt;ref&gt;(Mariful Hadîth, Vol. 3, P.399)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; There are several [[Fatwa|scholarly opinions]] regarding praying at Eidgahs, prescribing it in the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law):
*Complying with the Sunnah, performing of the Eid Salah at the outskirts of the town is better and more virtuous, than performing it in the town (i.e. in a mosque).&lt;ref&gt;(Fatwa Darul Uloom, Vol 5, P. 208) {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Eid Salah performed in the [[mosque]] is complete, but performing it in the Eidgah is Sunnah. To not perform Eid Salah in the Eidgah without a valid excuse, is contrary to the Sunnah.&lt;ref&gt;(Fatwa Darul Uloom, Vol. 5, P.2261) {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Eid Salah should be [performed in] a huge ''Jam'ah'' (congregation) on the outskirts of the town. In this way the brotherhood in [[Islam]] (i.e. among Muslims) is manifested. In the big cities it is difficult to have Eidgahs on the outskirts of the city, therefore a large open plain ground should be chosen for the Eidgah. Or if needed, the prayer can be performed in the mosque, which will be correct. But [people should try praying in an Eidgah] as far as possible, [since] one huge ''Jam'ah'' is superior to many small Eid [''Jam'ahs''].&lt;ref&gt;(Ahsanul Fatwa, Vol. 4, P. 119) {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Performing of the Eid Salah in the Eidgah is [classified as] ''Sunnah al-Muakkadah'' (emphasized or substantiated Sunnah). Without any valid excuse, the one who does not perform his Eid Salah in the Eidgah is worthy of being reprimanded and taken to task and this kind of a person is a sinner. If the Eidgah is a distance away and it is inconvenient for the old and sick, then the [[Fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) have given permission for them to perform Eid Salah in the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;(Fatwa Rahimiyah, Vol. 1, P.276) {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moradabad Eidgah===
The Moradabad Eidgah, Located near by moradabad railway station.
It is a historical religious place for muslims.
Moradabad Muslims perform Eid Namaz every year in Eidgah.Eidgah Moradabad ground is very huge &amp; with a seating capacity of 20000 namazi.

===Tumkur Eidgah===

The Tumkur Eidgah, located approximately 70 kilometres from Bangalore, is unique and combines traditional themes with the modern. Designed and built by Dr. Nazeer Ahmed, a space scientist, it has built into it subtleties that go beyond the ordinary. First, the divine name “Allah” is built into the structure, read right to left as is its reflection, read left to right. The reflection suggests the world is illusory and is only a reflection of the heavens. Secondly, each of the smaller minarets is nineteen feet from the ground. The number nineteen is a mystical number in Islam that appears in the Qur'an. The intermediate sized minarets are nineteen feet from the base. So, altogether there are six minarets that are nineteen feet each. Six times nineteen is 114, which is the total number of surahs in the Qur'an, a Book that completes God's favors upon humankind. Straight lines drawn from the apex of the minarets intersect where the word "Hu" is inscribed in a red circle. The subtended angle of 112.4 degrees is twice the natural flow angle of the earth into which we return. This flow angle is a solution to a Legendre polynomial of the second order which was presented in a paper by Dr. Ahmed at the fourth National Congress of Applied Mechanics at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1972.  "Hu" is the abstract divine pronoun for God, most exalted.  The circle is a reminder of "two bows length or less" wrapped around that shrouded prophet Muhammed when he stood in divine presence during [[Mi'raj]].  The entire structure is enclosed in a "golden rectangle" where the ratio of the width of the base to the height of the two large minarets is 1.618.  The Eidgah complex accommodates 12,000 worshipers.

===Gor-E-Shahid Eidgah Maidan===
Gor-E-Shahid Eidgah Maidan''([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: গোর-এ-শহীদ ঈদগাহ ময়দান)'' is located in [[North Bengal|Northern district]] of [[Dinajpur]]. [[Sholakia]] is declared as the largest Eidgah in [[Bangladesh]]. But in [[Eid ul Adha]] of 2017 this Eidgah hosted the largest [[Jamia|jamaat]] of Bangladesh.

==Eidgah Sharif==
Eidgah Sharif is a [[Sunni]] [[Sufi]] shrine located in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=stt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stthomas.edu/media/jayphillipscenter/publicevents/Updated-Short-Bio-of-Pir-Saab.pdf|title=Biography of Pir Saab|author=|date=|website=stthomas.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine was founded over a century ago. It welcomes visitors from all over the world and frequently hosts ceremonies known as ''Milaad Paaks'' which are mainly series of sermons from scholars and religious materials presented in solo a capella by people called "reciters". At the largest of these gatherings (such as the ''Urs Paak''), more than a million visitors crowd the main grounds and the surrounding streets. About four million followers from all over the country and about 500000 more from the [[United Kingdom]] are regular visitors to the shrine.

The custodian of Eidgah Sharif, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Naqib-Ur Rehman, known to his followers as "Pir Sa’ab", advances the mission and teachings of Eidgah Shareef with the assistance of his son Sahibzada Muhammad Hassan Haseeb Ur Rehman, known to the devotees as "Sa’ab Ji". Pir Sa’ab's ancestors, the previous custodians of the shrine, were all said to be Sufi masters directly from the lineage of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]]. In 1960 the family gifted the government with a large proportion of the land used to build Pakistan's capital city of [[Islamabad]], not far from Rawalpindi.&lt;ref name=stt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">'''Farrukhan the Little''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''Farrukhan-e Kuchak''), also surnamed '''the Deaf''' (''Korbali''),&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Madelung (1993), pp. 541–544&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Dabuyid]] dynasty, which ruled [[Tabaristan]] as independent monarchs in the century after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The brother of the ''[[ispahbadh]]'' [[Dadhburzmihr]], Farrukhan governed Tabaristan between 740/41 and 747/48 as regent for his underage nephew, [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Tabaristan-EN.svg|thumb|right|250px| Map of Tabaristan and its neighbouring territories]]
Farrukhan was the younger son of [[Farrukhan the Great]] (died ca. 728), the first ruler (''[[ispahbadh]]'') of the [[Dabuyid]] dynasty from whose reign coins are known.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Rekaya (1986), pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt; According to the traditional account, the Dabuyids had established themselves as the quasi-independent rulers of [[Tabaristan]] in the 640s, during the tumults of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] and the collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. They owed only the payment tribute and nominal vassalage to the [[Arab Caliphate]], and managed, despite repeated Muslim attempts at invasion, to maintain their autonomy by exploiting the inaccessible terrain of their country.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent interpretation of the sources by P. Pourshariati, however, supports that Farrukhan the Great was the one who actually established the family's rule over Tabaristan, sometime in the 670s.&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 308–313&lt;/ref&gt; 

Farrukhan the Great was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Dadhburzmihr]], who died in 740/41. He was succeeded by his son, [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]], but he was only six years old. Shortly before his death, Dadhburzmihr appointed Farrukhan the Little as regent until Khurshid came of age. Farrukhan effectively ruled Tabaristan for the next eight years, but this is not reflected in the coinage of the period, with coins struck solely in Khurshid's name from 741 on.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; Farrukhan's regency coincides with recorded attempts by the Dabuyids to strengthen their position vis-á-vis the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]; they used the turmoil of the [[Third Islamic Civil War]] to rebel against Caliph [[Marwan II]] (r. 744–750), and even sent an embassy to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] court in 746, which recognized him ("king Hu-lu-ban") as a vassal prince.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

When Khurshid came of age, Farrukhan prepared to hand over power, but his own sons disagreed and tried to usurp the throne. Their plot was allegedly betrayed to Khurshid by a slave girl, Varmja Haraviya. With the help of the sons of another cousin, Jushnas, Khurshid managed to defeat and imprison Farrukhan's sons. He later took Varmja Haraviya as his wife, while the sons of Jushnas were given high positions in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire is one of the elements that has been praised, and venerated, by the ancient Iranians. Fire is in the [[Avesta]] as [[Atar|Atash or Atar]], in  Pahlavi literature ''atour'' or ''atakhsh'' or fire, or in Persian literature has come as ''azar'' or ''athash''. The guardian angel fire is known as ''atouryast'' in [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] literature, and in Persian literature called [[Azarizad]] (Azar+Izad) (Azar=Fire. Izad=Goddess). Due to the importance of the position that the Angel has been called the son of [[Ahura Mazda]].{{clarification needed|reason=This sentence is ungrammatical, and who is "the Angel"?|date=January 2016}} In the ritual of ancient Iran, to appease the fire angel, fragrant woods or sandalwood are constantly applied in fire temples and fires in homes. In the religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], fire is sign of purity and truth, and [[Ardibehesht]] is its guardian. In ancient Iran, the origin of fire from two stones{{clarification needed|reason=What does this mean, fire-making using flints?|date=January 2016}} is attributed [[Hushang]] Pishdadi's period that survivor of them was [[Sadeh|Sadeh celebration]] that still make it popular.{{clarification needed|reason=This sentence makes no sense.|date=January 2016}}

== Early history ==
Fire commemoration and worship has a long history among the [[Indo-Iranians]], perhaps going back to the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=M. |last=Boyce |year=2011 |orig-year=1987 |title=ĀTAŠ |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Iranica]] |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo-Iranians believed that fire was the essence of life and existence, and it is thought that there was a relationship between fire and the plant.{{which?|reason=Any particular plant, or plants in general?|date=January 2016}} It also assumed that there is a relationship and proximity between the fire and souls of ancestors, and for this reason, it is thought that the [[fire-worship]] and [[ancestor worship]] have been relationship with each other since ancient periods. As it is written, the magnitude of a family was buried in courtyard of the family fire temple when died, and was kindled on his grave sacred fire, and it believed that as the fire that took the life preserver of the family, after the death of the spirits of the dead are supported. This tradition remains among Iranians in later periods to ignite [[candles]] or turn on the light on the graves of the dead, and yet this is a common event.

== Report of Greek historians ==
[[Ancient Greek]] historians refer to the [[Persian people|Persians]]' attention to the gods of the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[earth]], [[water]] and fire. Strabo's ''Geographica,'' Book XV, Chapter 3:&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15C*.html&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=But it is especially to fire and water that they offer sacrifice. To fire they offer sacrifice by adding dry wood without the bark and by placing fat on top of it; and then they pour oil upon it and light it below, not blowing with their breath, but fanning it; and those who blow the fire with their breath or put anything dead or filthy upon it are put to death.}}
Another historian, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis, writes that Iranians are sworn in front of the sacred fire, and such oaths are very important.&lt;ref&gt;Mythology and Iranian culture، P 405 and 406&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Ghar Wapsi''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]], meaning "Back to Home") is a series of [[religious conversion]] activities, facilitated by Indian [[Hindu]] organizations [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) and [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), to facilitate conversion of non-Hindus to [[Hinduism]]. It became a subject of public discussion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghar Wapsi continues in Kerala; 58 more embrace Hinduism|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/ghar-wapsi-continues-in-kerala-58-more-embrace-hinduism/20141225.htm|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=Rediff News|issue=December 25, 2014|date=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Ghar wapsi’ only way to end terror says BJP leader|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/ghar-wapsi-only-way-to-end-terror-says-bjp-leader/article1-1300421.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=Hindustan Times|date=December 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229063904/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/ghar-wapsi-only-way-to-end-terror-says-bjp-leader/article1-1300421.aspx|archivedate=29 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/VHP-to-hold-ghar-wapsi-for-4000-Muslims-in-Ayodhya-in-January/articleshow/45624372.cms VHP to hold 'ghar wapsi' for 4,000 Muslims in Ayodhya in January], Times of India, 24 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]'s [[Yogi Adityanath]] has claimed this campaign would continue unless conversions to other religions are banned altogether in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghar wapsi to continue till conversions are banned: Adityanath|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ghar-wapsi-to-continue-till-conversions-are-banned-adityanath/article6929001.ece|accessdate=February 24, 2015|work=The Hindu|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment, the judges ruled that reconversion to Hinduism will not prevent a person from accessing [[Reservation in India|quota]] benefits and adopt the [[Jāti|caste]] of his forefathers.

[[File:Book of incantations f.7v.png|thumb|19th century book of incantations, written by a Welsh physician]]
Incantation is a magical formula recited that contains a series of powerful words joined together of a single word to trigger or carry out a magical effect on a person or object. The words  can be spoken, sung or chanted.Haase, Donald The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales Volume 2:G-P, Greenwood Press Westport, CT 2008 Haase≈ An incantation may take place during a [[ritual]], either a [[hymn]] or [[prayer]], and may invoke or praise a [[deity]]. In [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[occultism]], [[shamanism]], and [[witchcraft]] it is used with the intention of casting a spell on an object or a person. The term derives from  [[Latin]] "incantare" (tr.), meaning "to chant (a magical spell) upon," from ''in-'' "into, upon" and ''cantare'' "to sing".

In  [[medieval literature]], [[folklore]], [[fairy tales]] and modern [[fantasy]] fiction, enchantments (from the [[Old French]] "enchantement") are charms or spells. The term was loaned into English since around AD 1300. The corresponding native English term being "[[galdr]]" "song, spell".  It has led to the terms "enchanter" and "enchantress", for those who use enchantments.

The weakened sense "delight" (compare the same development of "charm") is modern, first attested in 1593 ([[OED]]).

Surviving written records of historical magic spells were largely obliterated in many cultures by the success of the major monotheistic religions, Hinduism, [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]], which label some magical activity as immoral or associated with evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Owen|title=The top 10 grimoires|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history|website=The Guardian|accessdate=24 October 2017|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore and fiction==
[[File:Orlando Furioso 13.jpg|thumb|The enchantress Alcina makes herself appear beautiful, in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'']]

In traditional [[fairy tale]]s or [[fantasy fiction]], an enchantment is a [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] that is attached, on a relatively permanent basis, to a specific person, object or location, and alters its qualities, generally in a positive way.  A widely known example is the spell that [[Cinderella]]'s Fairy Godmother uses to turn a [[pumpkin]] into a coach.  An enchantment with negative characteristics is usually instead referred to as a [[curse]].

Conversely, enchantments are also used to describe spells that cause no real effects but deceive people, either by directly affecting their thoughts or using some kind of illusions.  Enchantresses are frequently depicted as able to seduce by such magic. Other forms include deceiving people into believing that they have suffered a magical [[Shape-shifting|transformation]].

==Effects==
[[File:The Enchanted Garden of Messer Ansaldo by Marie Spartali Stillman (1889).jpg|right|thumb|''The Enchanted Garden of Messer Ansaldo'' by [[Marie Spartali Stillman]]]]

To be enchanted is to be under the influence of an enchantment, usually thought to be caused by charms or [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]].

The [[Latin]] ''incantare'', which means 'to utter an incantation', or cast a magic spell, forms the basis of the word "[[wikt:Special:Search/enchant|enchant]]", with deep linguistic roots going back to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''kan-'' [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]. So it can be said that an enchanter or enchantress casts magic [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]], or utters incantations, similar to what are called [[Mantra]] in [[Sanskrit]].

==Magic words==
[[File:Abracadabra triangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|Classic magic words.]]
Magic words or words of power are words which have a specific, and sometimes unintended, effect. They are often [[nonsense]] phrases used in [[fantasy]] fiction or by [[Magic (illusion)|stage prestidigitators]]. Frequently such words are presented as being part of a [[Divine_language|divine]], [[Adamic_language|adamic]], or other [[Twilight language|secret]] or [[Language of the birds|empowered]] [[language]]. Certain [[comic book]] heroes use magic words to activate their  powers.

Examples of traditional magic words include ''[[Abracadabra]]'', ''[[Hocus pocus (magic)|Hocus pocus]]'', ''[[Open Sesame (phrase)|Open sesame]]'', and ''[[Sim Sala Bim]]''.

Craig Conley, a scholar of magic, writes that the magic words used by conjurers may originate from "pseudo-Latin phrases, nonsense syllables, or esoteric terms from religious antiquity," but that what they have in common is "language as an instrument of creation."&lt;ref name="conley"&gt;Conley, Craig (2006). ''[https://hechizoseternos.com/ Magic Words]: A Dictionary (revised second edition).'' In-Spired.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some collections of charms==

* The [[Anglo-Saxon metrical charms]]
* The [[Carmina Gadelica]], a collection of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[oral poetry]], much of it charms
* The [[Atharva Veda]], a collection of charms, and the [[Rigveda]], a collection of [[hymns]] or incantations
* [[Hittite ritual texts]]
* The [[Greek Magical Papyri]]
* Mandaean style incantations
* The [[Merseburg Incantations]]
* ''[[Cyprianus]]''
* ''[[Pow-Wows; or, Long Lost Friend]]''
* You can listen to a Babylonian incantation [[The Evil Dead|being read aloud]] by a modern scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speechisfire.com/|title=The Recordings: BAPLAR: SOAS|work=speechisfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (It is possible to view a translation and transcription while listening).
* [[Mesopotamia]]n incantations were composed to counter anything from witchcraft ([[Maqlû]]) to  field pests ([[Zu-buru-dabbeda]]).

==Modern uses and interpretations==
The performance of magic almost always involves the use of language. Whether spoken out loud or unspoken, words are frequently used to access or guide magical power. In ''The Magical Power of Words'' (1968), S. J. Tambiah argues that the connection between language and magic is due to a belief in the inherent ability of words to influence the universe. Bronisław Malinowski, in ''[[Coral Gardens and their Magic]]'' (1935), suggests that this belief is an extension of man's basic use of language to describe his surroundings, in which "the knowledge of the right words, appropriate phrases and the more highly developed forms of speech, gives man a power over and above his own limited field of personal action."&lt;ref name="Malinowski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malinowski|first1=Bronislaw|title=Coral Gardens and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands|date=2013|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=1136417737}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} Magical speech is therefore a ritual act and is of equal or even greater importance to the performance of magic than non-verbal acts.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tambiah|first1=S. J.|title=The Magical Power of Words|journal=Man|date=June 1968|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2798500|jstor=2798500}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

Not all speech is considered magical. Only certain words and phrases or words spoken in a specific context are considered to have magical power.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|176}} Magical language, according to [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]]'s (1923) categories of speech, is distinct from scientific language because it is emotive and it converts words into symbols for emotions; whereas in scientific language words are tied to specific meanings and refer to an objective external reality.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Magical language is therefore particularly adept at constructing metaphors that establish symbols and link magical rituals to the world.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

Malinowski argues that "the language of magic is sacred, set and used for an entirely different purpose to that of ordinary life."&lt;ref name="Malinowski"/&gt;{{rp|213}} The two forms of language are differentiated through word choice, grammar, style, or by the use of specific phrases or forms: [[prayers]], spells, [[songs]], [[blessing]]s, or [[chants]], for example. Sacred modes of language often employ archaic words and forms in an attempt to invoke the purity or "truth" of a religious or a cultural "golden age". The use of Hebrew in [[Judaism]] is an example.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

Another potential source of the power of words is their secrecy and exclusivity. Much sacred language is differentiated enough from common language that it is incomprehensible to the majority of the population and it can only be used and interpreted by specialized practitioners ([[magician (paranormal)|magicians]], [[priests]], [[Shamanism|shamans]], even [[mullah]]s).&lt;ref name="Malinowski"/&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|178}} In this respect, Tambiah argues that magical languages violate the primary function of language: communication.&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|179}} Yet adherents of magic are still able to use and to value the magical function of words by believing in the inherent power of the words themselves and in the meaning that they must provide for those who do understand them. This leads Tambiah to conclude that "the remarkable disjunction between sacred and profane language which exists as a general fact is not necessarily linked to the need to embody sacred words in an exclusive language."&lt;ref name="Tambiah"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

'''Integral mission''' or '''holistic mission''' is a term coined in Spanish as ''misión integral'' in the 1970s by members of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] group [[Latin American Theological Fellowship]] (or FTL, its Spanish acronym) to describe an understanding of Christian mission which embraces both the [[evangelism]] and [[social responsibility]]. Since [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne]] 1974, integral mission has influenced a significant number of evangelicals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMhsoyVuefIC&amp;pg=PA151|title=The Global Diffusion of Evangelicalism: The Age of Billy Graham and John Stott|last=Stanley|first=Brian|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2013|isbn=9780830825851|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=151-180|language=en|quote=|author-link=Brian Stanley (historian)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The proponents of integral mission argue that the concept of integral mission is nothing new – rather, it is rooted in Scripture and wonderfully exemplified in Jesus’ own ministry. "Integral mission" is only a distinct vocabulary for a holistic understanding of mission that has become important in the past forty years in order to distinguish it from widely held but dualistic approaches that emphasize either evangelism or social responsibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The process of defining integral mission and the journey of its acceptance by significant numbers of Evangelicals has taken place over a period of just over 40 years. Its progress can be observed through a number of significant international Evangelical congresses.

In 1966, the Congress on the World Mission of the Church, held in Wheaton, [[Illinois]], brought together [[Evangelicals]] from 71 countries.  The Wheaton Declaration confessed  that “we [Evangelicals] are guilty of an unscriptural isolation from the world that too often keeps us from honestly facing and coping with its concerns” and the “failure [of the church] to apply scriptural principles to such problems as [[racism]], [[war]], [[population explosion]], [[poverty]], family disintegration, [[social revolution]], and [[communism]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Wheaton Declaration | journal = Evangelical Mission Quarterly | volume = 2 | date = Summer 1966 | pages = 231–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, that same year the World Congress on Evangelization in [[Berlin]] continued to emphasise a traditionally [[Evangelicalism | Evangelical]] conception of mission, as articulated by [[Billy Graham]]: “if the church went back to its main task of proclaiming the [[gospel]] and people [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Christ]], it would have a far greater impact on the social, moral and psychological needs of men than it could achieve through anything else it could possibly do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | first = Billy | last = Graham | author-link = Billy Graham | title = Why the Berlin Congress | newspaper = Christianity Today | volume = 11 | date = 11 November 1966 | page = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the question of Christian social involvement  came up repeatedly during the ensuing regional congresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padilla|first=C. René|author-link=C. René Padilla|year=1985|title=Evangelism and Social Responsibility: From Wheaton '66 to Wheaton '83|journal=Transformation|volume=2|issue=3|pages=27-34|doi=10.1177/026537888500200311}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Congress on World Evangelization in [[Lausanne]] in 1974 is regarded by some as "the most important world-wide evangelical gathering of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="padilla"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice, Mercy &amp; Humility: Integral Mission and the Poor|last=Padilla|first=C. René|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Chester|editor-first=Tim|location=|pages=42-58|quote=|author-link=René Padilla|via=|contribution=Integral Mission and its Historical Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lausanne Covenant]] affirmed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God is both the Creator and the Judge of all men.  We therefore should share his concern for justice and reconciliation throughout human society and for the liberation of men from every kind of oppression… we express penitence both for our neglect and for having sometimes regarded evangelism and social concern as mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = John | last = Stott | title = Making Christ Known: Historic Mission Documents from the Lausanne Movement, 1974–1989 | place = Carlisle | publisher = Paternoster | year = 1996 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Congress]], support for the concept of integral mission grew amongst [[evangelicals]], particularly in the Two-Thirds World.  A number of declarations which emerged from international [[evangelical]] conferences in the ensuing years (some of them organized by the Lausanne Movement and chaired by John Stott) revealed similar concerns for a [[holistic]] understanding of mission.  Of critical importance for the development of the theology of integral mission were the various Latin American Congresses on Evangelism (CLADE, their Spanish acronym—Consejo Latinoamericano de Evangelización). Beginning with the Second Latin America Congress on Evangelism, held in Peru in 1979, the CLADES (III, Quito, 1992; IV, Quito, 2000) were organized by the Latin American Theological Fellowship (FTL). {{Citation needed | date = August 2014}}

In the [[UK]], the International Consultation on Simple Lifestyle in 1980 resulted in a document entitled "An Evangelical Commitment to Simple Lifestyle," again affirming a commitment to justice within an [[Evangelical]] conception of mission.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | title = Lifestyle in the Eighties: An Evangelical Commitment to Simple Lifestyle | editor-first = Ron | editor-last = Sider | place = Philadelphia | publisher = Westminster | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the International Consultation on the Relationship of Evangelism and Social Responsibility concluded that the latter is a consequence of, a bridge to and partner of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Stott | title = Making Christ Known|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document published maintained the [[wikt:primacy |primacy]] of [[evangelism]] however, despite its affirmation that the two are, in practice, “inseparable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichols|first=Bruce|title=In Word and Deed|year=1986|page=81|place=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=Eerdmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Consultation on the Church in Response to Human Need in Wheaton, Illinois, led to the publication of "Transformation: The Church in Response to Human Need," perhaps the strongest evangelical affirmation of integral Mission.&lt;ref name="padilla"/&gt; It is explicit in its denunciation of injustice, and churches and Christina organisations  who "by silence give their tacit support" to "the socio-economic status-quo."&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book | first1 = Vinay | last1 = Samuel | first2 = Chris | last2 = Sugden | title = The Church in Response to Human Need | place = Oxford | year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The last decade==

A commitment to integral mission is often reflected in particular concern for those living in poverty and a commitment to pursuing justice. The concept of integral mission is advocated largely by Evangelical Christians, many of whom are related to the Micah Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micahnetwork.org/resource-topics?topic=integral+mission&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 a global network of [[evangelical]] [[Christian]] organisations committed to Integral Mission was established and christened the Micah Network, which owes its name to the centrality of Micah 6:8 to the concept of Integral Mission:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Their members represent approximately 600 Evangelical service organizations, churches and individual members around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.micahnetwork.org/members|title=Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Micah Network|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ipomoea tricolor''''', the '''Mexican morning glory''' or just '''morning glory'''&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Brickell | editor-first = Christopher | title = The Royal Horticultural Society A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants | year = 2008 | page = 570 | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | location = United Kingdom | ISBN = 9781405332965}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a [[species]] of [[flowering plant]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] Convolvulaceae, [[native plant|native]] to the New World [[tropics]], and widely cultivated and [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] elsewhere. It is an [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[annual plant|annual]] or [[perennial plant|perennial]] twining [[liana]] growing to {{convert|2|-|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are spirally arranged, 3–7&amp;nbsp;cm (1" to 3") long with a 1.5–6&amp;nbsp;cm (½" to 2") long petiole. The [[flower]]s are trumpet-shaped, {{convert|4|-|9|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, most commonly blue with a white to golden yellow centre.

==Cultivation and uses==
In cultivation, the species is very commonly grown misnamed as ''[[Ipomoea violacea]]'', actually a different though related species. ''I. tricolor'' does not tolerate temperatures below {{convert|5 |C|F|abbr=on}}, so in temperate regions it is usually grown as an [[annual plant|annual]]. It is in any case a relatively short-lived plant.

Numerous [[cultivar]]s of ''I. tricolor'' with different flower colours have been selected for use as [[ornamental plant]]s; widely grown examples include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* ‘Blue Star’
*‘Flying Saucers’
* ‘Heavenly Blue’
* ‘Heavenly Blue Improved’
* ‘Pearly Gates’
* ‘Rainbow Flash’
* ‘Skylark’
* ‘Summer Skies’
* ‘Wedding Bells’
{{div col end}}

The cultivar 'Heavenly Blue' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Ipomoea tricolor'' | url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1032|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 53 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Entheogenic use===
The [[seed]]s, vines, flowers, and leaves contain [[ergoline]] [[alkaloids]], and have been used for centuries by many [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Native American]] cultures as an [[entheogen]]; [[R. Gordon Wasson]] has argued that the hallucinogenic seeds used by the [[Aztec]]s under the [[Nahuatl]] name ''tlitliltzin'', were the seeds of ''I. tricolor''. Wasson also noted that the modern-day [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] of Oaxaca know the seeds as ''badoh negro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carod-Artal|first=FJ|title=Hallucinogenic drugs in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures|journal=Neurologia|year=2015|volume=30|issue=1|pages=42–9|pmid=21893367|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2011.07.003|url=http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-neurologia-english-edition--495-pdf-S2173580814001527-S300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Schultes in 1941 described Mexican Native American use in a short report documenting the use dating back to [[Aztec]] times cited in [[TiHKAL]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. Further research was published in 1960, when [[Don Thomes MacDougall]] reported that the seeds of ''Ipomoea tricolor'' were used as sacraments by certain [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]s, sometimes in conjunction with the seeds of ''[[Rivea corymbosa]]'', another species which has a similar chemical composition, with [[lysergol]] instead of [[ergometrine]].  This more widespread knowledge has led to a rise in [[entheogen]]ic use by people other than Native Americans.

The hallucinogenic properties of the seeds are usually attributed to [[ergine]] (also known as ''d-lysergic acid amide'', or [[ergine|LSA]]), although the validity of the attribution remains disputed. [[Lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide]] and [[ergonovine]] are also considered to be contributing psychedelic alkaloids in the plant. While ergine is listed as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] substance in the United States, parts of the plant itself are not controlled, and seeds and plants are still sold by many nurseries and garden suppliers.

The seeds also contain [[glycoside]]s, which may cause [[nausea]] if consumed.

===Toxic treatments===
Commercial seeds are sometimes treated with toxic [[methylmercury]] (although the use of methylmercury has been banned in the US and the UK since the 1980s),  which serves as a preservative and a cumulative neurotoxic poison that is considered useful by some to discourage recreational use of them. There is no legal requirement in the United States to disclose to buyers that seeds have been treated with a toxic heavy metal compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunn Chace |first=Teri |date=2015 |title=Seeing Seeds: A Journey into the World of Seedheads, Pods, and Fruit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlfVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory#v=onepage&amp;q=methylmercury%20morning%20glory&amp;f=false |location=Portland OR |publisher=Timber Press |page= |isbn=1604694920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book Substances of Abuse, in addition to methylmercury, the seeds are claimed to be sometimes coated with a chemical that cannot be removed with washing that is designed to cause unpleasant physical symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain. The book states that this chemical is also toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Potter |first=James |date=2008 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=methylmercury+morning+glory |location=Redding CA |publisher=Jubilee Enterprises |page=157 |isbn=1930327463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colour change==
In ''Ipomoea tricolor'' 'Heavenly Blue', the colour of the flower changes during blossom according to an increase in [[vacuole|vacuolar]] pH.&lt;ref name="YoshidaKawachi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoshida|first1=Kumi|last2=Kawachi|first2=Miki|last3=Mori|first3=Mihoko|last4=Maeshima|first4=Masayoshi|last5=Kondo|first5=Maki|last6=Nishimura|first6=Mikio|last7=Kondo|first7=Tadao|title=The Involvement of Tonoplast Proton Pumps and Na+(K+)/H+ Exchangers in the Change of Petal Color During Flower Opening of Morning Glory, ''Ipomoea tricolor'' cv.

{{Jainism}}
[[Assam]], a state in north eastern India has had a long association with [[Jainism]]. Today the state is home to a number of Jain monuments, such as [[Jain temples]] and [[Jain tirths]].

==History==
[[Surya Pahar]] in the [[Goalpara district]] of Assam has several Jain statues and relics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TI Trade |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=mar0609/at03 |title=The Assam Tribune Online |publisher=Assamtribune.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest Jain temples in Guwahati was established in 1965 in the Fancy Bazar locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070723/asp/guwahati/story_8092452.asp |title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : Guwahati |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
Jainism is one of the smallest religions in Assam and constitutes 0.09% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcIOc0YaxGEC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=jain+community+assam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R-8zUrQLocDgA9b7gdAG&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=jain%20community%20assam&amp;f=false |title=The Peoples of Assam - Bhuban Mohan Das - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Assam has officially declared the Jain community in Assam as a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/jain-community-declared-as-minority-in-assam-113072600849_1.html |title=Jain community declared as minority in Assam |publisher=Business Standard |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assamese Jain community actively takes part in community service. They regularly organize free health camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=82414 |title=Magazine &amp;#124; Jaina Sanghas &amp;#124; Shvetambar Terapanth &amp;#124; Institutions &amp;#124; TPF Guwahati &amp;#124; 18.09.2011 ►Mega Health Checkup Camp |publisher=Herenow4u.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sèrvice dé Neu Léçons et Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 f.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Scripture lesson being read in a service of [[Nine Lessons and Carols]].]]

A '''lection''', also called the '''lesson''', is a reading from [[scripture]] in [[liturgy]].

== History ==

The custom of reading the [[Pentateuch|books of Moses]] in the [[synagogue]]s on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] is a very ancient one. Since the [[Nevi'im|prophetic books]] were written after the books of Moses, readings from them began later, and were common at the time of [[Jesus]]. This element in synagogue worship was taken over with others into the [[Christian worship|Christian divine service]], as may be gathered from passages in the [[gospel]]s such as [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] 4:16–20 and 16:29. During [[early Christianity]], readings began to be made from the writings of the [[Apostles]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]]s as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon]] developed.  Mention of this is found within the [[New Testament]] itself, for example in [[Colossians]] 4:16 and in [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|First Thessalonians]] 5:27.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Lection, Lectionary |volume=16 |page=357 |first=Frederick Edward |last=Warren |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest manuscripts of the Gospels have marginal marks, and sometimes actual interpolations, which can only be accounted for as indicating the beginnings and endings of liturgical lessons.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

From the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onwards references multiply, though the earlier references do not prove the existence of a fixed [[lectionary]] or order of lessons, but rather point the other way. [[Justin Martyr]], describing divine worship in the middle of the 2nd century says: "On the day called Sunday all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the Apostles, or the writings of the Prophets are read as long as time permits" (''Apol.'' i. cap. 67). [[Tertullian]] about half a century later makes frequent reference to the reading of Holy Scripture in public worship (''Apol.'' ~9; ''De praescript.'' 36; ''De amina'', 9).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The canons of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], written in the first half of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]] says, "Let [[presbyter]]s, [[subdeacon]]s and [[Reader (liturgy)|readers]], and all the people assemble daily in the church at time of cockcrow, and betake themselves to [[prayer]]s, to [[psalms]] and to the reading of the Scriptures, according to the command of the Apostles, until I come attend to reading" (canon xxi).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

There are traces of fixed lessons coming into existence in the course of the 3rd century. [[Origen]] refers to the [[Book of Job]] being read in [[Holy Week]] (''Commentaries on Job'', lib. i.). In the 4th century are such references are frequent. [[John Cassian]] (c. 380) states that throughout Egypt the [[Psalms]] were divided into groups of twelve, and that after each group there followed two lessons, one from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament (''De caenob. inst.'' ii. 4), implying but not absolutely stating that there was a fixed order of such lessons just as there was of the Psalms. [[Basil of Caesarea|St Basil the Great]] mentions fixed lessons on certain occasions taken from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], St [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] (Hom. xiii. ''De bapt.''). From [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]] (Horn. lxiii. in Act. etc.), and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (Tract. vi. in Joann. &amp;c.) both state that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was read in [[Lent]], Job and Jonah in [[Passion Week]], the Acts of the Apostles in [[Eastertide]], lessons on the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] on [[Good Friday]], and lessons on the [[resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] on [[Easter]] Day.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] (ii. 57, ca. 380) a service is described which is required of the church. First come two lessons from the Old Testament by a reader, the whole of the Old Testament being made use of except the books of the [[Apocrypha]]. The Psalms of [[David]] are then to be sung. Next the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] are to be read. Finally the four Gospels are to be read by a deacon or a priest. Whether the selections were [[ad libitum]] or according to a fixed table of lessons is not mentioned.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Third Council of Carthage]] (397) forbade anything but Holy Scripture to be read in church. This rule has been adhered to so far as the liturgical [[epistle]] and [[gospel]], and occasional additional lessons in the [[Roman Missal]] are concerned, but in the [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine office]], on [[feast day|feasts]] when nine lessons are read at [[matins]], only the first three lessons are taken from Holy Scripture, the next three being taken from the [[sermon]]s of [[Church Fathers|ecclesiastical writers]], and the last three from expositions of the day's gospel; but sometimes the lives or Passions of the saints, or of some particular saints, were substituted for any or all of these [[breviary]] lessons.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Nothing in the shape of a [[lectionary]] is extant older than the 8th century, though there is evidence that [[Claudianus Marnercus]] made one for the church at [[Vienna]] in 450, and that [[Musaeus the presbyter|Musaeus]] made one for the church at [[Marseille]] ca. 458.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Hindu empires rose to power following the birth of Hinduism in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Considered to be the greatest empire of its time in the world, the [[Maurya Empire]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] and [[Ashoka]] became larger than British India, diplomatically engaging with [[Greece]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Benoy Kumar. “Hindu Political Philosophy.” ''Political Science Quarterly'', vol. 33, no. 4, 1918, pp. 485.

Magas was the first-born son of the noblewoman [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice I]] and her first husband [[Philip (husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]], who had served as a military officer in the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211349/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two younger sisters: [[Antigone of Epirus]] and [[Theoxena of Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211349/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Philip was the son of Amyntas by an unnamed mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2603.html Ancient Library article: Philippus no. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084010/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2603.html |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] (Pyrrhus 4.4) implies that his father was previously married and had children, including daughters born to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I, Footnote 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211349/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip served as a military officer in the service of the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]] and was known for commanding one division of the [[phalanx]] in Alexander’s wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2006.html Ancient Library article: Magas no.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy I and Berenike I.jpg|thumb|left|Berenice I, mother of Magas, represented on a coin with her second husband, the powerful Ptolemy I Soter.]]
His mother Berenice was a noblewoman from [[Eordaia|Eordeaea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211349/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of local obscure nobleman [[Magas of Macedon|Magas]] and noblewoman [[Antigone of Macedon|Antigone]].&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, ''Who’s who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander’s empire'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Berenice’s mother was the niece of the powerful regent [[Antipater]]&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, ''Who’s who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander’s empire'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt; and was a distant collateral relative to the [[Argead dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/affilates/aff_ptolemies.htm Ptolemaic Dynasty - Affiliated Lines: The Antipatrids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100716/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/affilates/aff_ptolemies.htm |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the namesake of his maternal grandfather.

About 318 BCE, his father died of natural causes. After the death of Magas’ father, Magas’ mother took him and his siblings to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], where they were a part of the entourage of his mother’s second maternal cousin [[Eurydice of Egypt|Eurydice]]. Eurydice was then the wife of [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the first Greek [[pharaoh]] and founder of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. 

By 317 BCE, Ptolemy I fell in love with Berenice and repudiated Eurydice to marry her. His mother, through her marriage to Ptolemy, thus became an Egyptian Queen and the Queen mother of the Ptolemaic dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/be-bm/berenice/berenice_i.html Berenice I article at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Through his mother's marriage to Ptolemy, Magas was a stepson to Ptolemy; he became an Egyptian Prince living in his stepfather's court and was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. His mother bore Ptolemy three children: two daughters, [[Arsinoe II]], [[Philotera]] and the future Pharaoh [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211349/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/berenice_i_fr.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governorship and kingship of Cyrenaica==
[[File:Magas as Ptolemaic governor, first reign, circa 300-282 or 275 BC Didrachm.jpg|thumb|350px|Magas as Ptolemaic governor, first reign, circa 300 - 282/75 BC. ''Rev'': [[silphium]] and small crab symbols.]]
Around five years after the death of the Cyrenese ruler [[Ophellas]], Magas, then about 20 years old, received the governorship of Cyrenaica from the ruling Ptolemies in Egypt: his mother Queen Berenice I and his stepfather Ptolemy I.&lt;ref name="Clayman30"/&gt;

As a posthumous honor to his biological father, Magas, when he served as a priest of the Greek God [[Apollo]], had dedicated an honorific inscription proudly naming him as ‘the eponymous priest’ and ‘Magas son of Philip’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/magas_i_fr.htm Ptolemaic Genealogy: Magas of Cyrene, Footnote 2]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the death of his stepfather Ptolemy I in 283 BC, Magas tried on several occasions to wrest independence for Cyrenaica from his stepfather's successor, his maternal half-brother Ptolemy Philadelphus, until he crowned himself King around 276 BC.&lt;ref name="Clayman30"/&gt; It was the first time Cyrene had a king since [[Arcesilaus IV of Cyrene|Arcesilaus IV]] around 440 BC.&lt;ref name="Clayman30"/&gt;

[[Image:BerenikeIIOnACoinOfPtolemyIII.jpg|thumb|Berenice II was the daughter of Magas of Cyrene.]]
Magas then married [[Apama II]], his third maternal cousin and one of the daughters of [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid King]] [[Antiochus I Soter]] and [[Stratonice of Syria]]. Antiochus I used his marital alliance to foment a pact to invade Egypt. Apama II and Magas had a daughter called [[Berenice II]], who was their only child. 

Magas opened hostilities against Ptolemy II in 274 BC, attacking Egypt from the west, as Antiochus I was attacking [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Clayman30"/&gt; However, Magas had to cancel his operations due to an internal revolt of the Libyan nomad Marmaridae.&lt;ref name="Clayman30"/&gt; In the east, Antiochus I suffered defeat against the armies of Ptolemy II. Magas at least managed to maintain the independence of Cyrenaica until his death in 250 BC.  Magas betrothed his daughter Berenice II to [[Ptolemy III]], the son of Ptolemy II, as a way to seal an alliance between the two realms and secure the independence of Cyrene.&lt;ref name="Clayman"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceLUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.32 sq.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of Magas, Apama II broke the marital alliance between her daughter Berenice II and [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], the son of [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]], and proposed her daughter and the throne to [[Demetrius the Fair]], son of the [[Antigonid]] king [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]], who became the new king of Cyrene.&lt;ref name="Clayman36"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceLUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.36 sq.]&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the Antigonids strategic control of the western side of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Clayman36"/&gt; After Demetrius was assassinated by Berenice for cheating 
with her mother Apama, Berenice returned to Egypt to finally marry her original [[fiancé]], Ptolemy III Euergetes.&lt;ref name="Clayman36"/&gt;

Magas is known to have favored the arts and sciences in Cyrene, and was close to the philosophical school of the [[Cyrenaics]].&lt;ref name="Clayman"/&gt; The philosophy of the Cyrenaics under Magas evolved in a way that has similarities with [[Skepticism]], [[Epicurianism]] and also [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Clayman33"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceLUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with India==

Magas was known in name by the contemporary [[India|Indian]] Emperor [[Ashoka]], and he may have received Buddhist emissaries from India: indeed Magas is mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], as one of the recipients of Ashoka's [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[proselytism]].&lt;ref name="Clayman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400-9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]], Magas and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]])." ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of [[herbalism]], for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic Kings.&lt;ref&gt;"Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as [[Tamraparni]] and where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals." [[Edicts of Ashoka]], 2nd Rock Edict&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Asoka Kaart.gif|thumb|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of king [[Ashoka]] (260–218&amp;nbsp;BCE), according to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].]]
{{quote|Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]], '''Magas''' and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni. Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamktis, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dhamma.

Access to Insight: Readings in Theravāda Buddhism. Last accessed 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are no records of such emissaries in Western sources. However, the philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where Magas ruled in [[Cyrenaica]], is sometimes thought to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries, given the similarity of some of his teachings with Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Clayman33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and [[Alexandria]]. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited to teach."Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|INALCO]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wjW_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Anthony Preus, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p.184]&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Magas probably was quite knowledgeable about India. His father, Philip, had been a [[phalanx]] officer in the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]]. Later, Magas, having been raised in part at the Ptolemaic court, must also have received first-hand accounts of India from his stepfather Ptolemy I, a former general in Alexander's campaigns.  The predecessor of Magas in Cyrene, the Ptolemaic governor named [[Ophellas]], had also been one of the Alexander's officers in [[India]], in charge of one of his [[trireme|triremes]] during the expedition down the [[Indus River]]. Magas was probably quite acquainted with matters pertaining to India through his contacts with such veterans of the Indian campaigns.

'''Messianism''' is the belief in the advent of a [[messiah]] who acts as the [[Salvation|savior]] or liberator of a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/messianism |title= Define Messianism at Dictionary.com|accessdate= 27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religions with a [[messiah]] concept include [[Zoroastrianism]] ([[Saoshyant]]), [[Judaism]] (the [[Messiah in Judaism|Mashiach]]), [[Buddhism]] ([[Maitreya]]), [[Hinduism]] ([[Kalki]]), [[Taoism]] ([[Li Hong (Taoist eschatology)|Li Hong]]), and [[Bábism]] ([[He whom God shall make manifest]]).

{{Main|List of messiah claimants}}

===Judaism===
{{Main article|Messiah in Judaism|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}
Messiah ({{lang-he-n|משיח}}; ''mashiah'', ''moshiah'', ''mashiach'', or ''moshiach'', ("anointed [one]") is a term used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] to describe priests and kings, who were traditionally [[anointing|anointed]]. For example, [[Cyrus the Great]], the [[List of kings of Persia|King of Persia]], is referred to as "God's anointed" (Messiah) in the Bible.

In Jewish messianic tradition and [[Jewish eschatology|eschatology]], the term came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the [[Davidic line]], who will be "anointed" with [[holy anointing oil]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]]. In Standard Hebrew, the messiah is often referred to as ''Melech HaMeshiach'' ({{Hebrew|מלך המשיח}}, literally "the Anointed King."

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] and current [[Orthodox Judaism]] hold that the messiah will be an anointed one, descended from his father through the Davidic line of [[David|King David]], who will gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]] and usher in an era of peace.

Orthodox Jewish messianic movements have occasionally emerged throughout the centuries among Jewish communities worldwide. These surround various messiah claimants. However, the claimants failed to deliver the promises of redemption, and generally remained with only a handful of followers. The most popular messiah claimants were [[Simon bar Kokhba]] in 2nd century [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel]] in the 7th century [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Sabbatai Zevi]] in the 17th century Ottoman Empire (precursor to [[Sabbateans]]), [[Jacob Frank]] in 18th century Europe, [[Shukr Kuhayl I]] and [[Judah ben Shalom]] in 19th century Ottoman Yemen. There are those who currently identify the 20th century [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]]) as the [[Chabad messianism|Mashiach]]).

Other denominations, such as [[Reform Judaism]], believe in a Messianic Age when the world will be at peace, but do not agree that there will be a messiah as the leader of this era.

The Jewish messiah concept was the source of the development of later, similar messianic concepts in [[Christianity]] (originally a [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish sect]]) as [[Islam]].

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Christ|Christology|Jesus in Christianity}}
{{See also|Christian eschatology|List of people claimed to be Jesus}}
In [[Christianity]], the Messiah is called the [[Christ]] ({{IPAc-en|k|r|aɪ|s|t}}; {{Lang-el|Χριστός|lit=Anointed One|translit=Khristós}}; {{Lang-he|מָשִׁיחַ|translit=Māšîah|lit=Mashiach}}), the saviour and [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redeemer]] who would bring [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] to the [[Jewish people]] and mankind. "Christ" is the Greek translation of "Messiah", meaning "Anointed one". The role of the Christ, the Messiah in Christianity, [[Christianity and Judaism#The Messiah|originated from the concept]] of the [[messiah in Judaism]]. Though the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the split of [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|early Christianity and Judaism]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]]. [[Christian]]s believe [[Jesus]] to be the [[Jewish messiah]] (Christ) of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]].

Christians believe that the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] were fulfilled in his [[Ministry of Jesus|mission]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] to his [[Session of Christ|Session]] on the heavenly throne, where "he sat down at the right hand of God, where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet" (Heb 10:12-13 NET, quoting the Davidic royal Psalm 110:1). Christians believe that the rest of the messianic prophecies will be fulfilled in the [[Second Coming|Second coming of Christ]]. One prophecy, distinctive in both the Jewish and Christian concept of the messiah, is that a Jewish king from the [[Davidic line]], who will be "anointed" with [[holy anointing oil]], will be king of [[God's kingdom]] on earth, and rule the [[Jewish people]] and mankind during the [[Messianic Age#Christianity|Messianic Age]] and [[World to come#Christian eschatology|World to come]].

===Islam===
{{See also|Jesus in Islam|Mahdi|List of Mahdi claimants}}
In [[Islam]], ''Isa Ibn Mariam, al-Masih'' ("Jesus son of Mary, the Messiah") is believed to have been anointed from birth by [[Allah]] with the specific task of being a prophet and a king. In Islam, the [[Mahdi]] is believed to hold the task of establishing the truth and fighting against divisions of Islam, uniting all sects before the return of Jesus who will kill the false messiah ''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' (similar to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity), who will emerge shortly before him in human form in the end of the times, claiming that he is the messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|41|7023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mohammed Ali Ibn Zubair |last=Ali |url=http://www.islam.tc/prophecies/masdaj.html |title=Who is the evil Dajjal (the "anti-Christ")? |publisher=Islam.tc |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Jesus will pray for the death of [[Gog and Magog]] (Yajuj Majuj) who are an ancient tribe sealed away from humanity who will rise to cause destruction. After he has destroyed al-Dajjal, Mahdi's final task will be to become a just king and to re-establish justice. After the death of Mahdi, Jesus' reign of the messianic King will begin bringing eternal peace and monotheism in the world ending all religions besides Islam.

{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|656}}: Narrated [[Abu Hurairah]]:
{{quote|Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (Mariam) (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts)."}}

The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslim community]] believes that the prophecies regarding the advent of the Messiah and Mahdi have been fulfilled in the person of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] of Qadian. He claimed to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, the metaphorical second coming of Jesus of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Promised Messiah|url=https://www.alislam.org/topics/messiah/|website=alislam.org|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other religions ==

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|Maitreya|Buddhist eschatology|List of Buddha claimants}}
Maitreya is a [[bodhisattva]] who in the [[Buddhist]] tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and teach the pure [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya is found in the canonical literature of all Buddhist sects{{cn|date=August 2018}} ([[Theravada|Theravāda]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]]) and is accepted by most Buddhists as a statement about an actual event that will take place in the distant future.

Although Maitreya Buddha appears in the canonical literature shared by many sects of Buddhism, Buddhists in different historical contexts have conceived of Maitreya Buddha in different ways. In early medieval [[Chinese Buddhism]], for example, Taoist and Buddhist ideas combined to produce a particular emphasis on the messianic role of a Bodhisattva called "Prince Moonlight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zürcher|first=E.|title="Prince Moonlight": Messianism and Eschatology in Early Medieval Chinese Buddhism|journal=T'oung Pao|year=1982|volume=68|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Chinese Maitreyan traditions were themselves marked by considerable diversity. [[Erik Zürcher]] has argued that a certain "canonical" Maitreyan cult from the fourth to sixth centuries believed Maitreya to inhabit the [[Tushita]] heaven where Buddhists might be reborn in the very distant future. Another rival tradition, however, believed that Maitreya would appear in the imminent future in this world to provide salvation during a time of misery and decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zürcher|first=E.|title="Prince Moonlight": Messianism and Eschatology in Early Medieval Chinese Buddhism|journal=T'oung Pao|year=1982|volume=68|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter form of Maitreyan belief was generally censored and condemned as heretical to the point that few manuscripts survive written by Buddhists sympathetic to this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zürcher|first=E.|title="Prince Moonlight": Messianism and Eschatology in Early Medieval Chinese Buddhism|journal=T'oung Pao|year=1982|volume=68|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maitreya Buddha continued to be an important figure in millenarian rebellions throughout Chinese history such as in the rebellions associated with the so-called [[White Lotus]] Society.

===Cargo cults===
Some [[cargo cult]]s believe in a messiah figure called [[John Frum]].  When [[David Attenborough]] asked one of its adherents if it was rational for them to be still waiting for Frum to re-appear after 50 years, he was told that Christianity had been waiting 2,000 years, so waiting for Frum was much more rational.

===Hinduism===
{{Main article|Kalki|List of avatar claimants}}
In [[Hinduism]], Kalki ([[Devanagari]]: कल्कि; also rendered by some as ''Kalkin'' and ''Kalaki'') is the tenth and final Maha [[Avatar]]a (great incarnation) of [[Vishnu]] who will come to end the present age of darkness and destruction known as [[Kali Yuga]]. The origins of the name probably lie in the [[Sanskrit]] word "''kalka''" which refers to dirt, filth, or foulness and hence denotes the "destroyer of foulness," "destroyer of confusion," "destroyer of darkness," or "annihilator of ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismaili.net/Source/nikakalki.html The Kalki Parana]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian and Slavic messianism===
[[Romantic nationalism|Romantic]] [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] messianism held that the Slavs, especially the [[Russians]], suffer in order that other European nations, and eventually all of humanity, may be redeemed.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Messianism: Third Rome, Revolution, Communism and After, Peter J. S. Duncan, London, Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanticism|This theme]] had a profound impact in the development of [[Pan-Slavism]] and Russian and [[Soviet imperialism]]; it also appears in works by the Polish [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic]] poets [[Zygmunt Krasiński]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], including the latter's familiar expression, "''Polska Chrystusem narodów''" ("[[Christ of Europe|Poland is the Christ of the nations]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Chrostowski_Suffering.html THE SUFFERING, CHOSENNESS AND MISSION OF THE POLISH NATION, Waldemar Chrostowski], Religion in Eastern Europe, [[George Fox University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Messianic ideas appear in the "[[Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People]]" ([[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] Manifesto),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/K/O/KostomarovMykola.htm Kostomarov, Mykola] at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which universal equality and democracy in the [[Zaporizhian Sich]], recognized as a revival of human society initially planned by God and faith in its future revival, associated with faith in the death and resurrection of Christ. Reborned [[Ukraine]] will expand universal freedom and faith in all Slavic countries and thus designed by God ideal society will be restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthropos.lnu.edu.ua/jspui/bitstream/123456789/609/1/56-70_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA_%D0%A1.pdf Between The Philosophy of History and Messianism (The Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People) S.Kozak]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Around the 3rd century CE, religious [[Taoism]] developed eschatological ideas. A number of scriptures {{which|date=October 2015}} predict the end of the world cycle, the deluge, epidemics, and coming of the saviour [[Li Hong (Taoist eschatology)|Li Hong]] 李弘 (not to be confused with the [[Li Hong|Tang personalities]]).

=== Zoroastrianism ===
{{Main article|Saoshyant|Frashokereti}}
According to [[Zoroastrian]] philosophy, redacted in the [[Yasht|Zand-i Vohuman Yasht]],
{{quote|at the end of thy tenth hundredth winter [...] the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield the seed; and men [...] become more deceitful and more given to vile practices. They have no gratitude.&lt;br&gt;

Honorable wealth will all proceed to those of perverted faith [...] and a dark cloud makes the whole sky night [...] and it will rain more noxious creatures than winter.}}

[[Saoshyant]], the Man of Peace, battles the forces of evil.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The events of [[Frashokereti|the final renovation]] are described in the ''[[Bundahishn]]'' (30.1ff): "In the final battle with evil, the [[yazata|''yazata''s]] [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will 'melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river' ([[Bundahishn]] 34.18), but the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') will not be harmed."

Eventually, [[Ahura Mazda]] will triumph, and his agent Saoshyant will resurrect the dead, whose bodies will be restored to eternal perfection, and whose souls will be cleansed and reunited with God. Time will then end, and truth/righteousness (''[[asha]]'') and immortality will thereafter be everlasting.

Hoffman II, a Holocaust denier and exponent of multiple conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hoffman was born to a [[Catholic]] family in 1957 in [[Geneva, New York]].&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; His father, the chief of physical therapy at Clifton Springs Hospital, was [[German-American]].&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; His mother was [[Italian-American]].&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; According to biographical information on the back cover of his book ''Judaism Discovered'', Hoffman studied at the [[State University of New York at Oswego]] under Dr. Richard Funk and Dr. Faiz Abu-Jaber, father of [[Diana Abu-Jaber]].

Hoffman was reportedly taught at an early age about [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]], whose disappearance in 1826 resulted in the formation of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]].&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; He said that he learned from his maternal grandfather that elections in the United States were rigged by [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; From this, Hoffman was said to have deduced that "[n]othing is as it seems to be," which in turn led to a "life long vocation, researching the subterranean workings of the occult cryptocracy's orchestration of American history".&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; He has worked on the projects of [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] and of the Holocaust deniers [[Willis Carto]], [[David Irving]], [[Ernst Zündel]], and Herman Otten.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian News'', Dec. 10, 2012, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as Assistant Director of the [[Institute for Historical Review]], a Holocaust denial organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Historical Review'', vol. 6, no. 4, Spring, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He has also edited the work of alternative publisher [[Adam Parfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse Culture'' [[Feral House]], 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman claims to have operated an organic farm and to have lived among the [[Amish]] for several years. In 1995, Hoffman moved with his family to Idaho.&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; There, he hoped to establish a museum that would detail the "Communist holocaust against Christians" (i.e., the [[persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union]]), "the holocaust against the Germans", (i.e., the [[bombing of Dresden]] and other major German cities in [[World War II]]), and the "Holocaust against Japan" (i.e., the incineration of Tokyo and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]).&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt;

==Views==

===Economics===
Hoffman is the author of ''Usury in Christendom: The Mortal Sin that Was and Now is Not'' (2013), in which he argues that Jewish money-lenders have been scapegoated by gentile and Christian usurers in order to deflect attention from [[Renaissance]] [[Roman Catholic]] and late [[Protestant]] [[usury]] banking.

===Holocaust===
Hoffman has been called a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] by some sources such as [[Michael Barkun]] of [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=Barkun/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;Stephen E. Atkins, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Uj6u6b-ZIC&amp;pg=PA268 Holocaust Denial as an International Movement]'' (Praeger: 2009), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whine"&gt;Michael Whine, "The Far Right on the Internet" in ''The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring'' (ed. Brian D. Loader: Routledge, 1997), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman's one full-length work on the topic is ''The Great Holocaust Trial: The Landmark Battle for the Right to Doubt the West's Most Sacred Relic''. This book, published in 1985, rather than elaborating a Holocaust denial thesis itself, provides a sympathetic account of the 1980s Canadian trials of [[Ernst Zündel]]. At the time, Zündel was required to appear before the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] for "spreading false news", by distributing the Holocaust-denying pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' in Canada. Hoffman's book argues that Holocaust denial material should be completely legal to publish.

For a time Hoffman was the assistant director of the [[Institute for Historical Review]], known for its Holocaust denial works. Hoffman has been criticised by Stephen A. Atkins, an academic from [[Texas A&amp;M University Libraries]] who specialised in extremism and terrorism. In his 2009 book, ''Holocaust Denial as an International Movement'', Atkins claimed that Hoffman's newsletter ''Revisionist History'' promotes  Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Atkins"/&gt; Atkins also claimed in this work that Hoffman has denied the existence of the [[gas chamber]]s, advanced [[antisemitic conspiracy theories]], and contended that "the real Holocaust of World War II was deaths caused by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]."&lt;ref name="Atkins"/&gt; In the 1990s, Hoffman propagated his views online, via [[newsgroup]]s.&lt;ref name="Whine"/&gt;

===Cryptocracy===
Hoffman is the author of ''Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare'' which outlines his conspiracy theory of a [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] or "cryptocracy"&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; that gains power through manipulation of symbols and twilight language. Examples of such "psychodramas," in Hoffman's view, include [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] (which connects various centers of [[occult]] significance), and the [[Assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], in which Hoffman sees ritualistic elements.&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; The theory of masonic symbolism in the assassination of President Kennedy was first articulated by [[James Shelby Downard]], with whom Hoffman co-authored ''King/Kill-33'' which became the inspiration for a song by [[Marilyn Manson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachtkabarett.com/KennedyKingKill33|title=Kennedy: King Kill 33 - Manson, Holy Wood &amp; JFK - The NACHTKABARETT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman also states that the [[gnosis]] of this ruling cabal is slowly being revealed through movies such as ''[[They Live]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]'' and other forms of symbolic and subliminal communication.&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt; Hoffman has appeared on the [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] radio show to discuss his theories.  In a 2002 lecture in Sandpoint, Idaho, Hoffman analyzed the [[9/11]] [[terror]] attack in terms of human [[alchemy]] and [[psychological warfare]]&lt;ref&gt;''Inside the 9/11 Conspiracy'', [Audio CD, 2002].&lt;/ref&gt;

More important is his understanding of the tenets of mind control, and the fallacy that exposure of the methods of a criminal undertaking represents an important step "toward overthrowing the power of the cryptocracy." The perpetrators typically let the truth emerge—The Revelation of the Method—strengthening their hold on the subject population.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare,'' Independent History &amp; Research [2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Judaism===
{{see also|Criticism of the Talmud}}
Following on from the work of earlier Christian polemicists, such as [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger]] and [[Alexander McCaul]], Hoffman is a critic of the religion of [[Orthodox Judaism]] and has learned to read [[Hebrew]] as part of his research. In particular, Hoffman's works have taken aim at the [[Babylonian Talmud]], and that Orthodox Judaism is a racist, supremacist creed. Hoffman claims that the [[Talmud]] itself is [[anti-semitic]] in its oppressive micro-management of Jewish lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Judaism Discovered'', [2008], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman believes that most [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are not descended from the Biblical patriarchs, but from the [[Khazars]]. Examples of his hyperbole in discussing Jews; is found in his discussion of the libel charges in the case of ''[[Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt]]'' as "another revisionist weed pushing itself up through hairline cracks in the Jewish concrete that covers our planet."&lt;ref name="van Pelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Pelt|first=Robert Jan|title=The Case for Auschwitz: Evidence from the Irving Trial|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=9780253340160|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83dvJxPm--EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Robert Jan van Pelt|accessdate=March 15, 2013|chapter=Preface and Acknowledgements|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=83dvJxPm--EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote=Michael A. Hoffman II compared Irving to St. George before the dragon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mattias Gardell]]: "Antisemitism is prominent... in the worldview of Michael Hoffman II".&lt;ref name=Gardell/&gt;

===Slavery===
Hoffman is also the author of ''They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold Story of Enslavement of Whites in Early America''.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title=The Culture of Make Believe|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing Company|location=White River Junction, Vermont|isbn=9781603581837|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83dvJxPm--EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=Hoffman#v=onepage&amp;q=Hoffman&amp;f=false|authorlink=Derrick Jensen|chapter=Power|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2l39w5AtIMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Derrick Jensen]], Hoffman is "overtly racist" and "attempts to make the case that the enslavement of whites by commercial interests in Britain and the Americas was worse than the enslavement and genocide of Africans... perpetrated by those same interests."&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; Jensen said "Hoffman's analysis is seriously flawed" but that "his scholarship is impressive, and the story he tells is both interesting and horrifying".&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; In 2015, Liam Hogan writing in the British publication [[openDemocracy]] criticized Hoffman's scholarship in his essay "Irish Slaves - The Convenient Myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Liam|title='Irish slaves' - the convenient myth|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/liam-hogan/%E2%80%98irish-slaves%E2%80%99-convenient-myth|website=Open Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 1989, [[University of Texas at Austin]] student '''Mark Kilroy''' was kidnapped in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, while vacationing during [[spring break]]. He was taken by his abductors to a ranch where he was tortured and sodomized for hours before being murdered in a [[human sacrifice]] ritual. Kilroy was killed with a machete blow and then had his brain removed and boiled in a pot. His killers then inserted a wire through his backbone, chopped off his legs, and buried him at the ranch along with 14 other people who had been killed there before him. [[Adolfo Constanzo]], the leader of the cult, told his followers that human sacrifice granted them immunity from law enforcement for their drug smuggling operations. The killing drew worldwide media attention and initiated an international police manhunt because of the unusual circumstances of the crime.

After the bodies were discovered on 11 April 1989, Constanzo fled to [[Mexico City]] but was eventually tracked down. As the police surrounded his apartment complex, Constanzo died after ordering one of the cult members to kill him with a machine gun. [[Sara Aldrete]], another high-ranking member of the cult, was arrested at the scene along with several others. In 1993, the cult members were found guilty of a number of charges, including capital murder and drug trafficking. Several of them, however, claimed they were not guilty of Kilroy's murder and told the press they were [[Forced confession|tortured to confess]]. Only two suspects remain at large.

==Background==
===Victim===
Mark James Kilroy was born on 5 March 1968, in [[Chicago]], Illinois, U.S. His parents were James "Jim" William (father), a chemical engineer, and Helen Josephine (mother), a volunteer paramedic.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; They moved to [[Texas]] from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] after their son was born.&lt;ref name="59X5C" /&gt; Kilroy grew up in [[Santa Fe, Texas]], a small town outside of [[Houston]], for over 15 years along with his brother Keith Richard.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; He was raised [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and his parents were frequent attendees at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in the adjacent town of [[Hitchcock, Texas]]. Kilroy excelled both in academics and athletics as a teenager, and played baseball, basketball, and golf with his friends at school.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people" /&gt; He was in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and an honors student at [[Santa Fe High School (Texas)|Santa Fe High School]], where he was member of the student council, and was ranked 14th in a class of 210 students. Upon graduation in 1986, he attended [[Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]], before transferring to [[Tarleton State University]] in [[Stephenville, Texas]], on a basketball scholarship. At Tarleton he became a member of the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. He then decided to give up his athletics and transferred to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] to become a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student and prepare for his [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT).&lt;ref name="born" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

===Profile of cult leaders===
Kilroy's murderer, [[Adolfo Constanzo]], was a [[Cuban Americans|Cuban American]] who was born in [[Miami, Florida]], in 1962. His father died when he was an infant, so his mother relocated to Puerto Rico with him, where she remarried. They returned to Florida in 1972 and his stepfather died soon afterwards, leaving a large inheritance behind. His mother married again, this time with a man who was involved in drug trafficking and the [[occult]]. His stepfather taught him a philosophy that Constanzo carried for the rest of his life: he told him that he should let nonbelievers "kill themselves with drugs" while he could profit from their foolishness. Around the same time, Constanzo's mother believed that her son had psychic abilities.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}}&lt;ref name="CkwbC" /&gt; She introduced him to [[Palo (religion)|Palo Mayombe]], an Afro-Caribbean religion that involves animal sacrifice.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} He also was introduced to [[Santería]] when he was younger.{{efn|Other sources state that Santería was erroneously associated with Constanzo and that it was strictly Palo Mayombe.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=164&amp;ndash;167}}&lt;ref name="YoKYx" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Snow|2003|p=49&amp;ndash;52}} He started as a "palero", someone who practices Palo Mayombe, and eventually reached the status of high-priest, "padrino".&lt;ref name="OE2JL" /&gt; In 1984, he moved to Mexico City to start his life as a [[Tarotology|tarot card reader]] and eventually developed a cult following.{{sfn|Perlmutter|2003|p=224}} His psychic talent, charisma, and physical attractiveness (he previously worked as a male model) granted him the opportunity to mingle with Mexico City's upper class.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=425&amp;ndash;428}} His reputation for [[Prediction|predicting the future]] and offering [[Ritual purification|ritual cleansing]] became popular with some drug dealers, musicians, and police officers.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}}&lt;ref name="R2Wgq" /&gt;

The other cult leader was [[Sara Aldrete]], a honors student and cheerleader at [[Texas Southmost College]].&lt;ref name="3qdyd" /&gt; She was the girlfriend of Gilberto Sosa, a drug dealer linked to the Hernández clan that Constanzo wanted an introduction to.{{sfn|Little, Brown Book Group|2006|p=386}}&lt;ref name="rememberingbville" /&gt; In 1987, she met Constanzo and eventually became the cult's main recruiter.{{efn|Another source stated that Aldrete met Constanzo in 1988.&lt;ref name="wUcCG" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Cu3aj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zSgcJ" /&gt; Investigators believed that Aldrete's physical attractiveness and charm helped her lure men to join the cult or to set them up to get abducted and killed.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=425&amp;ndash;428}}  She recruited people by first showing them the 1987 thriller film ''[[The Believers]]'', which was about a New York City-based cult that practiced human sacrifice for money and influence.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Constanzo's members were forced to see the film again and again in order to indoctrinate them to the necessity of human sacrifice.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=164&amp;ndash;167}} Students and teachers at her college in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] recalled her as a friendly and studious physical education student who showed no signs of abnormal behavior or involvement with a religious cult.&lt;ref name="Fat7f" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usbp7" /&gt; Across the border in Matamoros, however, Aldrete was involved in drug smuggling operations and in cult activities. Some of her former classmates found it suspicious that she drove a 1989 vehicle with an embedded telephone, while others recall she preferred to dress in black. Investigators believed that her proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border allowed for Aldrete to keep her two lives separate for years.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Because of her contradictory lifestyle, law enforcement believed that Aldrete was living a [[Alter ego|double life]] and showed signs and symptoms of having a [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="am1F7" /&gt;{{sfn|Ross|1995|p=70}}

The ranch where Kilroy was murdered in Matamoros, Santa Elena, was owned by Brigido Hernández. He was not a follower of Constanzo and was not charged with any crimes in the U.S. or Mexico.&lt;ref name="UMKHf" /&gt; The sudden death of Saul Hernandez in a shooting prompted his family, including Elio and his brothers Serafín Sr. and Ovidio, to grow closer to rituals and eventually become members of Constanzo's cult.&lt;ref name="hernandezfam1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="innocenteshoracero" /&gt; Elio reportedly offered Constanzo half of his family's drug proceeds in exchange for his criminal contacts and supernatural protection for his family.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=100&amp;ndash;102}}

==Spring break trip==
===Prior to disappearance===
On 10 March 1989, Kilroy's childhood friend Bradley Moore finished exams early at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and headed to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to pick him up. Both of them then headed to Santa Fe to pick up two other friends, Bill Huddleston and Brent Martin, before heading to [[South Padre Island, Texas]] for spring break. After a foggy, 9-hour drive to South Texas, they arrived at South Padre Island shortly before midnight.{{efn|Another source stated that they arrived to South Padre Island, Texas on 11 May.&lt;ref name="UfZmD" /&gt;}} They checked in at the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]] the next morning before heading to the beach. When they first got to South Padre Island, there was not a huge crowd of people because it was barely the first weekend out of a five-week spring break season. But thousands of students from the entire U.S. were beginning to arrive as the weekend progressed. Beer sponsors were staging a variety of entertainment events, including free movies, music concerts, calls home, surf-simulator activities, and opportunities to appear on TV commercials. Kilroy and Bradley made free phone calls to their parents that day. Later that evening, they met a group of female students from [[Purdue University]] and partied until the next morning.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

The following morning, Kilroy and his friends had more or less a daily routine in mind. They went to the beach in the morning and suntanned before lunch. After lunch they went to the beach area behind their hotel for a daily Miss Tanline contest. Once the event was over that afternoon, Kilroy headed to the hotel for a quick nap before planning their trip to Mexico. They left South Padre Island that evening and stopped for dinner at a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in [[Port Isabel, Texas]], where they met a group of female students from [[University of Kansas]] who were planning to party in Mexico as well. The girls then followed Brent's car from Port Isabel to Brownsville and parked their cars close to the [[Gateway International Bridge]] before crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by foot. Kilroy's friends and the Kansas girls spent most of their evening at Sergeant Pepper's night club in Matamoros before the groups went their separate ways. Kilroy and his friends then returned to South Padre Island early the next morning. On 13 March, Kilroy and his friends attended another Miss Tanline contest behind the Sheraton. Early in the evening, Kilroy met with one of his former frat brothers at a condo party. At around 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. CT, Kilroy and his friends headed back to Matamoros. They parked on the border and crossed by foot again.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

That night, Matamoros was flooded with 15,000 spring tourists from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, Álvaro Obregón. The sidewalks, street, and night clubs were packed with foreign tourists looking to enjoy cheap alcohol and enjoy Mexico's lax drinking laws.{{efn|According to Mexican law, the legal age for drinking is 18. However, it is rare for alcohol sellers to ask for an ID or deny a purchase.&lt;ref name="khQgZ" /&gt; Drinking in public is also illegal but rarely enforced, especially for tourists on spring break in Matamoros.{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=9&amp;ndash;10}}}} When they got to Matamoros, Kilroy and his friends decided to go to the bar with the shortest waiting line.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=9&amp;ndash;10}} They ended up at Los Sombreros, a bar with rock music and bright neon. After a few drinks, Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Café for spring break. This bar was louder and wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony. Kilroy met with a few girls at the bar and was not seen by his friends for a while. Around 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. CT, Bill suggested the group head back to South Padre Island. As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across Álvaro Obregón street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends to walk across the border uninterrupted and in a group.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Tillman|2016|p=20&amp;ndash;22}}

===Kidnapping and murder===
Bradley and Brent separated from the group and walked to García's, a popular restaurant-store close to the border.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Maril|2006|p=134&amp;ndash;135}} Kilroy stopped at the steps of a house on Álvaro Obregón to say good-bye to the girl from Miss Tanline. He then waited for Bill to walk towards him. Bill then ran to a nearby alley to urinate while Kilroy waited for him.{{efn|Other sources mentioned Bill urinated behind a tree at a small park or in a nearby restroom.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytceremony" /&gt;}} By the time Bill came out and caught up to the other two near García's, Kilroy had vanished.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt; "Hey, Mark, stop fucking around", Bill said, but Kilroy was nowhere to be found.{{sfn|Shreeve|2015|p=11&amp;ndash;15}} His friends searched for him for hours, even after the establishments had closed and the streets had cleared at around 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. CT. They then crossed the border thinking Kilroy may have crossed to Brownsville and was perhaps waiting near their parked car.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagoreveler" /&gt; His friends did not find him near their car and waited a few minutes in Brownsville before heading to South Padre Island. They thought that Kilroy probably left to the hotel with someone else. They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.{{efn|Another source states that the friends contacted Kilroy's parents first, who then contacted the police.{{sfn|Snow|2003|p=49&amp;ndash;52}}}}&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

As Kilroy stood on the street, he was lured by a man parked inside a red truck who apparently called him and asked him if he needed a ride.{{efn|A minority version of the story suggests that Kilroy was lured by the cult members because they offered him drugs and sex. This version contradicts the image of Kilroy in the U.S. media as "an innocent: a clean-cut, sturdy American college student".{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=81}}}} As he got close to the vehicle, Kilroy was grabbed by two men, Serafín Hernández García and Malio Fabio Ponce Torres,{{efn|His name is also spelled as Mario Fabio Ponce Torres by other sources.{{sfn|Provost|1989|p=206}}}} and wrestled inside the truck.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Because of his size and athletic strength, Kilroy was able to break loose about two blocks down the road after one of the gangsters stopped for a few moments to catch his breath. Kilroy ran from the truck but was eventually intercepted by another vehicle driven by the gangsters' allies and taken at gunpoint.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CCEVR" /&gt; He was then subdued and handcuffed in the back of the second car.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=419&amp;ndash;420}}

The gangsters drove Kilroy through the back streets of the city and past an industrial area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Constanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

Throughout the night, Kilroy was tortured and sodomized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was then led out to the field and Constanzo killed him by chopping the back of his neck and head with a [[machete]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; His brain was then boiled in a [[nganga#In the Americas|nganga]], an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}} Kilroy's legs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed.{{sfn|Kilroy|Stewart|1990|p=111}} The cult members then dug a hole on the grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

==Investigation==
The search for Kilroy initially began as a routine missing persons investigation. Students that were reported missing in Matamoros in the past would often turn up in the following days with a hangover and blurry memory of what had happened to them.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Kilroy was one of the 60 people who had disappeared in Matamoros in the first three months of 1989. However, his case drew more attention in the U.S. because his uncle, Ken Kilroy, worked at the [[United States Customs Service]] in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Kilroy|Stewart|1990|p=26}}&lt;ref name="tlmEi" /&gt; When the news reached his uncle, a police task force was created in Brownsville to search for Kilroy. Alarmed with the bad publicity of his disappearance and the potential effects of tourism in Matamoros, local police officers tried to shift the blame and suggested that Kilroy had disappeared in Brownsville. Kilroy's friends denied such claims.{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=9&amp;ndash;10}} The Mexican federal police force vowed to work on the case and help U.S. investigators. One of the commanders assigned Mexican agents to U.S. officials to accompany them in Matamoros. Together they questioned informants, potential witnesses, and worked on tips provided by their sources.{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=11&amp;ndash;12}}

Both Mexican and U.S. authorities suspected that Kilroy's disappearance was some sort of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short on leads to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=409&amp;ndash;411}} Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist to see if he could figure out some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue plaid shirt and with a visible scar across his face talking to Kilroy before he disappeared.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" though Bill said he was not sure if Kilroy responded back.&lt;ref name="chicagoreveler" /&gt; However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared.&lt;ref name="nytceremony" /&gt; Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the [[United States Border Patrol]] were called to look on the [[Rio Grande|Rio Grande River]], but his body was not found.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=412&amp;ndash;414}}

During the investigation, Kilroy's parents headed to the [[Rio Grande Valley]] and circulated more than 20,000 handouts throughout the region, and offered a $15,000 reward to anyone who could help locate their son. They met with [[State attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Jim Mattox]], [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[Bill Clements|William Clements]], and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] to assist them on the case.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Texan officials told Kilroy's parents that they were planning to talk to [[Governor of Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas Governor]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Américo Villarreal Guerra|es}} and get people from Matamoros more involved in their son's disappearance.&lt;ref name="UZCms" /&gt; People from Kilroy's hometown travelled to Matamoros and issued fliers looking for him and offering a reward to anyone who could provide information on his safe return.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=412&amp;ndash;414}} U.S. authorities had praised the efforts of the Mexican federal police on the case, but they distrusted the state and municipal officials. They suspected that because state and local authorities were acting slowly and not sharing enough information, Kilroy's murderers had insiders within their ranks.&lt;ref name="f57Sw" /&gt;

On 26 March, the case was highlighted on national television in the crime show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''. This gave the case nationwide notoriety and generated several phone calls and letters with people giving clues on Kilroy's whereabouts. However, the police stated that none of the leads generated were solid enough to pursue. A few days later, Kilroy's parents returned to Santa Fe.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Santa Fe residents raised money through garage sales and car washes to help Kilroy's family continue their search.&lt;ref name="NpiuK" /&gt; In addition, Kilroy's parents went to the University of Texas at Austin to withdraw their son from school.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

===Investigation tightens===
On 1 April 1989, Mexican state authorities were stationed at a routine checkpoint near Santa Elena when they saw a vehicle that ran through the checkpoint without stopping.{{efn|Investigators later revealed that the checkpoint was set up because U.S. Customs agents alerted the Mexican federal police that drugs had been introduced to Brownsville from this part of Matamoros.&lt;ref name="rememberingbville" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}}  The vehicle had crossed the international border from Texas and sped through [[Mexican Federal Highway 2]], which connects Matamoros and [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]].{{sfn|Doreste|1995|p=49}}{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=414}} The man driving the vehicle was Serafín, who had kidnapped Kilroy weeks earlier.{{efn|Another source states that the driver was David Serna Valdez.&lt;ref name="seized" /&gt;}} Instead of turning on their police sirens, the police decided to follow the truck using an unmarked vehicle. They were then led to the ranch and pulled off at a distance. After about 30 minutes, Serafín took off from the ranch and headed back to the city. The officers decided to make their move to the ranch.{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=11&amp;ndash;12}}  In a quick search, the police discovered cult paraphernalia and marijuana traces.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}} Instead of arresting Serafín, the police decided to continue gathering more evidences on the suspected criminal activities at the ranch and the organized crime members involved with the Hernández family. They used informants in Matamoros to inquire on "family" activities at Santa Elena, in order to make a series of crucial arrests.{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=15&amp;ndash;16}}

On 9 April, they returned with several other policemen and arrested Serafín, his uncle Elio, cult members David Serna Valdez and Sergio Martínez Salinas, and Domingo Reyes Bustamante, the ranch's caretaker.{{efn|The reason why the police took several days to return to the ranch was because they needed a [[search warrant]].{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=414}}}}&lt;ref name="R0scx" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seized" /&gt; While in custody, the detainees were very relaxed. They were sent to prison while the police interrogated a caretaker at the ranch. This person revealed to the police that the ranch had frequent visitors from Serafín's criminal group.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}} The ranch's caretaker identified Kilroy through a photograph and stated that he saw him at the ranch.&lt;ref name="coo8H" /&gt; "Yeah", the caretaker told the police. "I saw him", and then pointed at the shack at the ranch.{{sfn|Shreeve|2015|p=11&amp;ndash;15}}

When the police interrogated Serafín separately, he confessed to aiding in Kilroy's murder and that other people were killed over the course of several months at Santa Elena.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}} Serafín then identified Constanzo and Aldrete as the heads of the group. He said that Constanzo had ordered the slayings as part of a sacrificial ritual. Constanzo believed that by sacrificing his victims, those doing the sacrifice were ensured strength, abundance, and immunity from law enforcement and injury.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=121&amp;ndash;122}} Specifically, he said that Kilroy was chosen at random because Constanzo had ordered his men to find a [[White Americans|white]], [[Anglo]] male (Spanish: [[gringo]]) to sacrifice.{{efn|Sources disagree on the reasons why Constanzo ordered his sacrifice. One source states that Constanzo told his cult members that killing a white person and boiling his brain would give him the powers to cast spells.&lt;ref name="FMFZS" /&gt; Other sources stated that Kilroy was killed because the group believed that by removing his brain, they would gain his intelligence.{{sfn|Miletich|2003|p=18}}{{sfn|Fox|Levin|2005|p=123&amp;ndash;124}} Other sources stated he was killed because the group was looking for someone who resembled Constanzo, their cult leader.{{sfn|Fox|1994|p=108}} Another source stated he was killed because Constanzo believed that he needed a "special" sacrifice to ensure success for a major drug smuggling operation he was conducting.{{sfn|Little, Brown Book Group|2006|p=389}} Another source stated that Constanzo killed Kilroy because he believed that his death protected him from the U.S. police.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=422}}}}&lt;ref name="PCJ4W" /&gt; He said that Kilroy was killed by Constanzo with a machete blow and that his body was buried at the ranch.&lt;ref name="t2EWP" /&gt; Serafín agreed to take the police to the exact spot where Kilroy was buried, which was marked by a wire piece coming out of the dirt. He stated that the wire was attached to Kilroy's spinal cord so they would be able pull out the bones and wear them as necklaces after the body decomposed.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}}

===Remains discovered===
On 11 April, the police took Serafín and the four other suspects to Santa Elena and asked Serafín to show the police where Kilroy's and others' remains were kept. That afternoon, they were forced at gunpoint to spend several hours digging up the graves. Once Kilroy's corpse had been exhumed, the police observed that his legs were missing; Serafín explained that the amputations were not a procedure of the ritual, but were done to simplify burial.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Kosh|2014|p=123&amp;ndash;125}}

After the excavation concluded, the suspects had unearthed 15 mutilated bodies including Kilroy's, all males who had been killed over a period of nine months.{{efn|Three of the 15 bodies were found in Los Leones, another ranch next to Santa Elena and owned by the Hernández clan.{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=77}} Another source stated that two additional bodies were found in Santa Librada, a ranch close to the murder scene, but did not confirm if they were part of the killings at Santa Elena.{{sfn|Doreste|1995|p=53}}}}&lt;ref name="vIcUI" /&gt; Kilroy's corpse was officially identified after the Brownsville police matched his dental records with the teeth found at the scene.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=419&amp;ndash;420}} Investigators concluded that most of the victims were rival drug dealers of Constanzo and not random sacrificial victims of the cult.{{efn|Family members of two victims stated that they their deceased relatives were not involved in any drug trafficking activities.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=430}}}}&lt;ref name="mostrivals" /&gt; Three out of the 15 bodies were never identified.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} At Santa Elena, the Mexican police also seized 110&amp;nbsp;kg (243 lb) of marijuana, 108 grams of cocaine, 12 firearms including three submachine guns, and 11 vehicles, some equipped with telephones.&lt;ref name="seized" /&gt; Inside an iron pot, investigators discovered remains of human brain, a goat's head, chicken feet, a turtle, several herbs, a horseshoe, and coins mixed with animal blood. They found no signs of [[cannibalism]].{{efn|Some media outlets mentioned that Constanzo's cult practiced cannibalism. This information was false.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2015|p=123&amp;ndash;125}}}}&lt;ref name="oNvCV" /&gt;

On 12 April, the detainees were taken to the headquarters of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference.&lt;ref name="hW9ml" /&gt; More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras zoomed in on the suspects, Elio showed his membership scars on his shoulders, back, arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people" /&gt; The marks were given to selected cult members with the authority to perform human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="prisoners" /&gt;

====Reactions====
On 13 April, a religious ceremony initially intended to revive hope for Kilroy's safe return turned into a memorial service a day after his body was discovered. The service was held at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Santa Fe. Many local residents attended the service and about 150 children pinned yellow ribbons outside the church's trees to rally in favor of Kilroy. After the ceremony, Kilroy's friends stated that they wished they had stayed in Texas to party instead of going to Mexico.&lt;ref name="nytceremony" /&gt; At St. Luke Catholic Church in Brownsville, over 1,200 people attended a memorial service to support Kilroy's parents. Several of the attendees wore yellow ribbons with "Miss you Mark" written on them, and waited in line after the service was over to express their condolences to Kilroy's parents.&lt;ref name="3lKtp" /&gt; The Kilroy family showed deep faith and conviction while speaking to the press. Kilroy's father spoke about the murder and told the press that they were not angry with the killers. He hoped that if and when those responsible for Kilroy's death go to heaven and see their son, they can apologize to him for their wrongdoing. Kilroy's mother told others to pray for the murderers.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;

On 15 April, Kilroy's parents met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[William Bennett]], who headed the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. They told the politicians that for every drug consumer, there is a victim who suffers from their addiction. In addition, he stated that drug consumption should be treated with better education, and that the use of drugs, even casually, causes suffering. Bush described the case as "very sensitive", and Bennett stated that Kilroy's murder was mourned nationwide but that the parents were able to turn their suffering to a "very good effort". After the meeting, the parents stated that although Bush and Bennett were not specific on the actions their administration would take to fight drugs and enforce it at a local, state, and federal level, they were satisfied that the government was looking in the "right direction". They praised the efforts of the government in asking citizens what could be done to improve their country. Kilroy's father concluded that change required the government to do its part, but that it also required every citizen of the country to put in their effort to make it happen.&lt;ref name="JByhz" /&gt;

Two weeks after the bodies were exhumed from Santa Elena, the Mexican Federal Police returned to the ranch early in the morning to burn down the shack and lay a wooden cross above the ashes.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Reportedly, the police took a [[curandero]] (folk-healer) to purify the shack before burning it down. The curandero went inside the house, said a few prayers, sprinkled the floor with salt, and concluded by making the [[sign of the cross]]. The policemen then proceeded to spray gasoline around the shack before setting it on fire.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;{{sfn|Peters|1998|p=237}} The Mexican government offered no official explanation for their actions, but a source close to the investigation stated that the police's motives were supernatural in nature. They said that they knew the shack meant a lot to Constanzo and burning it would make him go insane; "[We] would hit him where it hurts", the police said.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; The next morning, Constanzo reportedly went into a rage after the arson was shown on national television.{{sfn|Shreeve|2015|p=11&amp;ndash;15}}

==Manhunt for cult members==
By murdering Kilroy, Constanzo prompted the downfall of his cult. He attracted international attention and forced the Mexican government to focus their efforts on bringing him, and those involved, to justice.&lt;ref name="QpmJN" /&gt; On 11 April 1989, the day the bodies were exhumed from Santa Elena, Constanzo fled to a [[Holiday Inn]] in Brownsville before flying from [[McAllen, Texas]] to [[Mexico City]], where he had an apartment.&lt;ref name="PWooB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KEXel" /&gt; He escaped with Aldrete, Martín Quintana Rodríguez, Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, and [[Álvaro de León Valdés]] ("El Duby").{{efn|His maternal surname is sometimes spelled as "Valdez".&lt;ref name="usKjj" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Little, Brown Book Group|2006|p=390}}

U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agencies carried out an international manhunt to locate Constanzo and the rest of his cult members. The police believed that Constanzo had possibly fled to Miami to visit his mother, but Constanzo opted for Mexico City, where he hid with several of his followers for short periods of time.{{sfn|Little, Brown Book Group|2006|p=390}} Rumors began to surface that Constanzo was seen in [[Chicago]], Illinois;{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} other rumors suggested that Aldrete was spotted in schools throughout the [[Rio Grande Valley]] and that she had vowed to kidnap children for every jailed cult member.{{efn|Orea Ochoa confessed to the press that Constanzo had ordered the killing of infants and children since 1983.&lt;ref name="nbKPV" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=306&amp;ndash;308}} A convenience store clerk in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], called the police and told them that he had seen a couple matching the description of Constanzo and Aldrete stopping at his store to purchase something.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=432&amp;ndash;433}} According to investigators, Constanzo was last seen driving a 1989 Mercedes Benz in Brownsville.&lt;ref name="UiZgR" /&gt; In Matamoros, law enforcement raided Aldrete's house, where they discovered an altar and several religious images. They also stated that the house's interior was covered with blood.&lt;ref name="rFpnP" /&gt; In the [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]] sheriff's office, authorities released a wanted poster of Constanzo stating that he was "extremely dangerous",&lt;ref name="6p5lW" /&gt; and indicted him and Aldrete for aggravated kidnapping.&lt;ref name="serafinsr" /&gt; Both were also indicted by a state jury in [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]], along with 11 other cult members from Contanzo's organization, for importing marijuana, conspiracy to import marijuana, conspiracy to possess with the intent of distributing, and possession with the intent of distributing.{{efn|An FBI agent stated that the purpose of the drug indictments was to create a probable cause for a legal arrest in the U.S., so they could be extradited to Mexico for murder.&lt;ref name="closedin1" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="QI5W5" /&gt; Cameron County officials also issued arrest warrants for the other cult members who were at large.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=422}} Although none of the leads proved successful, the police encouraged citizens to continue helping them in their search.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=432&amp;ndash;433}}

On 17 April, Serafín Hernández Rivera Sr., a Brownsville native, was arrested in Houston by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] agents. Federal charges were filed against him for importing marijuana, possession, and conspiracy. Two other men implicated with him were Quintana Rodríguez and Ponce Torres, both Mexican citizens.&lt;ref name="serafinsr" /&gt; As the police searched his Houston home, they seized cash and weapons, but found no evidence of any cult paraphernalia or leads pointing to Constanzo. Houston police believed that Constanzo was probably hiding in Houston because he was linked to a $20 million failed cocaine operation that was busted there in June 1988. When the house was raided, investigators found ritualistic candles, an altar, and paperwork with Rivera's name on it. The police believed that Constanzo bought several properties across Houston in the past and were investigating if he had visited any of his alleged hangouts. Serafín Sr. cooperated with U.S. officials and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was released in June 1990 and returned to Brownsville.&lt;ref name="searchprop" /&gt;{{sfn|Humes|2014|p=306&amp;ndash;308}}

On 17 April in Mexico City, the police raided one of Constanzo's properties in [[Ciudad López Mateos|Atizapán]]. They discovered piles of homosexual pornography and a hidden ritual chamber with an altar.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} This prompted the police to question people in Mexico City's homosexual community to see if they had any leads on Constanzo's whereabouts.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=432&amp;ndash;433}} The Mexican police stated that no evidence was found at the scene to link Constanzo or his men to any murders committed there. They said they saw altars and other ritualistic belongings, but did not find any traces of blood.&lt;ref name="searchprop" /&gt; No men were arrested at the scene, but the police managed to arrest a lady called María Teresa Quintana Rodríguez, sister of one of Constanzo's lovers and henchmen. The police also discovered that Aldrete's purse and other belongings were left behind, which prompted them to conclude that Constanzo probably murdered her because she knew too much about the inner workings of his cult group.&lt;ref name="gGIps" /&gt;{{sfn|Nash|2004|p=1159&amp;ndash;1162}} The police stated that they did not see Aldrete with the group when they arrived in Mexico City. They thought that Constanzo might have buried her somewhere in the city.&lt;ref name="l0zvT" /&gt; U.S. authorities, however, believed that Aldrete purposely left her belongings behind to confuse investigators and make it appear that she was dead.&lt;ref name="mostrivals" /&gt; On 24 April, the police arrested Víctor Manuel Antúnez Flores and Salvador Antonio Villaluz, who were hiding in one of Constanzo's properties in [[Colonia Juárez, Mexico City|Juárez]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="6Z17o" /&gt;

===Death of Constanzo===
The [[Law enforcement in Mexico City|Mexico City police department]] noticed that the Matamoros killings were similar to murders carried out in Mexico City between 1987 and 1989.{{sfn|Shreeve|2015|p=16&amp;ndash;20}} After consulting local witchcraft practitioners and sorcerers, the police heard that Constanzo was probably hiding in [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc]], one of the city's boroughs. Another contact told the police that there was an address of interest in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Verónica Anzures|es}} neighborhood, next to Cuauhtémoc. The police department sent 16 officers to search the area. At a supermarket, they interrogated a shoemaker who claimed to have seen a woman who matched Aldrete's description. The police then spotted a man at the supermarket who was attempting to buy large amounts of groceries with U.S. dollars. They followed the man and saw that he was living at an apartment on Río Sena. By the end of the week, the police concluded that the man was De León and that he was buying groceries for Constanzo. On 6 May 1989, the police surrounded the building and waited for traffic to subside before raiding the premises. However, a black vehicle pulled up in front of the apartment complex and the police walked over to investigate. Constanzo noticed the police from the window of his apartment and opened fire at the officers who were at ground level.{{efn|Another source states that the police were in the area for an unrelated reason. They were searching for a missing child and Constanzo shot at them from his apartment.{{sfn|Shreeve|2015|p=16&amp;ndash;20}}}} Constanzo threw golden coins and paper money from the window, and burned some of his money on a stove. Constanzo eventually ran out of ammunition and began to lose his patience. After about 45 minutes, and worried of his imminent capture, Constanzo ordered De León to kill him and Quintana Rodríguez.&lt;ref name="charisma" /&gt;{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=100&amp;ndash;102}}

De León hesitated at the beginning, but Constanzo hit him in the face and told him that he would suffer in hell if he did not do as he commanded. Constanzo then hugged Quintana Rodríguez, and De León stood in front of them before he opened fire and killed the two with a machine gun inside a closet. When the police climbed up the stairs and made it to Constanzo's smoke-filled apartment, Aldrete ran from the door screaming that Constanzo was dead.&lt;ref name="charisma" /&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} De León later confessed that Constanzo had lost his mind and was saying that "everything was lost" and that "no one was going to have [his] money" when the police raid forced him to barricade himself in his apartment.&lt;ref name="f6RFn" /&gt; He also stated that he participated in Kilroy's murder and in other killings at Santa Elena, but both agreed that Constanzo did most of the killings himself. Aldrete denied participation in the killings and stated that she was unaware of them until she saw the victims on national television. She said she was sorry to hear about Kilroy's murder. She stated that she was not an official member of the cult and was barely going through the initiation. In addition, she stated she was held prisoner during Constanzo's hiding in Mexico City.{{efn|Aldrete claimed to have thrown a written note from Constanzo's apartment saying she was being held prisoner and asked whoever read it to call the police.&lt;ref name="b5JQk" /&gt;}} When asked if she was in love with Constanzo, she denied it and said that she was only his follower.&lt;ref name="prisoners" /&gt;&lt;ref name="closedin1" /&gt;

At the scene, the police took Aldrete, De León, Orea Ochoa, Juan Carlos Fragoso, and Jorge Montes into custody.{{efn|Montes is also known as Salvador Antonio Gutiérrez Juárez. Another source states he was arrested on 10 May in [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="q3yp3" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="qU06P" /&gt; The police also arrested María de Lourdes Güero López and María del Rocío Cuevas Guerra, other cultists under Constanzo, in Mexico City later that day. They were renting one of Constanzo's apartments. The individuals arrested that day were held for homicide, criminal association, wounding an officer, and damage to property.&lt;ref name="closedin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNoXf" /&gt; Fearing that Constanzo might have purposely faked his own death, investigators conducted fingerprint analysis. They concluded that the corpse was indeed Constanzo's.{{sfn|Mandelsberg|1991|p=437}} Constanzo's 9mm [[Uzi]] submachine gun and his supposed suitcase were never formally presented by the police as seized items.{{sfn|Arellano|1992|p=74&amp;ndash;75}} On 15 May, a judge refused to set bail for the individuals arrested that day because they were wanted for crimes accumulating over 50 years in prison.&lt;ref name="qwWlC" /&gt;

==Criminal sentences==
On 27 August 1989, Orea Ochoa was admitted to a hospital in {{Interlanguage link multi|Santa Martha Acatitla|es}} after being diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].{{efn|According to Sara Aldrete's autobiography, Orea Ochoa was injected with the virus while in prison and told her that he did not have HIV/AIDS prior to that.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=63&amp;ndash;64}}}} The police said that he and Aldrete were Constanzo's lovers, but that Aldrete showed no signs of the disease in her immune system.&lt;ref name="Zrsak" /&gt; He died on 11 February 1990.&lt;ref name="IMptB" /&gt;

On 2 June 1989, Salvador Vidal García Alarcón, a police chief of the [[Federal Judicial Police]], was indicted for drug trafficking. He was linked to Constanzo by Aldrete and other cult members who claimed he acted as the group's contact in the police. Aldrete said that Constanzo told her that he had killed two men to favor García Alarcón. The police chief, however, defended his stance and stated that Alarcón's involvement with Constanzo was merely religious; he said that he was possessed with spirits at a young age and sought Constanzo for help. He was not charged with Kilroy's murder or for any other killings conducted by Constanzo's group.&lt;ref name="yGdLL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="e3ZgF" /&gt;

In August 1990, De León was sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing Constanzo and Quintana Rodríguez. Fragosa and Montes were convicted of a separate murder charge and sentenced to 35 years in prison.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=51&amp;ndash;54}} Reyes Bustamante, the ranch caretaker, was accused in court of [[cover-up]]; he was released from prison on 11 December 1990, after paying a bond of US$500.&lt;ref name="50G2G" /&gt;

On 10 June 1993, drug trafficking charges against Ovidio and Ponce Torres were dropped in the U.S without a stated reason.&lt;ref name="atlarge" /&gt; On 3 May 1994, Aldrete was sentenced to 62 years in prison. Cult members Elio, Serafín Jr., Martínez Salinas, and Serna Valdez, received 67 years each. In an interview with the press, Kilroy's parents stated that they were relieved to hear that the cultists were sentenced.&lt;ref name="SxoYT" /&gt; The charges were multiple homicide (31 years), possession of narcotics (12 years), involvement in organized crime (5 years), police impersonation (2 years), illegal body desecration (2 years), illegal possession of firearms (10 years), and illegal possession of weapons exclusive to the [[Mexican Armed Forces]] (5 years). The Mexican federal judge explained that the reason Aldrete received fewer years in prison than the rest was because she was not charged with using weapons that were military-exclusive, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence. He also stated that the maximum conviction a person in Mexico can receive for [[capital murder]] is 50 years. Since Mexico's judicial system does not have [[parole]], it allows for prisoners to file motions at an appeal court to reduce their sentences after several years. If this condition is denied or granted, inmates can then push for a [[Recurso de amparo|writ of ''amparo'']].&lt;ref name="RbU6s" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xmc8D" /&gt;

On 27 March 1998, a Mexican federal court reduced the sentences of Elio, Serna Valdez, and Martínez Salinas by 17 years, lowering their sentences from 67 total years to 50.&lt;ref name="DT3Yx" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reduced" /&gt; Since the [[Capital punishment in Mexico|death penalty]] and [[Life imprisonment in Mexico|life sentences]] are not part of Mexico's judicial system, reductions for charges that are over 50 years are common. In addition, individuals like the cult members, who were charged with murder and other serious crimes that push the total punishment sum above 50 years for capital murder, often have their sentences reduced by an appeal court. If the individuals were first-time offenders, as the cult members were, an appeals court may determine that it is reasonable to reduce their sentences. Elio was sent to a prison in [[Ciudad Victoria|Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas]]. The other two were sent to [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] in [[Almoloya de Juárez|Almoloya, State of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="reduced" /&gt;

As of 2009, only two suspects remained at large, Ovidio and Ponce Torres, and were wanted for Kilroy's murder in Mexico.{{efn|Ponce Torres was once pulled over by sheriff deputies in Brownsville who were investigating a house. He was allowed to go freely. His name had not yet been shared with them by Mexican authorities.&lt;ref name="rememberingbville" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="atlarge" /&gt;

===Claims of innocence===
Aldrete spoke to the press in 2003 and denied her participation in Kilroy's murder and in the cult killings. She stated that it was impossible for investigators to understand what had happened at Santa Elena because the biggest evidence in the case, Constanzo, was dead. Aldrete also stated that the police hid the names of famous people involved with Constanzo for their own convenience. She concluded by stating that she believed in God and was not going to ask society for forgiveness because she was innocent of the crimes.&lt;ref name="uCjFC" /&gt; The following year, Aldrete interviewed with the press again and stated that she had been tortured to confess. She said she had been stripped naked, blindfolded, beaten upside down, and then had her toenails yanked. Aldrete claimed she was beaten so severely that doctors told her she would never be able to have children.&lt;ref name="RtJhh" /&gt;

In the early 2000s, she published an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences when she was allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story.&lt;ref name="TlktR" /&gt;{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=9&amp;ndash;10}} Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that she would go to the police and tell them where they were hiding.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=26&amp;ndash;27}} She claimed that Constanzo and the rest of the group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=84&amp;ndash;88;126&amp;ndash;127}} She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=98&amp;ndash;101; 115}} Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=135}} She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.{{sfn|Aldrete|2013|p=77}}

In an interview with the press in 2014, Serafín and Martínez Salinas gave their versions of the story and proclaimed their innocence. Serafín stated that the Federal Judicial Police commander Juan Benítez Ayala found Serafín guilty because he was related to Elio and Ovidio. He said he was not arrested at the ranch, but rather at Elio's in-law's house in Matamoros. He said he grew up in Houston and moved to Brownsville for college, and that he was in Matamoros visiting his family when he was taken by the police. Serafín said he had been tortured by the Mexican and U.S. police in Matamoros to [[Forced confession|confess his participation]] in Kilroy's murder and in the killings at Santa Elena. He said he was allegedly beaten and told that he and his family would be killed if he spoke English during his declaration. He said he was a student of Texas Southmost College and knew who Aldrete was, but had not a relationship with her. Serafín also stated that he had never met Constanzo and had no idea his family ranch was a gathering place for his cult. He said that he had never dug up the bodies and had been taken to the ranch after the bodies were already exhumed.&lt;ref name="innocenteshoracero" /&gt;

Martínez Salinas, on the other hand, stated that he was forced to confess because he was a neighbor at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when he was looking for a part for his car. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.&lt;ref name="innocenteshoracero" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Two months after Kilroy was confirmed dead, his parents founded the Mark Kilroy Foundation which promotes drug awareness, education, and prevention through the "[[Just Say No]]" campaign. Since Kilroy's dream was to become a doctor after college, his parents decided to help others and continue his dream through this program.&lt;ref name="9fzqh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="houstonfoundation" /&gt; Since 1994, the foundation has sponsored and worked alongside Substance Abuse Free Environment (SAFE), a non-profit community group that promotes awareness for [[substance abuse]] and drug prevention. Both of them partner with the Santa Fe local government, its school system, and the ones nearby, and with businesses and private donors, to provide programs for the entire year. The full-time and part-time counselors visit school campuses during the academic year in Santa Fe and Hitchcock to hold programs for approximately 800 students regularly. When students are gone for the summer, the foundation conducts programs in summer camps by partnering with volunteers. They offer free outdoor activities like archery, golfing, fishing, tennis, and swimming. An average of 550 youth participate in these programs every summer.&lt;ref name="FZJap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="houstonfoundation" /&gt;

According to Kilroy's father, the purpose of these summer activities is to keep the youth distracted when they are not in school so they do not get bored and think about consuming drugs. On September 1999, the foundation signed an agreement with the U.S. Federal government to receive ten yearly grants of $100,000. By the tenth year, the government intended to stop the funding and expect the foundation to be self-supporting. However, Kilroy's parents stated that the yearly expenses exceeded $160,000 and that they would need to find new ways to make up the deficit. The Mark Kilroy Foundation was one of the five non-profit organizations in the [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]] that receives proceeds from a bingo place in [[La Marque, Texas]].&lt;ref name="houstonfoundation" /&gt; They also receive proceeds from sales of the book ''Sacrifice'', written by Kilroy's father and Bob Stewart in 1990.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Besides counseling kids and teenagers with drug advice, Kilroy's parents also advise young people who plan to travel for spring break. They advise people to stay in groups, keep an eye on each other, and not wander off on their own. They also suggest tourists be aware of travel warnings and abide by foreign laws and regulations when they travel outside the U.S., though they reiterated that people can get hurt in the U.S. too.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
After Kilroy was confirmed dead, the media framed the drug group and their religious practices as [[Satanism|satanist]].{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=164&amp;ndash;167}}{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=81&amp;ndash;83}} For the most part, the U.S. media labeled the group as satanist and gave little mention to the drug-related violence that was widespread in northern Mexico, thus failing to provide a wider picture of what happened at Matamoros.{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=73; 77}} Reports concluded that because human body parts were found inside a large metal pot, the group practiced cannibalism. Some journalists made the error of attributing cannibalism with the common mistake of satanist groups [[Satanic ritual abuse|sacrificing and eating human remains]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2015|p=123&amp;ndash;125}} Other writers, however, stated that Constanzo believed in [[Kadiempembe]], the devil in Palo Mayombe.{{sfn|Fanthorpe|Fanthorpe|2008|p=156&amp;ndash;157}}&lt;ref name="occultcrime" /&gt; In addition, some occult writers believed that the nature of Kilroy's murder, which included mutilation and clandestine burial, were part of occult tradition.{{sfn|Noblitt|Noblitt|2014|p=105}}

When media coverage and allegations of Constanzo's affinity towards Satanism died down, several Afro-Caribbean scholars stated that Constanzo's actions were fueled by his personal conviction and psychopathic involvement with Palo Mayombe. They argued that Constanzo used Palo Mayombe for his own financial, illicit, and psychological needs by convincing his cult members to help further his drug trafficking operations. Through human sacrifice, Constanzo promised his members that they were protected from the law. Other Afro-Caribbean scholars, on the other hand, alleged that Constanzo murdered Kilroy because he truly believed it was a requirement in his distorted view of Palo Mayombe. From this point of view, Constanzo's actions and what happened in Matamoros could happen anywhere.&lt;ref name="occultcrime" /&gt;

On the 20th anniversary of the murder, Kilroy's parents visited the Rio Grande Valley and Matamoros to thank the people who had supported them in their search for their son. Kilroy's father stated that people were supportive and called the police whenever they saw something suspicious that they thought was related to their son's disappearance. He said that it was easier to overcome their son's death because of the support they received.&lt;ref name="j2i28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tenlY" /&gt; Kilroy's mother said she received a [[Christian cross|cross]] from a Brownsville woman when she was searching for her son in 1989. "It's a reminder every time that I know that the [[God in Christianity|Lord]] was involved in everything", she said, while she touched and showed the cross around her neck.&lt;ref name="2iLqA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4408">The '''Musahars'''  are a [[Hindu]] [[Scheduled Caste]] found in the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. They also exist in [[Terai]], Nepal.  They are also known as  '''Banbasi''',&lt;ref name="xlii3"&gt;{{cite book|title=People of India Uttar Pradesh|volume=XLII Part Three|editor=A Hasan &amp; J C Das|pages=1006–1012|publisher=Manohar Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the plateau as '''pasi'''.&lt;ref name="Sachchidananda1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sachchidananda|title=Tradition And Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZ1EOSQHhlYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-072-5|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Musahar were traditionally rat-catchers, and there is still uncertainty as to their exact origin. According to a local legend, the father Brahma created man and gave him a horse to ride. The first Musahar decided to dig holes in the belly of the horse to fix his feet as he rode. This offended Lord Brahma, who punished them by making them rat-catchers.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In Bihar, the word Musahar is said to be derived from mūs, a local Bhojpuri and [[Sanskrit]] (mūṣ) word for a rat or mouse, on account of their traditional occupation as rat catchers.&lt;ref name="UpadhyayPandey1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vijay S. Upadhyay|author2=Gaya Pandey|title=History Of Anthropological Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNw5zVN1V0oC&amp;pg=PA436|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-492-1|pages=436–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are found in eastern Uttar Pradesh,&lt;ref name="xlii3"/&gt; Bihar&lt;ref name="bihar"&gt;{{cite book|title=People of India Bihar |volume=XVI  Part Two|editor=S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha|pages=702–707|publisher=Seagull Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and north [[Madhya Pradesh]] and the Terai region of Nepal. The Musahar speak the [[Bhojpuri]] dialect of [[Hindi]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

== Present circumstances ==
The Musahar consists of three sub-groups, the Bhagat, Sakatiya and Turkahia. Each of these clans are [[Endogamy|endogamous]].  They no longer engage in rat-catching and are now mainly landless agricultural labourers. They are one of the most marginalised groups in India, and have suffered discrimination. Although the Musahar are Hindu, they believe in a number of tribal deities.&lt;ref name="xlii3"/&gt;

The Musahar are found throughout Bihar and are employed in the stone quarries of the state. Many have also emigrated to the states of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]], and are employed as agricultural labourers. They speak Bhojpuri but many now have working knowledge of Hindi.&lt;ref name="bihar"/&gt;

In the rural areas, Musahar are primarily bonded agricultural labourers, but often go without work for as much as eight months in a year.  Children work alongside their parents in the fields or as [[rag-picker]]s, earning as little as 25 to 30 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] daily. The Musahar [[literacy rate]] is 3 percent, but falls below 1 percent among women. By some estimates, as many as 85 percent of some villages of Musahars suffer from [[malnutrition]] and with access to health centres scant, diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[kala-azar]], the most severe form of [[leishmaniasis]], are prevalent.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The [[Government of Bihar]] operates the Mahadalit Mission, which partially funds some programs to expand education and other social welfare programs for the Musahar. An example is the Prerna schools operated by [[Sudha Varghese]], residential schools for Musahar girls that include vocational training in the curriculum. Varghese also operates Nari Gunjan, which has 50 centres teaching 1500 Musahar girls throughout Bihar.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Musahar Scheduled Caste population as 257,135.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix - Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nimi''' is considered to be the first king of the [[Videha]] kingdom and belonged to the [[Janaka]] lineage of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. Nimi was the grandson of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] and son of Ikshwaku.&lt;ref&gt;Anthropology of Ancient Hindu Kingdom. Author – Makhan Jha&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Hindu texts ==

According to Vishnupurana&lt;ref&gt;Vishnupurana, Book IV&lt;/ref&gt; and Brihad Vishnupurana&lt;ref&gt;Brihad Vishnupurana in Mithila Mahatma Khand,&lt;/ref&gt; Nimi became the first King of Mithila.

=== Nimi's Yagya ===
Once Nimi performed Yagya and invited Sage [[Vasishtha]] to be the main priest to conduct Yagya. However Sage vasishtha had already committed to conduct yagya for Lord [[Indra]], he told Nimi that he would officiate as Head Priest after having conducted Lord Indra's Yagya and thus Nimi will have to wait. Nimi went away without replying. Sage Vashistha got impression that King Nimi has assented to wait for him.

Sage Vasishtha conducted Lord Indra's Yagya and rushed to preside at King Nimi's Yagya only to find that the Yagya was already being conducted. Sage Vasishtha got angry and cursed King Nimi that "he would cease to live in corporal form". Thus, King Nimi was left without his body to heaven with [[Sakra (Buddhism)|Sakra]] or [[Indra]] and stayed there for 9,000,000 years. After the Yagya was conducted successfully, the priests asked the Gods to return King Nimi in his corporal form. He returned and ruled Mithila righteously for 84,000 years

== In Buddhist texts ==
In several traditions, a righteous and edifying Videhan King Nimi or Nemi is mentioned, who travels to [[heaven (Buddhism)|heaven]] and [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]] in a celestial chariot. The story is mentioned in one text of the [[Pāli Canon]], and two Pāli [[Atthakatha|post-canonical texts]]. The name Nimi or Nemi is explained as "he brings the lineage full circle like the rim ({{lang-pi|nemi|italic=yes}}) of a carriage wheel".{{sfn|Appleton|2016|pp=139–40, 164 n.9}} The story relates that a certain King Makhadeva tells his barber that the latter should warn him as soon as the king has his first grey hair, a common ''[[memento mori]]'' motif found in ancient Indian literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Maurice|author-link=Maurice Bloomfield|title=On Recurring Psychic Motifs in Hindu Fiction, and the Laugh and Cry Motif|journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|date=1916|volume=36|pages=57–8|doi=10.2307/592669|jstor=592669}}&lt;/ref&gt; which goes back to the ancient Indian [[āśrama|conception of stages of life]].{{sfn|Appleton|2016|p=140}} Later on, when his first hairs go grey, and his barber tells him about that, the king [[pabbajja|goes forth]] to lead a spiritual life as a [[Rishi#Ruesi in Cambodia, Thailand and Laos|hermit]], but not before he entrusts his son to do the same when his hair goes grey. The former king is later reborn in a heavenly world. He sees that his descendants all follow the same tradition of becoming hermits when they became old. He then decides to be reborn as the next descendant of the same dynasty, and has the name King Nimi. The story then goes on to say that this king is able to travel to heaven and hell at the invitation of the god [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]]. At the end of the story, King Makhadeva, later reborn as Nimi, is identified as a previous birth of [[the Buddha]], and the barber and heavenly charioteer are identified as the disciple [[Ānanda]].{{sfn|Appleton|2016|p=139, 165 n.14}}

The story is mentioned in many other [[Early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] texts, both canonical and post-canonical.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2017" /&gt;{{sfn|Appleton|2016|p=139}} Translator [[C. A. F.

Solitary Buddhas are often depicted renouncing their worldly life because of certain signs in their environment or on their body, as in the case of Makkhadeva.{{sfn|Appleton|2016|p=144}} Finally, according to the scholar [[Padmanabh Jaini]], the story may also have influenced how Buddhist cosmology was interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaini|first1=Padmanabh S.|author-link=Padmanabh Jaini|title=Ākāravattārasutta: An 'apocryphal' sutta from Thailand|journal=[[Indo-Iranian Journal]]|date=July 1992|volume=35|issue=2–3|page=198|doi=10.1007/BF00164932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-canonical [[Pāli]] works, the belief is expressed that King Nimi belongs to a long line of Kings descending from [[Mahāsammata]], the first king of humankind. The Buddha is believed to be a descendant of the same dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jory|first1=Patrick|title=The Vessantara Jataka, Barami, And The Bodhisatta-Kings: The Origin and Spread of a Thai Concept of Power|journal=Crossroads: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|date=2002|volume=16|issue=2|pages=41–2|jstor=40860799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open-source Judaism'''&lt;ref name=osj_name&gt;Douglas Rushkoff, who originated the term, consistently capitalized ''Open Source Judaism'' (see the citations in later sections). ''Open Source'' may be capitalized in recognition of the usage of [[The Open Source Definition]] as a trademark of the [[Open Source Initiative]], although ''[[open source]]'' itself is not a trademark. When not referring specifically to Rushkoff's ideas, this article generally employs the lowercase, hyphenated form ''open-source Judaism'', similar to the usual form for analogous movements such as [[open-source software]] and [[open-source religion]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a name given to initiatives within the [[Jewish]] community employing [[Open Content]] and [[open-source license|open-source licensing]] strategies for collaboratively creating and sharing works about or inspired by Judaism. Open-source efforts in Judaism utilize licensing strategies by which contemporary products of Jewish culture under copyright may be adopted, adapted, and redistributed with credit and attribution accorded to the creators of these works. Often collaborative, these efforts are comparable to those of other [[open-source religion|open-source religious]] initiatives inspired by the [[free culture movement]] to openly share and broadly disseminate seminal texts and techniques under the aegis of [[Copyright law]]. Combined, these initiatives describe an open-source movement in Judaism that values correct attribution of sources, creative sharing in an intellectual [[Commons]], adaptable [[future proof|future-proof]] technologies, open technological standards, open access to primary and secondary sources and their translations, and personal [[autonomy]] in the study and craft of works of Torah.

==Sharing Torah in Rabbinic Judaism==

Unencumbered access to educational resources, the importance of attribution, and limiting proprietary claims on intellectual property, are all matters common to [[open-source]], the [[free culture movement]], and [[rabbinic Judaism]]. Open-source Judaism concerns itself with whether works of [[Jewish culture]] are shared in accord with Jewish teachings concerning proper stewardship of the [[Commons]] and civic responsibilities of property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady|first1=Aharon|title=‘Make yourself into a Maqom Hefker': Teachings on Open Source in Judaism (sourcesheet)|url=http://opensiddur.org/development/open-source-judaism/make-yourself-into-a-maqom-hefker-teachings-on-open-source-in-judaism-sourcesheet/|website=The Open Siddur Project|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rhetorical virtue of ''[[parrhesia]]'' appears in [[Midrash]]ic literature as a condition for the transmission of [[Torah]]. Connoting open and public communication, ''parrhesia'' appears in combination with the term, [[wikt:δῆμος|δῆμος]] (''dimus'', short for ''dimosia''), translated ''coram publica'', in the public eye, i.e. open to the public&lt;ref&gt;A meaning found in ''Sylloge lnscriptionum Graecum'', 2nd edition, ed. Diltenberger 1888-1901, no.807, an inscription from after 138 C. E.&lt;/ref&gt; As a mode of communication it is repeatedly described in terms analogous to a [[Commons]]. ''Parrhesia'' is closely associated with an ownerless wilderness of primary mytho-geographic import, the ''Midbar Sinai'' in which the Torah was initially received. The dissemination of Torah thus depends on its teachers cultivating a nature which is as open, ownerless, and sharing as that wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;''Bamidbar Rabbah'' 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the text from the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]] where the term ''dimus parrhesia'' appears (see bolded text).

::ויחנו במדבר - נתנה תורה '''דימוס פרהסיא''' במקום הפקר, שאלו נתנה בארץ ישראל, היו אומרים לאומות העולם אין להם חלק בה, לפיכך נתנה '''דימוס פרהסיא''', במקום הפקר, וכל הרוצה לקבל יבא ויקבל. מפני מה לא ניתנה תורה בארץ ישראל? שלא ליתן פתחון פה לאומות העולם, לומר לפי שנתנה בארצו לפיכך לא קבלנו עלינו. דבר אחר: שלא להטיל מחלוקת בין השבטים, שלא יהא זה אומר בארצי נתנה תורה וזה אומר בארצי נתנה תורה, לפיכך נתנה במדבר, '''דימוס פרהסיא''' במקום הפקר. בשלושה דברים נמשלה תורה במדבר ובאש ובמים לומר לך מה אלו חנם לכל באי העולם אף דברי תורה חנם לכל באי העולם.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mekhilta de Rebbi Yishmael|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta.19.2.7?lang=he&amp;layout=lines&amp;sidebarLang=all|website=the Sefaria Project|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Torah was given over ''dimus '''parrhesia''''' in a ''maqom hefker'' (a place belonging to no one). For had it been given in the Land of Israel, they would have had cause to say to the nations of the world, “you have no share in it.” Thus was it given ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one: “Let all who wish to receive it, come and receive it!” Why was the Torah not given in the land of Israel? In order that the peoples of the world should not have the excuse for saying: `Because it was given in Israel's land, therefore we have not accepted it. Another reason: To avoid causing dissension among the tribes [of Israel]. Else one might have said: In my land the Torah was given. And the other might have said: In my land the Torah was given. Therefore, the Torah was given in the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one. To three things the Torah is likened: to the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), to fire, and to water. This is to tell you that just as these three things are free to all who come into the world, so also are the words of the Torah free to all who come into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780827610033 | volume = Tractate Baḥodesh | chapter = 5 | at = on Shemot 20:2 | publisher = JHU | ISBN = 978-0-82761003-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the place in which the story of the Torah's revelation occurred becomes analogous to the personal virtue that a student and teacher of Torah must cultivate in oneself. In the midrashic work, [[Bamidbar Rabbah]] (1:7), an exegesis based on the phonetic similarities between the name ''Sinai'', and the word ''she'eino'' meaning "that is not," is offered:

::"God spoke to Moshe in the Sinai wilderness" (Numbers 1:1). This teaches us that anyone that is not (''she'eino'') making themselves into a ''midbar hefker'' (a wilderness belonging to no one) cannot acquire Wisdom and Torah, and so it is called in the ''Sinai'' wilderness.

The question of whether ''ḥidushei torah'' (innovative teachings in torah), Jewish liturgy, and derivative and related work are in some sense proprietary is subordinate to the importance given to preserving the lineage of a teaching. According to a [[mishna]]ic teaching of Rabbi [[Yehoshua ben Levi]], the 48th attribute of an excellent student is their capability in citing a teaching in the name of the one they learned it from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pirkei Avot|pages=6:6|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.6?lang=he-en&amp;layout=heLeft&amp;sidebarLang=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The question of whether new works of Torah learning are given the status of property is a question born of the commodification of printed works, competition, and prestige in modernity. In their academic article "Is Copyright Property?&amp;nbsp;– The Debate in Jewish Law," Neil Netanel and David Nimmer explain that,
::Rabbinic tradition recognizes a fundamental public interest in making ''ḥidushei torah'' freely available to a community in need of knowledge and guidance about how Jewish law applies to contemporary life. Partly for that reason, Jewish law has long prohibited rabbinic scholars from profiting from teaching Jewish law and religion.&lt;ref&gt;That prohibition has been narrowly applied to enable scholars to earn a livelihood from teaching and fulfilling other rabbinic functions. For further discussion, see Neil W. Netanel, Maharam of Padua v. Giustiniani: The Sixteenth-Century Origins of the Jewish Law of Copyright, 44 HOUS. L. REV. 821, 862 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue, accordingly, that authors of ''ḥidushei torah'' may not assert a right to profit from their sale. Others mitigate that rule by distinguishing between the intangible work, that is the actual teaching presented in the book or tape, on one hand, and the author’s labor and investment in reducing his teaching to writing or other fixed form and in printing, reproducing, and distributing the copies of his work, on the other. The author may not profit from, and has no property right in, the teaching itself, but is entitled to receive the full, customary salary for his labor and investment in preparing the manuscript or recording and in producing and distributing copies."&lt;ref name="Neil Netanel and David Nimmer 217–251"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neil Netanel and David Nimmer|title=Is Copyright Property?&amp;nbsp;— The Debate in Jewish Law|journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law|volume=12|issue=217|pages=217–251|url=http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Is-Copyright-Property-%E2%80%94-The-Debate-in-Jewish-Law.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rabbinic Jewish teaching, the primary sin committed by the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was their insistence on the absolute primacy of property, declaring that "what is mine is mine and what is yours is yours."&lt;ref&gt;Mishna Avot 5:10, [[Pirkei Avot]] 5:13&lt;/ref&gt;

::As applied by rabbinic jurists, the rule against acting like a Sodomite gives rise to three possible limitations on copyright, even assuming that copyright is property. First, if an author has created and disseminated his work with no intention of profiting from it, he suffers no economic loss even if another benefits from his work without paying for it, and thus such an author might be acting like a Sodomite were he to insist upon payment after the fact.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Yaakov Avraham 1999"&gt;Cohen, Yaakov Avraham. ''Emeq Ha-Mishpat'', Vol. 4: Zekhuyot Yotsrim [''Valley Of The Law'', Vol. 4: Copyright] (1999) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the rule against Sodomite behavior supports the view of some rabbinic jurists that private copying is permitted so long as the copier would not have otherwise purchased the copy and thus causes the author no loss.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Yaakov Avraham 1999"/&gt; Third, the rule might be the basis for limiting copyright’s duration for published works. In his seminal ruling rejecting a perpetual, proprietary copyright while conceding that authors have an exclusive right to print their unpublished manuscripts, [Rabbi] [[Isaac Judah Schmelkes|Yitzhak Schmelkes]] [1828-1905] reasoned that copying causes the author no damage (as distinct from foregone profit) once the first edition has been sold, and thus that the rule against Sodomite behavior negates any continuing claim the author might have to enforce an exclusive right to print following the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;Schmelkes, Yitzhak. ''Beit Yitzhak'', Yoreh De’ah, Pt. 5, No. 75 (Pyzemsyl 1875) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is akin to copyright in Jewish law in part derives from exclusive printing privileges that rabbinic authorities have issued since the invention of the printing press and date back to 1518. These privileges typically give the publisher the exclusive right to print the book for a period of ten to twenty years or until the first edition has been sold (i.e., after the author or heirs have recovered their investment). According to the minority position of Rabbi [[Joseph Saul Nathanson]] (1808–1875), a copyright is itself a property right arising out of the right of ownership. However, according to the majority position of Rabbi Yitzhak Schmelkes, "the author’s exclusive right to publish a manuscript and sell a first edition flows not from a proprietary copyright in the text, but only from the Jewish law of unfair competition or from the author’s right to condition access and use of the physical chattel, the manuscript, in which the author holds a property right."&lt;ref name="Neil Netanel and David Nimmer 217–251"/&gt; Ultimately, determination on the legal treatment of works of Jewish liturgy and ''ḥidushei torah'' depend upon a basic facet of rabbinic Jewish law: ''dinah malkhuta dina''—the law of the land is (accorded to the status of) the Law.&lt;ref&gt;Shilo, Shmuel. ''Dina De-Malkhuta Dina'' (Dfus Akademi 1974) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Under United States copyright law, for instance, all newly created "creative" works are considered as [[intellectual property]] and afforded proprietary property rights that restrict adaptation and redistribution of the works by others without explicit permission granted by the copyright owner.

To establish a community based instead on ''[[chesed|ḥesed]]'' (lovingkindness), the custom has long been for individuals to share or provide others with personal possessions as needed. The institution of the [[Gemach|G'MaḤ]] provided a practical example for the sharing of books, tools, and services. The ideal of contributing to or forming one's own G'MaḤ was popularized by Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838-1933), who addressed many halakhic questions about the practice and lauded the spiritual benefits of lending property in chapter 22 of his work, ''Ahavat Ḥesed'' (''Loving Loving-kindness'', 1888): "[Lending property] stems from compassion and constitutes a mitzvah, as [[chazal|ḤaZa"L]] have pointed out: "''[[tzedaka]]'' is performed with one’s money; ''ḥesed'' with one’s money and one’s self."&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli Sukkah 49b&lt;/ref&gt; Rashi explains ''ḥesed'' here to mean the lending of money, chattel (personal property), livestock—all being included in the ''[[mitzvah]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Yisroel Meir|title=Ahavat Ḥesed|date=1888|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/40295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free-Libre and Open-source Software==

Prior to the coinage and adoption of the term "[[Open Source]]" in 1998, several Jewish computer scientists, typographers, and linguists developed [[free software]] of interest to Jews, students of Judaism, and readers of Hebrew. "Free software" (not to be confused with freeware) is software shared under a free license (such as the [[GPL]]), where the definition of "free" is maintained by [http://freedomdefined.org freedomdefined.org].

Much of the development of free and open-source software was developed by Israeli computer scientists and programmers for the display, analysis, and manipulation of Hebrew text. This development has been celebrated by [[Hamakor]] a secular organization founded in 2003 to promote free and open-source software in Israel.

===Calendar Calculus===
[[File:Hebcal Jewish Calendar.png|thumb|Hebrew Calendar (Hebcal)]]
The earliest example of free software written for Jews may be the calendar code in [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] developed by [[Nachum Dershowitz]] and [[Edward Reingold]] in 1988, which included a [[Hebrew Calendar|Jewish calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reingold|first1=Edward M.|title=calendar.el --- calendar functions|url=http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob/HEAD:/lisp/calendar/calendar.el|website=repo.or.cz|publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calendar code was further adapted by Danny Sadinoff in 1992 as [http://www.hebcal.com hebcal].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadinoff|first=Danny|title=hebcal: A Perpetual Jewish Calendar|url=https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal/blob/master/README.md|work=GitHub|publisher=hebcal|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such software provided a proof-of-concept for the utility of Open Source for innovating interesting and useful software for the Jewish and Hebrew speaking community. In 2005, the LGPL licensed [http://www.kosherjava.com/zmanim-project/ Zmanim Project] was begun by Eliyahu Hershfeld (Kosher Java) to maintain open-source software and code libraries for calculating [[zmanim]], specific times of the day with applications in Jewish law.

===Morphological Analysis===

In 2000, Israeli linguists Nadav Har'El and Dan Kenigsberg began development of an open-source Hebrew morphological analyzer and spell-checking program, [[Hspell]] ([http://hspell.ivrix.org.il/ official website]). In 2004, Kobi Zamir created a GUI for Hspell. The Culmus Project developed [http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/nakdan-culmus Nakdan], a semi-automatic diacritics tool based on [[Wiktionary]] for use with [[OpenOffice.org|Open Office]] and [[LibreOffice]].

===Digital Typography===

In September 2002, Maxim Iorsh publicly released v.0.6 of Culmus, a package of Unicode Hebrew digital fonts licensed under the GPL, free software license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iorsh|first=Maxim|title=Version 0.6 of Culmus fonts released (2002-09-10 17:44)|url=http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=179316|work=Culmus-announce|publisher=Culmus|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other fonts shared with [[SIL Open Font License|SIL-OFL]] and [[GPL+FE]] licenses, provided the basic means for displaying Hebrew text on and offline in documents shared with Open Content licenses and in software shared with non-conflicting open-source licenses.

Canonical Jewish and liturgical texts (and some modern Hebrew poetry) depend upon [[niqqud|diacritics]] for vocalization of Hebrew. Upon the introduction of the Unicode 4.0 standard in 2003, the Culmus Project, [[SIL International|SIL]], and other open-source typographers were able to begin producing digital fonts supporting the full range of Hebrew diacritics. By 2008, several open-source licensed fonts supporting Hebrew diacritics were available including Ezra (SIL NRSI Team), Cardo (David J. Perry, Fonts for Scholars), and Keter YG (Yoram Gnat, Culmus). The [[Open Siddur Project]] maintains a comprehensive archive of Unicode Hebrew fonts organized by license, typographer, style, and diacritical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=פונטים קוד פתוח ביוניקוד - Open Source Licensed Unicode Hebrew Fonts|url=http://opensiddur.org/tools/fonts/|website=opensiddur.org|publisher=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex Text Layout===

Throughout the 2000s, the display and rendering of Hebrew with diacritics improved with support of [[complex text layout]]s, [[bidirectional text]], and right-to-left (RTL) positioned text in most popular open-source web browsers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady|first1=Aharon|title=Web Browser Testing for Unicode Hebrew Text and CSS @font-face: Bi-directional and CSS @font-face Unicode Hebrew Text Test Results|url=http://aharon.varady.net/browser-test/browser-test-for-hebrew-diacritics-test-results.html|website=aharon.varady.net|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Mozilla Firefox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bug 60546 - [BiDi] Unicode Hebrew/Yiddish Diacritics do not correctly align in some fonts|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60546|website=Firefox Bugzilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chromium]]), text editors ([[LibreOffice]], [[Apache OpenOffice|OpenOffice]]), and graphic editors ([[GIMP]]). Improved support is still needed, especially in open-source text layout/design applications utilizing text (e.g., [[Inkscape]], [[LyX]], and [[Scribus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=0001726: hebrew vowels (and cantillation marks) not placed properly|url=http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=1726|website=Scribus Bugzilla|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady|first1=Aharon|title=Scribus looking for help with Hebrew layout bugs|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/opensiddur-tech/PFJ6MDjnp5o/xDWI2T8UB0IJ|website=opensiddur-tech forum|publisher=Google Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Hebrew Script OCR===

In 2005, Kobi Zamir, began development of the first Hebrew OCR to recognize Hebrew diacritics, [https://code.google.com/p/hebocr/ hOCR], released open-source under the GPL. A GUI, [https://code.google.com/p/qhocr/ qhOCR] soon followed. By 2010, development on hOCR had stalled; legacy code is available on [https://github.com/guruyaya/hebocr Github]. In 2012, researchers at Ben-Gurion University began training the open-source [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract-OCR]] to read Hebrew with [[niqud]].&lt;ref&gt;Documentation is available here [http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/hocr/] and [http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/hocr/OCRWithNikud.pptx].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, open-source OCR software supporting other Jewish languages written in Hebrew script is in development, namely, [https://github.com/urieli/jochre Jochre] for Yiddish, being developed by Assaf Urieli. Urieli explains the difficulty of supporting Hebrew with diacritics in OCR software:

:the possible combinations are huge: 27 letters if you include the final forms × 9 niqqudim (more if we consider biblical niqqud) × cantillation marks. This means for an algorithm based on classification (such as Jochre), there are far too many classes, and it’s virtually impossible to get sufficient representation in an annotated training corpus. It would be better to imagine a two-pass algorithm: the first pass recognizes the letter, and the second pass recognizes the diacritics (niqqud + cantillation). However, this would require development in Jochre – it’s hard to guess how much without analyzing further. Note that Yiddish doesn’t suffer from the same difficulty, since there is very little niqqud used, and only in certain fixed places (e.g. komets aleph, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Siddur Project: FAQ: Technical Questions|url=http://opensiddur.org/development/faq/|website=opensiddur.org|publisher=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Open Source Judaism"==

The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" for Judaism in describing a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held religio-cultural [[source code]]: the [[Oral Torah|Oral]] and [[Written Torah]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an [[open-source religion]] which he understood as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, Open Source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushkoff's vision of an Open Source Judaism was comparable to some other expressions of [[open-source religion]] explicitly advocating for doctrinal reform or change in practice. As an expression of Open Source Judaism, in 2002 Rushkoff founded a movement called [http://www.rebooters.net/about-us/ Reboot]. "The object of the game, for me, was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Open Source Religion|url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=G4 TV|date=2003-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rushkoff subsequently left Reboot when he felt its funders had become more concerned with marketing and publicity of Judaism than its actual improvement and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalmindsblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/media-resistance-interview-with-douglas.html |title=Digital Minds Blog: Media Resistance – An Interview with Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=Digitalmindsblog.blogspot.com |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:A Decision Tree for Choosing Free-Libre Licenses for Cultural and Technological Work.png|thumb|Open source advocacy by an open-source Jewish project. "This decision tree helps copyright owners choose the right free/libre license for the type of cultural or technological work they wish to share: software, hardware, art, music, or scholarly work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varady|first=Aharon|title=A Decision Tree for Choosing Free-Libre Licenses for Cultural and Technological Work|url=http://opensiddur.org/2011/01/a-decision-tree-for-choosing-freelibre-licenses-for-cultural-and-technological-work/|work=opensiddur.org|publisher=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early confusion over the means by which "open-source" projects [[collaboration|collaborate]], led some Jewish [[social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneurs]] inspired by Rushkoff's idea to develop their work without indicating a license, publicly sharing code, or attributing content.&lt;ref&gt;Content shared with the Creative Commons licenses that apply non-commercial (NC) and no-derivatives (ND) terms cannot be legally remixed with content shared with Open Content licenses due to [[license compatibility]] issues.&lt;/ref&gt; Others offered "Open Source" as a model to be emulated but expressed no understanding of the role open-source licensing played in open-source collaboration and no opinion as to what role said licenses might serve for an Open Source Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kullock|first=Joshua|title=Creative Openings|url=http://www.morim.org/Contents.aspx?id=2570|work=morim-madrichim.org|publisher=American Joint Distribution Committee|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates for the adoption of Open Source in Judaism now work to clarify the meaning of "[[open content|open]]" and "[[gratis versus libre|free]]," and to convince projects soliciting [[user-generated content]] to adopt [[free content|free-culture]] compatible Open Content licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varady|first=Aharon|title=If You Love Torah, Set It Free (2013-10-14)|url=http://sovaproject.org/2013/10/14/if-you-love-torah-set-it-free/|work=The Sova Project|publisher=The Sova Project|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of rallying around Open Source as a means towards religious reform as Rushkoff suggested, other open-source Jewish projects strive to present their work as non-denominational and non-prescriptive. They see free-culture and open-source licensing as a practical means towards preserving culture, improving participation, and supporting educational objectives in an era of shifting media formats and copyright restrictions. In an interview with the Atlantic Magazine, the founder of the open-source [[Open Siddur Project]], Aharon Varady, explained,
:: "...I was interested in how free culture and open-source licensing strategies could help improve access and participation in the creative content I inherited from my ancestors in just that age when it was all transitioning from an analog print format to a searchable digital one. To me it seemed both obvious and necessary to pursue the digitization of existing works in the public domain, and broaden the network of students, scholars, practitioners, and communities that were already adopting, adapting, and distributing their inspired creativity and scholarship -- but were only doing so in the highly restricted channel of copyrighted work....The essential problem is how to keep a collaborative project like Judaism culturally vital, in an age when the creative work of participants in the project -- prayers, translations, commentaries, songs, etc. -- are immediately restricted from creative reuse by "All Rights Reserved" copyright. The fact is that broad creative engagement in collaborative projects isn't only limited by technological forces: these can be and have been overcome. They are limited by legal forces that assume creatives have only a proprietary interest in their work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism (2012-06-12)|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source offered a licensing strategy that could be employed for helping a community of users remix user-generated content such as translations of liturgy in the preparation of new prayerbooks, or for anyone to simply access Jewish content that could be redistributed with attribution and without fear of copyright infringement. The three [[license compatibility|non-conflicting]] "free" licenses by the free-culture advocacy group, [[Creative Commons]] ([[CC0]], [[CC-BY]], and [[CC-BY-SA]]), provided the basis of this strategy. By 2012, Dr. Dan Mendelsohn Aviv observed that,

::Jewish users, too, have embraced this [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] and open source ethos. In coming together to open source a project, users not only produce an evolving and meaningful Jewish artifact, they also construct a Jewish community that often extends both temporally and physically beyond the scope of the original project. Riffing on [Eric S.] Raymond['s "[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]"], Jewish users are definitely creatures of the bazaar as they revisit, reconsider and, in some cases, rework many of the seminal texts in Jewish life: the Siddur, the Tanakh, the ''d’var torah'' (sermon), the Haggadah, and The Book of Legends. These "open source projects" not only invited involvement by users at their individual level of learning and desire for engagement, but created connections and forged bonds between individuals across time zones and denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendelsohn Aviv|first=Dan|title=End of the Jews: Radical Breaks, Remakes, and What Comes Next|date=2012|publisher=Key Publishing, Inc.|location=Toronto, Canada|isbn=978-1-926780-07-8|page=174|url=http://thekeypublish.com/index.php/vmchk/End-of-the-Jews-Radical-Breaks-Remakes-and-What-Comes-Next.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Content Projects==
[[File:Wikisource Logo (Hebrew).svg|thumb|Hebrew Wikisource, a database of largely rabbinic Jewish texts in Hebrew]]

Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While digital editions of biblical and rabbinic Jewish sourcetexts proliferated on the World Wide Web by the mid-2000s, many of these lacked information as to the provenance of their digital texts. Common [[Torah database]] applications such as the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project and Hebrew text editing software such as Davka Corps. DavkaWriter, relied upon [[end-user license agreements]] explicitly forbidding the copy of included texts despite these texts residing in the Public Domain. Other websites, such as Mechon Mamre, presented public domain texts but indicated that the digital editions they presented were Copyrighted works, "All Rights Reserved." Many scholarly databases containing transcriptions of manuscripts and digital image collections of scanned manuscripts (e.g. hebrewbooks.org) lacked [[open access]] policies. In 1999, the Hebrew equivalent of Project Gutenberg, [http://benyehuda.org/ Project Ben Yehudah], was established in Israel as a digital repository of Hebrew literature in the Public Domain (excepting religious texts). The limited scope of Project Ben Yehuda presented a need for another platform to be used for editing, proofreading and formatting religious Jewish texts in Hebrew under a free license in a collaborative environment.&lt;ref&gt;This description of Hebrew Wikisource, the impetus for its creation, its history and the current nature of its activity, are based upon a presentation at the [http://2013.minervaisrael.org.il/ 2013 EVA/Minerva Jerusalem International Conference on Digitisation of Culture in the session on "Open Access to the Jewish Canon"]; a summary of the discussion is [http://www.slideshare.net/evaminerva/e4-rabbi-avikadishfreedigitallibraryevaminerva2013 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Content licensing and Public Domain dedications provide the basis for open collaboration and content sharing across open-source projects of particular interest to Hebrew readers and students of Judaism. The importance of compatible licensing cannot be understated. In the summer of 2009, content across the Wikimedia Foundation adopted new Open Content licensing in response to incompatibilities between the GNU Free Document license and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) copyleft license. After this, other non-Wikimedia Foundation projects using Open Content licensing were finally able to exchange content with Wikipedia and Wikisource under a common standard copyleft. This license transition was also significant because Wikisource provided a transcription environment available for multi-user collaboration. With the switch to an Open Content copyleft license, users could collaborate on transcriptions at Wikisource without concern for license incompatibility of the resulting digital editions.

===Torah Databases and the Digital Humanities===

Inside and outside the Jewish community, [[digital humanities]] projects often developed by scholars in academic institutions and theological seminaries, provided the basis for later open-source initiatives. The Westminster Leningrad Codex, a digital transcription of the [[Leningrad Codex]] maintained by the [[J. Alan Groves]] Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] was based on the Michigan-Claremont-Westminster Electronic Text of [[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]] (1983) and shared with a Public Domain dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westminster Leningrad Codex|url=http://www.grovescenter.org/GC/projects/wlc-1|work=J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebrew Wikisource was created in 2004 to provide a free and openly licensed home for what is known in Israel as the "Traditional Jewish Bookshelf," thus filling the need left by Project Ben Yehudah. The digital library at Hebrew Wikisource consists not just of texts that have been typed and proofread, but also hundreds of texts that have been punctuated and formatted (as a means of making them accessible to modern readers), texts are linked in tens of thousands of places to sources and parallel literature (as a well of facilitating the conversation between generations that is a feature of the traditional bookshelf), texts that have collaboratively produced commentaries (such as the Mishnah), and texts that have been corrected in new editions based on manuscripts and early versions. While Hebrew Wikisource is open to all texts in Hebrew, and not just to Judaica, it has primarily focused on the latter because the vast majority of public domain Hebrew texts are rabbinic ones. Hebrew Wikisource was the first independent language-domain of Wikisource. In 2009, [https://yi.wikisource.org Yiddish Wikisource] was created.

In 2013, Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish and a small team completed a carefully corrected draft of a new digital experimental edition of the [[Tanakh]] at Hebrew Wikisource, ''[http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%A9:Dovi/%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A4%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%95 Miqra `al pi ha-Mesorah]'', based on the [[Aleppo Codex]] and related manuscripts, and consulting the full range of masoretic scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadish|first=Seth (Avi)|title=מקרא על פי המסורה {{!}} Miqra `al pi ha-Mesorah: A New Experimental Edition of the Tanakh Online (2013-08-25)|url=http://opensiddur.org/2013/08/מקרא-על-פי-המסורה-miqra-al-pi-ha-mesorah-a-new-experimental-edition-of-the-tanakh-online/|publisher=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Moshe Wagner began work on a [[cross-platform]] [[Torah database]] called Orayta. Source code is licensed GPL and copyrighted content is licensed CC-BY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Moshe|title=Orayta|url=https://code.google.com/p/orayta/|work=Google Code|publisher=Orayta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Joshua Foer]] and Brett Lockspeiser began work on developing a free-culture licensed digital library of canonical Jewish sources and a web application for generating "sourcesheets" (handouts with a sequence of primary sources for study and discussion) from this repository. The [[Sefaria|Sefaria Project]] organizes the translation of essential works of rabbinic Judaism, such as the [[Mishnah]], and seeks English translations of many other seminal texts. The project mostly uses a combination of CC-BY and CC0 licenses to share its digital library and foster collaboration of its paid and volunteer contributors. Certain seminal works, notably the [[JPS 1985]] and the [[Steinsaltz Talmud|Steinsaltz translation of the Talmud]], are shared under restrictive Creative Commons licenses that do not conform to open-source principles.

===Web-to-Print Publishing===

In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the creation of an "Open Siddur Project," a digital humanities project developing a database of Jewish liturgy and related work ("historic and contemporary, familiar and obscure") and a [[web-to-print]] application for users to contribute content and compile their own siddurim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varady|first=Aharon|title=The Open Siddur Project (2002-10-13)|url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/|archivedate=2002-10-13|work=Aharon Varady's Homepage|publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All content in the database would be sourced from the Public Domain or else shared by copyright owners with Open Content licenses. Lack of available fonts supporting the full range of Hebrew diacritics in Unicode kept the idea from being immediately workable. The idea was revived on New Year's Eve December 2008 when Varady was introduced to Efraim Feinstein who was pursuing a similar goal. In the summer of 2009, the renewed project was publicly launched with the help of the PresenTense Institute, an incubator for social entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Prayer Ala Carte|url=http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Prayer-Ala-Carte-Raphael-Ahren-Haaretz-2009.07.03.pdf|publisher=Ha'aretz|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the application remains in development, all code for the project is publicly shared on [[GitHub]] with an [[LGPL]]. Meanwhile, liturgy and related work is being shared at [http://opensiddur.org opensiddur.org] with any one of the three Open Content licenses authored by the [[Creative Commons]]: the [[CC0]] [[Public Domain]] dedication, the [[CC BY]] attribution license, and the [[CC BY-SA]] Attribution/ShareAlike license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://opensiddur.org/development/faq/|work=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Open Siddur Project]] also maintains a package of open-source licensed Unicode Hebrew digital fonts collecting fonts from Culmus and other open-source font foundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=פונטים קוד פתוח ביוניקוד {{!}} Free/Libre and Open Source Licensed Unicode Hebrew Fonts|url=http://opensiddur.org/2010/07/unicode-compliant-and-open-source-licensed-hebrew-fonts/|publisher=the Open Siddur Project|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikisource]] is currently the transcription environment for digitizing printed Public Domain content by the Open Siddur Project.

===Encyclopedic References===

In July 2004, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Judaism|WikiProject Judaism]] was founded on [[English Wikipedia]]. The project helped incorporate [[:Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia|numerous articles]] from the Encyclopaedia Judaica (1906), a Public Domain reference work in order to be shared and expanded upon under the terms adopted by the Wikimedia Foundation.

===Other Educational Tools===
In 2011, Russel Neiss and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz were supported by the Jewish New Media Fund in building PocketTorah, a portable app for studying the chanting of the weekly Torah reading. Project funding subsidized recording of the entire Torah chanted according to the Ashkeanzic custom. All recordings used in the software were shared with CC BY-SA licenses and contributed to the [[Internet Archive]]. All code for the app was shared with an LGPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PocketTorah is Here|url=http://www.pockettorah.com/?p=96|work=PocketTorah|publisher=Notabox Media Lab|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Support for Open-source Judaism==

Projects that are not funded through competitive grants are supported by a combination of volunteer contributions, small donations, and out-of-pocket expenses by project organizers. Hubs for [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[Jewish education]] have come to serve as meeting places for project organizers with complementary interests in Open Source and Open Content. In 2009, the PresenTense Institute in Jerusalem served as the meeting place for Aharon Varady (Open Siddur), [http://www.russelneiss.com Russel Neiss], and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz (PocketTorah). Another hub for Open Source in the Jewish world has been [http://mechonhadar.org Mechon Hadar]. The umbrella institution of the Halakhic Egalitarian yeshiva, Yeshivat Hadar, revised its copyright policy in November 2014 and began sharing its searchable database of sourcesheets, lectures, and audio recordings of Jewish melodies with a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license. The institution has been a hub for open-source community initiatives. In 2009-2010, Mechon Hadar provided Aharon Varady with a community project grant for the Open Siddur Project. In April 2015, Aharon Varady and Marc Stober co-founded the Jewish Free Culture Society in order to better support new and existing projects in open-source Judaism and to represent the interests of open-source in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://jewishfreeculture.org|website=the Jewish Free-Culture Society|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parisam vaippu''' is a [[Hindu]] devotional [[ritual]]. It is observed by the  [[Arayan]] (Arayar, Arya) community of parts of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] in India. The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''parisam'' means [[dowry]]. The ritual "Parisam vaippu" is performed on the day of [[Shivaratri]] at [[Chengannur]] temple, [[Alappuzha District]], by the Arayans. It is traditional to give ''parisam'' to a daughter upon her marriage.

== History ==

The king [[Senguttuvan|Chenkuttuva]] had constructed a temple in memory of [[Kannagi]] at Chengannur in A.D.205.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Since then, the ”Alappattu Aryans” have been performing “Thiru Chengannur Shivaratri” and “Parisam vaippu”. To the Aryan community, the "Parisam vaippu" ritual is not only traditional but is also a grand marriage of their daughter [[Parvati]] Devi with the Lord [[Shiva]].

The ritual “Parisam vaippu” and the Shivaratri celebration have been recorded in record books by the administrator of the Chengannur temple since A.D 205.

However, at that time  a demon named Puloman came to the ashrama (hermitage) of Bhrigu and saw Puloma who had been betrothed to her in the past.

==In [[Mahabharata]]==
[[File:Chyavana.jpg|right|thumb|Chyavana son of Bhrigu and Puloma]]
In [[Mahabharata]], as narrated by the bard [[Sauti]], Puloma was the wife of sage Bhrigu and they were staying in a hermitage. She became pregnant.&lt;ref name=Bhrigu/&gt;  One day Bhrigu went for his morning ablutions in the river leaving his wife in the ashram at the care of Agni. At that time a [[rakshasa]] by name Puloman, who had earlier loved Puloma and had been betrothed to her, came to the ashram and saw Puloma and he was besotted by her beauty. Puloma, as a virtuous wife of Brighu and a host, treated him like a guest and offered him refreshments in spite of his lustful glaring at her. But Puloman enamoured by her beauty wished to abduct and marry her.&lt;ref name=Bhrigu/&gt;{{sfn|Anonymous||p=119}} He then saw Agni, the flames of the sacrificial fire burning in a chamber in the hermitage. Puloman then asked Agni to tell him truthfully the status of Puloma whom he had accepted as his spiritual wife. But Agni was reluctant to reveal the truth as he was scared that Bhrigu would curse him if he told the truth. But on Puloman's insistence, Agni told him the truth that Brighu had married Puloma as per Vedic scriptural rites in his presence as she had only been betrothed to him (rakshasa) and not formally married to her.&lt;ref name=Bhrigu/&gt; Hearing this Puloman changed his form to a [[boar]] and abducted Puloma.&lt;ref name=Puloma/&gt;

Frightened by this development, Puloma gave birth to her son who fell on the ground. This son was named Chavana also spelt Cyvana meaning the "fallen from the womb".&lt;ref name=Puloma/&gt; The child was shining very bright like the Sun and looking at the baby Puloman was scorched to death leaving behind Puloma and her son.{{sfn|Parmeshwaranand|2001|pp=14-15}} (in another version it is said that he was terrified by looking at the child and ran away dropping Puloma on the ground) Puloma, overcome by her plight, cried intensely to the extent that the tears she shed created a river called Vadhusaras which later became the location of the hermitage of her son Chavana when he had become a sage with immense ascetic achievement. Brahma consoled her.&lt;ref name=Puloma/&gt;{{sfn|Parmeshwaranand|2001|pp=14-15}}

Puloma then came to her ashram and appraised Bhrigu of the events that had happened with her and her son. While Bhrigu was happy to see his son, he was enraged to know from Puloma that it was Agni who had revealed her true identity as Bhrigu's wife to Puloman who was now dead, turned into ashes by their son's brightness. In a fit of rage he cursed Agni saying "Thou shalt eat of all things",&lt;ref name=Puloma/&gt; meaning to become "omnivorous"{{sfn|"O'Flaherty|1976|p=304}} or “May you be consumer of all things "''Sarva Bhahshaka'' on this Earth".{{sfn|Garg|1992|p=212}} Agni also became furious to hear this curse and told Bhrigu that his curse was not just as he only spoke the truth. Agni told that he was omnipresent and through his mouth both the gods and the ancestors (''pitrus'') accept the clean oblations of clarified butter offered to him and hence any offering of unclean things to him would be improper. 

He also told Bhrigu that he could also curse him but he refrained from doing so as he was a rishi and a Brahmin. With these words Agni went incognito.&lt;ref name=curse&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01008.htm|title=Section VII (Pauloma Parva continued)|pages=48–49|accessdate=17 November 2013|publisher=Sacred Texts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brahma then summoned Agni to his presence and recounted Agni's role in the universe and told him that the curse stands modified as his flames would only consume everything offered to him but his physical body would remain pure. Then Agni reappeared in the universe to perform his natural duties.&lt;ref name=curse/&gt;{{sfn|"O'Flaherty|1976|p=304}}

==In Padma Purana==
In another version in [[Padma Purana]] (pa 14) it is said that when Bhrigu was searching for ''samidhas'' (firewood) for offering to the fire god, the demon Damana went to Bhrigu’s ashram looking for the rishi’s wife. Agni looking at Damana got frightened and disclosed Puloma’s hideout in the ashram. When Bhrigu came back and came to know of Agni’s action, he cursed him but later agreed to reduce its effect to some extent.{{sfn|Garg|1992|p=212}}

[[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in Mexico]], representing about 83% of the total population as of 2010. In recent decades the number of Catholics has been declining, due to the growth of other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations – especially various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and [[Mormonism]] – which now constitute 10% of the population, and non-Christian religions. Conversion to non-Catholic denominations has been considerably slower than in [[Central America]], and central Mexico remains one of the most Catholic areas in the world.

Mexico is a [[secular]] country and has allowed [[freedom of religion]] since the mid-19th century. [[Mainline Protestant|Traditional Protestant denominations]] and the open practice of [[Judaism]] established themselves in the country during [[La Reforma|that era]]. Modern growth has been seen in [[Evangelical Protestantism]], Mormonism and in folk religions, such as ''[[Mexicayotl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Yolotl González Torres. ''The Revival of Mexican Religions: The Impact of Nativism''. ''Numen''. Vol. 43, No. 1 (Jan. 1996), pp. 1–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zotero Citlalcoatl. [http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/bitstream/10150/193424/1/azu_etd_11401_sip1_m.pdf AMOXTLI YAOXOCHIMEH].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] have both made limited inroads through immigration and conversion.

== Religion and the state ==
The Mexican [[Constitution of 1917]] imposed limitations on the [[Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]] and sometimes codified state intrusion into religious matters. The government does not provide financial contributions to the religious institutions, nor does the Roman Catholic Church participate in public education. [[Christmas]] is a national holiday and every year during [[Easter]] and Christmas all schools in Mexico, public and private, send their students on vacation.

In a major reversal of the Mexican state's restrictions on religion, the constitution was amended in 1992 lifting almost all restrictions on the religions, including granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico|work=International Religious Report|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24499.htm|accessdate=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, priests did not have the right to vote, and even now they cannot be elected to public office.

== Abrahamic religions ==

=== Christianity ===
Historically the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico is the oldest established church, established in the early sixteenth century.  At independence, the Roman Catholic Church kept its status as the only permissible church in Mexico. In the mid-nineteenth century, Mexican liberals curtailed the exclusive standing of the church, and Protestant missionaries, mainly from the United States, legally evangelized in Mexico. Other Christian denominations have grown in Mexico, dating from the twentieth century.  With the growth of immigration from the Middle East, Eastern Catholic churches were established.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Evangelical Protestant churches have expanded their reach significantly from the late twentieth century.

Mexicans are at least nominally Catholic, some combine or [[Syncretism|syncretize]] Catholic practices with native traditions. In the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], some Mayan people still practice the traditional beliefs of their ancestors, without being syncretized with Christianity.The same happens with the [[Wixarika]] people of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]].

There are major festivities in Mexico celebrating the Christian holidays of Epiphany (6 January) (''Día de los Reyes Magos''), All Saints' day (1 November), All Souls' day or [[Day of the Dead]] (2 November)(''Día de los fieles difuntos''), and the feast of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (12 December).  These are not [[public holidays in Mexico]].  Christmas is celebrated as a religious and public holiday.

==== Eastern Catholicism in Mexico ====
There are also separate jurisdictions for specific Eastern particular churches within the Catholic Church in Mexico:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==== Protestantism ====
{{See|Protestantism in Mexico}}

About 11% of the population (6,160,000 people over the age of 5, according to the 2000 census, including Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons who are usually considered to be non-Protestant and part of [[Restorationism]] or individual Christian branches) are [[Protestantism|Protestant]],&lt;ref name="tabulados" /&gt; of whom [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] (called Neo-Pentecostals in the census), are the largest group. The [[Anglican Communion]] is represented by the [[Anglican Church of Mexico]].

Protestantism is strongest where the Catholic Church and the Mexican state have little presence,&lt;ref name="Mexico 2012" /&gt; and accounts for over 10% of the population in the four states that border heavily-Protestant [[Religion in Guatemala|Guatemala]]: [[Campeche]], [[Chiapas]], [[Quintana Roo]], and [[Tabasco]]. It is also sizable in the Mexican states that border the U.S. State of [[Texas]].

Protestantism is also on the rise as it offers a less legalistic and hierarchical version of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion in Mexico: Staying alive, Mexicans are increasingly turning away from the Catholic church|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1250549|accessdate=7 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=25 July 2002|location=[[Mexico City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Mexico}}
The first [[LDS missionaries]] in Mexico arrived in 1875 (although the original Mormons came to Mexico in the 1840s in Utah, when it was still a Mexican territory). In 1885, 400 [[Mormon colonies in Mexico|Mormon colonists]] moved to Mexico. In 1993 the Mexican government formally registered the LDS Church. This allowed the church to own property in Mexico.

The 2010 Census reported 314,932 Mormons.&lt;ref name=census2010/&gt;
As of 2015, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) claims 1,368,475 members, 231 [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], 1,998 [[Ward (LDS Church)|congregations]], and 12 [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;LDS Newsroom (Statistical Information)[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/mexico/], see also [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics#North America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[Jews]] in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several [[Conversos]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} According to the last national census by the INEGI, there are now more than 67,000 Mexican Jews, the near totality of which (around 95%) live in the Greater Mexico City area.&lt;ref name="tabulados" /&gt;

Approximately 108,701 Buddhists are counted in Mexico.{{citation needed|reason=Census says all Eastern religions are less than 19,000|date=April 2015}} Also one of six [[Tibet House]]s in the world – Casa Tibet México – is located in Mexico City. It is used by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other leaders of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] to preserve and share Tibetan culture and spirituality. [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] has stated that he discovered [[Zen Buddhism]] in the 1960s while in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Jodorowsky, Alejandro.

== Nonreligious ==
{{Main|Irreligion in Mexico}}
Although the [[demographics of atheism]] and irreligion in Mexico is hard to measure because many atheists are officially counted as Catholic, almost three million people in the 2000 National Census reported having no religion.&lt;ref name="tabulados" /&gt;

Recent surveys have shown that around 3% of Catholics attend church daily and 44% attend church at least once a week,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195107845]&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[INEGI]], the number of atheists grows annually by 5.2%, while the number of Catholics grows by 1.7%.&lt;ref name="Aciprensa"&gt;[http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=20574 Aciprensa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catholic News Agency"&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12159 Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35194">{{Ten Commandments series}}
"'''Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy'''" is one of the [[Ten Commandments]]&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:1-21, Deuteronomy 5:1-23, ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

The full text of the commandment reads:
{{quote|Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.  Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the {{LORD}} your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the {{LORD}} made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the {{LORD}} blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.| {{bibleref2|Exodus|20:8-11|ESV}}}}

==Background==
When God gave the [[Israelites]] the Ten Commandments at [[biblical Mount Sinai]], they were commanded to remember the [[Sabbath]] and keep it holy by not doing any work and allowing the whole household  to cease from work.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043; Sabbath, The New Unger's Bible Dictionary, Moody Publishers, 1988, pp. 1095-1096&lt;/ref&gt; This was in recognition of God's act of creation and the special status that God had conferred on the seventh day during the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation week]].&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:11-12; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabbath day also points ahead to the 1,000-year messianic kingdom to come upon this earth during the seventh and final day of history week.

==Ancient understanding==
The [[Torah]] portrays the Sabbath concept both in terms of resting on the seventh day and allowing land to lie fallow during each [[Shmita|seventh year]].&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23:11-12; Leviticus 25:2-4; Sabbatical Year, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 p. 1043&lt;/ref&gt;  The motivation is described as going beyond a sign and remembrance of [[Yahweh]]'s original rest during the creation week&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 31:17; Sabbath, The New Unger's Bible Dictionary, Moody Publishers, 1988, pp. 1095-1096&lt;/ref&gt; and extends to a concern that one's servants, family, and livestock be able to rest and be refreshed from their work.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23:12, Deuteronomy 5:14; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the instruction to rest on each seventh day and seventh year, periods of seven days are often relevant aspects of Biblical instructions. For example, the quarantine period for suspected skin diseases after initial examination by a priest was seven days, after which the priest would re-examine the skin and pronounce the person clean or unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 13; Commentary on Leviticus 13, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 234-238&lt;/ref&gt;  Other special days included the day after the seventh Sabbath,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 23:16; Commentary on Leviticus 23, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 262-267&lt;/ref&gt; the first day of the seventh month,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 23:24; Commentary on Leviticus 23, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 262-267&lt;/ref&gt; the day of ritual cleansing after being healed from an unclean disease or other event bringing uncleanness.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 14; Numbers 19; Commentary on Leviticus 24, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 238-241&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, in the battle of Jericho, [[Joshua]] commanded the army to march around [[Battle of Jerico|Jericho]] each day for seven consecutive days and to march around Jericho seven times on the seventh day.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoshua 6; Commentary on Joshua 6, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 473-474&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah describes disobedience to the command to keep the Sabbath day holy as punishable by death&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 35:2; Numbers 15:32; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; and failing to observe Sabbath years would be compensated for during the captivity that would result from breaking covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 26:34-43; Yeremiah 34:14-22; Sabbatical Year, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982,  p. 1043&lt;/ref&gt;  The Torah also describes how special bread was to be set out before Yahweh Sabbath by Sabbath&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 24:5-9; Commentary on Leviticus 24, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 267-268&lt;/ref&gt; and describes Sabbath day offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 28:9-10; Commentary on Numbers 28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 340-341&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Day of Atonement]] was regarded as a "Sabbath of Sabbaths" &lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 16:31; Nosson Scherman, Yom Kippur, Mesorah Publications, 1989, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  It was on this day alone that the [[Kohen Gadol]] (High Priest) entered the [[Kodesh Hakodashim]] (Most Holy Place) inside the [[Tabernacle]] where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] contained the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were engraved.  The presence of YHWH in the Kodesh Hakodashim on that yearly day, upon the [[mercy seat]], required that the Kohen Gadol be first purified by the sacrifice of a bull in a prescribed manner.  Entering the Most Holy Place on other days or without fulfilling the ritual requirements would subject  the priest to death.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 16; Commentary on Leviticus 16, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 243-247&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that observing the Sabbath did not prevent Joshua from marching around Jericho for seven consecutive days,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 6; Commentary on Joshua 6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 473-474&lt;/ref&gt; Sabbath observance did not prevent the chief priest Jehoiada from organizing a palace coup on the Sabbath in order to remove queen Ataliah from the throne and replace her with Joash, a rightful heir to the throne.  Ataliah had murdered all the other heirs to the throne upon the death of Ahaziah and usurped the throne of Judah for herself.  Jehoiada's wife had rescued young Joash, and Jehoiada had kept him hidden for six years while Ataliah reigned as queen over Judah.  The priest Jehoiada used the occasion of the transfer of the guard on the Sabbath to proclaim Joash as king because at that time, he could arrange twice the normal guard on duty at the temple of Yahweh.  On that day, a covenant was made, Joash was proclaimed king, Ataliah was put to death, the temple of Baal was torn down, idols were smashed, and Mattan, the priest of Baal, was killed.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings  11; 2 Chronicles 22-23; R. Kittel, A History of the Hebrews Vol. II, Williams and Norgate, 1896, pp.286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the prophets condemn desecration of the Sabbath with various forms of work, including Isaiah,&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 56; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremiah,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 17; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel,&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 20; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; and Amos.&lt;ref&gt;Amos 8; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Nehemiah, after the captives return to Jerusalem from Exile, they make a covenant which includes a promise to refrain from desecrating the Sabbath,&lt;ref&gt;Nehemiah 10; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt; yet some give in to the ongoing temptation to buy and sell on the Sabbath.  As a result, Nehemiah has to rebuke them and station guards to prevent commerce in Jerusalem on the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Nehemiah 13; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Ezra taught that the Exodus account of the Ten Commandments contains the text exactly as written on the stone tablets and that the different version in Deuteronomy contains Moses words which remind Israel to obey the commandments, "as the {{LORD}} your God has commanded you."&lt;ref name="ארכיון הדף היומי"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha/devarim/45-58vaet.doc|title=ארכיון הדף היומי|work=vbm-torah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn Ezra explains that Moses did not need to re-iterate the reference to six days of creation at the beginning of the commandment in Deuteronomy, because the command in Deuteronomy itself refers back to the command from Exodus with the words "as [[YHWH]] your [[Elohim]] has commanded you."  Instead, Moses revealed in Deuteronomy the motive for the command that slaves rest on the Sabbath day in order that Israel remember that they were slaves in Egypt  and that God redeemed them.&lt;ref name="ארכיון הדף היומי"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha/devarim/45-58vaet.doc|title=ארכיון הדף היומי|work=vbm-torah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (the Ramban) also views the Exodus version of the Sabbath day commandment as a direct recitation by God, and the version in Deuteronomy as Moses’ personal reconstruction and exposition.  The Ramban explains that Moses wishes to emphasize that the prohibition of work extends even to agricultural work aimed at food production.  He further explains the difference in the stated rationals (creation in Exodus, exodus in Deuteronomy).  The exodus from Egypt serves as further evidence of Yah's creation of the world.  God's awesome display of power during the exodus annuls any doubts regarding YHWH as creator, because only the creator can possess such total control over the elements.

{{quote|Thus the Sabbath is a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt, and the exodus is a remembrance of the Sabbath, for on it [the Sabbath] they remember and say that it is Elohim who ... created everything at the beginning of creation ... Now he did not explain here [in Deuteronomy] that the reason for the rest [on the Sabbath] is that in six days the Eternal made heaven since this has already been mentioned many times in the Torah. Instead...he explained to them that from the Exodus from Egypt they will know that it was He who spoke and the world came into existence, and He ceased from work thereon.’&lt;ref name="ארכיון הדף היומי"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha/devarim/45-58vaet.doc|title=ארכיון הדף היומי|work=vbm-torah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Maimonides]] (the Rambam) gives equal footing to both rationals for the Sabbath command:

{{quote|YHWH commanded us to abstain from work on the Sabbath, and to rest, for two purposes; namely, (1) That we might confirm the true theory, that of the Creation, which at once and clearly leads to the theory of the existence of God.  (2) That we might remember how kind God had been in freeing us from the burden of the Egyptians - The Sabbath is therefore a double blessing: it gives us correct notions, and also promotes the well-being of our bodies.&lt;ref name="ארכיון הדף היומי"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha/devarim/45-58vaet.doc|title=ארכיון הדף היומי|work=vbm-torah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Testament===
{{see also|Biblical Sabbath}}
Moral imperatives mirroring nine of the Ten Commandments are repeated in the [[New Testament]], but the commandment regarding the Sabbath is notably absent (unless you're apart of the 7th day Adventist Church).&lt;ref&gt;Warren W. Wiersbe, The Bible Exposition Commentary: New Testament: Volume 1, Cook Communications, 1989,  p. 392; Greg L. Bahnsen, Wayne G. Strickland, Douglas J. Moo, Willem A. Van Gemeren, Five Views of Law and Gospel, Zondervan, 1999, p. 81; John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck, The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament Edition, David C. Cook, 1983, p. 678; William Henry Branson, In Defense of the Faith, Herald, 1949, p. 122; Normal Geisler, Ron Rhodes, Conviction Without Compromise, Harvest House, 2008, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the background and Jewish understanding of the Sabbath commandment underscore much of the New Testament narratives and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043; Sabbath, The New Unger's Bible Dictionary, Moody Publishers, 1988, pp. 1095-1096&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Jesus is described as pointing out to the Jews their misunderstanding of the [[Mosaic Law]] by making observance of the Sabbath more rigorous than God had commanded.  It was not unlawful to eat on the Sabbath, even if food must be obtained by plucking grain from the ears.  It was not unlawful to do good on the Sabbath day.  Healing was a work of mercy, and Jesus, portrayed as [[Lord of the Sabbath]], was merciful.  Consequently, criticisms of healing on the Sabbath were unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 12:1-14; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."

He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
 He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.|Matthew 12:1-14 NIV&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 12:1-14 NIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catholic views===   
The Catholic Church views the commandment to "remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8-10) as an essential part of observing the command to "[[Great Commandment|love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind]]."(Mark 2:27-28)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic teaching emphasizes the holiness of the Sabbath day (Exodus 31:15),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2168, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; connects the Sabbath with God's rest after the six days of creation (Exodus 20:11),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2169, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; views the Sabbath as a reminder of Israel's liberation from bondage (Deuteronomy 5:15),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2170, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; and views God's example of resting on the seventh day as an example for human resting and protesting the servitude of work and the worship of money. (Exodus 31:17, 23:12)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2172, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' discusses many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the Sabbath law, and points out that Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day. (Mark 1:21, John 9:16) Jesus is described as giving the Sabbath law its authentic and authoritative interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath." (Mark 2:27)   With compassion, Christ declares the Sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.(Mark 3:4)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2173, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunday is distinguished from the Sabbath, which it follows.  According to Catholic teaching, ceremonial observance of Christ's resurrection on the first day of the week replaces that of the Sabbath.

Sunday is described as a [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] of the spiritual truth of the Jewish Sabbath and an announcement of man's eternal rest in God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2175, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Catholic Catechism describes Sunday celebration as observing  the "moral commandment inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward, visible, public, and regular worship."  Thus, [[Sunday worship]] fulfills the "moral command of the [[Old Covenant]], taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 2176, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord's day should be "a day of grace and rest from work" to cultivate their "familial, cultural, social, and religious lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 2184, The Third Commandmen]&lt;/ref&gt;   On Sundays and other holy days, faithful Christians are to refrain from work and activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the [[Lord's Day]], [[Works of Mercy|works of mercy]], and the "appropriate relaxation of mind and body."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2185, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians also sanctify Sunday by giving time and care to their families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. "Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2186, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to one's own rest, Christians should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2187, The Third Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt;

An oration given by Jesus to [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary]], along with Saint Matilda and Saint Bridget, titled "A True Letter of Our Saviour Jesus Christ", which is venerated by Roman Catholics, implores the faithful: "If you want to reap an abundant harvest you must not work on Sunday, for Sunday you must go to Church and pray to God to forgive your sins. He gave you six days in which to work and one for rest and devotion and to tender your help to the poor and assist the Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pieta Prayer Book|year=2004|publisher=MLOR Corp|language=English|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheran views===
[[Martin Luther]] taught that with regard to external observance, the Sabbath commandment was given to Jews alone and not strictly applicable to Christians.  Luther did see wisdom in voluntary observance of a day to rest from labor and pay particular attention to Christian duties of reading the Scriptures, worshiping God, and prayer.  He thought that this need not occur on any particular day, but should continue on Sunday (the Lord's day), since this was the long established practice, and there was no reason to create disorder by unnecessary innovation.  Luther emphasized that no day is made holy by rest alone, but rather by the individual seeking to be holy through washing himself in God's word.&lt;ref name="iclnet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-05.html|title=The Large Catechism (V) - Martin Luther|work=iclnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation| For the Word of God is the sanctuary above all sanctuaries, yea, the only one which we Christians know and have…God's Word is the treasure which sanctifies everything, and by which even all the saints themselves were sanctified. At whatever hour then, God's Word is taught, preached, heard, read or meditated upon, there the person, day, and work are sanctified thereby, not because of the external work, but because of the Word which makes saints of us all. Therefore I constantly say that all our life and work must be ordered according to God's Word, if it is to be God-pleasing or holy. Where this is done, this commandment is in force and being fulfilled. | Martin Luther, ''The Large Catechism''&lt;ref name="iclnet.org"/&gt;}}

From Martin Luther there is also the following comments on the reason for, importance of, and continuing need for the seventh-day Sabbath, specifically, found in ''Luther on the Creation: A Critical and Devotional Commentary on Genesis 1-3'':

{{quote|God did not sanctify to himself the heaven nor the earth nor any other creature.  But God did sanctify to himself the seventh day.  This was especially designed of God, to cause us to understand the seventh day is to be especially devoted to divine worship.  For that which is appropriated to God and exclusively separated from all profane uses is sanctified or holy...

It follows therefore from this passage, that if Adam had stood in his innocence and had not fallen he would yet have observed the "seventh day" as sanctified, holy and sacred; that is, he would have taught his children and posterity on that day concerning the will and worship of God.

Further by this sanctification of the Sabbath it is also plainly shown that man was especially created for the knowledge and worship of God.  For the Sabbath was not instituted on account of sheep or oxen, but for the sake of men, that the knowledge of God might be exercised and increased by them on that sacred day.  Although therefore man lost the knowledge of God by sin, yet God willed that his command concerning the sanctifying of the Sabbath should remain.  He willed that on the seventh day both the Word should be preached, and also those other parts of his worship performed, which he himself instituted; so the end that by those appointed means we should first of all think solemnly on our condition in the world as men; that this nature of ours was created ...for the knowledge and the glorifying of God; and also that by these same sacred means we might hold fast in our minds the same hope of a future and eternal life.}}

Here one does not find Luther saying the Sabbath command of Genesis 1 is something that could be dispensed with.  It was the command of the Creator of the universe and had a specific purpose.

=== Reformed views ===
[[John Calvin]] taught that since Jesus Christ fulfilled the Sabbath, binding observance to the Sabbath was [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]] for Christians.  However, he emphasized that because Christians are buried with Christ in [[baptism]] and [[Resurrection of the Dead|raised from the dead]] to the glory of [[God the Father]] (Romans 6:4), that what Christ fulfilled in the Sabbath requires not one day each week, but rather "requires the whole course of our lives, until being completely dead to ourselves, we are filled with the life of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#fortynin.htm John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000248/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html |date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calvin taught that spiritual wisdom deserves to have some part of every day devoted to it, but owing to the weakness of many daily meetings cannot be held.  Consequently, the pattern of weekly observance established by God is useful for the church to emulate.  This church practice is not to be in the manner of [[Judaizers|Jewish observance of minute formalities]], but rather one of ordering church life in a useful and predictable manner to serve the body with opportunity to hear the word, receive the [[sacraments]], and participate in [[Prayer in Christianity|public prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#fortynin.htm John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 33-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000248/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html |date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] describes the Sabbath day as being the seventh day of the week from the creation until the resurrection of Christ, and as being changed to the first day of the week with [[Resurrection of Jesus|Christ's resurrection]].&lt;ref name="reformed.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/|title=Westminster Confession of Faith|work=reformed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|VI. Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worship, is now, under the Gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed: [John 4:21] but God is to be worshipped everywhere,[Malachi 1:11, 1 Timothy 2:8] in spirit and truth;[John 4:23] as, in private families[Jeremiah 10:25, Deuteronomy 6:6-7, 1 Peter 3:7, Acts 10:2] daily,[Matthew 6:11] and in secret, each one by himself;[Matthew 6:6, Ephesians 6:18] so, more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God, by His Word or providence, calls thereunto.[Isaiah 56:6-7, Hebrews 10:25, Acts 13:42, Luke 4:16, Acts 2:42]

VII. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in His Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, He has particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him:[Exodus 20:8-11, Isaiah 56:2-11] which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week: and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week,[Genesis 2:2, 1 Corinthians 16:1-2, Acts 20:7] which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's Day,[Revelation 1:10] and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.[Exodus 20:8,10, Matthew 5:17-18]

VIII. This Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations,[Exodus 20:8, Exodus 16:23-30, Exodus 31:15-17, Isaiah 58:13, Nehemiah 13:15-22] but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.[Isaiah 58:13]&lt;ref name="reformed.org"/&gt;}}

=== Methodist views ===
{{further|Sabbatarianism#Methodist Churches}}
In [[Methodism]], an "important aspect of the pursuit of [[sanctification]] is the careful following" of the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name="Campbell2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Ted A.|title=Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials, 2nd Edition|accessdate=|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English|isbn=9781426753473|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Rules of the Methodist Church required "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God" and prohibited "profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling".&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199774159|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, "Methodist observance of the [[Lord's Day]] was grounded in their sense that the observance of Sunday as a day of rest fulfilled the Commandement to sanctify the Sabbath."&lt;ref name="Campbell2011"/&gt; The 2014 ''Discipline'' of the [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]] states, with regard to the Lord's Day:&lt;ref name="BMCC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the Lord’s Day, celebrated on Sunday, the first day of the week, throughout the Christian church, is the Christian sabbath, which we reverently observe as a day of rest and worship and as the continuing memorial of our Savior’s resurrection. For this reason, we abstain from secular work and from all merchandising on this holy day, except that required by mercy or necessity.&lt;ref name="BMCC2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemethodist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2014-Bible-Methodist-Discipline.pdf|title=Discipline of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches|year=2014|pages=30|language=English|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Theologically speaking, for Methodists, Sunday is "the special but not the only day for worship, it is hallowed by God, recalls creation and the resurrection, requires release from earthly toil and responsibilities, and anticipates the eschatological day of the Lord that is the hope and desire of all believers."&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"/&gt;

=== Latter-day Saints views ===
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] believe the Lord has commanded them to continue to observe the Sabbath. He has promised them that if they obey this commandment, they will receive "the fullness of the earth.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.16-20|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:16-20|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons are taught that they should keep it a holy day and it should be reserved for holy activities.  Mormons attend [[sacrament meeting]] each week. Other Sabbath-day activities may include: praying, meditating, studying the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets, writing letters to family members and friends, reading wholesome material, visiting the sick and distressed, and attending other Church meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/36863_eng.pdf True to the Faith, Pg 146 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventh-day Adventists ===
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] observe the sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.&lt;ref name="Beliefs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html|title=Beliefs|date=2016-10-04|website=www.adventist.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places where the sun does not appear or does not set for several months, such as northern Scandinavia, the tendency is to regard an arbitrary time such as 6 p.m. as "sunset". During the sabbath, Adventists avoid secular work and business, although medical relief and humanitarian work is accepted. Though there are cultural variations, most Adventists also avoid activities such as shopping, sport, and certain forms of entertainment. Adventists typically gather for church services on Saturday morning. Some also gather on Friday evening to welcome in the sabbath hours (sometimes called "[[vespers]]" or "opening Sabbath"), and some similarly gather at "closing Sabbath".

Traditionally, Seventh-day Adventists hold that the [[Ten Commandments]] (including the fourth commandment concerning the sabbath) are part of the [[Moral absolutism|moral law]] of God, not abrogated by the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]], which apply equally to [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="Beliefs"/&gt; This was a common Christian understanding before the Sabbatarian controversy led Sunday-keepers to adopt a more radical [[antinomian]] position. Adventists have traditionally distinguished between "moral law" and "ceremonial law", arguing that moral law continues to bind Christians, while events predicted by the ceremonial law were fulfilled by Christ's death on the cross.

The '''Sapera''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found in [[North India]]. They are also known as Barwa Sampheriya in [[West Bengal]], Sapela in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and Sparera in [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1268 to 1272 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India Haryana Volume XXIII  edited by M.K Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 380 to 385 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India Punjab Volume XXXVII  edited by I.J.S Bansal and Swaran Singh pages 398 to 400 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schlangenbeschwörer-Delhi-1973.jpg|thumb|right|A snake charmer in Delhi]]

==Origin==

They are a community of snake charmers and one of a number of semi-nomadic communities found in North India which live in camps at the outskirts of most North Indian towns.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1268 to 1272 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haryana]], the community is known as the Sapera Nath. They are further divided into ten sub-groups, some of which are the Brahmin Sapera, Jhinwar Sapera, Soggar Sapera, BihaL Sapera, Nakphule Sapera, and Sandenath Sapera. These divisions are said to reflect the diverse origin of this community, where people of different caste backgrounds took to the occupation of snake charming, and over time evolved into a distinct community. They now have [[Scheduled Caste]] status in Haryana.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Haryana Volume XXIII  edited by M.K Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 380 to 385 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the word Sapela is derived from the word sap, which means snake in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. They are also known as Nath. The community are as much snake catchers as snake charmers, and are employed by villagers as snake charmers. According to their traditions, the community descend from a Kanipa, a [[Jhinwar]], who took to snake charming. They are nomadic, and are possibly of [[Domba|Dom]] origin. The Punjab Sapela speak Punjabi and found throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Punjab Volume XXXVII  edited by I.J.S Bansal and Swaran Singh pages 398 to 400 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Sapera are divided into two [[endogamous]] groups, the Saharpua and the Baiga in [[Uttar Pradesh]], especially the [[Bareilly district]].  These are further segmented into [[exogamous]] clans, and they maintain a strict system of clan exogamy.  The principal occupation of the Sapera remains snake charming, and they wander from village to village, performing with deadly snakes like [[cobra]]s.  They are also expert snake catchers, and are often called in by other villagers to catch snakes and remove the poison from persons bitten by snakes.  A small number of Sapera have also been involved in the manufacture of a coarse rope called the munj. As with other nomadic groups, the Indian state has exerted pressure for them to settle down. A few have now taken up permanent settlement and are mainly sharecroppers.  They remain an extremely marginalised group, suffering from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India: Uttar Pradesh.'' Volume XLII, Part Three (2005). Edited by A. Hasan &amp; J. C. Das. Anthropological Survey of India. 1268-1272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sapela community in Punjab consists of a number of clans, the main ones being the Marar, Goar, Bhambi, Doom and Ladhu.  All these clans are of equal status and intermarry.  The Sapela are still largely involved in their traditional occupation of snake charming and snake catching, as well as collecting wild root and tubers, which they use for medicinal purposes.  They are nomadic are often employed in the villages to catch snakes.  The community are also associated with the playing the gourd pipe, known as a ''been''.  Like other Sapera groups, they are extremely marginalised, and have been granted Scheduled Caste status.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India: Punjab.'' Volume XXXVII. Edited by I.J.S Bansal and Swaran Singh. Anthropological Survey of India. 398-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Sapera are [[Hindu]] by faith, although a small number have converted to [[Islam]], and form a distinct community of [[Sapera (Muslim)|Muslim Sapera]]s.  The Hindu Sapera are followers of the [[Shakti]] cult and worship the goddess [[Kali]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1969 the government instituted a Commission of Inquiry into Scientology which resulted in the [[Dumbleton-Powles Report]].

On 21st January 2017, the new Ideal Church of Scientology of Auckland opened its doors in the heritage-listed Grafton building, formerly Whitecliffe Art College. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11786804|title=An inside look at Auckland's new Church of Scientology|last=|first=|date=2017-01-23|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Censorship==
In 2008 a protest against the church as part of [[Project Chanology]] was held in some parts of New Zealand by "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]", a world-wide group that has concerns about internet censorship by Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4441382a6442.html|title=Protesters bid to unmask Scientology|last=Wall|first=Tony|date=2008-03-16|publisher=Sunday Star Times|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 
This seems to be wishful thinking. Cannot find any refs. It may happen since the Charities Com is investigating other orgs.

In November, 2009, the New Zealand [[Charities Commission (New Zealand)|Charities Commission]] commenced an investigation as to whether the Church of Scientology qualified as a charity under New Zealand law.

Simha corresponds to the zodiacal sign of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], and overlaps with about the second half of August and about the first half of September in the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p72"/&gt; In Vedic texts, the Simha month is called '''Nabhas''' (IAST: Nabhas), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations.&lt;ref name="Dershowitz2008p123"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nachum Dershowitz|author2=Edward M.

It is preceded by the solar month of [[Karkaṭa]], and followed by the solar month of [[Kanyā]].&lt;ref name=sewell5/&gt;

The Simha month is called ''Avani'' in the Tamil Hindu calendar.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p72"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, N-Z (Vol 1 &amp; 2) |year= 2002|publisher =The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn= 978-0-8239-3179-8|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Simha, just like they do with other months. For example, the ''Surya Siddhanta'', dated to c. 400 CE, calculates the duration of Simha to be 31 days, 0 hours, 26 minutes and 48 seconds.&lt;ref name=sewell10/&gt; In contrast, the ''Arya Siddhanta'' calculates the duration of the Simha month to be 31 days, 2 hours, 5 minutes and 31 seconds.&lt;ref name=sewell10&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=Śaṅkara Bālakr̥shṇa Dīkshita|title=The Indian Calendar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MiAQAAMAAJ |year=1896|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; Company|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian solar month names are significant in epigraphical studies of South Asia. For example, ''simha'' month, along with other solar months such as ''Makara'', are found inscribed in South Indian temples. The Pandya King Jatavarman Sundara-Pandaya II dedicated the Kalisvara temple at [[Kalayar Kovil]] in his 12th year of reign, reads one inscription, on the third ''tithi'' of the second fortnight of the Simha month, which corresponds to Wednesday August 27, 1287.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E Hultzsch|title=Epigraphia Indica|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MxE9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277|year= 1906|publisher=Education Society Press|pages=279, 277–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simha is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to [[Leo (astrology)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bangalore V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4986">{{Celtic mythology}}
The English-Latin noun '''''vates''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|eɪ|t|iː|z}} is a term for a [[prophet]] and a [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] following the Latin term. It is the origin of the English term ovate for an Irish [[bard]]. The earliest Latin writers used ''[[:wikt:vates|vātēs]]'' ({{IPA-la|ˈwaːteːs|}} to denote "prophets" and soothsayers in general; the word fell into disuse in Latin until it was revived by [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mala.bc.ca/atkinsona/112-11%20vates.htm Vates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus [[Ovid]] could describe himself as the ''{{lang|la|vates}}'' of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] (''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 3.9).  

According to the Ancient Greek writers [[Strabo]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kernunnos.com/culture/druids/lit.html Ovates or Vates: The Shamans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and [[Poseidonius]], the ''{{lang|cel-Latn|vates}}'' ({{lang|cel-Grek|οὐάτεις}}) were one of three classes of [[Celt]]ic [[priest]]hood, the other two being the [[druid]]s and the [[bard]]s.  The Vates had the role of [[wikt:seer|seer]]s and performed [[sacrifice]]s (in particular administering [[human sacrifice]]) under the authority of a druid according to Roman and Christian interpretation. The Celtic word ''{{lang|cel-Latn|vates}}'' is continued by [[Irish language|Irish]] ''{{lang|ga|fáith}}'' "prophet, seer," and ''gwawd'' "scorn, satire, scoff" in Welsh.

==Etymology==

It is unknown whether the Latin and [[Gaul]]ish usages are [[cognate]]s, or if the former should be considered a Celtic [[loanword]].  The word may be derived from a [[PIE]] root ''{{PIE|*wāt-}}'' " to inspire, spiritually arouse"; however that root cannot be shown to go back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], since it is only certainly attested for Celtic and Germanic (though it may be present natively in Italic).  
[[Virgil]] uses the Latin ''{{lang|la|vannus}}'' "[[Fan (implement)|winnowing fan]]" (from ''{{PIE|*wat-nos}}'', compare [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|wadal}}'', modern German ''{{lang|de|Wedel}}'', with the same meaning, from ''{{PIE|*wat-lo-}}'') for something borne about in the [[Dionysus|Bacchic]] festival, suggesting that the root may have had an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] sense in Italic also.

In pagan Rome the vates resided on the Vatican Hill, the Hill of the Vates. The Vatican Hill takes its name from the Latin word Vaticanus, a vaticiniis ferendis, in allusion to the oracles, or Vaticinia, which were anciently delivered on the Vatican Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: Compendious Description of the Museums of Ancient Sculpture, Greek and Roman, in the Vatican Palace, by Cav. H. J. Massi, First Curator of the Vatican Museums and Galleries, Paleographer and Professor of the Italian and French Languages, Rome, Third Edition, 1889, Title page, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When the papacy was returned to Rome from Avignon (France) in the 14th Century, the Vatican became the residence of the Pope, and the word Vatican came to refer to the enclave in the middle of Rome that had become the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Incredible Book of Vatican Facts and Papal Curiosities| first=Nino| last=Lo Bello| publisher=Liguori Publications| year=1998| isbn=0-7648-0171-6| page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rübekeil (2003) suggested that the name of the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] god ''{{lang|gem|*[[Wōđinaz]]}}'' may in fact be an early loanword, an adjective ''*{{lang|ine|vatinos}}'' based on Celtic ''{{lang|cel|vates}}''.

==Modern usage==

Vates (or ''Ovates'', due to a misinterpretation of the Greek spelling {{lang|cel-Grek|οὐάτεις}} {{IPA-el|ˈwaːteːs|}}) make up one of the three grades of the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]], a [[neo-druidism]] order based in [[England]]. 

An ovate is also the initial level one can attain in the modern Welsh [[Gorsedd]] of Bards. The Gorsedd is not a neo-druidic entity like the one mentioned above, but is more concerned with Welsh arts and culture; however, the ceremony and practices are largely based on reimaginings of druidism by [[Iolo Morganwg]].
