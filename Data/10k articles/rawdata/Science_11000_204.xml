The '''A258 road''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in England, running through [[East Kent]] from [[Dover]] to [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]].  It is in [[A roads in Zone 2 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|Zone 2 of the Great Britain numbering scheme]].

It begins at the [[A256 road|A256]] within Dover, running up Castle Hill and passing [[Dover Castle]] on its eastern side and the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]] on its western side.  It then crosses the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] at a four-way roundabout (called Guston Roundabout) at the top of [[A2 road (Great Britain)#Brenley Corner To Dover Docks|Jubilee Way]] before running behind the East Kent coast, with turn-offs to [[Westcliffe, Kent|Westcliffe]], [[Martin Mill]] and [[St Margaret's at Cliffe]]. 
 
It then runs through [[Ringwould]] (passing [[Ripple Mill, Ringwould|Ripple Mill]]), [[Walmer]] and [[Deal, Kent|Deal]].  
Whilst in Deal it is named 'the Strand' and it passes [[Deal Castle]], then becomes part of a one-way traffic system in Deal, it heads up 'Victoria Road', then right onto 'Ranelagh Road' then left onto 'Prince of Wales Terrace' (beside the coastline). 'Deal Castle Road' leads back to the Ringwould/Dover route.
The route heads away from the coast on 'Broad Street', where it crosses over the pedestrianised high street and becoming 'Queen Street'. It passes over the railway close to Deal Railway station . Then it becomes 'London Road' heading to Upper Deal. Then it heads north-west, passing [[Sholden]] and later [[Betteshanger Park]]. It is once again called the A258, passing through the hamlet of [[Hacklinge]] and past the junction to [[Finglesham]] and then the junction to [[Worth, Kent|Worth]].  When it reaches the southern part of [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], near [[Woodnesborough]], it terminates at another junction with the [[A256 road|A256]] (Sandwich By-pass) at Stone Cross.

==Improvements==
In 2006, improvement works were carried out to the A2(T)/A258 Guston Roundabout Junction, Dover. This meant the road from Deal was widened at the junction to allow for more queuing on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moderngov.dover.gov.uk/Data/Dover%20Joint%20Transportation%20Board/20060918/Agenda/$Agenda10.doc.pdf |title=Improvement Works to the A2(T)/A258 Guston Roundabout Junction,Dover.|date=8 September 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |work=Dover Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A4123''', also known as the '''Birmingham New Road''' or '''Wolverhampton New Road''', is a major road in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] linking [[Wolverhampton]] with [[Birmingham]]. It was one of the first major new roads constructed for use by motor traffic, and was designed as an unemployment relief project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1923/jul/18/birmingham-and-wolverhampton-road#S5CV0166P0_19230718_CWA_21|title=Hansard|date=18 July 1923|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs roughly northwest to southeast from the [[Wolverhampton Ring Road]] to [[Harborne]], west Birmingham.

Construction of the road began on 4 February 1924, and was built in individual sections.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1924/jun/03/birmingham-and-wolverhampton-new-road#S5CV0174P0_19240603_CWA_49|title=Hansard|date=3 June 1924|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided jobs for at least 470 unemployed workers in surrounding areas including Birmingham, Wolverhampton, [[Dudley]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Smethwick]] and [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1925/mar/10/birmingham-and-wolverhampton-new-road#S5CV0181P0_19250310_CWA_29|title=Hansard|date=10 March 1925|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened by the then Prince Of Wales (later [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]]) on 2 November 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1927/nov/18/landlord-and-tenant-no-2-bill#S5CV0210P0_19271118_HOC_71|title=Hansard|date=18 November 1927|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road has previously been a Trunk Road (looked after by the [[Highways Agency]]), but was detrunked on 13 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=167284 |title=Highways Agency : Press Release |date=6 November 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707090125/http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=167284 |archivedate=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Express West Midlands]] service 126 serves the majority of the A4123 from [[Birmingham]] to Wolverhampton. Buses are supposed to run every 10 minutes during peak times.

'''Angelo Vermeulen''' (born 1971) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] visual artist.&lt;ref name="Resseler 2008, p. 5"&gt;Resseler 2008, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His multidisciplinary oeuvre crosses over the boundaries of [[biology]], [[technology]] and [[community]]. Vermeulen won the Witteveen+Bos Art+Technology Award in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;N.N. 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He is crew commander of HI-SEAS, a Mars simulation study on improving the nutritional value of space food, funded by [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;N.N. 24 July 2012 ''in: Knack.be''&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[TED (conference)|TED]] Senior Fellow he travels the world to share information about his art and scientific projects.

==Short introduction==

Angelo Vermeulen is a space systems researcher, biologist, artist and community organizer. In his work, he ties technological, ecological and social systems together through group engagement and collaboration.

[[Biomodd]] is one of his most well-known art projects and consists of a worldwide series of interactive art installations in which computers and ecosystems coexist. In 2009 he launched SEAD (Space Ecologies Art and Design), a platform for research on architecture and ethics of [[space colonization]]. Seeker is one of the resulting projects involving co-created starship sculptures that evolve over time. From 2011 to 2012 he was a member of the European Space Agency Tropical Team Arts &amp; Science (ETTAS) and in 2013 he was a crew a commander for the NASA-funded HI-SEAS Mars mission simulation in Hawai'i.

His space-related work led him to start a new PhD at [[Delft University of Technology]], developing paradigm-shifting concepts for evolvable starships. He co-authored the book 'Baudelaire in Cyberspace: Dialogues on Art, Science and Digital Culture' with philosopher [[Antoon Van den Braembussche]], and gives talks about his work around the world. IN 2012 he was a Michael Kalil Endowment for Smart Design Fellow at Parsons in New York.

Currently, Vermeulen is a TED Senior Fellow and holds positions at [http://sintlucas.luca-arts.be LUCA School of Visual Arts in Ghent] (Belgium) and [[University of Applied Arts Vienna|Die Angewandte]] in Vienna (Austria).Vermeulen is also  a member of the Arts &amp; Science Topical Team of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = HI-SEAS|title = Angelo Vermeulen's Biography|url = http://hi-seas.org/?p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeulen grew up in the Belgian city [[Sint-Niklaas]]. In 1998 Vermeulen completed his PhD on the deformation of the teeth of non-biting midges at the biology department of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium. He also graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Leuven, where he studied photography.&lt;ref&gt;Steveheydens 2006, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeulen left Belgium to work in London as a photographer together with [[Nick Waplington]].&lt;ref name="Resseler 2008, p. 5" /&gt; After his return to Belgium in 2001, he attended a two-year post-academic course at the [[Higher Institute for Fine Arts]] (HISK) in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Steveheydens 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This became the starting point of an exploration trying to find out how biology and ecological processes could interact in art and materialize them as art installations.&lt;ref name="Pain 2009, in: Science"&gt;Pain 2009, ''in: Science''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected Art Projects ==

=== Seeker (2012 - Ongoing) ===
Seeker is a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] spaceship model which experiments with the integration of the technological, ecological and social systems that enable long-term survival in a spaceship. Vermeulen started the first edition of Seeker (DV1) in response to the [http://www.witteveenbos.nl Witteveen+Bos] Art+Technology award he won in 2012. The designing and making of Seeker was a collaboration between Witteveen+Bos engineers, local artists, independent volunteers and the artist as inspirer/connector. The spaceship was exhibited in autumn 2012 in the Bergkerk church in Deventer, the Netherlands.

By the end of the exhibition, Seeker became partly demolished and re-used for a second edition during the Space Odyssey 2.0-exhibition in Z33 in Hasselt (Belgium). Several months before the opening of the exhibition, Vermeulen launched an open call for ideas and participation on Seeker (HS2). The outward construction was unaltered, but the interior changed depending on the needs and priorities of the new crew. Although Vermeulen and Matilda Krzykowski share their leadership over the crew, there is no hierarchy in the process of realizing the work.

Seeker is primarily a community project in which a tiny, isolating room is created to provide the best possible conditions for a particular group of inhabitants. Seeker developed itself as a traveling project with always new groups of participants.

=== Biomodd (2007-Ongoing) ===
Started in Athens Ohio during a four-month residency at the ‘Aesthetic Technologies Lab’ in 2007.

Biomodd is a socially engaged art installation that finds meaningful relationships between biology, computers and people. On its most basic level, Biomodd creates symbiotic relationships between plants and computers, and ignites conversations among the community around it. For example, algae are used to cool computer processors so they can run faster, while the heat that is generated by the computer electronics is used to create ideal growing conditions for a plant-based ecosystem. This dynamic is the catalyst for a collaboration between the team members - which include artists, biologists, computer scientists, game designers, gardeners, community organizers - and members of the local community in which the project takes place.

This open source project was conceived by Belgian biologist turned artist Angelo Vermeulen. Fellow collaborators and himself have brought Biomodd to different countries throughout the world. The first version started in Athens (Ohio, USA) in 2007 and has since traveled to the Philippines, Slovenia, New Zealand, Belgium, New York (USA), Chile, the Netherlands and London (Great Britain). Biomodds all over the world are still ongoing and every single project has new groups of participants. This leading to very different results for every culture.

'''Biomodd [ATH1]''' became a self-generating [[eco-system]] that gets stimulated by playing a computer game.&lt;ref name="Fellow"&gt;TEDFellow Conference 2010.Angelo Vermeulen. Videorecording: TED. Long Beach California. Feb. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By playing the computer game, the computer's components heat up and nurse the plants that surround them. Microscopic [[algae]] are used to simultaneously cool some of the hot components.&lt;ref name="Fellow" /&gt; Filmmaker Morgan Riles directed a documentary on the Biomodd [ATH1] which has been screened at the 27th International Festival of Films on Art, and the [[Houston Cinema Arts Festival]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIOMODD [ATH1]: A Living Game Computer As Social Sculpture |url=http://vimeo.com/12519873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomodd [LBA2]''' was conceived in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] in the Philippines. The installation contained local recycled materials, however, certain parts of previous versions were integrated into the new structure as well. Vermeulen and [[Diego Maranan]] co-lead a team of 22 members with different backgrounds. The travelling, social and evolving nature of the project is essential to it even though all versions are conceptually and physically connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maranan |first=D. |author2=Wynants M. (ed.) |title=Biomodd as Paradox |journal=We can change the weather |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yicsl9Zq-90C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=we+can+change+the+weather&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ksZjTPvDCpSOOOWqmbkK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomodd [TUDelft3]''': In October 2011 Vermeulen was invited by Professor Frances Brazier of the Systems Engineering section at [[TU Delft]] (the Netherlands) for the Biomodd project at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=B. |title=People just show up and start designing |journal=TU Delta |date=12 October 2011 |volume=43 |issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomodd [NYC4]''' was developed as part of the art exhibition “ReGeneration” at the [[New York Hall of Science]] in New York. ReGeneration included seventeen artists.&lt;ref name="Biomodd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomodd |url=http://www.biomodd.net/biomoddnyc4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010203105/http://www.biomodd.net/biomoddnyc4 |archivedate=2013-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Immigrant Movement International, the Biomodd [NYC4] was part of Springmavera. In April 2012 Katherine Moriwaki and Vermeulen worked with the students of [[Parsons The New School for Design]] on the  building of your own [[Bioreactor]].&lt;ref name="Biomodd" /&gt;

==Works: an overview==

Vermeulen's artistic engagement consists of actively bringing art's radical freedom and focus on sensory, aesthetic and emotional directness to other domains, such as [[science]], cultural communities, game culture and [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Weelden |first=D. |title=Onbegrensde intuitie.

Several months before the opening of the exhibition, Vermeulen launched an open call for ideas and participation on Seeker [HS2]. The outward construction was unaltered, but the interior changed depending on the needs and priorities of the new crew. Although Vermeulen and Matylda Krzykowski share their leadership over the crew, there is no hierarchy in the process of realizing the work. Seeker is primarily a community project in which a tiny, isolating room get created which is adapted to provide the best possible conditions for a particular group of inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/54433402&lt;/ref&gt; Seeker developed itself as a travelling project with always new groups of participants.
* '''Blue Shift [LOG. 1]''' (2001): ‘Blue Shift’ is an [[interactive art]] installation, made for Art Center STUK in Leuven (Belgium). This Darwinian installation piece was realized together with evolutionary biologist Prof. Luc De Meester from the University of Leuven (Belgium) and engineers from electronics company Philips (Turnhout, Belgium). The project was originally conceived for the exhibition 'Hot Re-Strike' (curated by Stef Van Bellingen) at De Warande arts centre in Turnhout (Belgium) in 2005. Blue Shift (LOG.1) is an [[interactive art]] installation with a living model ecosystem at its core. Using single-cell algae,  [[water fleas]], fish and water snails, a compact aquatic community is set up in the exhibition space. The whole system is designed in such a way that visitors drastically induce a gradual microevolution of the - genetically determined - light-responsive behavior of the water fleas. When the system is in standby, yellow lights illuminate the aquaria from the top. The water fleas are strongly attracted to this light and swim near the surface of the water. Whenever a visitor approaches the installation and passes a wall-mounted sensor, blue spotlights on top of the aquaria are activated. The water fleas are repelled by this color of light, flee downwards and pass through holes in a false bottom of the aquaria. However, fish are residing in the lower sections of the aquaria and most of the water fleas are immediately wiped out. What can be considered to be a survival strategy in natural circumstances - blue light indicates clear open water and hence potential detection by fish - has quite a different meaning in this set up: it are exactly those water fleas which do not swim away from the blue light, that survive and reproduce. In this way, their genes will become dominant in the water flea populations and a 'contra-natural' selection will occur. When the work is on display, the artists-scientists continuously adjust the set-up and carry out new experiments. The installation aims to question the status of the utilitarian in art and science, and push interactive installation art into Darwinian realms.  
* '''Corrupted C#N#M#''' - is an exploration into the material quality of media and its potential to be altered by biological processes. The work challenges the often-made assumption that media's existence and production are largely immaterial. by growing bacteria and mould on data-containing media like VHS tape and hard drives, the goal was to subsequently revoke visual information with glitches that could be said to be authored by these biological processes. The title of the work includes a corruption of 'cinema' with its vowels replaced by hash tags. In the most recent stage of Corrupted C#N#M# - the so-called Entomoghraph ñ Madagascar hissing cockroaches were transformed into ëcyberinsectsi capable of disrupting video data. The project is a collaboration with silversmith Walter Bresseleers. An experimental film using this system is currently in pre-production and is created in collaboration with filmmaker Jashari Shelbatra.

== Selected Scientific Projects ==

=== TED Fellowship ===
Angelo Vermeulen became a TED Fellow in 2010 for a TED talk on Biomodd in Long Beach. In 2013, Vermeulen became a TED Senior Fellow.

=== HI-SEAS ===
'''[[HI-SEAS]]''' (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) is an analog habitat for human spaceflight to Mars.&lt;sup&gt;[1][2][3]&lt;/sup&gt; HI-SEAS is located in an isolated position on the slopes of the Mauna Loavolcano on the island of Hawaii. The area has Mars-like features and an elevation of approximately 8,200 feet above sea level. HI-SEAS is funded by the NASA Human Research Program for four research missions. The missions are of extended duration from four months to a year.

The purpose of the detailed research studies is to determine what is required to keep a space flight crew happy and healthy during an extended mission to Mars and while living on Mars.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;Research into food, crew dynamics, behaviors, roles and performance, and other aspects of space flight and a mission on Mars itself is the primary focus. The HI-SEAS researchers also carry out studies on a variety of other topics as part of their daily activities.

Vermeulen was crew commander of a four-month Mars simulation mission. HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analogand Simulation) takes place on the flanks of the Mauna Loa Volcano which is the closest approximation of the actual surface of Mars. The mission intends to study improving the taste and nutritional quality of the meals consumed during a spaceflight. Previous spaceflight simulations such as MARS-500 proved the importance of the quality of the food during long periods of isolation of this nature. During the mission, Vermeulen is in charge of a six-man crew consisting of researchers from different backgrounds. Among the other researchers OlegAbramov, Simon Engler, Kate Greene, [[Sian Proctor]], and [[Yajaira Sierra Sastre]], Vermeulen is the only European member of the crew. Due to his experience in community building in complex conditions, such as Biomodd and other projects, he is commissioned as the leader of the crew. Aside from the food study, Vermeulen investigates the possibilities of remote-operated robotic agriculture in order to create semi-autonomous farms for Mars settlement. The mission is initiated by NASA in collaboration with Cornell University of New York and the University of Manoa in Hawaii.

In September - October 2015, Vermeulen exhibited a selection of art photos he made when he was commander on a HI-SEAS mission at the Dome of Visions in Stockholm (Sweden).

=== MELiSSA ===
The Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative ([[MELiSSA]]) is a European Space Agency initiative (ESA) with the aim to develop the technology for a future regenerative life support systemfor long term human space missions. Initiated in 1989, the design is inspired by a terrestrial ecosystem. Today MELiSSA is a consortium made up of 30 organisations across Europe.

== SEAD ==
Vermeulen founded Space Ecologies Art and Design (SEAD), an artistic research platform on the architectures and biopolitics of space colonization in 2009. Two years after the platform was launched, Vermeulen started a doctoral research in Space habitat design and participatory systems engineering at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Vermeulen is a member of the Arts &amp; Science Topical Team of the European Space Agency (ESA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31567">An '''Atmospheric radiative transfer model, code, or simulator''' calculates [[radiative transfer]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] through a [[planetary atmosphere]], such as [[the Earth]]'s.

== Methods ==

At the core of a radiative transfer model lies the [[radiative transfer equation]] that is numerically solved using a [[Solver (computer science)|solver]] such as a [[discrete ordinate method]] or a [[Monte Carlo method]]. The radiative transfer equation is a [[monochromatic]] equation to calculate radiance in a single layer of the Earth's atmosphere. To calculate the radiance for a spectral region with a finite width (e.g., to estimate the Earth's energy budget or simulate an instrument response), one has to [[numerical integration|integrate]] this over a band of frequencies (or wavelengths). The most exact way to do this is to loop through the frequencies of interest, and for each frequency, calculate the radiance at this frequency. For this, one needs to calculate the contribution of each [[spectral line]] for all [[molecule]]s in the atmospheric layer; this is called a ''line-by-line'' calculation.
For an instrument response, this is then [[convolution|convolved]] with the spectral response of the instrument. A faster but more approximate method is a ''band transmission''. Here, the transmission in a region in a band is characterised by a set of pre-calculated coefficients (depending on [[temperature]] and other parameters). In addition, models may consider [[scattering]] from molecules or particles, as well as [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]]; however, not all models do so.

== Applications ==

Radiative transfer codes are used in broad range of applications. They are commonly used as [[forward model]]s for the [[Inverse theory|retrieval]] of geophysical parameters (such as [[temperature]] or [[humidity]]). Radiative transfer models are also used to optimize [[solar photovoltaic]] systems for [[renewable energy]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Andrews, J.M. Pearce, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance], ''Solar Energy'', '''91''',233–241 (2013). DOI:10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 [https://www.academia.edu/3081684/The_effect_of_spectral_albedo_on_amorphous_silicon_and_crystalline_silicon_solar_photovoltaic_device_performance open access]&lt;/ref&gt; Another common field of application is in a [[General Circulation Model|weather or climate model]], where the [[radiative forcing]] is calculated for [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[aerosols]], or [[clouds]]. In such applications, radiative transfer codes are often called [[parametrization (climate)|radiation parameterization]]. In these applications, the radiative transfer codes are used in forward sense, i.e. on the basis of known properties of the atmosphere, one calculates [[heating rates]], [[radiative fluxes]], and radiances.

There are efforts for intercomparison of radiation codes. One such project was ICRCCM (Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models) effort that spanned the late 1980s - early 2000s.  The more current (2011) project, Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes, emphasises also using observations to define intercomparison cases.

{{Infobox Telescope}}

The '''Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder''' ('''ASKAP''') is a [[radio telescope]] array located at [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] (MRO) in the [[Australia]]n [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West]]. ASKAP consists of 36 identical [[parabolic antenna]]s, each 12 metres in diameter, working together as a single instrument with a total [[antenna effective area|collecting area]] of approximately 4,000 square metres.

It is operated by the governmental research agency [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] and forms part of the [[Australia Telescope National Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/the_atnf/|title=The Australia Telescope National Facility|publisher=[[CSIRO]]|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASKAP's combination of fast survey speed and high sensitivity will allow activities such as researching the [[Big Bang|creation and early evolution]] of the [[Universe]], analysing cosmic [[magnetism]], testing predictions of the [[general theory of relativity]], mapping [[black hole]]s, and exploring the origins of galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/us-australia-ska-pathfinder-idUSBRE89404L20121005|title=World's fastest radio telescope starts up in Australian outback|last=Kebede|first=Rebekah|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASKAP Science Update, Vol. 1 |publisher= CSIRO |accessdate=8 November 2010 |url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/ASKAP_Science_Update_1.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASKAP is also a technology demonstrator for the international [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA), a planned radio telescope that is planned to be the world's largest and most sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SKA Factsheet for Journalists |work= SKA Project Development Office (SPDO) |publisher=Skatelescope.org |accessdate= 13 April 2011 |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SKA_Factsheet-for-Journalist_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASKAP's home, the MRO, has also been selected as one of the SKA's two central location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the SKA Siting Options Working Group |work=SKA Organisation |publisher=Skatelescope.org |date= 14 June 2012 |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/uploaded/19942_120520_SOWG.Report.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Development and construction of ASKAP was led by CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science (CASS), in collaboration with scientists and engineers in The Netherlands, Canada and the USA, as well as colleagues from Australian universities and industry partners in China.&lt;ref name="fastfacts"/&gt;

The [[Yamatji|Wajarri Yamatji]] people are the traditional owners of the land on which the observatory lies{{Relevance inline|date=September 2015}}.

The construction and assembly of the dishes was completed in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/news_antenna_18062012.html |title=ASKAP News |publisher=Atnf.csiro.au |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The features that will make ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope include a wide [[Field of view#Astronomy|field-of-view]], large [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|spectral bandwidth]], extremely fast survey speed, and excellent [[u-v coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory |publisher=CSIRO |accessdate= 13 April 2011 |url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/site.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASKAP is located in the [[Murchison (Western Australia)|Murchison]] district in Western Australia, a region that is extremely "radio-quiet" due to the low population density and resultant lack of [[Radio frequency interference|radio interference]] (generated by human activity) that would otherwise interfere with weak [[Astronomical radio source|astronomical signals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's biggest radio telescope, Square Kilometre Array |publisher= [[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate= 13 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12891215/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique radio quiet nature is being recognised as a natural resource and is being protected by the [[Australian Government|Australian Commonwealth]] and [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australia State Government]] through a range of protective regulatory measures.

Data from ASKAP will be transmitted from the MRO to a [[supercomputer]] at the [[Joseph Lade Pawsey|Pawsey]] Supercomputing Centre in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The data will be converted to images of the sky in near-real-time by a [[Instruction pipeline|pipeline processor]] running the purpose-built ASKAPsoft package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASKAP Science Update, Vol. 5 |publisher= CSIRO |accessdate= 13 April 2011 |url= http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/ASKAP_Science_Update_5.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; All data will be placed in the public domain after being checked for quality by the ten ASKAP Survey Science Teams. Post processing will be supported by supercomputers operated by iVEC at the Pawsey Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pawsey Centre |publisher=iVEC |date=14 June 2012 |url=http://www.ivec.org/ivec-projects/pawsey/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307220253/http://www.ivec.org/ivec-projects/pawsey/ |archivedate=7 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Perth, and may also be complemented by '[[theSkyNet]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During ASKAP's first five years of operation, at least 75% of its time will be used for large Survey Science Projects. ASKAP is expected to make substantial advances in key areas, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASKAP Science |publisher= CSIRO |accessdate= 8 November 2010 |url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/science.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ASKAP Survey Science Projects ==
In 2009, after an open call for proposals, CSIRO announced that ten major science projects had been selected to use ASKAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSIRO sets science path for new telescope |publisher=CSIRO |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url=http://www.csiro.au/news/CSIRO-sets-path-for-ASKAP.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319205803/http://www.csiro.au/news/CSIRO-sets-path-for-ASKAP.html |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ten projects' authors, 33% were from Australia and New Zealand, 30% from North America, 28% from Europe, and 9% from elsewhere in the world.

'''Balkan Snowfield''' (Plato Balkan \'pla-to bal-'kan\) is an ice-covered plateau of elevation ranging from 150 to 280 m in eastern [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], Antarctica, situated south of lower [[Perunika Glacier]], northwest of [[Huntress Glacier]] and north of [[Contell Glacier]].  It is 3&amp;nbsp;km long in southwest-northeast direction and 2&amp;nbsp;km wide, and bounded by [[Burdick Ridge]] to the east, [[Willan Nunatak]] and [[Castillo Nunatak]] to the southeast, and [[Krum Rock]] to the southwest.  The feature slopes gently northwestwards with its foot bounded by the hills along [[Bulgarian Beach]]. It is named after the [[Balkans]].

'''Basic aluminium''' (or '''basic aluminum''') is the name of more than one [[functional group]] consisting of [[aluminium]] with one or two [[hydroxy group]]s attached.

'''Dihydroxyaluminium''', Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as '''dibasic aluminium''', is monovalent, and known in these compounds:
*Dihydroxyaluminium acetate, (HO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as [[aluminium monoacetate]], basic aluminium monoacetate, dibasic aluminium acetate
*[[Dihydroxyaluminium sodium carbonate]]
*[[Aloglutamol]], tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethanegluconate dihydroxyaluminate
*[[Aluminium monostearate]]
*[[Carafate]]
*[[Sucralfate]]

'''Hydroxyaluminium''', Al(OH), also known as '''monobasic aluminium''' or '''basic aluminium''', is divalent, and known in these compounds:
*Hydroxyaluminium diacetate, HOAl(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as [[aluminium diacetate]], basic aluminium diacetate, basic aluminium acetate, monobasic aluminium acetate

Aluminium, Al, is trivalent. [[Aluminium triacetate]], Al(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a complete molecule without any hydroxy groups, so it is not a "basic aluminum" compound.

[[Aluminium hydroxide]], Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, aluminium with three hydroxy groups attached, is a complete molecule, so it is not a "basic aluminum" compound.

[[Aluminium acetate]] is a name for three salts in the solid state: dihydroxyaluminium aluminium acetate, hydroxyaluminium diacetate, and [[aluminium triacetate]], Al(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In aqueous solution, aluminium triacetate hydrolyses to form a mixture of the other two, so all solutions of all three can be referred to simply as "aluminium acetate", as the species co-exist and inter-convert in [[chemical equilibrium]].

'''Chang Yi Wang''' ({{zh|t='''王長怡'''|s='''王长怡'''|first=t}})

Dr. Wang is the founder of United Biomedical, Inc. (UBI) , headquartered in Hauppauge, New York, and its group of companies in Asia. She has served as chief scientific officer of UBI since its inception in December 1985, and as chairperson and chief executive officer of the UBI Group of companies since 1998. Dr. Wang is the author of more than 120 peer-reviewed scientific publications and she is the inventor of more than 100 patents to date. She has given various keynote and plenary lectures both nationally and internationally in the areas of [[Immunology]], vaccination, immunotherapeutics and [[Infectious disease]]. She has also served on the scientific review committee for the Cooperative Research Partnerships for BioDefense and Allergy and Immunobiology programs funded and administered by the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH) . In 2007, the New York Intellectual Property Law Association ( NYIPLA) presented Dr. Wang with the Inventor of the Year Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Medical-Patent-Week/2007-06-17/55061720077MP.html/ |title=United Biomedical, Inc.

In 2018, the Brain Mapping Foundation presented Dr. Wang with the Pioneer in Technology Award for her contribution in the development of therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.

== Early life and education ==

Dr. Wang was born in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. She attended the prestigious [[Taipei First Girls' High School]], where she first became aware of the double helix structure of [[DNA]], which served as one of the primary motivators for her lifetime pursuit of biomedical sciences.
She graduated with honor from [[National Taiwan University]] in 1973, majoring in chemistry. Dr. Wang was the first Asian woman accepted into the graduate program at [[Rockefeller University]] in the United States, where in 1979 she received a Ph.D. degree with dual specialization in [[Biochemistry]] and [[Immunology]]. She joined the [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] from 1979 to 1985, becoming its youngest faculty member, principal investigator and head of the molecular immunology laboratory, endowed by the Arthur J. and Leslie Levine Fund.

==Career in immunology and entrepreneurship in the biomedical industry==

Dr. Wang has been a pioneer in advocating “immunology as a secret weapon in medicine,” combined with personal motivation for developing medical interventions via application of basic biomedical sciences. Her first such achievements in terms of immunological applications of synthetic peptides were antibody screening immunoassays employing highly optimized synthetic viral peptide antigens. The first involved developing a synthetic peptide-based HIV 1, and later an HIV 1,2 diagnostic test for blood screening, both of which received U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval, in 1989 and 1996, respectively. These tests were subsequently recognized by the [[WHO]] as being suitable for worldwide use. Her other contributions in this area include synthetic peptide-based blood screening diagnostics for [[HTLV]] I/II and the [[Hepatitis C virus]] (HCV), which received CE certification and was sold in the global market through Organon Teknika /[[Biomerieux]] since 1991, as well as screening diagnostics for the SARS coronavirus, and diagnostic tests for the differentiation of infected vs. vaccinated animals for foot and mouth disease.

Since 1992, she has received support and guidance from Dr. James D. Watson, the co-discoverer of the double-helix DNA structure and a board member of United Biomedical, Inc at the time, in the courageous pursuit of many challenging vaccine and immunotherapy programs employing designer synthetic peptides.

At the invitation of the Taiwanese government (Ministry of Economic Affairs and National Development Fund), Dr. Wang, representing UBI US, established UBI-Asia as a joint venture with Taiwanese government Agencies. Upon establishing UBI Asia in Taiwan in 1999, Dr. Wang’s mission was to position UBI Asia as the center of excellence in the protein and monoclonal antibody drug-development area. In line with her mission, she assembled and led a team of scientists and industrial experts to ensure the establishment of an integrated platform technology and a rich pipeline of high-impact products. The UBI-421 monoclonal antibody, first in this pipeline and also a brainchild of hers with a series of issued and pending patents, is in phase III trials for HIV treatment as a HAART substitution, as well as other applications including functional cure. Many other products are currently in various preclinical and clinical stages of development. In order to fully develop and commercialize these products, two companies, United BioPharma and UBI Pharma, were spun off from UBI Asia to allow dedicated resources for commercialization of the respective pipelines of monoclonal antibodies and long-acting protein drugs. The two companies have also established respective state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at both Hsin Chu, Taiwan and Yangzhou, China to prepare for commercialization of these innovative protein drugs worldwide.

==Challenging Chiron’s broad HCV epitope claims and worldwide HCV patents==

Dr. Wang’s patent for diagnostic [[Hepatitis C virus]] (HCV) peptide epitopes was the first such patent issued in the United States which was also subsequently licensed to Roche Diagnostics. Partnering with distributor Organon Teknika/[[Biomerieux]], UBI’s peptide
antigen-based HCV blood-screening test was a success in Europe in the early 1990s. However, patent litigation ensued between
Chiron et al. and UBI et al. regarding Chiron’s broadly claimed HCV epitope patent. Six [[Nobel laureates]]  served as expert witnesses and judicial advisors in the UK court to dispute the validity of the broadly claimed Chiron HCV epitope/peptide patent. Following years of litigation and Dr. Wang’s valiant efforts in putting forth technical arguments challenging the validity of Chiron’s overly broad HCV epitope claims, UBI prevailed. In the year of 2000, the Technical Board of the European Patent Office invalidated all overly broad HCV epitope claims. Meanwhile, the UK’s Section 44 patent law was also repealed at the advice of a team of experts including patent barristers and judges setting a case for “lack of support can be used to attack the breadth of patent claims even after the patent is issued”. This result freed up valuable information derived from detailed [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] sequences for public research and follow-up inventions, finally allowing for worldwide use of the vast amount of [[Genomic sequence]] generated by the biomedical community.

==Pioneering high precision designer peptide-based vaccines and immunotherapeutics as a new class of biologicals==

For the past 25 years, Dr. Wang has dedicated herself to the discovery, design and development of a new class of biologicals comprising [[Immunotherapeutics]] and vaccines for the therapy and prevention of chronic and infectious diseases, and companion diagnostics for monitoring treatment and control of these diseases. The resultant peptide-based biologicals act by directing the immune system to specific functional target sites and have great potential in a wide range of therapeutic areas.

Under her direction, “UBITh”, a new platform technology in high precision peptide immunogen design for the development of innovative vaccines and immunotherapeutics, was established. Some examples include a site-specific UBITh amyloid-β vaccine and Tau vaccine for Alzheimer’s disease, a site-specific Alpha Synuclein vaccine for Parkinson’s disease, an IgE vaccine for allergic diseases, and others for multiple human and animal health applications, including an LHRH vaccine for boar taint removal via immunocastration, and vaccines against infections caused by [[Porcine circovirus]], [[Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus]], and [[Foot and mouth disease]] viruses. Validation for the UBITh vaccine
technology has been demonstrated by achieving the long-sought goal of producing a [[Synthetic peptide]] vaccine for [[Foot and mouth disease]], selling over 3 billion doses since introduction in 2007 in China, the largest swine market.

== First Asian female recipient of the NYIPLA Inventor of the Year Award ==

The [[New York Intellectual Property Law Association]]’s Inventor of the Year award recognizes an individual or group who, through inventive talents, has made worthwhile contributions to society by promoting “the progress of science and useful arts”. Dr. Chang Yi Wang was the 2007 recipient for her work on “UBITh peptide immunogens”. Dr. Wang’s work on synthetic peptide-based immunotherapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics made her the first Asian female recipient of the prestigious award.

== Recipient of the 2018 Pioneer in Technology Award given by the Brain Mapping Foundation ==

The [[Brain Mapping Foundation]] (BMF) is established for the purpose of facilitating multidisciplinary brain and spinal cord research, and expediting integration of cutting-edge technologies into the field of Neuroscience. Dr. Wang was the 2018 recipient for Pioneer in Technology Award given by the foundation for her cumulative work on the development of high precision endobody vaccines for the treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.

== Personal life ==

Dr. Wang divides her time between the United States and Taiwan, actively engaged in R&amp;D and business development activities in biomedical applications. Her husband, Nean Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedbiomedical.com/Cor_Info/Default.asp/ |title=Management Team |publisher=UBI |date= |accessdate=2011-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607050230/http://www.unitedbiomedical.com/Cor_Info/Default.asp |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; , devotes his time to UBI’s subsidiaries in Shanghai, China. She has one daughter, Mei Mei Hu, JD, who serves as co-CEO of United Biomedical Inc. (UBI) and CEO of United NeuroScience(UNS).

==A Commemoration of Chang Yi Wang’s Mentors==
'''Robert B. Merrifield'''

In 1974, Chang Yi, already an astute organic chemist as a result of her undergraduate training at National Taiwan University, joined Dr. Merrifield’s laboratory at Rockefeller University as a
first-year Ph.D. student, learning the many facets of solid-phase peptide chemistry. Dr. Merrifield won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 for his pioneering work in solid-phase peptide synthesis.
Chang Yi’s use of this synthetic tool for some of her inventions in immunological applications in diagnostics, vaccines and immunotherapeutics began in the mid ‘80s.

'''Henry G. Kunkel'''

Dr. Kunkel, often referred to as “the father of immunopathology” was Chang Yi’s Ph.D. dissertation advisor from 1975 to 1979 at Rockefeller University. He trained Chang Yi as an investigator, teaching her how to master a few simple technologies and apply them to the most important subjects, and how an inquisitive mind can discover intriguing findings in an ignored corner that few can fathom.

'''Gerald M. Edelman'''

Dr. Edelman, an American biologist who received his Ph.D. training at Dr. Kunkel’s laboratory, shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work with Rodney R. Porter on the immune system. Specifically, the Nobel Prize was given for his discovery of the structure of antibody molecules. Dr. Edelman and his laboratory colleagues taught immunology and biochemistry classes at Rockefeller University and were instrumental in leading Chang Yi to the most exciting, yet then still primitive, field of immunology.

'''Ralph M. Steinman'''

Dr. Steinman, a Canadian Immunologist and cell biologist, was one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity. He was the first teacher at the Rockefeller University to bring Chang Yi to the intriguing field of cellular immunology at a time when he was describing his EM finding of dendrite-like immune cells later known as the dendritic cells, critical for initiating the immune responses.

'''Robert A. Good'''

Dr. Good, regarded as a founder of modern immunology, was an American physician who performed the first successful human bone marrow transplant between persons who were not identical twins. Chang Yi was recruited immediately after receiving her Ph.D. degree as an independent Principal Investigator and Head of Laboratory of Molecular Immunology by Dr. Good, then president of the Sloan Kettering Institute of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in Manhattan, the world’s largest cancer center.
Her work in the early ‘80s used specific monoclonal antibodies to define several critical lymphocyte surface markers (LEU1, LEU3, LEU4, LEU10, LEU13, LEU14 and the idiotypic leukemic T cell marker, also known as the T cell receptor).

'''Lloyd J. Old'''

Dr. Old was one of the founders and standard bearers of the field of cancer immunology. Chang Yi’s entry into the tumor immunology and cytokine fields originated from a collaboration with Dr. Old while at the MSKCC by characterizing a tumor necrosis factor defined by Dr. Old’s laboratory in the ‘70s found in mice serum. The cytokine was purified to homogeneity as a 17KD molecule before it was cloned by Cetus in 1983.
Monoclonal antibodies to cytokines including TNF-alpha, funding through a NCI contract, and other tumor-specific antigens—mostly heat-stable glycolipids—were developed in the mid-‘80s by Chang Yi’s laboratory for further clinical applications.

'''Clorpt''' (or '''Corpt''') is a [[mnemonic]] for [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)|Hans Jenny]]'s [[state equation]] for the factors influencing soil formation:

: {{math| '''&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} ''f''(&lt;var&gt;cl&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/var&gt;)''' }}

* {{math| '''&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;''' [[soil formation]]
* '''&lt;var&gt;cl&lt;/var&gt;''' (sometimes '''&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;''') [[climate]]
* '''&lt;var&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;''' organisms ([[soil microbiology]], [[soil mesofauna]], [[soil biology]])
* '''&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;''' [[topographic relief|relief]]
* '''&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;''' [[parent material]]
* '''&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;''' [[time]] }}

There are two principal methods that the state equation may be solved: first in a theoretical or conceptual manner by logical deductions from certain premises, and second empirically by experimentation or field observation.  
The empirical method is still mostly employed today, and soil formation can be defined by varying a single factor and keeping the other factors constant. This led to the development of empirical models to describe [[pedogenesis]], such as climofunctions, biofunctions, topofunctions, lithofunctions, and chronofunctions. Since Hans Jenny  published his formulation in 1941, it has been used by innumerable [[soil survey]]ors all over the world as a qualitative list for understanding the factors that may be important for producing the soil pattern within a region.

The term ''clorpt'' is mainly used for empirical quantitative prediction with the purposes of making [[Digital soil mapping|digital soil maps]]. In this approach, the state-factor equation was put explicitly into a spatial framework and the factors were also observed in the same spatial domain. Some people have termed the approach ''environmental correlation'', associated with using [[stratigraphy]], [[digital terrain model]]s and gamma radiometric surveys, to predict and map soil properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1991/01000/The_Place_of_Humans_in_the_State_Factor_Theory_of.12.aspx|title = THE PLACE OF HUMANS IN THE STATE FACTOR THEORY OF ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR SOILS.|last = Amundson, Jenny|date = January 1991|journal = Soil Science: An interdisciplinary approach to soil research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.lion.hsc.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=882015a5-3f69-4204-8af3-2de14df9e31d%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4204&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=16018626&amp;db=a9h|title = Reflections on the Nature of Soil and Its Biomantle.|last = Johnson|date = March 2005|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2005.00448.x |pmid = |access-date = 30 November 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Compact Muon Solenoid''' ('''CMS''') experiment is one of two large general-purpose [[particle physics]] [[Particle detector|detectors]] built on the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]] and [[France]].  The goal of  CMS experiment is to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the [[Higgs boson]], [[extra dimensions]], and particles that could make up [[dark matter]].

CMS is 21.6&amp;nbsp;metres long, 15&amp;nbsp;m in [[diameter]], and weighs about 14,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/publications/PDF/CERN-CMS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018141526/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/publications/PDF/CERN-CMS.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 3,800 people, representing 199 scientific institutes and 43 countries, form the CMS collaboration who built and now operate the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/content/cms-collaboration|title=CMS Collaboration - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in an underground cavern at [[Cessy]] in [[France]], just across the border from [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]].

==Background==
Recent collider experiments such as the now-dismantled [[LEP|Large Electron-Positron Collider]] and the newly renovated [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at CERN, as well as the ({{As of|October 2011|lc=on}}) recently closed [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] have provided remarkable insights into, and precision tests of, the [[Standard Model]] of Particle Physics. A principle achievement of these experiments (specifically of the LHC) is the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model [[Higgs boson]], the particle resulting from the [[Higgs mechanism]], which provides an explanation for the masses of elementary particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Higgs Boson|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson|website=CERN: Accelerating Science|publisher=CERN|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are still many questions that future collider experiments hope to answer.  These include uncertainties in the mathematical behaviour of the Standard Model at high energies, tests of proposed theories of [[dark matter]] (including [[supersymmetry]]), and the reasons for the [[CP Violation|imbalance]] of matter and antimatter observed in the Universe.

==Physics goals==
The main goals of the experiment are:
* to explore physics at the [[TeV]] scale
* to further study the properties of the [[Higgs boson]], already discovered by CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]
* to look for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as [[supersymmetry]], or [[extra dimensions]]
* to study aspects of heavy ion collisions.

The [[ATLAS experiment]], at the other side of the LHC ring is designed with similar goals in mind, and the two experiments are designed to complement each other both to extend reach and to provide corroboration of findings. CMS and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] uses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system to achieve the goals.

==Detector summary==
CMS is designed as a general-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of [[proton]] collisions at 0.9-13 [[TeV]], the [[Special relativity|center-of-mass]] energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] particle accelerator.

The CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates a magnetic field of 4 teslas, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magnetic field is confined by a steel 'yoke' that forms the bulk of the detector's weight of 12 500 tonnes. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead of being built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHC experiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being lowered underground in 15 sections and reassembled.

It contains subsystems which are designed to measure the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of [[photons]], [[electrons]], [[muons]], and other products of the collisions.  The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker.  Surrounding it is a [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillating]] [[stolzite|crystal]] electromagnetic [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeter]], which is itself surrounded with a sampling calorimeter for hadrons.  The tracker and the calorimetry are compact enough to fit inside the CMS [[Solenoid]] which generates a powerful magnetic field of 3.8 [[tesla (unit)|T]].  Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the return yoke of the magnet.

==CMS by layers==
For full technical details about the CMS detector, please see the [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/922757/files/lhcc-2006-001.pdf Technical Design Report].&lt;ref&gt;http://cds.cern.ch/record/922757&lt;/ref&gt;

===The interaction point===
This is the point in the centre of the detector at which [[proton]]-proton collisions occur between the two counter-rotating beams of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]. At each end of the detector magnets focus the beams into the interaction point. At collision each beam has a radius of 17&amp;nbsp;μm and the crossing angle between the beams is 285&amp;nbsp;μrad.

At full design [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] each of the two LHC beams will contain 2,808 bunches of {{val|1.15|e=11}} protons. The interval between crossings is 25&amp;nbsp;ns, although the number of collisions per second is only 31.6 million due to gaps in the beam as injector magnets are activated and deactivated.

At full luminosity each collision will produce an average of 20 proton-proton interactions. The collisions occur at a centre of mass energy of 8&amp;nbsp;TeV. But, it is worth noting that for studies of physics at the electroweak scale, the scattering events are initiated by a single quark or gluon from each proton, and so the actual energy involved in each collision will be lower as the total centre of mass energy is shared by these quarks and gluons (determined by the [[parton distribution functions]]).

The first test which ran in September 2008 was expected to operate at a lower collision energy of 10&amp;nbsp;TeV but this was prevented by the 19 September 2008 shutdown. When at this target level, the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.

===Layer 1 – The tracker===
Momentum of particles is crucial in helping us to build up a picture of events at the heart of the collision. One method to calculate the momentum of a particle is to track its path through a magnetic field; the more curved the path, the less momentum the particle had. The CMS tracker records the paths taken by charged particles by finding their positions at a number of key points.

The tracker can reconstruct the paths of high-energy muons, electrons and hadrons (particles made up of quarks) as well as see tracks coming from the decay of very short-lived particles such as beauty or “b quarks” that will be used to study the differences between matter and antimatter.

The tracker needs to record particle paths accurately yet be lightweight so as to disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10&amp;nbsp;µm, a fraction of the width of a human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/tracker-detector|title=Tracker detector - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMS tracker is made entirely of silicon: the pixels, at the very core of the detector and dealing with the highest intensity of particles, and the silicon microstrip detectors that surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The tracker employs sensors covering an area the size of a tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in the pixel detector there are some 6000 connections per square centimetre.

The CMS silicon tracker consists of 13 layers in the central region and 14 layers in the endcaps. The innermost three layers (up to 11&amp;nbsp;cm radius) consist of 100×150 μm pixels, 66 million in total.

The next four layers (up to 55&amp;nbsp;cm radius) consist of {{nowrap|10 cm × 180 μm}} silicon strips, followed by the remaining six layers of {{nowrap|25 cm × 180 μm}} strips, out to a radius of 1.1&amp;nbsp;m. There are 9.6 million strip channels in total.

During full luminosity collisions the occupancy of the pixel layers per event is expected to be 0.1%, and 1–2% in the strip layers. The expected [[High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider|HL-LHC]] upgrade will increase the number of interactions to the point where over-occupancy would significantly reduce trackfinding effectiveness. An upgrade is planned to increase the performance and the radiation tolerance of the tracker.

This part of the detector is the world's largest silicon detector. It has 205&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of silicon sensors (approximately the area of a tennis court) comprising 76 million channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/32915 CMS installs the world's largest silicon detector], CERN Courier, Feb 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layer 2 – The Electromagnetic Calorimeter===
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is designed to measure with high accuracy the energies of [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s.

The ECAL is constructed from crystals of [[lead tungstate]], PbWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This is an extremely dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but with a touch of oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and [[Scintillator|scintillates]] when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle’s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a [[radiation length]] of χ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.89&amp;nbsp;cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25&amp;nbsp;ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;22&amp;nbsp;mm and a depth of 230&amp;nbsp;mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon [[avalanche photodiodes]] for readout.

The ECAL, made up of a barrel section and two ”endcaps”, forms a layer between the tracker and the HCAL. The cylindrical “barrel” consists of 61,200 crystals formed into 36 “supermodules”, each weighing around three tonnes and containing 1700 crystals. The flat ECAL endcaps seal off the barrel at either end and are made up of almost 15,000 further crystals.

For extra spatial precision, the ECAL also contains preshower detectors that sit in front of the endcaps. These allow CMS to distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting physics) and the less interesting close pairs of low-energy photons.

At the endcaps the ECAL inner surface is covered by the preshower subdetector, consisting of two layers of [[lead]] interleaved with two layers of silicon strip detectors. Its purpose is to aid in pion-photon discrimination.

===Layer 3 – The Hadronic Calorimeter===
[[Image:CMS Hcal 26 01 2007.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Half of the Hadron Calorimeter]]
The Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of [[hadrons]], particles made of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] (for example [[protons]], [[neutrons]], [[pions]] and [[kaons]]). Additionally it provides indirect measurement of the presence of non-interacting, uncharged particles such as [[neutrinos]].

The HCAL consists of layers of dense material ([[brass]] or [[steel]]) interleaved with tiles of plastic [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillators]], read out via wavelength-shifting fibres by [[hybrid photodiodes]]. This combination was determined to allow the maximum amount of absorbing material inside of the magnet coil.

The high [[pseudorapidity]] region &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (3.0 \;&lt;\; |\eta| \;&lt;\; 5.0)&lt;/math&gt; is instrumented by the Hadronic Forward (HF) detector. Located 11&amp;nbsp;m either side of the interaction point, this uses a slightly different technology of steel absorbers and quartz fibres for readout, designed to allow better separation of particles in the congested forward region.
The HF is also used  to measure the relative online luminosity system in CMS.

About half of the brass used in the endcaps of the HCAL used to be Russian artillery shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/using-russian-navy-shells|title=Using Russian navy shells - CMS Experiment|website=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layer 4 – The magnet===
The CMS magnet is the central device around which the experiment is built, with a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth’s. CMS has a large [[solenoid]] magnet.  This allows the charge/mass ratio of particles to be determined from the curved track that they follow in the magnetic field.  It is 13&amp;nbsp;m long and 6&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, and its refrigerated superconducting niobium-titanium coils were originally intended to produce a 4&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The operating field was scaled down to 3.8&amp;nbsp;T instead of the full design strength in order to maximize longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/5/03/T03021/pdf/1748-0221_5_03_T03021.pdf Precise mapping of the magnetic field in the CMS barrel yoke using cosmic rays]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inductance of the magnet is 14&amp;nbsp;[[henries|Η]] and the nominal current for 4&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 19,500&amp;nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a total stored energy of 2.66&amp;nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]], equivalent to about half-a-tonne of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]]. There are dump circuits to safely dissipate this energy should the magnet [[Superconducting magnet#Magnet quench|quench]].  The circuit resistance (essentially just the cables from the power converter to the [[cryostat]]) has a value of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mΩ which leads to a circuit time constant of nearly 39 hours.  This is the longest time constant of any circuit at CERN.  The operating current for 3.8&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]] is 18,160&amp;nbsp;[[ampere|A]], giving a stored energy of 2.3&amp;nbsp;[[gigajoule|GJ]].

The job of the big magnet is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a measure of momentum. CMS began with the aim of having the strongest magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles.

The tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly inside the magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure that surrounds the magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this “return yoke” reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment’s structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.

===Layer 5 – The muon detectors and return yoke===
As the name “Compact Muon Solenoid” suggests, detecting [[muons]] is one of CMS’s most important tasks. Muons are charged particles that are just like [[electrons]] and [[positrons]], but are 200 times more massive. We expect them to be produced in the decay of a number of potential new particles; for instance, one of the clearest "signatures" of the [[Higgs Boson]] is its decay into four muons.

Because muons can penetrate several metres of iron without interacting, unlike most particles they are not stopped by any of CMS's calorimeters. Therefore, chambers to detect muons are placed at the very edge of the experiment where they are the only particles likely to register a signal.

To identify [[muon]]s and measure their momenta, CMS uses three types of detector: [[wire chamber|drift tubes]] (DT), [[cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) and [[resistive plate chambers]] (RPC).  The DTs are used for precise trajectory measurements in the central ''barrel'' region, while the CSCs are used in the ''end caps''. The RPCs provide a fast signal when a muon passes through the muon detector, and are installed in both the barrel and the end caps.

The [[drift tube]] (DT) system measures [[muon]] positions in the barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) as well as by calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.

[[Cathode strip chambers]] (CSC) are used in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.

[[Resistive plate chambers]] (RPC) are fast gaseous detectors that provide a muon trigger system parallel with those of the DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).

==Collecting and collating the data==

===Pattern recognition===
New particles discovered in CMS will be typically [[Particle decay|unstable]] and rapidly transform into a cascade of lighter, more stable and better understood particles. Particles travelling through CMS leave behind characteristic patterns, or ‘signatures’, in the different layers, allowing them to be identified. The presence (or not) of any new particles can then be inferred.

===Trigger system===
To have a good chance of producing a rare particle, such as a [[Higgs boson]], a very large number of collisions is required. Most collision events in the detector are "soft" and do not produce interesting effects. The amount of raw data from each crossing is approximately 1&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]], which at the 40&amp;nbsp;MHz crossing rate would result in 40&amp;nbsp;[[terabytes]] of data a second, an amount that the experiment cannot hope to store, let alone process properly. The full trigger system reduces the rate of interesting events down to a manageable 1000 per second.

To accomplish this, a series of "trigger" stages are employed. All the data from each crossing is held in buffers within the detector while a small amount of key information is used to perform a fast, approximate calculation to identify features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy. This "Level 1" calculation is completed in around 1&amp;nbsp;µs, and event rate is reduced by a factor of about thousand down to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz. All these calculations are done on fast, custom hardware using reprogrammable [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA).

If an event is passed by the Level 1 trigger all the data still buffered in the detector is sent over [[fibre-optic]] links to the "High Level" trigger, which is software (mainly written in [[C++]]) running on ordinary computer servers. The lower event rate in the High Level trigger allows time for much more detailed analysis of the event to be done than in the Level 1 trigger. The High Level trigger reduces the event rate by a further factor of hundred down to 1000 events per second. These are then stored on tape for future analysis.

===Data analysis===
Data that has passed the triggering stages and been stored on tape is duplicated using the [[LHC Computing Grid|Grid]] to additional sites around the world for easier access and redundancy. Physicists are then able to use the Grid to access and run their analyses on the data.

There are a huge range of analyses performed at CMS, including:
* Performing precision measurements of Standard Model particles, which allows both for furthering the knowledge of these particles and also for the collaboration to calibrate the detector and measure the performance of various components.
* Searching for events with large amounts of missing transverse energy, which implies the presence of particles that have passed through the detector without leaving a signature. In the [[Standard Model]] only [[neutrinos]] would traverse the detector without being detected but a wide range of [[Beyond the Standard Model]] theories contain new particles that would also result in missing transverse energy.
* Studying the [[kinematics]] of pairs of particles produced by the decay of a parent, such as the [[Z boson]] decaying to a pair of electrons or the [[Higgs boson]] decaying to a pair of [[tau lepton]]s or [[photons]], to determine various properties and mass of the parent.
* Looking at jets of particles to study the way the partons ([[quarks]] and [[gluons]]) in the collided protons have interacted, or to search for evidence of new physics that manifests in hadronic final states.
* Searching for high particle multiplicity final states (predicted by many new physics theories) is an important strategy because common Standard Model particle decays very rarely contain a large number of particles, and those processes that do are well understood.

==Etymology==
The term Compact Muon Solenoid comes from the relatively compact size of the detector, the fact that it detects muons, and the use of solenoids in the detector.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel, Ammir D. "Present at the Creation: Discovering the Higgs Boson". Random House, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "CMS" is also a reference to the [[Center-of-momentum frame|center-of-mass system]], an important concept in particle physics.

{{other uses|Dido (disambiguation){{!}}Dido}}
'''DIDO''' was a materials testing [[nuclear reactor]] at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It used [[enriched uranium]] metal fuel, and [[heavy water]] as both [[neutron moderator]] and primary coolant. There was also a [[graphite]] [[neutron reflector]] surrounding the core. In the design phase, DIDO was known as '''AE334''' after its engineering design number.

DIDO was designed to have a high [[neutron flux]], largely to reduce the time required for testing of materials intended for use in nuclear power reactors. This also allowed for the production of intense beams of neutrons for use in [[neutron diffraction]].

DIDO was shut down in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harwell Decommissioning Update 3|url=http://www.orau.gov/ddsc/projects/Harwell_update_3.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary facilities decommissioning is expected to be complete in 2023 with the reactor decommissioning completed in 2031 and final site clearance achieved in 2064 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Decommissioning Authority Harwell Site|url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/sites/harwell/|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In all, six DIDO class reactors were constructed based on this design:

*DIDO.
*[[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], also at Harwell, first criticality 1957.
*[[HIFAR]] ([[Australia]]), first criticality January 1958.
*[[Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor]] (DMTR) at [[Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment]] in Scotland, first criticality May 1958.
*DR-3 at [[Risø National Laboratory]] ([[Denmark]]), first criticality January 1960. &lt;ref&gt;http://sundhedsstyrelsen.dk/da/sundhed/straalebeskyttelse/nukleare-anlaegatomanlaeg/udgivelser/~/media/41E3012B782547DE9711945FB39E5E52.ashx p.15, retrieved 19 February 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[FRJ-II]] at [[Jülich Research Centre]] ([[Germany]]), first criticality 1962.

HIFAR was the last to shut down, in 2007.

In [[metadata]], '''dimension''' is a set of equivalent units of measure, where equivalence between two units of measure is determined by the existence of a quantity preserving one-to-one correspondence between values measured in one unit of measure and values measured in the other unit of measure, independent of context, and where characterizing operations are the same.

The equivalence defined here forms an equivalence relation on the set of all units of measure.  Each equivalence class corresponds to a dimensionality.  The units of measure "temperature in degrees Fahrenheit" and "temperature in degrees Celsius" have the same dimensionality, because given a value measured in degrees Fahrenheit there is a value measured in degrees Celsius with the same quantity, and vice versa.   Quantity preserving one-to-one correspondences are the well-known equations Cº = (5/9)*(Fº&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;32) and Fº = (9/5)*(Cº)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32.

Units of measure are not limited to physical categories. Examples of physical categories are: linear measure, area, volume, mass, velocity, time duration.Examples of non-physical categories are: currency, quality indicator, colour intensity.

Quantities may be grouped together into categories of quantities which are mutually comparable.  Lengths, diameters, distances, heights, wavelengths and so on would constitute such a category.  Mutually comparable quantities have the same dimensionality.  [[ISO 31-0]] calls these ''quantities of the same kind''.

'''Discursive deracialization''' is a term used for the rhetorical removal of '[[Race (human categorization)|race]]' from potentially racially motivated arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, S., &amp; Burke, S. (2011). Discursive deracialization in talk about asylum seeking. Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology, 21(2), 111-123. doi:10.1002/casp.1065&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier known as "deracialization of discourse",&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; discursive deracialization is where the opposition to, or negative representations of, minority out-groups is attributed to reasons other than race.&lt;ref&gt;Augoustinos, M., &amp; Every, D. (2007). The language of "race" and prejudice: A discourse of denial, reason, and liberal-practical politics.

'''Douglass''' is a crater in the east of [[Thaumasia quadrangle]] of Mars and in the east of [[Aonia Terra]], located at 51.8°S latitude and 70.6°W longitude.  It is 94.0&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Andrew E. Douglass]], and the name was approved in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Douglass|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1631|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wikidouglasseast.jpg|thumb|left|East side of Douglass Crater, as seen by CTX camera (on [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]).]]
The crater is located nearly WNW of [[Halley (Martian crater)|Halley]] and east of the ringed crater of [[Lowell (Martian crater)|Lowell]]. A third of the way to Halley is [[Ogygis Undae]] which s the only named dune field in the southern hemisphere. Further east is [[Argyre Planitia]], southwest is [[Aonia Planum]] and north is Phrixi Rupes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">An '''electrochromic device''' ('''ECD''') controls optical properties such as optical transmission, absorption, reflectance and/or emittance in a continual but reversible manner on application of voltage ([[electrochromism]]). This property enables an ECD to be used for applications like [[smart glass]], electrochromic mirrors, and electrochromic display devices.

== History ==
The history of coloration goes back to 1704 when Diesbach discovered [[Prussian blue]] (hexacyanoferrate), which changes the color from transparent to blue under oxidation of iron. In the 1930s, Kobosew and Nekrassow first noted electrochemical coloration in bulk tungsten oxide. While working at Balzers in Lichtenstein, T. Kraus provided a detailed description of electrochemical coloration in thin film of [[tungsten trioxide]] (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on 30 July 1953. In 1969, S. K. Deb demonstrated electrochromic coloration in WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films.&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Deb, Appl. Opt., 8(S1) (1969) 192&lt;/ref&gt; Deb observed electrochromic color by applying electric field of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Vcm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; across WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin film. In fact, the real birth of the EC technology is usually attributed to S. K. Deb’s seminal paper of 1973, wherein he described the coloration mechanism in WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Deb, Phil. Mag., 27 (1973) 801&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrochromism]] occurs due to the electrochemical redox reactions that take place in electrochromic materials. Various types of materials and structures can be used to construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications.

== Device structure ==
[[File:Bare bones of an electrochromic devices.png|thumbnail|500px|right|Electrochromic device structure]]

Electrochromic (sometimes called electrochromatic) devices are one kind of electrochromic cells. The basic structure of ECD consists of two EC layers separated by an electrolytic layer. The ECD works on an external voltage, for which the conducting electrodes are used on the either side of both EC layers. Electrochromic devices can be categorized in two types depending upon the kind of electrolyte used viz. Laminated ECD are the one in which liquid gel is used while in solid electrolyte EC devices solid inorganic or organic material is used. The basic structure of electrochromic device embodies five superimposed layers on one substrate or positioned between two substrates in a laminated configuration. In this structure there are three principally different kinds of layered materials in the ECD: The EC layer and ion-storage layer conduct ions and electrons and belong to the class of mixed conductors. The electrolyte is a pure ion conductor and separates the two EC layers. The transparent conductors are pure electron conductors. Optical absorption occurs when electrons move into the EC layers from the transparent conductors along with charge balancing ions entering from the electrolyte.

=== Solid-state ECD ===
In solid-state electrochromic devices, solid [[inorganic]] or [[Organic compound|organic]] material is used as the [[electrolyte]]. Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the most extensively studied inorganic solid electrolytes.

=== Laminated ECD ===
Laminated electrochromic devices are the ones in which a liquid gel is used as the electrolyte.

[[File:Modes of Electrochromic Device (ECD) Operation.png|thumb|500px|right|Modes of electrochromic device operation]]
Typically, ECD are of two types depending on the modes of device operation, namely the transmission mode and reflectance mode. In the transmission mode, the conducting electrodes are transparent and control the light intensity passing through them; this mode is used in smart-window applications.  In the reflectance mode, one of the transparent conducting electrodes (TCE) is replaced with a reflective surface like aluminum, gold or silver, which controls the reflective light intensity; this mode is useful in [[rear-view mirror|rear-view mirrors]] of cars and EC display devices.

== Applications ==

=== EC windows ===
[[Image:ANA Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner electrochromic window.jpg|thumb|right|ANA Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner electrochromic window]]
Electrochromic windows, also known as smart windows, are a new technological arrangement for achieving energy efficiency in buildings, with variable transmittance of light and solar energy.  These ‘‘smart windows’’ can automatically control the amount of light and solar energy passing through the windows which subsequently improves indoor comfort; for example, electrochromic glass provides better glare resistance than fritted glass in most direct sunlight applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-01|title=Electrochromic glass vs. fritted glass: an analysis of glare control performance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610217329387|journal=Energy Procedia|language=en|volume=122|pages=343–348|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2017.07.334|issn=1876-6102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of these windows will vary depending on their placement, size, and local climate conditions since these factors influence the amount of sunlight that comes in contact with these windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-04-01|title=Conventional fixed shading devices in comparison to an electrochromic glazing system in hot, dry climate|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778812006809|journal=Energy and Buildings|language=en|volume=59|pages=104–110|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.12.031|issn=0378-7788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrochromic windows generally achieve their control over light and heat through their layered design. These layers within the window allow for tinting of the glass in response to increases in incoming sunlight as well as protection against UV radiation. An example of this layered design is the electrochromic glass developed by Gesimat, where multiple layers of material (i.e. tungsten oxide, polyvinyl butyral, and Prussian Blue) are sandwiched by two dual layers of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-03-06|title=Large-area electrochromic glazing with ion-conducting PVB interlayer and two complementary electrodeposited electrochromic layers|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024805001406|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|language=en|volume=90|issue=4|pages=469–476|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2005.01.019|issn=0927-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the tungsten oxide and Prussian Blue layers form complementary electrochromic layers; essentially, this means they form the positive and negative ends of a battery using the incoming solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-12-01|title=Properties, performance and current status of the laminated electrochromic glass of Gesimat|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024809001809|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|language=en|volume=93|issue=12|pages=2088–2092|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2009.05.010|issn=0927-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) forms the central layer in this configuration, and it serves as a polymer electrolyte (this allows for the flow of ions which, in turn, generates a current).

=== EC mirror ===
Electrochromic reflecting surfaces are employed as self darkening mirrors that regulate reflections of flashing light from following vehicles at night so that a driver can see them without discomfort.
[[Image:Gentex Mirror.jpg|thumb|225px|right|An auto-dimming car mirror]]

=== EC display ===
Electrochromic display operating in either reflecting or transmitting mode. Advantages of EC display is Low power consumption and cheap.

However, there are various other display applications where ECD can be used viz. electrochromic paper, electrochromic goggles, motorcycle helmet-visors.  Electrochromic paper, which on touching it with a stylus electrode can create an image, has been prepared by incorporating ECs in paper.  Furthermore, visors of helmets and goggles can be colored to a chosen degree at day times and bleached during the night.

'''Ernst Csiki''', or '''Ernő Csiki (Csíki)''' ({{lang-hu|'''Csiki (Csíki) Ernő'''}}, 1875 in [[Vulcan, Hunedoara|Vulkan]] &amp;ndash; 1954 in [[Budapest]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Coleoptera]].

He was, between 1897 and 1932, Keeper of the Collections of the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] where his collection is conserved.

At the time of Ernő Csiki's retirement (1932) the beetle collection contained over 1 million specimens largely due to his purchases and his obtaining funding for expeditions.
Csiki wrote several parts of ''Coleopterorum Catalogus'' and many papers on Carpathian Coleoptera.

When trying to understand the self in terms of the brain, [[neuroscientist]]s have found contradictory results and [[paradox]]es. Nevertheless, Gonzalo Munevar has argued that neuroscience in an evolutionary context can give a proper explanation of the self. His Evolutionary Theory of the Self depends on, “the ability by the brain to coordinate new sensory information in light of the organism’s internal states and in the context of its personal history and genetic inheritance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gonzalo Munevar, Mathew L. Cole, Yongquan Ye, JieYang, Yi Zheng, Uday Krishnamurthy, and Mark Haacke, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” Neuroscience Discovery, 2014, http://www.hoajonline.com/journals/pdf/2052-6946-2-3.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is an alternative conception for the explanation of the self, which takes into account the [[evolutionary biology]] of the brain.

[[Organism]]s that are highly complex execute the function of telling self from other with the brain and the [[immune system]]. To fulfill the function of recognizing self from other, the brain uses past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] (e.g. survival, reproduction). The self is defined by these functions that distinguish an organisms from other organisms, which allow them to act as one whole entity in social and physical environments. Simply put, the theory revolves around the idea that the brain constitutes the self, which represents itself in a variety of internal states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;A. Damasio: The Feeling of What Happens, Harcourt Brace &amp; Co, New York 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“A Darwinian Account of Self and Free Will,” in Evolution 2.0: implications of Darwinism in Philosophy and the Social and Natural Sciences, ed. by Weinert, F. and Brinkworth, M.H. (Springer, 2011), pp. 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain/self evolves for action to be able to interact with social and physical environments. It is suggested that the brain performs a complex list of tasks to complete these interactions to distinguish self from other. This defines the brain to be characteristically distributive to complete complex tasks, and thus suggests that the self is also distributive. Therefore, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self detours from the traditional conceptions that include the self being a centralized, unitary mechanism that is both conscious (sense of self) and compiled of a collection of episodic memories. Alternatively, it suggests that the conception of self is mostly [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious]], and the brain evolves from past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] to create the evolutionary self.

In Munevar’s study, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” he aimed to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of this conception of the self as a distributive system, and discovered results complimenting the Evolutionary Theory of the Self while resolving the contradictions and paradoxes of traditional conceptions of self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==  Neuroscience problems and paradoxes of the self ==
One of the problems is that the results of brain-imaging studies of self-knowledge vary depending on the behavioral tasks chosen. Some studies use [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) to do self-attribution of personality traits, while others use [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). Other studies prefer to do tasks involving self-recognition (recognizing a photograph or yourself and others). Studies that use self-attribution studies, “find neural activation of the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC) as evidence for the self”, while studies consisting of self-recognition tasks find, “correlated activation of the right [[prefrontal lobe]] and regions of the [[Medial superior temporal area|medial]] and left hemisphere as evidence [[self-awareness]] and [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This variety of results of the studies have provided evidence for Gillihan and Farah to conclude that there is not a unitary and common [[neural system]] concerning the self, which leads into the next two problems of the traditional conception of self.&lt;ref name=gillihan&gt;Gillihan SJ and Farah MJ. ''Is self special? A critical review of evidence from experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience''. Psychol Bull. 2005; ''131'':76-97. | Article | PubMed&lt;/ref&gt; These problems are that the traditional conceptions of the self argue that the self is a unified mechanism that exists in a centralized area in the brain, and that the self is something we can consciously sense. The problems with these accounts are that there is scientific research contradicting the claims of traditional conceptions. Llinas suggests that the self is a form of perception and thus that the self is an invention of the brain just as secondary sensory qualities are.&lt;ref&gt;R. Llinas:  ''I of the Vortex'' (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is no one brain area that could account for the self, and he concludes that the self doesn’t exist. Although Llinas is confusing the conscious and unconscious self, because when he suggests the self as a form of perception he should be referring to the conscious self being a form of perception. Munevar suggests that Llinas is incorrect in assuming the self does not exist, because just as an elephant and the perception of an elephant are different things, so are the self and our perception of the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional conceptions also assume that the self is a collection of [[episodic memories]], since they are memories of the actions that sculpt our [[Personality psychology|personalities]], and therefore closely link personality and the self. According to Klein, in a study of patients who had lost their [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]] (the part of the brain responsible for memories), patients were able to recollect their knowledge of personality even in the absence of [[episodic memories]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Klein: The cognitive neuroscience of knowing one’s self. In ''The Cognitive Neurosciences''&lt;/ref&gt; This points to show that the trait summaries of their personality must have come around subconsciously, inferring that the self can exist even in the absence of [[episodic memories]]. Thus, the self cannot be a collection of [[episodic memories]].

== Solutions to the problems ==
The Evolutionary Theory points out that distributive systems are characteristic of the brain. Organisms need to identify itself from others in many complex ways, thus many areas of the brain are used when distinguishes self from other. We need to understand that the brain is full of distributed mechanisms, thus creating an expectation that the self will be too. With this understanding, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self avoids all the difficulties about the unified and central mechanisms that traditional conceptions hold. In addition, the brain-based model of the evolutionary theory recognizes that the majority of the mental tasks highly complex organisms do are unconscious. Simply put, we may be aware of a decision we have made, but not the calculations that went into the decision as they are not capable to be understood by the conscious self.&lt;ref&gt;F. Crick: The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul (Scribner’s Sons, New York 1994, 265-268).&lt;/ref&gt; By attempting to take an evolutionary approach to understanding the self, the confrontation of self with the sense of self is avoided, in addition to, “all the problems that arise from an undue emphasis on consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As suggested by Munevar, research on the evolutionary theory of self needs to firstly examine the existence of distributed activation in the brain when doing a self-attribution task. Secondly, they need to examine distinctions in brain activity when identifying self and close others in a manner of objective vs subjective to see if there are activation variances between the two. Thirdly, research needs to use non-personality traits as well as personality traits to take into account the importance of non-personality traits to the evolutionary needs of an organism. Fourthly, the research should aim to prove that humans, “should identify with those close to us, although not as strongly as with ourselves."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These four aims were the four that structured the hypotheses in his study, and provide blueprint for further research to test.

== Evidence to support the theory ==
In Munevar’s study, they compared self vs other conditions in which personality trait adjectives were rated in terms of Self vs Best Friend, Self vs Bill Gates, and Best Friend vs Bill Gates. He used a blocked-design [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] [[paradigm]], where non-personality and personality trait adjectives were rated as to whether they applied to themselves or other. The four hypotheses were as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Self conditions would show a different pattern of brain activation from those shown by Best Friend (i.e., close other) and Bill Gates (i.e., far other) conditions; (2) our data should exhibit a fair degree of distributive performance by the brain in responding to these attribution tasks; and (3) the resulting patterns of activation should show some overlap with structures normally involved in preparedness to action (motion). In addition, (4) the Best Friend condition would also differ from the Bill Gates condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The study found that several areas of the brain were active when doing the tasks related to ‘Self’ and Best Friend. In support of the first hypothesis (1), there was very significant differential activation in [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] (covering part of [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate gyrus]] and the medial parietal), and the [[substantia nigra]].&lt;ref name=gillihan/&gt; There was significant activity in the right and left portions of [[Brodmann area 23|BA 23]], and the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] tail. In a lesser degree, there was some activity in the [[Brodmann area 10|BA 10]] and the thalamus. There was also greater activation in [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]], particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, in Self-Bill Gates condition compared to the Best Friend-Bill Gates condition. With these results, there is different brain patterns shown by Best Friend and Bill Gate conditions. The contrasting results found also support the second hypothesis (2), and indicate that a large number of distributive structures throughout the brain are used when doing a self-attribution task.

In support of the third hypothesis (3), he found a large amount of activation of the [[substantia nigra]] (key stricture of [[basal ganglia]] for action), in addition to the activation of the [[caudate nucleus]] of the [[basal ganglia]]. These areas in the brain are known to be crucial to the process of movement, and thus an overlap with these structures supports their hypothesis.

In support of the fourth hypothesis (4), the greater activation of [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]] in comparison of Best Friend vs Bill Gates condition and the Self-Bill Gates condition points to show that humans strongly identify with those you are close to us, and less strongly with ourselves.

The results displayed that the brain areas that we use for thinking about ourselves may also be used for thinking about those who are important to us. The fact that there is this relationship with multiple parts of the brain being active during both goes to show that there is an association between the two, furthering to suggest that one area in the brain nor one unified mechanism is not responsible for the self. The results also support the evolutionary expectation of a connection between self and the preparedness for action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The activation of key areas in the [[basal ganglia]] and the differential activation of [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] by the self-conditions in contrast with the Best Friend conditions in this study, elude to further support the idea of personality being a product of the unconscious self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future work ==
From the results seen in Munevar’s study, there are several implications for the future progress of this theory. Since the study had a limitation of gender impacting the results of the conditions of Self vs Best Friend and Best Friend vs Bill Gates, further research should be done that classify results of fMRI by each gender. Another positive direction this study points to is by studying brains with deficits in activation of the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] that bring problems when identifying self from non-self. This problem is prevalent in mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and late-stage [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], where the ability to differentiate self vs other is compromised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research should use the results of Munevar's study and continue on to dissect the paradoxes and problems of traditional conceptions, while focusing on the evolutionary biology of the brain. Overall, the research done on the Evolutionary Theory of Self is promising and provides fruitful insight to the possibility of discovering new conclusions on what we know about the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Hyalite fluorescence.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] hyalite under [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]]]

'''Hyalite''' is a form of [[opal]] with a glassy and clear appearance which may exhibit an internal play of colors if natural inclusions are present.  It is also called ''Muller's glass'', ''water opal'' and ''jalite''. The name Müller's glass derived from the name of its discoverer, [[Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein]].  

==Properties==
Hyalite's [[Mohs hardness]] is 5.5 to 6 and has a [[specific gravity]] of 1.9 - 2.1.  It has no planes of cleavage but fractures [[conchoidal]]ly, is clear or translucent and has a globular structure.  Its luster is vitreous and its [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]] is white.  Hyalite is an [[amorphous]] form of [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) formed as a volcanic sublimate in volcanic or [[Igneous rock|pegmatic]] rock and is therefore considered a [[mineraloid]].  It contains 3 - 8% water, either as a [[silanol]] group or in molecular form. 

==Uses==
Opalescent hyalite is used in jewellery, and well-formed samples are of interest to collectors due to their unusual appearance, mode of formation and relative rarity.  It is sometimes mistaken for resin opal or [[silica glass]] since they both may appear clear and globular, but it can be identified under ultraviolet light due to its bright green [[fluorescence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">In [[optical physics]], '''laser detuning''' is the tuning of a [[laser]] to a [[frequency]] that is slightly off from a [[quantum mechanics|quantum system]]'s [[resonance|resonant frequency]]. When used as a noun, the laser detuning is the difference between the resonance [[frequency]] of the system and the laser's optical frequency (or [[wavelength]]). Lasers tuned to a frequency below the resonant frequency are called ''red-detuned'', and lasers tuned above resonance are called ''blue-detuned''.&lt;ref name="Riehle2006" /&gt;

==Illustration==
Let us consider a system with a resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; in the optical frequency range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], i.e. with frequency of a few THz to a few PHz, or equivalently with a wavelength in the range of 10 nm to 100 μm. If this system is excited by a laser with a frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_L&lt;/math&gt; close to this value, the laser detuning is then defined as:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta \omega\  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \ \omega_L - \omega_0 &lt;/math&gt;The most common examples of such resonant systems in the optical frequency range are [[Optical cavity|optical cavities]] (free-space, fiber or [[Optical microcavity|microcavities]]), [[Atom|atoms]], and [[Dielectric|dielectrics]] or [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]]. 

The laser detuning is important for a resonant system such as a cavity because it determines the phase (modulo 2π) acquired by the laser field per roundtrip. This is important for linear optical processes such as interference and scattering, and extremely important for [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes because it affects the [[Nonlinear_optics#Phase_matching|phase-matching]] condition.

== Applications ==

=== Laser cooling of atoms ===
{{Main|Laser cooling}}
Lasers can be detuned in the [[lab frame]] so that they are [[Doppler shift]]ed to the resonant frequency in a moving system, which allows lasers to affect only atoms moving at a specific speed or in a specific direction and makes laser detuning a central tool of [[laser cooling]]&lt;ref name="MetcalfStraten1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold J. Metcalf|author2=Peter Van der Straten|title=Laser cooling and trapping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-40VaXqrj0C|accessdate=26 November 2011|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-98728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magneto-optical trap]]s.&lt;ref name="Riehle2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz Riehle|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9AKk3smIJwC|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=8 May 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-60595-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Optomechanics ===
[[File:OptomechanicalDamping.png|thumb|192x192px|A plot of the optically induced damping of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical system.]]
{{Main|Cavity optomechanics}}
Similar to the laser cooling of atoms, the sign of the detuning plays an important part in [[Cavity optomechanics|Optomechanical]] applications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aspelmeyer|first=M.|last2=Gröblacher|first2=S.|last3=Hammerer|first3=K.|last4=Kiesel|first4=N.|date=2010-06-01|title=Quantum optomechanics—throwing a glance [Invited]|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-27-6-A189|journal=JOSA B|language=EN|volume=27|issue=6|pages=A189–A197|doi=10.1364/JOSAB.27.00A189|issn=1520-8540|bibcode=2010JOSAB..27..189A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aspelmeyer|first=Markus|last2=Kippenberg|first2=Tobias J.|last3=Marquardt|first3=Florian|date=2014-12-30|title=Cavity optomechanics|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=86|issue=4|pages=1391–1452|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391|arxiv=1303.0733|bibcode=2014RvMP...86.1391A}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the red detuned regime, the optomechanical system undergoes cooling and coherent energy transfer between the light and the mechanical mode (a "[[beam splitter]]"). In the blue-detuned regime, it undergoes heating, mechanical amplification and possibly [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezing]] and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]. The on-resonance case when the laser detuning is zero, can be used for very sensitive detection of mechanical motion, such as used in [[LIGO]].

[[File:Flag of Washington.svg|thumb|alt=A green flag with a circular seal consisting of concentric circles. The inner circles contains an image of a stately man wearing a powdered wig. The outer circle has the words "The Seal of the State of Washington" and "1889" written clockwise within a yellow banner surrounding the inner circle.|The [[flag of Washington]], the state's flag]]

The U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] has 21 [[Lists of United States state insignia|official emblems]], as designated by the [[Washington State Legislature]]. These symbols, which reflect the history and culture of the state, are often opportunities for politicians to "tie themselves to popular symbols", for teachers to highlight the legislative process to their students, and for lobbyists to "have their products given official designation".&lt;ref name=StatePride&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=304062|title=State Pride, Via Soil, Milk, Popcorn, Pork|date=December 27, 2004|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Michael S.|last=James|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the symbols are unique to Washington, others are used by multiple states. For example, the willow goldfinch (also known as the [[American goldfinch]]), Washington's [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]], is also an official symbol for [[List of Iowa state symbols|Iowa]] and [[List of New Jersey state symbols|New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=StateBirds&gt;{{cite news |last=Hinterberger |first=John |date=August 19, 1973 |title=Cries of 'Fowl' echo in state |page=B8 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington's [[List of U.S. state grasses|state grass]], [[bluebunch wheatgrass]], is also a symbol for the state of [[List of Montana state symbols|Montana]].&lt;ref name=Montana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhs.mt.gov/education/studentguide/Symbols.asp|title=Symbols of Montana|accessdate=December 17, 2009|publisher=Montana Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[square dance]] and apple are commonly used [[List of U.S. state dances|state dances]] and [[List of U.S. state foods|state foods]], respectively. While most states have an official [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|motto]] and [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]], Washington's motto ("Al-ki", meaning "by and by" in [[Chinook Jargon]]) and nickname ("The Evergreen State") have never been officially adopted by the Legislature.&lt;ref name=Unofficial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Symbols/Pages/default.aspx|title=State Symbols|publisher=[[Washington State Legislature]]|accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington's first official symbol was [[Flag of Washington|its flag]], adopted in 1923. While some symbols, including the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] and [[Seals of the U.S. states|state seal]], were selected before then, they were not adopted by the Legislature until later. Washington's second symbol was [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]], selected as the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] in 1947. Fourteen symbols were added between 1950 and 2000. Five symbols have been adopted in the 21st century. The newest symbol of Washington is the [[Olympic marmot]], declared the [[List of U.S. state mammals|state endemic mammal]] in 2009.

| The Legislature adopted the state flag in 1923, more than thirty years after the state was admitted to the United States. By law ([[Revised Code of Washington|RCW]] 1.20.010), the flag "shall be of dark green silk or bunting and shall bear in its center a reproduction of the seal of the state of Washington embroidered, printed, painted or stamped thereon. The edges of the flag may, or may not, be fringed. If a fringe is used the same shall be of gold or yellow color of the same shade as the seal.

| Originally designed by Charles Talcott shortly before Washington was admitted to the United States in 1889, the seal contains the image of [[George Washington]] encircled with "The Seal of the State of Washington" and the date "1889". The simple design was accepted by the Legislature, but did not become the official seal until graphic designer Richard Nelms was commissioned to create a new insignia. Nelms used a portrait by painter [[Gilbert Stuart]] in his design, which was accepted by the Legislature in 1967.&lt;ref name="Seal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/seal/history.aspx|title=History of the State Seal|accessdate=December 20, 2009|publisher=Secretary of State of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Indigenous (ecology)|Native]] to the [[Pacific Northwest]], the Pacific Chorus Frog was designated as the state amphibian because it lives on both sides of the [[Cascade Range]] and within each [[List of counties in Washington|county]] of the state. The symbol was proposed by third graders at Boston Harbor Grade School in north [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]].

| [[List of U.S. state birds|Bird]]
| [[American goldfinch]]&lt;br&gt;(''Carduelis tristis'')
| In 1928, school children selected the [[meadowlark]] as the state bird, the same choice made by seven other states at the time. The Washington Federation of Women's Clubs picked the goldfinch as the state symbol in 1931 over the [[tanager]], [[song sparrow]], [[junco]] and [[pileated woodpecker]]. Two decades later, legislators allowed school children to decide between the two birds, and the goldfinch was chosen.

|Before [[suffrage]], Washington women selected the coast rhododendron as the state flower in 1892. Six flowers were initially considered as an entry for a floral exhibit at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], but the rhododendron beat out the clover following a statewide election. In 1959, the lawmakers officially designated the native species ''Rhododendron macrophyllum'' as the state flower. [[Dr. Frasier Crane]] attests that the state's flower is mildew in a documentary series about his life.

This is a '''list of [[complexity class]]es''' in [[computational complexity theory]]. For other computational and complexity subjects, see [[list of computability and complexity topics]].

Many of these classes have a 'co' partner which consists of the [[complement (complexity)|complement]]s of all languages in the original class.  For example if a language L is in NP then the complement of L is in co-NP.  (This does not mean that the complement of NP is co-NP—there are languages which are known to be in both, and other languages which are known to be in neither.)

"The hardest problems" of a class refer to problems which belong to the class such that every other problem of that class can be reduced to it. Furthermore, the reduction is also a problem of the given class, or its subset.

'''''Looking Backward: 2000–1887''''' is a [[utopia]]n [[science fiction]] novel by [[Edward Bellamy]], a journalist and writer from [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts]]; it was first published in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bellamy_edward Edward Bellamy in [[Encyclopedia of science fiction]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the third-largest bestseller of its time, after ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (novel)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref name = "qlfjpt"&gt;Edward Bellamy, ''Looking Backward 2000-1887'', with a Foreword by [[Erich Fromm]], Signet, 1960. {{ISBN|0-451-52412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced a large number of intellectuals, and appears by title in many [[socialism|socialist]] writings of the day. "It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement".&lt;ref&gt;See Fromm's Foreword to ''Looking Backward'', p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States alone, over 162 [[Nationalist Clubs|"Bellamy Clubs"]] sprang up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/5280831/Utopian_Dreamers_-_Edward_Bellamy_And_The_Canadian_Context |title=Utopian Dreamers - Edward Bellamy And The Canadian Context |first=Matthew |last=Vasilev |type=Undergraduate research paper |publisher=McGill University |date=2012 |accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and propagate the book's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking backward: 2000-1887|year=2000|publisher=Signet|page=Introduction}} Walter James Miller confirms "more than 162 Bellamy Clubs".&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its commitment to the [[nationalization]] of private property and the desire to avoid use of the term "socialism", this political movement came to be known as Nationalism — not to be confused with the political concept of [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bellamy. "What 'Nationalism' Means". ''The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature (1844–1898)''; Vol. 52, No. 3 (September 1890); p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel also inspired several [[Commune (intentional community)|utopian communities]].

==Publication history==

The decades of the 1870s and the 1880s were marked by economic and social turmoil, including the [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1879, a series of [[recession]]s during the 1880s, the rise of [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[strike action|strikes]], and the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] and its controversial aftermath.&lt;ref name=Bowman87&gt;Sylvia E. Bowman, ''The Year 2000: A Critical Biography of Edward Bellamy.'' New York: Bookman Associates, 1958; pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, American capitalism's tendency towards concentration into ever larger and less competitive forms—[[monopoly|monopolies]], [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], and [[trust (business)|trusts]]—began to make itself evident, while emigration from Europe expanded the labor pool and caused wages to stagnate.&lt;ref name=Bowman87 /&gt; The time was ripe for new ideas about economic development which might ameliorate the current social disorder.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898), a relatively unknown [[New England]]-born novelist with a history of concern with social issues,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; began to conceive of writing an impactful work of visionary fiction shaping the outlines of a [[utopian socialism|utopian]] future, in which production and society were ordered for the smooth production and distribution of commodities to a regimented labor force. In this he was not alone — between 1860 and 1887, no fewer than 11 such works of fiction were produced in the United States by various authors dealing fundamentally with the questions of economic and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellamy's book, gradually planned throughout the 1880s, was completed in 1887 and taken to [[Boston]] publisher Benjamin Ticknor, who published a first edition of the novel in January 1888.&lt;ref name=Bowman115&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales of the book were modest and uninspiring, but the book did find a readership in the Boston area, including enthusiastic reviews by future Bellamyites [[Cyrus Field Willard]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' and [[Sylvester Baxter]] of the ''Boston Herald.''

Shortly after publication, Ticknor's publishing enterprise, Ticknor and Company, was purchased by the larger Boston publisher, [[Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.]], and new publishing plates were created for the book.&lt;ref name=Bowman115 /&gt; Certain "slight emendations" were made to the text by Bellamy for this second edition, released by Houghton Mifflin in September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its second release, Bellamy's futuristic novel met with enormous popular success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in the United States alone by the time Bellamy's follow-up novel, ''Equality,'' was published in 1897.&lt;ref name=Bowman121&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales topped 532,000 in the USA by the middle of 1939.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt; The book gained an extensive readership in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], as well, with more than 235,000 copies sold there between its first release in 1890 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt;

The first version of the novel published in China, heavily edited for the tastes of Chinese readers, was titled ''Huitou kan jilüe'' (回頭看記略). This text was later retitled ''Bainian Yi Jiao'' (百年一覺 ), or "A Sleep of 100 Years" and in 1891–1892 this version was serialized in ''[[Wanguo gongbao]]'';&lt;ref name=Andolfatto&gt;Andolfatto, Lorenzo.

The book remains in print in multiple editions, with one publisher alone having reissued the title in a printing of 100,000 copies in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schiffman, "Introduction" to Edward Bellamy: ''Selected Writings on Religion and Society.'' New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1955; pg. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

Bellamy's novel tells the story of a hero figure named Julian West, a young American, who towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds himself in the same location ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a [[socialist]] utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and the use of an "industrial army" to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.

The young man readily finds a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age, including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous, Internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens. The productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.

Although Bellamy's novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail, commentators frequently compare ''Looking Backward'' with actual economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the [[consumers' cooperative]]s of his own day based on the ''[[Rochdale Principles]]'' of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern [[warehouse club]] like BJ's, Costco, or Sam's Club. He additionally introduces a concept of "credit" cards in chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like modern [[debit card]]s. All citizens receive an equal amount of "credit". Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours (in contrast to the real-world practice of paying them more for their efforts of, presumably, the same hours). Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through [[cable radio|cable "telephone"]] (already demonstrated but commercialized only in 1890 as [[Théâtrophone]] in France).

Despite the "ethical" character of his socialism (though he was initially reluctant to use the term "socialism"), Bellamy's ideas somewhat reflect classical [[Marxism]]. In chapter 19, for example, he has the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of [[atavism]], then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried over. Chapters 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more [[libertarian socialist]] system. In one case, Bellamy even writes, "the nation is the sole employer and capitalist".

== Precursors ==

Though Bellamy tended to stress the independence of his work, ''Looking Backward'' shares relationships and resemblances with several earlier works—most notably the anonymous ''[[The Great Romance]]'' (1881), [[John Macnie]]'s ''[[The Diothas]]'' (1883),&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Edward Bellamy'', New York, Columbia University Press, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Gronlund]]'s ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' (1884), and [[August Bebel]]'s ''Woman in the Past, Present, and Future'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Plagiarism in Utopia: A Study of the Continuity of the Utopian Tradition With Special Reference to Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward"'', Yellow Springs, Ohio, privately printed, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''The True Author of Looking Backward'' (1890) J. B. Shipley argued that Bellamy's novel was a repeat of Bebel's arguments, while literary critic R. L. Shurter went so far as to argue that "''Looking Backward'' is actually a fictionalized version of ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' and little more".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Shurter, ''The Utopian Novel in America, 1865–1900'', New York, AMS Press, 1975; p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bellamy's book also bears resemblances to the early socialist theorists or 'utopian socialists' [[Étienne Cabet|Etienne Cabet]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Robert Owen]], and [[Henri Saint-Simon]], as well as to the 'Associationism' of [[Albert Brisbane]] whom Bellamy had met in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative, Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America'', (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1991), p. 368, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction and sequels ==
{{main|List of sequels to Looking Backward}}

On publication, ''Looking Backward'' was praised by both the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[Knights of Labor]].&lt;ref name="rew"&gt;Robert E. Weir, ''Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia''.Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC-CLIO, ©2013 {{ISBN|1598847198}} (p. 68-70).&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Knights read ''Looking Backward'' and also joined Bellamy's Nationalist clubs.&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt; ''Looking Backward'' was also praised by [[Daniel De Leon]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt;

In 1897, Bellamy wrote a sequel, ''[[Equality (book)|Equality]]'', dealing with women's rights, education, and many other issues. Bellamy wrote the sequel to elaborate and clarify many of the ideas merely touched upon in ''Looking Backward''.

The success of ''Looking Backward'' provoked a spate of sequels, parodies, satires, dystopian, and 'anti-utopian' responses.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pfaelzer,''The Utopian Novel in America, 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press; pp. 78–94 and 170–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A partial list of these follows.&lt;ref&gt;This list was derived from G. Claeys ''Late Victorian Utopias: A Prospective'', (Pickering and Chatto, London, 2008), J. Pfaelzer, ''The Utopian Novel in America 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', (University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1984), K. Roemer, ''The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888–1900'', (Kent State University Press, Kent, 1976), K. Roemer, ''Utopian Audiences, How Readers Locate Nowhere'', (University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, 2003), C.J. Rooney, ''Dreams and Visions: a study of American utopias, 1865–1917'' (1997), F. Shor, ''Utopianism and radicalism in a reforming America, 1888–1918'', (Greenwood Press, Westport Connecticut, 1997), and especially L.T. Sargent ''British and American Utopian Literature, 1516–1985: An Annotated, Chronological Bibliography'' (Garland Publishing, New York, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a "battle of the books" that lasted through the rest of the 19th century and into the 20th. The back-and-forth nature of the debate is illustrated by the subtitle of Geissler's 1891 ''Looking Beyond'', which is "A Sequel to 'Looking Backward' by Edward Bellamy and an Answer to 'Looking Forward' by Richard Michaelis".

The book was translated into [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] in 1892. In 1900 Bellamy personally approved a request by Bulgarian author [[Iliya Yovchev]] to make an "adapted translation" based on the realities of [[Bulgaria]]n social order. The resulting work, titled ''The Present as Seen by Our Descendants And a Glimpse at the Progress of the Future'' ("Настоящето, разгледано от потомството ни и надничане в напредъка на бъдещето"), generally followed the same plot. The events in Yovchev's version take place in an [[environmentally friendly]] [[Sofia]] and describe the country's unique path of adapting to the new social order. It is considered by local critics to be the first Bulgarian utopian work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chitanka.info/text/20938-nachaloto|title=The Beginning|author=Ivaylo Runchev|publisher=Narodna Mladezh|year=1985|accessdate=1 July 2013|quote=Фактически налице е произведение, отличаващо се от оригинала дотолкова, че следва да се говори за нов роман, първия ни български утопичен роман. ("Basically this work differs from the original to such an extent, that we can consider it a new novel, the first Bulgarian Utopian novel.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Morris]]'s [[1890 in literature|1890]] utopia ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' was partly written in reaction to Bellamy's utopia, which Morris did not find congenial.

Beyond the purely literary sphere, Bellamy's descriptions of utopian [[urban planning]] had a practical influence on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s founding of the [[garden city movement]] in England, and on the design of the [[Bradbury Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].
[[Image:Edward Bellamy 2000 1887.jpg|thumb|German Reclam edition 1919]]
During the [[Great railroad strike of 1877|Great Strikes of 1877]], [[Eugene V. Debs]] opposed the strikes and argued that there was no essential necessity for the conflict between capital and labor. Debs was influenced by Bellamy's book to turn to a more [[socialist]] direction. He soon helped to form the [[American Railway Union]]. With supporters from the [[Knights of Labor]] and from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike in June 1894. This came to be known as the [[Pullman Strike]].

The book had a specific and intense reception in Wilhelminian Germany including various parodies and sequels, from [[Eduard Loewenthal]], [[Ernst Müller]] and [[Philipp Wasserburg]], [[Konrad Wilbrandt]] and [[Richard Michaelis]].&lt;ref&gt;(Edward Bellamy, ''Ein Rückblick aus dem Jahre 2000 auf das Jahr 1887'', Translation Georg von Gizycki, editor Wolfgang Biesterfeld. Philipp Reclam jun., Stuttgart 1983 {{ISBN|3-15-002660-1}} (Universal-Bibliothek 2660 [4]), Afterword of Biesterfeld, p.301f.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, there was a revival of interest in ''Looking Backward''. Several groups were formed to promote the book's ideas. The largest was Edward Bellamy Association of New York; its honorary members included [[John Dewey]], [[Heywood Broun]] and [[Roger N. Baldwin]]. &lt;ref name="aem"&gt; Aaron D. Purcell, ''Arthur Morgan: A Progressive Vision for American Reform''. University of Tennessee Press, 2014 {{ISBN|9781621900580}} (p. 214-9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]], chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], also admired the book and wrote the first biography of Bellamy.&lt;ref name="aem" /&gt; 

== Legacy and later responses ==
''Looking Backward'' influenced the novel ''[[Future of a New China]]'' by [[Liang Qichao]].&lt;ref name=DDWangTranslatingp309&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David D. W.]] "Translating Modernity." In: Pollard, David E. (editor). ''Translation and Creation: Readings of Western Literature in Early Modern China, 1840–1918''. [[John Benjamins Publishing]], 1998. {{ISBN|9027216282}}, 9789027216281. Start: p. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ni88Ddi_S2cC&amp;pg=PA303 303]. CITED: p. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ni88Ddi_S2cC&amp;pg=PA309 309].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Looking Backward'' was rewritten in 1974 by American science fiction writer [[Mack Reynolds]] as ''Looking Backward from the Year 2000''. [[Matthew Kapell]], a historian and anthropologist, examined this re-writing in his essay, "Mack Reynolds' Avoidance of his own [[18 Brumaire|Eighteenth Brumaire]]: A Note of Caution for Would-Be Utopians".

In 1984, Herbert Knapp and Mary Knapp's ''[[Red, White and Blue Paradise|Red, White and Blue Paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama]]'' appeared. The book was in part a memoir of their careers teaching at fabled [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High School]], but also a re-interpretation of the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] as a creature of turn-of-the-century Progressivism, a workers' paradise. The Knapps used Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' as their heuristic model for understanding Progressive ideology as it shaped the Canal Zone.

A one-act play, ''Bellamy's Musical Telephone,'' was written by Roger Lee Hall and premiered at Emerson College in Boston in 1988 on the centennial year of the novel's publication.  It was released as a DVD titled, "The Musical Telephone."

==Research interests==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2009}}
Focusing his attention on bees, Srinivasan has explored how simple animal systems display complex behaviours. This broad field has applications in robotics, especially [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] because of the competing needs for autonomy and a lightweight control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheeler |first1=David L. |date=April 15, 2012 |title=From Bees' Brains to Airplanes: an Australian Scientist Applies His Research |url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/1001147570?accountid=13902 |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=24 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bees are highly competent fliers. Srinivasan has shown that many ostensibly complex flight behaviours can be attributed to the tendency of the bee to keep [[optic flow]] constant. Some examples:
* They measure the distance they have travelled. This is important as distance is signalled to other bees as a component of the [[waggle dance]].
* When landing, the ground becomes closer and therefore appears to be moving faster. By keeping the apparent velocity of the ground constant, the bee reduces its own velocity in a continuous manner.
* Similarly, bees slow down in a crowded landscape because nearby objects appear to move faster than objects on the horizon. This is a safety mechanism that reduces the incidence of collision.
* When avoiding objects, the bee will tend to take the optimal path because it will 'balance' the rate of the optic flow between the eyes. It will, for example, fly down the middle of a tunnel, because if it flew closer to one side the optic flow would appear to be greater.

'''Mercury-Redstone 3''', or '''''Freedom 7''''', was the first United States [[human spaceflight]], on May 5, 1961, piloted by [[astronaut]] [[Alan Shepard]]. It was the first manned flight of [[Project Mercury]], the objective of which was to put an astronaut into [[orbit]] around the Earth and return him safely. Shepard's mission was a 15-minute [[sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] flight with the primary objective of demonstrating his ability to withstand the high [[g force|g-force]]s of launch and [[atmospheric re-entry]].

Shepard named his [[space capsule]] ''Freedom 7'', setting a precedent for the remaining six Mercury astronauts naming their spacecraft. The number 7 was included in all the manned Mercury spacecraft names to honor [[Mercury Seven|NASA's first group of seven astronauts]]. His spacecraft reached an altitude of 116.5 [[statute mile]]s (101.2 [[mile|nautical mile]]s, 187.5 [[kilometer|km]]) and traveled a downrange distance of 302.8 statute miles (263.1 nautical miles, 487.3 km). It was the fourth Mercury flight launched with the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]],{{refn|group="Note"|The previous three Mercury-Redstone flights were the unmanned [[Mercury-Redstone 1A]], [[Mercury-Redstone 2]] (which carried a chimpanzee), and [[Mercury-Redstone BD]], an unmanned flight with a "boilerplate" (non-production) Mercury capsule.}} from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida, close to the Atlantic Ocean.

During the flight, Shepard observed the Earth and tested the capsule's [[attitude control system]], turning the capsule around to face its blunt heat shield forward for atmospheric re-entry. He also tested the [[retrorocket]]s which would return later missions from orbit, though the capsule did not have enough energy to remain in orbit. After re-entry, the capsule landed by parachute on the North Atlantic Ocean off the [[Bahamas]]. Shepard and the capsule were picked up by helicopter and brought to U.S. Navy aircraft carrier [[USS Lake Champlain (CV-39)|USS ''Lake Champlain'']]''.

The mission was a technical success, though American pride in the accomplishment was dampened by the fact that just three weeks before, the [[Soviet Union]] had launched the first man in space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], who completed one orbit on [[Vostok 1]]. In 2017 the first [[National Astronaut Day]] was held on May 5 to pay tribute to this first flight.

==Preparation==
{{See also|Project Mercury}}
The ''Freedom 7'' spacecraft, Mercury capsule #7, was delivered to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on December 9, 1960. It had originally been expected that a mission could be launched soon after the spacecraft was available, but Capsule #7 turned out to require extensive development and testing work before it was deemed safe for flight. However, as it had been earmarked since the summer as the first manned spacecraft, the decision was taken to delay the mission until this particular capsule was ready, with a tentative launch date of March 6, rather than use an alternative capsule.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The booster originally intended for the flight, Redstone #3,&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; had been delivered to the Cape in early December;&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was then used on the [[Mercury-Redstone 1A|MR-1A]] test flight on December 19.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement, Redstone #7, did not arrive at the Cape until late March; by this time, however, the mission had already been postponed to await the results of another test flight.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1960, there had been a growing number of concerns about the standards of the Redstone launch vehicle; the [[Mercury-Redstone 2|MR-2]] test flight, "manned" by a chimpanzee, had had technical problems during the launch leading to the spacecraft flying too high, too far and too fast.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the mission was two minutes longer than planned, and the re-entry subjected the passenger to 14.7g rather than the planned figure of approximately 12g. The splashdown point was sixty miles from the nearest recovery ship, and it was over two and a half hours before a helicopter could recover the capsule and its passenger – by which time it had almost sunk.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, NASA was unwilling to launch the MR-3 mission without further development work; by late February, there were still seven major alterations they had made to the booster which required testing.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 323–4&lt;/ref&gt; An additional testing flight was accordingly added to the schedule, [[Mercury-Redstone BD|MR-BD]] (for "Booster Development"; it was originally known as MR-2A). This would launch on March 28, pushing the MR-3 flight back a month to April 25.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; The MR-BD flight was almost completely successful, ensuring that the manned MR-3 flight could proceed without further significant delay.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot for MR-3 had been chosen several months in advance, in early January, by the head of the program, [[Robert R. Gilruth]]. He had selected [[Alan Shepard]] as the primary pilot, with [[John Glenn]] and [[Gus Grissom]] as his backups; the other members of the [[Mercury Seven]] continued to train for later missions. The three names were announced to the press on February 22 without any indication as to which of the three was expected to fly the mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Shepard's name was only announced publicly after the initial launch attempt had been canceled, as Gilruth wished to keep his options open in the event that last-minute personnel changes were required.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn served as Shepard's backup on launch day,&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; with Grissom focusing on training for [[Mercury-Redstone 4|MR-4]], the next suborbital mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial launch attempt, on May 2, was canceled due to weather problems two hours and 20 minutes before the launch time, with Shepard waiting in a hangar already suited and prepared. The flight was rescheduled for two days later, when it was delayed one more day due to inclement weather conditions, until 5 May, with an expected launch time of 7:20&amp;nbsp;am. EST.{{refn|group="Note"|All local times quoted here are in [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]], as Florida did not observe [[daylight saving time]] until 1966.}}&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 350–351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==
The countdown began at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. the previous night, with Shepard waking up and eating a breakfast of [[steak]] and eggs with [[toast]], coffee, and [[orange juice]] (the steak and eggs breakfast would soon become a tradition for astronauts the morning of a launch). He entered the spacecraft at 5:15&amp;nbsp;am. ET, just over two hours before the planned 7:20 launch time. At 7:05&amp;nbsp;am, the launch was held for an hour to let cloud cover clear – good visibility would be essential for photographs of the Earth – and fix a power supply unit; shortly after the count restarted, another hold was called in order to reboot a computer at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. The count was eventually resumed, after slightly over two and a half hours of unplanned holds, and continued with no further faults.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt; All of the delays resulted in Shepard lying on his back in the capsule for almost three hours, by which point he complained to the blockhouse crew that he had a severe need to urinate (because the mission would last under 20 minutes, nobody had thought to equip the Mercury with a urine collection device). The crew told him that this was impossible as they'd have to set the White Room back up and waste considerable amounts of time removing the Mercury's heavily bolted hatch. An irate Shepard then announced that if he couldn't get out for a bathroom trip, he'd simply urinate in his suit. When the blockhouse protested that that would short out the medical electrodes on his body, he told them to simply turn the power off. They complied, and Shepard emptied his bladder. Because of the position he was sitting in, the urine pooled somewhat underneath his back and with oxygen flowing through the spacesuit, he was soon dried out, and the countdown resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepard, Jr.|first1=Alan B.|last2=Slayton|first2=Deke|last3=Barbree|first3=Jay|last4=Benedict|first4=Howard|title=Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon|date=1994|publisher=Turner|location=Kansas City, MO|isbn=1878685546|pages=383|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury-Redstone 3 Launch MSFC-6100884.jpg|Launch of MR-3 on May 5, 1961|thumb|upright|left]]

Mercury-Redstone 3 finally lifted off at 9:34&amp;nbsp;am. ET, watched by an estimated 45 million television viewers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Shepard was subjected to a maximum acceleration of 6.3g just before the Redstone engine shut down, two minutes and 22 seconds after launch. ''Freedom 7's'' space-fixed velocity was {{convert|5134|mph|km/h}}, close to the planned value. Ten seconds later, the [[escape tower]] was jettisoned. At the three-minute mark, the automated [[attitude control system]] rotated ''Freedom 7'' so the [[heat shield]] faced forward ready for re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard was now able to take manual control of the spacecraft, and began testing whether he was able to adjust its orientation. The first thing he did was position the spacecraft to its retrofire attitude of 34 degrees pitch (nose of spacecraft pitched down 34 degrees). He then tested manual control of [[Yaw angle|yaw]], motion from left to right, and roll. When he took control of all three axes, he found that the spacecraft response was about the same as that of the Mercury simulator; however, he could not hear the jets firing, as he could on the ground, due to the levels of background noise.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary objective was to make observations of the ground from the spacecraft; returning the spacecraft to automatic control, Shepard found that he was able to distinguish major land masses from clouds easily, and could make out coastlines, islands and major lakes, but had difficulty identifying cities. He had problems working with the spacecraft periscope – early Mercury capsules had a small periscope rather than a viewing window – and had to abandon an attempt to change optical filters on it after noticing that a pressure gauge on his wrist kept bumping the lever that would have activated the Launch Escape System. Although the escape tower was long gone and pressing on the lever probably wouldn't do anything, Shepard still didn't want to risk it in case something unexpected happened.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 353–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Under automatic control, the spacecraft had developed a slight movement as it passed through peak altitude; Shepard now switched into the "fly-by-wire" mode, where the pilot used a controller to order the automatic system to fire the rockets for the desired positioning, rather than manually controlling the individual jets. Adjusting roll and yaw, he found the pitch position was around ten degrees too shallow – 25 degrees rather than the desired 35 for reentry – and as he began to correct it, the timed retrorockets fired to send him into reentry. The retrorocket pack – strapped atop the heatshield and so requiring release before reentry – was successfully jettisoned, but the confirmation light failed, requiring Shepard to activate the manual override for the jettison system before it confirmed that the rockets were fully released.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard resumed fly-by-wire control after retrofire, reporting that it felt smooth and gave the sensation of being fully in command of the craft,&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; before letting the automatic systems briefly take over to reorient the capsule for reentry. He then kept control until the g-forces peaked at 11.6g during re-entry; he held the capsule until it had stabilized and then relinquished control to the automated system. The descent was faster than anticipated, but the parachutes deployed as planned, a [[drogue parachute|drogue]] at {{convert|21000|ft|km|abbr=on}} and a main parachute at {{convert|10000|ft|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|Splashdown]] occurred with an impact comparable to landing a [[jet aircraft]] on an [[aircraft carrier]]. ''Freedom 7'' tilted over on its right side about 60 degrees from an upright position, but did not show any signs of leaking; it gently righted itself after a minute, and Shepard was able to report to the circling aircraft that he had landed safely and was ready to be recovered. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and after a brief problem with the spacecraft antenna, the capsule was lifted partly out of the water in order to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and his spacecraft to a waiting aircraft carrier, {{USS|Lake Champlain|CV-39|6}}. The whole recovery process had taken only eleven minutes, from splashdown to arriving aboard.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 356–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight lasted 15 minutes, 22 seconds and the spacecraft traveled {{convert|302|mi|km}} from its launch point, ascending to {{convert|116.5|mi|km}}. ''Freedom 7'' landed at these coordinates: {{coord|27.23|N|75.88|W|}}. It reached a speed of {{convert|5180|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the flight the spacecraft was examined by engineers and found to be in excellent shape, so much so that they decided it could have been safely used again in another launch. Given to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] by [[NASA]], ''Freedom 7'' was previously displayed at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Maryland until 2012. Since 2012, it has been on display at the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Depiction in popular culture==
In June 1961, Laurie Records issued a 45 rpm single featuring William Allen and Orchestra entitled "Space Flight Freedom 7." It consisted of recreations of the tower to astronaut communications spoken over an instrumental backing.
The Mercury-Redstone 3 mission was dramatized in the HBO miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode "[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|Can We Do This?]]" (starring [[Ted Levine]] as Alan Shepard), as well as in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'', and [[Philip Kaufman]]'s movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' based on the book. (In Kaufman's film, [[Scott Glenn]] plays Shepard.)

[[File:DynAXIS L.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern mirror galvanometer from Scanlab]]

A '''mirror galvanometer''' is an electromechanical instrument that indicates that it has sensed an electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] by deflecting a light beam with a [[mirror]].  The beam of light projected on a scale acts as a long massless pointer.  In 1826, [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]] developed the mirror galvanometer for detecting electric currents. The apparatus is also known as a ''spot galvanometer'' after the spot of light produced in some models.

Mirror galvanometers were used extensively in scientific instruments before reliable, stable [[electronic amplifier]]s were available.  The most common uses were as recording equipment for [[seismometer]]s and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] used for telegraphy.

In modern times, the term ''mirror galvanometer'' is also used for devices that move [[laser]] beams by rotating a mirror through a galvanometer set-up. The name is often abbreviated as ''galvo''.

== Kelvin's galvanometer ==

The mirror galvanometer was later improved by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later to become Lord Kelvin. He would patent the device in 1858.

Thomson reacted to the need for an instrument that could indicate with sensibility all the variations of the [[current (electricity)|current]] in a long cable. This instrument was far more [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitive]] than any which preceded it, enabling the detection of the slightest defect in the core of a cable during its manufacture and submersion.  Moreover, it proved the best apparatus for receiving messages through a long cable.

The following is adapted from a contemporary account of Thomson's instrument:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Munro | first = John | title = Heroes of the Telegraph | date = July 1997 | publisher = Project Gutenberg | url = http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The mirror galvanometer consists of a long fine coil of silk-covered copper wire. In the heart of that coil, within a little air-chamber, a small round mirror is hung by a single fibre of floss silk, with four tiny magnets cemented to its back.  A beam of light is thrown from a lamp upon the mirror, and reflected by it upon a white screen or scale a few feet distant, where it forms a bright spot of light.  When there is no current on the instrument, the spot of light remains stationary at the zero position on the screen; but when a current flows through the traverses the long wire of the coil, the suspended magnets twist themselves horizontally out of their former position, the mirror is  inclined with them, and the beam of light is deflected along the screen to one side or the other, according to the nature of the current. If a positive electric current gives a deflection to the right of zero, a negative current will give a deflection to the left of zero, and vice versa.

The air in the little chamber surrounding the mirror is compressed at will, so as to act like a cushion, and deaden the movements of the mirror.  The needle is thus prevented from idly swinging about at each deflection, and the separate signals are rendered abrupt.  At a receiving station the current coming in from the cable has simply to be passed through the coil before it is sent into the ground, and the wandering light spot on the screen faithfully represents all its variations to the clerk, who, looking on, interprets these, and cries out the message word by word.  The small weight of the mirror and magnets which form the moving part of this instrument, and the range to which the minute motions of the mirror can be magnified on the screen by the reflected beam of light, which acts as a long impalpable hand or pointer, render the mirror galvanometer marvellously sensitive to the current, especially when compared with other forms of receiving instruments.  Messages could be sent from the United Kingdom to the United States through one Atlantic cable and back again through another, and there received on the mirror galvanometer, the electric current used being that from a toy battery made out of a lady's silver thimble, a grain of zinc, and a drop of acidulated water.

The practical advantage of this extreme delicacy is that the signal waves of the current may follow each other so closely as almost entirely to coalesce, leaving only a very slight rise and fall of their crests, like ripples on the surface of a flowing stream, and yet the light spot will respond to each.  The main flow of the current will of course shift the zero of the spot, but over and above this change of place the spot will follow the momentary fluctuations of the current which form the individual signals of the message.  What with this shifting of the zero and the very slight rise and fall in the current produced by rapid signalling, the ordinary land line instruments are quite unserviceable for work upon long cables.}}

== Moving coil galvanometer ==

Moving coil galvanometer was developed independently by [[Marcel Deprez]] and  [[Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval]] about 1880. Deprez's galvanometer was developed for high currents, while D'Arsonval designed his to measure weak currents. Unlike in the Kelvin's galvanometer, in this type of galvanometer the magnet is stationary and the coil is suspended in the magnet gap. The mirror attached to the coil frame rotates together with it. This form of instrument can be more sensitive and accurate and it replaced the Kelvin's galvanometer in most applications. The moving coil galvanometer is practically immune to ambient magnetic fields. Another important feature is self-damping generated by the electro-magnetic forces due to the currents induced in the coil by its movements the magnetic field. These are proportional to the angular velocity of the coil.

== Modern uses ==
[[File:Laser galvo.jpg|thumb|Mirror galvo in an RGB [[laser projector]].]]
[[File:Spot Galvanometer picture.png|thumb|right|200px|"EdSpot", a popular commercial mirror galvanometer, somewhat resembles this picture.]]

In modern times, high-speed mirror [[galvanometer]]s are employed in [[laser light shows]] to move the laser beams and produce colorful geometric patterns in fog around the audience. Such high speed mirror galvanometers have proved to be indispensable in industry for [[laser marking]] systems for everything from laser etching hand tools, containers, and parts to batch-coding [[Wafer (electronics)|semiconductor wafers]] in [[semiconductor device fabrication]]. They typically control [[Cartesian coordinate system|X and Y directions]] on [[Nd:YAG]] and [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser]] markers to control the position of the infrared power laser spot. [[Laser ablation]], [[laser beam machining]] and [[wafer dicing]] are all industrial areas where high-speed mirror galvanometers can be found.

This moving coil galvanometer is mainly used to measure very feeble or low currents of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;A.

To linearise the magnetic field across the coil throughout the galvanometer's range of movement, the [[Galvanometer#History|d'Arsonval design]] of a soft iron cylinder is placed inside the coil without touching it. This gives a consistent radial field, rather than a parallel linear field.

The '''reststrahlen effect''' (German: “residual rays”) is a [[Reflection (physics)|reflectance]] phenomenon in which [[electromagnetic radiation]] within a narrow energy band cannot propagate within a given medium due to a change in [[refractive index]] concurrent with the specific absorbance band of the medium in question; this narrow energy band is termed the ''reststrahlen band''.

As a result of this inability to propagate, normally incident reststrahlen band radiation experiences strong-reflection or total-reflection from that medium.

The energies at which reststrahlen bands occur vary and are particular to the individual compound.

Numerous physical attributes of a compound will have an effect on the appearance of the reststrahlen band. These include phonon band-gap, particle/grain size, strongly absorbing compounds, compounds with optically opaque bands in the infrared.

== Appearance ==
Reststrahlen bands manifest in diffuse reflectance [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared]] absorption spectra as complete band reversal, or in infrared emission spectra as a minimum in emissivity.

==Application==
The reststrahlen effect is used to investigate the properties of semiconductors, it is also used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]].

The '''Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Grant Award''' was a grant award originally announced in 2000.&lt;ref name="torygraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1350497/4m-set-aside-to-lure-Beckhams-of-science.html "£4m set aside to lure 'Beckhams of science'"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', July 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which has now been superseded by the [[Royal Society Wolfson Fellowship]]s. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/wolfson-research-merit/|title=Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 26 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

It was administered by the [[Royal Society]] and jointly funded by the [[Wolfson Foundation]] and the UK [[Office of Science and Technology]], to give universities additional financial support to attract key researchers to this country or to retain those who might seek to gain higher salaries elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/6MdvAoJ6d&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle the [[brain drain]].&lt;ref name="braindrain"/&gt; They were given in four annual rounds, with up to seven awards per round.&lt;ref name="braindrain"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smaglik | first1 = P. | title = Battling the brain drain | doi = 10.1038/nj6871-03a | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6871 | pages = 3–31 | year = 2002 | pmid =  11823808| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SimPy''' is a process-based [[List of discrete event simulation software|discrete-event]] [[simulation]] framework based on standard
[[Python (programming language)|Python]]. Its event dispatcher is based on Python’s [https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator generators] and can also
be used for asynchronous networking or to implement multi-agent systems (with
both, simulated and real communication).

Processes in SimPy are simple Python generator functions and are used to model
active components like customers, vehicles or agents. SimPy also provides
various types of shared ''resources'' to model limited capacity congestion points
(like servers, checkout counters and tunnels). From version 3.1, it will also
provide monitoring capabilities to aid in gathering statistics about resources
and processes.

Simulations can be performed “as fast as possible”, in real time (wall clock
time) or by manually stepping through the events.

Though it is theoretically possible to do continuous simulations with SimPy, it
has no features to carry out that. However, SimPy is overkill
for simulations with a fixed step size where your processes don’t interact with
each other or with shared resources — use a simple &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop in this case.

The SimPy distribution contains tutorials, in-depth documentation, and a large
number of examples.

SimPy is released as [[Open-source software|open source]] software under the [[MIT License]]. The first version was released in December 2002.

== Example ==

One of SimPy's main goals is to be easy to use. Here is an example for a simple SimPy simulation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stefan.sofa-rockers.org/downloads/simpy-ep14.pdf#page=5|title=Discrete-event simulation with SimPy|last=Scherfke|first=Stefan|date=July 25, 2014|website=|publisher=|page=5|format=PDF|access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''clock''' process that prints the current simulation time at each step:
&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import simpy
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def clock(env, name, tick):
...     while True:
...         print(name, env.now)
...         yield env.timeout(tick)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; env = simpy.Environment()
&gt;&gt;&gt; env.process(clock(env, 'fast', 0.5))
&lt;Process(clock) object at 0x...&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; env.process(clock(env, 'slow', 1))
&lt;Process(clock) object at 0x...&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; env.run(until=2)
fast 0
slow 0 
fast 0.5 
slow 1 
fast 1.0 
fast 1.5
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Telecommunications engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline centered on [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]] which seeks to support and enhance [[telecommunication]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jee.org/2001/october/417.pdf |title=The First Telecommunications Engineering Program in the United States |author=Burnham, Gerald O.|journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=653–657 |date=October 2001 |publisher=[[American Society for Engineering Education]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf |title=Program criteria for telecommunications engineering technology or similarly named programs |work=Criteria for accrediting engineering technology programs 2012-2013 |page=23 |date=October 2011 |publisher=[[ABET]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work ranges from basic [[circuit design]] to strategic mass developments. A telecommunication engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the installation of telecommunications equipment and facilities, such as complex [[electronic switching system]]s, and other [[plain old telephone service]] facilities, [[optical fiber]] cabling, [[IP network]]s, and [[microwave transmission]] systems. Telecommunication engineering also overlaps with [[broadcast engineering]].

Telecommunication is a diverse field of engineering connected to [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[systems engineering]]. Ultimately, telecom engineers are responsible for providing high-speed [[data transmission]] services. They use a variety of equipment and transport media to design the telecom network infrastructure; the most common media used by wired telecommunications today are [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]]s, and [[optical fiber]]s. Telecommunications engineers also provide solutions revolving around [[wireless]] modes of communication and information transfer, such as wireless telephony services, radio and [[satellite communications]], and [[internet]] and [[broadband]] technologies.

==History==
Telecommunication systems are generally designed by telecommunication engineers which sprang from technological improvements in the telegraph industry in the late 19th century and the radio and the telephone industries in the early 20th century. Today, telecommunication is widespread and devices that assist the process, such as the television, radio and telephone, are common in many parts of the world. There are also many networks that connect these devices, including computer networks, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} radio networks, and television networks. Computer communication across the Internet is one of many examples of telecommunication.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Telecommunication plays a vital role in the world economy, and the telecommunication industry's revenue has been placed at just under 3% of the gross world product.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Telegraph and telephone ===
{{Main|Electrical telegraph|Transatlantic telegraph cable|Invention of the telephone|History of the telephone}}
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's big box telephone, 1876, one of the first commercially available telephones - National Museum of American History - DSC06223.JPG|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell's big box telephone, 1876, one of the first commercially available telephones - National Museum of American History]]

[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. Soon after he was joined by [[Alfred Vail]] who developed the register &amp;mdash; a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape. This was demonstrated successfully over three miles (five kilometres) on 6 January 1838 and eventually over forty miles (sixty-four kilometres) between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] on 24 May 1844. The patented invention proved lucrative and by 1851 telegraph lines in the [[United States]] spanned over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm The Electromagnetic Telegraph], J. B. Calvert, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time. Earlier transatlantic cables installed in 1857 and 1858 only operated for a few days or weeks before they failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ The Atlantic Cable], Bern Dibner, Burndy Library Inc., 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The international use of the telegraph has sometimes been dubbed the "[[Victorian Internet]]".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Redfern, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4475394.stm Wiring up the 'Victorian internet']'', [[BBC News]], 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial telephone services were set up in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of [[New Haven]] and [[London]]. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries. The technology grew quickly from this point, with inter-city lines being built and [[telephone exchange]]s in every major city of the United States by the mid-1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm Connected Earth: The telephone], BT, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html History of AT&amp;T], AT&amp;T, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Arthur W. |authorlink= |date=January 1906 |title=Communication By Wire And "Wireless": The Wonders of Telegraph and Telephone |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIII |issue= |pages=8408–8422 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3IfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8408|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, transatlantic voice communication remained impossible for customers until January 7, 1927 when a connection was established using radio. However no cable connection existed until [[TAT-1]] was inaugurated on September 25, 1956 providing 36 telephone circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cables/CableTimeLine/index1951.htm History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy], Bill Glover, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Bell and co-inventor [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] conducted the world's first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by [[photophone]]s. The scientific principles of their invention would not be utilized for several decades, when they were first deployed in military and [[fiber-optic communication]]s.

=== Radio and television ===
[[File:Marconi crystal radio receiver.jpg|thumb|[[Marconi]] crystal radio receiver]]
{{Main|History of radio|History of television}}

Over several years starting in 1894 the Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] built the first complete, commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based on airborne electromagnetic waves ([[radio transmission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klooster|first=John W.|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|pages=161–168|date=2009|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1901, he would go on to established wireless communication between Britain and Newfoundland, earning him the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1909 (which he shared with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm Tesla Biography], Ljubo Vujovic, Tesla Memorial Society of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Reginald Fessenden]] was able to wirelessly transmit a human voice. On March 25, 1925, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] publicly demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette pictures at the London department store [[Selfridges]].  In October 1925, Baird was successful in obtaining moving pictures with [[halftone]] shades, which were by most accounts the first true television pictures.&lt;ref name="The Baird Television Website"&gt;[http://www.bairdtelevision.com The Baird Television Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a public demonstration of the improved device on 26 January 1926 again at [[Selfridges]]. Baird's first devices relied upon the [[Nipkow disk]] and thus became known as the [[mechanical television]]. It formed the basis of semi-experimental broadcasts done by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] beginning September 30, 1929.

=== Satellite ===
{{Main|Communications satellite|Satellite phone|Satellite radio|Satellite television|Satellite Internet access}}
The first U.S. satellite to relay communications was [[Project SCORE]] in 1958, which used a tape recorder to [[store and forward]] voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1960 [[NASA]] launched an [[Echo satellite]]; the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  [[Courier 1B]], built by [[Philco]], also launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as uses in GPS, television, internet and telephone uses.

[[Telstar]] was the first active, direct relay commercial [[communications satellite]]. Belonging to [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company|AT&amp;T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&amp;T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch. [[Relay 1]] was launched on December 13, 1962, and became the first satellite to broadcast across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name="NASA-SP-93"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf|title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30–32|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental [[long distance telephony]]. The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted a receiving [[satellite dish]] via a [[geostationary satellite]] in Earth orbit.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s, through the use of [[fiber-optics]], caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still exclusively service remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example [[Antarctica]], plus large regions of [[Australia]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Northern Canada]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Greenland]].

After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including [[satellite phone|mobile satellite phones]], [[satellite radio]], [[satellite television]] and [[satellite Internet access]]. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial [[Transponder (satellite communications)|satellite transponder channels]] continued to drop significantly.

=== Computer networks and the Internet ===
{{main|Computer networking|History of the Internet}}
[[File:Arpanet 1974.svg|thumb|Symbolic representation of the Arpanet as of September 1974]]

On 11 September 1940, [[George Stibitz]] was able to transmit problems using [[teleprinter]] to his Complex Number Calculator in New York and receive the computed results back at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/stibitz.htm George Stlibetz], Kerry Redshaw, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration of a centralized computer or [[mainframe computer]] with remote "dumb terminals" remained popular throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] — a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969. This network soon became the [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hafner | first = Katie | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARPANET's development centered around the Request for Comment process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of the [[communication protocol]]s that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.

===Optical fiber===
{{main |Fiber-optic communication}}
[[File:U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Gary Chitwood, a tactical automated security system (TASS) administrator with the 380th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, tests a fiber optic wire 130320-F-ME639-036.jpg|thumb|[[Optical fiber]]]]

Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and [[computer network]]ing because it is flexible and can be bundled into cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few [[optical communications repeater|repeater]]s.

In 1966 [[Charles K. Kao]] and [[George Hockham]] proposed optical fibers at STC Laboratories (STL) at [[Harlow]], England, when they showed that the losses of 1000&amp;nbsp;dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5-10&amp;nbsp;dB/km in coaxial cable) was due to contaminants, which could potentially be removed.

Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by [[Corning Glass Works]], with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20[[Decibel|dB]]/km), and at the same time GaAs (Gallium arsenide) [[Laser diode|semiconductor lasers]] were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.

After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic communications system was developed, which operated at a wavelength around 0.8&amp;nbsp;µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45&amp;nbsp;[[Mbps]] with repeater spacing of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.

The first wide area network fibre optic cable system in the world seems to have been installed by Rediffusion in Hastings, East Sussex, UK in 1978. The cables were placed in ducting throughout the town, and had over 1000 subscribers. They were used at that time for the transmission of television channels,not available because of local reception problems.

The first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] to use optical fiber was [[TAT-8]], based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988.

In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the [[Internet]], and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as [[video on demand]]. [[Internet protocol]] data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under [[Moore's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hellman |first=Martin E. |title=Moore's Law and Communications |url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/moore.html |date=11 June 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic elements of a telecommunication system===
{{Main|Telecommunication}}

====Transmitter====
{{Main|Transmitter}}
[[Transmitter]] (information source) that takes information and converts it to a signal for transmission. In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]] a transmitter or radio transmitter is an [[electronic device]] which, with the aid of an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], produces [[radio wave]]s. In addition to their use in [[broadcasting]], transmitters are necessary component parts of many electronic devices that communicate by [[radio communication|radio]], such as [[cell phone]]s, 
[[File: Lautsprecherkabel Makro nah.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Copper]] wires]]

====Transmission medium====
{{Main|Transmission medium}}
[[Transmission medium]] over which the signal is transmitted. For example, the transmission medium for [[sound]]s is usually air, but solids and liquids may also act as transmission media for sound. Many transmission media are used as [[communications channel]]. One of the most common physical medias used in networking is [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]]. Copper wire to carry signals to long distances using relatively low amounts of power.Another example of a physical medium is [[optical fiber]], which has emerged as the most commonly used transmission medium for long-distance communications. Optical fiber is a thin strand of glass that guides light along its length.

The absence of a material medium in [[vacuum]] may also constitute a transmission medium for [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s.

====Receiver====
{{Main|Receiver (radio)}}
[[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]] ([[information sink]]) that receives and converts the signal back into required information. In [[radio communications]], a radio receiver is an electronic device that receives [[radio wave]]s and converts the information carried by them to a usable form. It is used with an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound (an [[audio signal]]), images (a [[video signal]]) or [[digital data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio Frequency, RF, Technology and Design, ''Radio Receiver Technology'' |website=Radio-Electronics.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127132225/http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |archivedate=27 January 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wireless communication tower.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wireless]] communication tower, [[cell site]]]]

===Wired communication===

Wireless communication involves the transmission of information over a distance without help of wires, cables or any other forms of electrical conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/wireless_communication |title=What is wireless communication technology and its types |website=EngineersGarage |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless operations permit services, such as long-range communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the [[telecommunications]] industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls etc.) which use some form of energy (e.g. [[radio waves]], acoustic energy, etc.) to transfer information without the use of wires.&lt;ref name="FS1037C"&gt;{{cite web|title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007 |url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |publisher=atis.org |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Roles==

===Telecom equipment engineer===
A telecom equipment engineer is an electronics engineer that designs equipment such as routers, switches, multiplexers, and other specialized computer/electronics equipment designed to be used in the telecommunication network infrastructure.

===Network engineer===
A network engineer is a computer engineer who is in charge of designing, deploying and maintaining computer networks. In addition, they oversee network operations from a [[network operations center]], designs [[backbone network|backbone]] infrastructure, or supervises interconnections in a [[data center]].

===Central-office engineer===
[[File:Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone Central Office Installation.jpg|thumb|Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone [[Telephone exchange|Central Office]] Installation]]
A central-office engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the implementation of telecommunications equipment in a [[Telephone exchange|central office]] (CO for short), also referred to as a wire center or [[telephone exchange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Overstreet |first=Frank |url=http://www.frankoverstreet.com/pages/co/what-is-a-central-office.aspx |title=What is a Central Office |website=www.frankoverstreet.com |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CO engineer is responsible for integrating new technology into the existing network, assigning the equipment's location in the wire center, and providing power, clocking (for digital equipment), and alarm monitoring facilities for the new equipment. The CO engineer is also responsible for providing more power, clocking, and alarm monitoring facilities if there are currently not enough available to support the new equipment being installed. Finally, the CO engineer is responsible for designing how the massive amounts of cable will be distributed to various equipment and wiring frames throughout the wire center and overseeing the installation and turn up of all new equipment.

====Sub-roles====
As [[structural engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of racking and bays for the equipment to be installed in as well as for the plant to be placed on.

As [[electrical engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[capacitance]], and [[inductance]] (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable. [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for. In addition, power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the wire center.

Overall, CO engineers have seen new challenges emerging in the CO environment. With the advent of Data Centers, [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) facilities, cellular radio sites, and other emerging-technology equipment environments within telecommunication networks, it is important that a consistent set of established practices or requirements be implemented.

Installation suppliers or their sub-contractors are expected to provide requirements with their products, features, or services. These services might be associated with the installation of new or expanded equipment, as well as the removal of existing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1275&amp; GR-1275, ''Central Office/Network Environment Equipment Installation/Removal Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1502&amp; GR-1502, ''Central Office/Network Environment Detail Engineering Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other factors must be considered such as:
*Regulations and safety in installation
*Removal of hazardous material
*Commonly used tools to perform installation and removal of equipment

===Outside-plant engineer===
[[File:VZ SAI workers Secaucus jeh.JPG|thumb|Engineers working on a [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]]]]
[[Outside plant]] (OSP) engineers are also often called field engineers because they frequently spend much time in the field taking notes about the civil environment, aerial, above ground, and below ground.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} OSP engineers are responsible for taking plant (copper, fiber, etc.) from a wire center to a distribution point or destination point directly. If a distribution point design is used, then a [[cross-connect]] box is placed in a strategic location to feed a determined distribution area.

The [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]], is then installed to allow connections to be made more easily from the wire center to the destination point and ties up fewer facilities by not having dedication facilities from the wire center to every destination point.  The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary.  These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.

The plant facilities can be delivered via underground facilities, either direct buried or through conduit or in some cases laid under water, via aerial facilities such as telephone or power poles, or via microwave radio signals for long distances where either of the other two methods is too costly.

====Sub-roles====
[[File:Lady pole climbing Telephone Engineer - geograph.org.uk - 467324.jpg|thumb|Engineer (OSP) climbing a telephone pole]]
As [[structural engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of cellular towers and telephone poles as well as calculating pole capabilities of existing telephone or power poles onto which new plant is being added.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges. Shoring also has to be taken into consideration for larger trenches or pits.  Conduit structures often include encasements of slurry that needs to be designed to support the structure and withstand the environment around it (soil type, high traffic areas, etc.).

As [[electrical engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the resistance, capacitance, and inductance (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable.  [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for.  In addition power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the field.  Ground potential has to be taken into consideration when placing equipment, facilities, and plant in the field to account for lightning strikes, high voltage intercept from improperly grounded or broken power company facilities, and from various sources of electromagnetic interference.

As [[civil engineer]]s, OSP engineers are responsible for drafting plans, either by hand or using [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) software, for how telecom plant facilities will be placed.  Often when working with municipalities trenching or boring permits are required and drawings must be made for these.  Often these drawings include about 70% or so of the detailed information required to pave a road or add a turn lane to an existing street.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges.  As civil engineers, telecom engineers provide the modern communications backbone for all technological communications distributed throughout civilizations today.

Unique to telecom engineering is the use of air-core cable which requires an extensive network of air handling equipment such as compressors, manifolds, regulators and hundreds of miles of air pipe per system that connects to pressurized splice cases all designed to pressurize this special form of copper cable to keep moisture out and provide a clean signal to the customer.

As political and social [[ambassador]], the OSP engineer is a telephone operating company's face and voice to the local authorities and other utilities. OSP engineers often meet with municipalities, construction companies and other utility companies to address their concerns and educate them about how the telephone utility works and operates.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, the OSP engineer has to secure real estate to place outside facilities on, such as an easement to place a cross-connect box on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">[[File:Tesla valve cross-section.png|thumb|360px|Cross-section of a Tesla valve, displaying its unique cavity design, from the original patent application.]]
A '''Tesla valve''', called by Tesla a '''valvular conduit''', is a fixed-geometry passive [[check valve]]. It allows a [[fluid]] to flow preferentially in one direction, without moving parts. The device is named after [[Nikola Tesla]], who was awarded a patent in 1920 for its invention. The patent application describes the invention as follows:&lt;ref name ="Patent"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The interior of the conduit is provided with enlargements, recesses, projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance to the passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the opposite [direction].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tesla illustrates this with the drawing, showing one possible construction with a series of eleven flow-control segments, although any other number of such segments could be used as desired to increase or decrease the flow regulation effect.

One [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulation of Tesla valves with 2 and 4 segments showed that the flow resistance in the blocking (or reverse) direction was respectively about 15 and 40 times greater than the unimpeded (or forward) direction.&lt;ref name = "CFD"/&gt; This lends support to Tesla's patent assertion that in the valvular conduit in his diagram, a pressure ratio "approximating 200 can be obtained so that the device acts as a slightly leaking valve".&lt;ref name ="Patent"/&gt;

The Tesla valve is used in [[microfluidic]] applications&lt;ref name = "microvalves"/&gt; and offers advantages such as scalability, durability, and ease of fabrication in a variety of materials.&lt;ref name = "Micropump"/&gt;

==Diodicity==
The valves are structures that have a higher pressure drop for the flow in one direction (reverse) than the other (forward). This difference in flow resistance causes a net directional flow rate in the forward direction in oscillating flows. The efficiency is often expressed in diodicity &lt;math&gt;Di&lt;/math&gt;, being the ratio of pressure drops for identical flow rates:&lt;ref name="diodicity"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Di = \left( \frac{\Delta p_r}{\Delta p_f} \right)_Q, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p_r&lt;/math&gt; is the reverse flow pressure drop, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta p_f&lt;/math&gt; the forward flow pressure drop for flow rate &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:2005gdpIndustrial.png|thumb|right|Industrial output in 2005]]
[[File:2005gdpServices.png|thumb|right|Service output in 2005]]
The '''three-sector model''' in [[economics]] divides economies into three sectors of activity: extraction of raw materials ([[Primary sector of industry|primary]]), manufacturing ([[Secondary sector of industry|secondary]]), and services ([[Tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]]).  It was developed by [[Allan George Barnard Fisher|Allan Fisher]], [[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]] and [[Jean Fourastié]].

According to the model, the main focus of an [[economy]]'s activity shifts from the primary, through the secondary and finally to the tertiary sector.  Fourastié saw the process as essentially positive, and in ''The Great Hope of the Twentieth Century'' he wrote of the increase in [[quality of life]], social security, blossoming of education and culture, higher level of qualifications, humanisation of work, and avoidance of [[unemployment]].

Countries with a low [[per capita income]] are in an early state of development; the main part of their [[national income]] is achieved through production in the primary sector.  Countries in a more advanced state of development, with a medium [[national income]], generate their income mostly in the secondary sector.  In highly developed countries with a high income, the tertiary sector dominates the total output of the economy.

==Structural transformation according to Fourastié==
[[File:The distribution of the workforce among the three sectors.png|thumb|Three sectors according to Fourastié]]
[[File:Clark's sector model.svg|thumb|Clark's sector model]]
[[Image:Economic sectors and income.JPG|thumb|right|200px|This figure illustrates the percentages of a country's economy made up by different sector. The figure illustrates that countries with higher levels of socio-economic development tend to have less of their economy made up of primary and secondary sectors and more emphasis in tertiary sectors. The less developed countries exhibit the inverse pattern.]]
The distribution of the workforce among the three sectors progresses through different stages as follows, according to Fourastié:

===First phase: Traditional civilizations===
{{main|Primary sector of the economy}}
Workforce quotas:
* Primary sector: 64.5%
* Secondary sector: 20%
* Tertiary sector: 15.5%


This phase represents a society which is scientifically not yet very developed, with a negligible use of [[machine]]ry.  The state of development corresponds to that of European countries in the early [[Middle Ages]], or that of a modern-day [[developing country]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

===Second phase: Transitional period===
{{main|Secondary sector of the economy}}
Workforce quotas:
* Primary sector: 40%
* Secondary sector: 40%
* Tertiary sector: 20%

More machinery is deployed in the primary sector, which reduces the number of workers needed.  As a result, the demand for machinery production in the secondary sector increases.  The transitional way or  phase begins with an event which can be identified with the [[industrialisation]]: far-reaching mechanisation (and therefore automation) of manufacture, such as the use of [[conveyor belt]]s.

The tertiary sector begins to develop, as do the [[finance|financial]] sector and the power of the state.

===Third phase: Tertiary civilization===
{{main|Tertiary sector of the economy}}
Workforce quotas:
* Primary sector: 10%
* Secondary sector: 20%
* Tertiary sector: 70%

The primary and secondary sectors are increasingly dominated by automation, and the demand for workforce numbers falls in these sectors.  It is replaced by the growing demands of the tertiary sector.  The situation now corresponds to modern-day industrial societies and the society of the future, the service or [[post-industrial society]].  Today the tertiary sector has grown to such an enormous size that it is sometimes further divided into an information-based [[Quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary sector]], and even a quinary sector based on human services.

'''''Three Roads to Quantum Gravity: A New Understanding of Space, Time and the Universe''''' is the second non-fiction book by American [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lee Smolin]]. The book was initially published on May 30, 2001 by [[Basic Books]] as a part of ''Science Masters'' series.

==Overview==
Smolin discusses three potential approaches by which a unified theory of [[quantum gravity]], arguably the foremost issue in [[theoretical physics]], may be realized.  Approaches discussed include [[string theory]], [[M-theory]], and Smolin's preferred approach, [[loop quantum gravity]].  Smolin suggests that these approaches may be approximations of a single, underlying theory.

==Review==
{{quote|Divide an inch in two. Now divide each half again, and then repeat the division, over and over. Can you go on for ever, or do the laws of physics eventually get in the way? Is the fabric of space infinitely divisible, or is it ultimately made up of "atoms"—tiny chunks of space that can never be split? This question may seem almost unanswerable. But as physicist Lee Smolin writes in ''Three Roads to Quantum Gravity'', some of the newest ideas in physics are pointing to a surprising answer: space and time do indeed appear to be made out of such atoms. In explaining why, he offers a tour by a skilled teacher through some of the boldest and most beautiful ideas of modern science. Smolin has been one of the leading figures in recent efforts to bring together two of the most far-reaching scientific theories of our age.}}

'''Tobii''' (formerly known as Tobii Technology AB) is a Swedish high-technology company that develops and sells products for eye control and [[eye tracking]].

== History ==

[[John Elvesjo]], Mårten Skogö and Henrik Eskilsson founded the company in 2001. All three founders play an active role in the company: Henrik Eskilsson is the [[CEO]], John Elvesjö is [[vice president]] and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]], and Mårten Skogö is [[Chief Science Officer]]. The Tobii Group consists of three business units: Tobii Dynavox from an acquisition of US based [[DynaVox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Acquires AAC leader DynaVox Systems LLC |url=http://www.tobii.com/group/news-media/press-releases/tobii-acquires-aac-leader-dynavox-systems-llc/ |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobii Pro, and Tobii Tech. Tobii is based in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, with offices in the US, Japan, China, Germany, Norway and Ukraine. Tobii became publicly traded on April 22, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sweden's Tobii sets IPO price range at 22-25 SEK/share |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/13/tobii-ipo-idUSL5N0XA09I20150413 |publisher=Reuters |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

In 2007, the company got $14 million in [[venture capital]] from Investor Growth Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Technology Raises $14M in Funding From Investor Growth Capital |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070326005524/en/Tobii-Technology-AB-Tobii-Technology-Raises-14M |agency=[[Businesswire]] |date=26 March 2007 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Investor, Amadeus Capital Partners and Northzone Ventures invested an additional $16 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Technology raises $16M funding |url=http://www.mrweb.com/drno/news9974.htm |agency=MrWeb |date=15 May 2009 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the start of 2012, [[Intel Capital]] invested $21 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/03/16/intel-invests-in-tobii-eye-tracker/ |title=Intel invests in Tobii eye tracker |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Sven |last=Grundberg |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Tobii won the Swedish Grand Award of Design together with the design company Myra Industriell Design, for the technology and design in their eye controlled screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.di.se/artiklar/2008/5/6/ogonstyrda-bildskarmar-tilldelas-stora-designpriset/ |title=Ögonstyrda bildskärmar tilldelas Stora designpriset |trans-title=Grand Award of Design awarded for eye tracking screens |last=Bergsell |first=Thomas |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Tobii won the SIME Grand Prize for having the most innovative technology concept.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3582">'''Toussaint de Charpentier''' (22 November 1779 – 4 March 1847) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geologist]] and [[entomologist]].

He was the author of ''Libellulinae europaeae descriptae e depictae'' (1840).

==Biography==
Toussaint de Charpentier was born in [[Freiberg, Saxony]] ( 22 November 1779 and died in [[Brzeg|Brieg]] 4 March 1847. 
Charpentier was the son of the [[Saxony]] geologist and  "Berghauptmann" (head of the mining inspectorate), [[Johann Friedrich William von Charpentier]] and the brother of [[Jean de Charpentier|Johann von Charpentier]]. He studied geology and mining engineering at the [[Bergakademie Freiberg]] and continued his studies at the University of [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohl|first=Michael|date=2012|title=The primary types of Mantispidae (Neuropterida) in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin - An annotated catalogue|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/zoos.201200010|journal=Zoosystematics and Evolution|language=en|volume=88|issue=1|pages=97–124|doi=10.1002/zoos.201200010|issn=1435-1935|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1802 Charpentier went to [[Prussia]], where he accepted a place with the [[Silesia]] Oberbergamt (upper mining authority) in [[Breslau]]. Charpentier took over the management of Schweidnitz local mining authority in [[Schweidnitz]] until returning, in 1811, to the upper mining authority in Breslau.

In 1828 his transfer to [[Dortmund]] as "Vizeberghauptmann"  took place. 1830 he was appointed to a post in "Oberbergamtes"  [[Dortmund]]. In the year 1836 he transferred to the Silesian mining authority in the same capacity. After 1819 he was transferred to Brieg and remained there up to his death in the same office.

Charpentier published numerous writings on mountain structure and geology, in addition, to writing on his hobby, entomology. He published between 1829 and 1830 a new edition of the publications ''Die europäischen Schmetterlinge'' and ''Die ausländischen Schmetterlinge'' with [[Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper]].

Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, (2) 2011. Accessed 12.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Dutch sociologist and Professor of business administration at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], known for his seminal work in the field of [[sociotechnical system]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Arnold, Philip Miedema, Diederik van der Steege (2004) ''Organisaties in verandering''. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caluwé, Léon de, and H.

== Biography == 
Born in [[Jönköping]], Sweden, Ulbo de Sitter was named after his father [[Ulbo de Sitter]] (1902–1980), a geologist working at the [[Leiden University]]. He studied sociology at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and obtained his PhD in 1970 at the [[University of Leiden]] with the thesis, entitled "Leiderschapsvorming en leiderschapsgedrag in een organisatie" (Leadership formation and leadership behavior in an organization).

De Sitter had started working as engineer in the [[merchant navy]] for four years before he started his studies in Amsterdam. After graduation in Amsterdam he worked as sociologist at the head office of the Koninklijke PTT Nederland, nowadays [[KPN]]. Sequentially he was research assistant at the Sociografische Werkgemeenschap (Socio Graphic Work Association) of the University of Amsterdam. In 1971 he was appointed professor at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. From 1986 to 1988 he was also director of the Koers consulting group in 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1990 he was appointed Professor of Sociotechnical System at the University of Nijmegen, where he retired  March 31, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Frans van Eijnatten (1995) (red.) ''Als het maar stroomt! : Ulbo de Sitter, laveren tussen simpel en complex''. Bundel aangeboden aan Prof.dr. L.U. de Sitter ter gelegenheid van zijn afscheid als hoogleraar in de moderne sociotechniek aan de Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen op 31 maart 1995. Assen : Van Gorcum, 1995. {{ISBN|90-232-3013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work == 
De Sitter is best known for introducing the sociotechnical system approach in the Netherlands. This approach involves redesign of organization and change management theory, which was initially developed at the British [[Tavistock Institute]] in the late 1950s. De Sitter combined in his work the systems theory fundamentals of the Delft Systems Approach, developed by [[Jan in 't Veld]] and [[Pierre Malotaux]]. With scientists as [[Björn Gustavsen]], [[Fred Emery]], [[Eric Trist]], De Sitter is considered among the foremost social systems scientists in their field.&lt;ref name="FvE 2011"/&gt;

=== Modern socio-technology (MST) ===
Benders et al. (2010) recalled the development of socio-technical systems design since its initiation at the British coal mines in the late 1940s, and the development of Modern Socio-technology (MST) by De Sitter and others:

:''In 1951, Trist and Bamforth published a founding article on STSD while the London-based Tavistock Institute played a key role in further developing socio-technical design into practical applications. During the 1950s and 1960s these notions were picked up in many countries, with Norwegian and Swedish researchers playing key roles. In the Netherlands a strand of socio-technical scholars and practitioners developed a widely accepted research based organizational design methodology (De Sitter, Den Hertog, &amp; Dankbaar, 1997; De Sitter, 1998). This Dutch variant, called Modern Socio-technology (MST), builds on the classic STSD. In the 1970s Ulbo de Sitter played a key role in developing this socio-technical systems theory (with some roots in German sociology). During the 1980s this design theory was enriched with a proper design methodology based on action research...''&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"&gt;Benders, J. G. J. M., et al. "[http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/661125/roelschoutetenarticle_1.pdf A modern socio-technical view on ERP-systems]." Social computing: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2010): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;
And furthermore specifically about Modern Socio-technology (MST):

:''Modern Socio-technology (MST) mainly differs from STSD by its integral approach. Whereas classic STSD provides a set of static and partial design principles, MST offers detailed structural principles in terms of design content, while at the same time specifying a theory of change by means of worker participation and training (Van Eijnatten, 1993). To emphasize the integral character of this approach, Van Eijnatten and Van der Zwaan (1998) labeled it Integral Organizational Renewal (IOR)."&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"/&gt;

'''Vader''' is the unofficial name given to a dark [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Pluto]]'s largest [[moon]] [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. The crater was discovered by [[NASA]]'s ''[[New Horizons]]'' [[space probe]] on its way by Pluto. It was named after [[Darth Vader]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' media franchise.

'''''Wider than the Sky: The Phenomenal Gift of Consciousness''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[book]] on [[neuroscience]] by the neuroscientist [[Gerald Edelman|Gerald M. Edelman]]. Yale University Press published the book in 2004 . The book includes a [[glossary]], a bibliographic note, and an [[index (publishing)|index]]. The title alludes to an English-language [[poem]] written by [[Emily Dickinson]] in about 1862 . In that poem, Dickinson describes the [[brain]] as "wider than the Sky", "deeper than the sea", and "just the weight of God".

In the preface (page xiii), Edelman describes, as follows, the purpose of the book.

{{quote|A scientific analysis of consciousness must answer the question: How can the firings of neurons give rise to subjective sensations, thoughts, and emotions? To some, the two domains are so disparate as to be irreconcilable. A scientific explanation must provide a causal account of the connection between these domains so that properties in one domain may be understood in terms of events in the other. This is the task I have set myself in this small book.}}

The book's content is similar to another one Edelman co-authored: ''[[A Universe of Consciousness|A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination]]''. Both books put forward the theory of [[neuronal group selection]], also known as [[Neural Darwinism]]. Both books make a distinction between [[primary consciousness]] and [[higher-order consciousness]].
