A cryptographic '''accumulator''' is a [[one way function|one way]] membership function.  It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set. One example is how large [[composite numbers]] accumulate their [[prime factors]], as it's currently impractical to [[integer factorization|factor]] a composite number, but relatively easy to divide a specific prime into another number to see if it is one of the factors and/or to factor it out.  New members may be added or subtracted to the set of factors simply by multiplying or factoring out the number respectively.  More practical accumulators use a [[Quasi-commutative property#Applied to functions|quasi-commutative]] hash function where the size (number of bits) of the accumulator does not grow with the number of members.

The concept was introduced by J. Benaloh and M. de Mare in 1993&lt;ref&gt;J. Benaloh and M. de Mare, [http://www.michaeldemare.com/pubs/owa.pdf One-way accumulators: a decentralized alternative  to digital signatures], Advances in Cryptology—Eurocrypt’93,  LNCS, vol. 765, Springer-Verlag, 1993, pp. 274–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has received renewed interest recently due to the proposed [[Zerocoin]] add on to [[bitcoin]], which employs cryptographic accumulators to eliminate trackable linkage in the bitcoin blockchain, which would make bitcoin anonymous and untraceable, increasing privacy of transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Miers, Ian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">In [[mathematics]], the '''Almgren–Pitts min-max theory''' (named after [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and his student [[Jon T. Pitts]]) is an analogue of [[Morse theory]] for [[hypersurface]]s.

The theory started with the efforts for generalizing [[George David Birkhoff]]'s method for the construction of simple closed [[geodesic]]s on the sphere, to allow the construction of [[embedding|embedded]] [[minimal surface]]s in arbitrary [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Colding]] and [[Camillo De Lellis]]: "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0303305v2.pdf The min-max construction of minimal surfaces]", Surveys in Differential Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

It has played roles in the solutions to a number of [[conjecture]]s in [[geometry]] and [[topology]] found by Almgren and Pitts themselves and also by other mathematicians, such as [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Richard Schoen]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], [[Fernando Codá Marques]], [[André Neves]], [[Ian Agol]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://numdam.mathdoc.fr/numdam-bin/item?id=ASNSP_2006_5_5_4_483_0 |author1=Giaquinta, Mariano |author2=Mucci, Domenico |title=The BV-energy of maps into a manifold : relaxation and density results |publisher=Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa – Classe di Scienze, Sér. 5, 5|number=4 |date=2006 |pages=483–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Holden, Ragni Piene – The Abel Prize 2008-2012, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osserman]] – A Survey of Minimal Surfaces, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cdm/content/vols/2013/0001/a001/index.html |title=Content Online - CDM 2013 Article 1 |publisher=Intlpress.com |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aneves/papers/CDM-harvard3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Applications of Almgren-Pitts Min-max theory |author1=Fernando C.

A '''Bayesian average''' is a method of estimating the [[mean]] of a population using outside information, especially a pre-existing belief,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-average-ratings.html|title=Bayesian Average Ratings|website=www.evanmiller.org|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is factored into the calculation. This is a central feature of [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian interpretation]]. This is relevant when the available data set is small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fulmicoton.com/posts/bayesian_rating|title=Of Bayesian average and star ratings|last=Masurel|first=Paul|website=fulmicoton.com|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating the Bayesian average uses the prior mean ''m'' and a constant&amp;nbsp;''C''. ''C''&amp;nbsp;is assigned a value that is proportional to the typical data set size. The value is larger when the expected variation between data sets (within the larger population) is small. It is smaller when the data sets are expected to vary substantially from one another.

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{x} = {Cm + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \over C + n}  &lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to adding ''C'' data points of value ''m'' to the data set. It is a weighted average of a prior average ''m'' and the sample average.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1847">In [[probability theory]], a '''branching random walk''' is a [[stochastic process]] that generalizes both the concept of a [[random walk]] and of a [[branching process]].  At every generation (a [[discrete time|point of discrete time]]), a branching random walk's value is a set of elements that are located in some [[linear space]], such as the [[real line]]. Each element of a given generation can have several descendants in the next generation. The location of any descendant is the sum of its parent's location and a [[random variable]].

==Example==
An example of branching random walk can be constructed where the branching process generates exactly two descendants for each element, a ''binary ''branching random walk. Given the [[initial condition]] that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;ϵ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, we suppose that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the two children of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;ϵ&lt;/sub&gt;. Further, we suppose that they are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[normal distribution|{{mathcal|N}}(0,&amp;nbsp;1)]] random variables.  Consequently, in generation&amp;nbsp;2, the random variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; are each the sum of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a {{mathcal|N}}(0,&amp;nbsp;1) random variable. In the next generation, the random variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,2&lt;/sub&gt; are each the sum of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; and a {{mathcal|N}}(0,&amp;nbsp;1) random variable. The same construction produces the values at successive times.

Each lineage in the infinite "genealogical tree" produced by this process, such as the sequence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;ϵ&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., forms a conventional random walk.

{{Broaden | date = December 2016 }}
The '''''Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta''''' ("Correctly Established [[siddhanta|Doctrine]] of [[Brahma]]", abbreviated BSS)
is the main work of [[Brahmagupta]], written c. 628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brahmagupta {{!}} Indian astronomer|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Brahmagupta|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Τhis text of mathematical astronomy contains significant mathematical content, including a good understanding of the role of [[0 (number)|zero]], rules for manipulating both [[negative and positive numbers]], a method for computing [[square root]]s, methods of solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s, and rules for summing [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[Brahmagupta's identity]],  and  [[Brahmagupta’s theorem]]. 

The book was written completely in verse and does not contain any kind of mathematical notation.  Nevertheless, it contained the first clear description of the [[quadratic formula]] (the solution of the quadratic equation).&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Michael.  ''The Birth of Mathematics: Ancient Times to 1300'', p. 86 (Infobase Publishing 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Dana.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2QYSAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Brahmagupta&amp;f=false The Universe in Zero Words: The Story of Mathematics as Told through Equations]'', p. 61 (Princeton University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta'' rules for numbers==

'''''Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta''''' is one of the first books to provide concrete ideas on [[positive number]]s, [[negative number]]s, and zero. He wrote the following rules:&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]]. ''Algebra, with Arithmetic and Mensuration, from the Sanscrit of Brahmegupta and Bháscara'', London 1817, p. 339 ([https://archive.org/details/algebrawitharith00brahuoft online])&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[addition|sum]] of two positive quantities is positive
* The sum of two negative quantities is negative
* The sum of zero and a negative number is negative
* The sum of zero and a positive number is positive
* The sum of zero and zero is zero
* The sum of a positive and a negative is their difference; or, if they are equal, zero
* In [[subtraction]], the less is to be taken from the greater, positive from positive
* In subtraction, the less is to be taken from the greater, negative from negative
* When the greater however, is subtracted from the less, the difference is [[additive inverse|reversed]]
* When positive is to be subtracted from negative, and negative from positive, they must be added together
* The [[multiplication|product]] of a negative quantity and a positive quantity is negative 
* The product of two negative quantities is positive
* The product of two positive quantities is positive
* Positive [[division (mathematics)|divided]] by positive or negative by negative is positive
* Positive divided by negative is negative. Negative divided by positive is negative
* Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator 
*A positive or negative number when [[Division by zero|divided by zero]] is a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with the zero as denominator
* [[indeterminate form|Zero divided by zero]] is zero

The last two of these rules are notable as the earliest attempt to define division by zero, even though they are not compatible with modern number theory (division by zero is undefined for a [[field (mathematics)|field]]).&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Complexity economics''' is the application of [[complex system|complexity science]] to the problems of [[economics]]. It sees the economy not as a system in equilibrium, but as one in motion, perpetually constructing itself anew.&lt;ref&gt;W. Brian Arthur, Complexity and the Economy, Oxford: Oxford Economic Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beinhocker"&gt;Beinhocker, Eric D. The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics. Boston, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses computational rather than mathematical analysis to explore how economic structure is formed and reformed, in continuous interaction with the adaptive behavior of the 'agents' in the economy &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0dGLEreBrM&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

The "nearly archetypal example" is an artificial [[stock market]] model created by the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; The model shows two different outcomes, one where "agents do not search much for [[Dependent and independent variables|predictors]] and there is convergence on a homogeneous rational expectations outcome" and another where "all kinds of technical trading strategies appearing and remaining and periods of [[economic bubble|bubbles]] and crashes occurring".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

Another area has studied the [[prisoner's dilemma]], such as in a network where agents play amongst their nearest neighbors or a network where the agents can make mistakes from time to time and "evolve strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In these models, the results show a system which displays "a pattern of constantly changing distributions of the strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

More generally, complexity economics models are often used to study how non-intuitive results at the macro-level of a system can emerge from simple interactions at the micro level.  This avoids assumptions of the [[representative agent]] method, which attributes outcomes in collective systems as the simple sum of the rational actions of the individuals.

== Measures ==

=== Economic complexity index ===
MIT physicist [[César Hidalgo]] and Harvard economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]] introduced a spectral method to measure the complexity of a country's economy by inferring it from the structure of the network connecting countries to the products that they export. The measure combines information of a country's [[diversity index|diversity]], which is positively correlated with a country's productive knowledge, with measures of a product ubiquity (number of countries that produce or export the product).&lt;ref name="HidalgoHausmannPNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=Cesar A.|author2=Hausmann Ricardo|title=The Building Block of Economic Complexity|journal=PNAS|year=2009|issue=106(26)|pages=10570–10575|pmid=19549871|doi=10.1073/pnas.0900943106|pmc=2705545|volume=106|arxiv=0909.3890|bibcode=2009PNAS..10610570H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ComplexityAtlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hausmann &amp; Hidalgo|title=The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0615546625|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/static/pdf/atlas/AtlasOfEconomicComplexity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept, known as the [[The Product Space|"Product Space"]], has been further developed by MIT's [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity|Observatory of Economic Complexity]], and in The Atlas of Economic Complexity&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; in 2011.

==== Relevance ====

The [[economic complexity index]] (ECI) introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann&lt;ref name=HidalgoHausmannPNAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; is highly predictive of future GDP per capita growth. In Hausmann, Hidalgo et al.,&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; the authors show that the List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates ability of the ECI to predict future GDP per capita growth is between 5 times and 20 times larger than the World Bank's measure of governance, the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and standard measures of human capital, such as years of schooling and cognitive ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Complexity matters|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/10/buidling-blocks-economic-growth|newspaper=The Economist|date=Oct 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diversity Training|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15452697?story_id=15452697|newspaper=The Economist|date=Feb 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metrics for country fitness and product complexity ===
[[Luciano Pietronero|Pietronero]] and collaborators have recently proposed a different approach.&lt;ref name=metricsfitness1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tacchella|first=Andrea|title=A New Metrics for Countries' Fitness and Products' Complexity|journal=Scientific Reports|date=10 October 2012|volume=2|issue=723|doi=10.1038/srep00723|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121010/srep00723/full/srep00723.html|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.723T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsfitness2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cristelli|first=Matthieu|title=Measuring the Intangibles: A Metrics for the Economic Complexity of Countries and Products|journal=PLOS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070726|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070726|display-authors=etal|volume=8|pages=e70726|pmid=23940633|pmc=3733723|bibcode=2013PLoSO...870726C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsflyer&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Complexity: Measuring the Intangibles. A Consumer's Guide|url=http://pilhd.phys.uniroma1.it/PILgroup_Economic_Complexity/Home_files/economic_complexity_flyer%20_v2_1.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These metrics are defined as the fixed point of non-linear iterative map. Differently from the linear algorithm giving rise to the ECI, this non-linearity is a key point to properly deal with the nested structure of the data. The authors of this alternative formula claim it has several advantages:

* Consistency with the empirical evidence from the export country-product matrix that diversification plays a crucial role in the assessment of the competitiveness of countries. The metrics for countries proposed by Pietronero is indeed extensive with respect to the number of products.
* Non-linear coupling between fitness and complexity required by the nested structure of the country-product matrix. The nested structure implies that the information on the complexity of a product must be bounded by the producers with the slowest fitness. 
* Broad and [[Pareto distribution|Pareto]]-like distribution of the metrics.
* Each iteration of the method refines information, does not change the meaning of the iterated variables and does not shrink information.

The metrics for country fitness and product complexity have been used in a report&lt;ref name=fitnessmtricsBCG&gt;{{cite web|title=National Strategy for Sweden: From Wealth to Well-being|url=http://www.bcg.se/expertise_impact/publications/publicationdetails.aspx?id=tcm:106-145990|publisher=BCG|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Boston Consulting Group]] on [[Sweden]] growth and development perspectives.

==Features==
[[W. Brian Arthur|Brian Arthur]], [[Steven N. Durlauf]], and [[David A. Lane (scientist)|David A. Lane]] describe several features of complex systems that deserve greater attention in economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Brian | last1 = Arthur | author1-link = W. Brian Arthur | first2 = Steven | last2 = Durlauf | author2-link = Steven N. Durlauf | first3 = David A | last3 = Lane | chapter = Introduction: Process and Emergence in the Economy | title = The Economy as an Evolving Complex System II | publisher = Addison-Wesley | place = Reading, Mass. | year = 1997 | chapterurl = http://www.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/ADLIntro.html | accessdate = 2008-08-26 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Dispersed interaction'''—The economy has interaction between many dispersed, heterogeneous, agents. The action of any given agent depends upon the anticipated actions of other agents and on the aggregate state of the economy.
# '''No global controller'''—Controls are provided by mechanisms of competition and coordination between agents. Economic actions are mediated by legal institutions, assigned roles, and shifting associations. No global entity controls interactions. Traditionally, a fictitious ''auctioneer'' has appeared in some mathematical analyses of general equilibrium models, although nobody claimed any descriptive accuracy for such models.  Traditionally, many mainstream models have imposed ''constraints'', such as requiring that budgets be balanced, and such constraints are avoided in complexity economics.
# '''Cross-cutting hierarchical organization'''—The economy has many levels of organization and interaction. Units at any given level behaviors, actions, strategies, products typically serve as "building blocks" for constructing units at the next higher level. The overall organization is more than hierarchical, with many sorts of tangling interactions (associations, channels of communication) across levels.
# '''Ongoing adaptation'''—Behaviors, actions, strategies, and products are revised frequently as the individual agents accumulate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiozawa | first1 = Y. | year = 2004 | title = Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifest | url = | journal = Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 5–47 | doi=10.14441/eier.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Novelty niches'''—Such niches are associated with new markets, new technologies, new behaviors, and new institutions. The very act of filling a niche may provide new niches. The result is ongoing novelty.
# '''Out-of-equilibrium dynamics'''—Because new niches, new potentials, new possibilities, are continually created, the economy functions without attaining any optimum or global equilibrium. Improvements occur regularly.

==Contemporary trends in economics==
Complexity economics has a complex relation to previous work in economics and other sciences, and to contemporary economics. Complexity-theoretic thinking to understand economic problems has been present since their [[inception]] as [[academic discipline]]s. Research has shown that no two separate micro-events are completely isolated,&lt;ref name="AFC-NA-21"&gt;[[Albert-Laszlo Barabasi]] {{cite web |title =  explaining ''(at 27:07)'' that no two events are completely isolated in the BBC Documentary |work = BBC  |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/|publisher= |page =  |accessdate=11 June 2012}} "Unfolding the science behind the idea of six degrees of separation"&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a relationship that forms a [[macroeconomic]] structure. However, the relationship is not always in one direction; there is a reciprocal influence when feedback is in operation.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.lse.ac.uk/complexity/Papers/Ch2final.pdf|title= Page 20 - Ten Principles of Complexity &amp; Enabling Infrastructures |publisher= by Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Director Complexity Research Programme, London School of Economics |accessdate=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity economics has been applied to many fields.

===Intellectual predecessors===
Complexity economics draws inspiration from [[behavioral economics]], [[Marxian economics]], [[institutional economics]]/[[evolutionary economics]], [[Austrian economics]] and the work of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url=http://sandcat.middlebury.edu/econ/repec/mdl/ancoec/0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also draws inspiration from other fields, such as [[statistical mechanics]] in physics, and [[evolutionary biology]]. Some of the 20th century intellectual background of complexity theory in economics is examined in Alan Marshall (2002) The Unity of Nature, Imperial College Press: London. See Douma &amp; Schreuder (2017) for a non-technical introduction to Complexity Economics and a comparison with other economic theories (as applied to markets and organizations).

===Applications===
The theory of complex dynamic systems has been applied in diverse fields in economics and other decision sciences. These applications include [[capital theory]],&lt;ref name=Rosser1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J.

Saari]].&lt;ref name=Saari2001&gt;Saari, Donald G. ''Chaotic Elections: A Mathematician Looks at Voting''. American Mathematical Society (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Complexity economics has attracted the attention of historians of economics.&lt;ref name=Bausor1994&gt;Bausor, Randall.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ramalingam's [[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]] includes numerous applications of complexity economics that are relevant to [[aid|foreign aid]].

===Complexity economics as mainstream, but non-orthodox===
According to {{harvtxt|Colander|2000}}, {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004}}, and {{harvtxt|Davis|2008}} contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is evolving to be more "eclectic",&lt;ref name=COL2000a&gt;"Economists today are not neoclassical according to any reasonable definition of the term. They are far more eclectic, and concerned with different issues than were the economists of the early 1900s, whom the term was originally designed to describe." {{harvtxt|Colander|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COL2000b&gt;"Modern economics involves a broader world view and is far more eclectic than the neoclassical terminology allows." {{harvtxt|Colander|2000|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; diverse,&lt;ref name=CHR04a&gt;"In our view, the interesting story in economics over the past decades is the increasing variance of acceptable views..." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHR04b&gt;"In work at the edge, ideas that previously had been considered central to economics are being modified and broadened, and the process is changing the very nature of economics." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHR04c&gt;"When certain members of the existing elite become open to new ideas, that openness allows new ideas to expand, develop, and integrate into the profession... These alternative channels allow the mainstream to expand, and to evolve to include a wider range of approaches and understandings... This, we believe, is already occurring in economics." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|pp=488–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pluralism in economics|pluralistic]].&lt;ref name=DAV2008a&gt;"despite an increasing pluralism on the mainstream&amp;nbsp;economics research&amp;nbsp;frontier..." {{harvtxt|Davis|2008|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004}} state that contemporary mainstream economics is "moving away from a strict adherence to the holy trinity – rationality, selfishness, and equilibrium", citing complexity economics along with [[recursive economics]] and [[dynamical system]]s as contributions to these trends.&lt;ref name=CHR04d&gt;{{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; They classify complexity economics as now  mainstream but [[Heterodox economics|non-orthodox]].&lt;ref name=CHR04e&gt;"The second (Santa Fe) conference saw a very different outcome and atmosphere than the first. No longer were mainstream economists defensively adhering to general equilibrium orthodoxy... By 1997, the mainstream accepted many of the methods and approaches that were associated with the complexity approach." {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|p=497}} {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004|pp=490–492}} distinguish between orthodox and mainstream economics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DAV2008b&gt;{{harvtxt|Davis|2008|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 1995-1997 publications, ''[[Scientific American]]'' journalist John Horgan "ridiculed" the movement as being the fourth ''C'' among the "failed fads" of  "[[complexity]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]], and [[cybernetics]]".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In 1997, Horgan wrote that the approach had "created some potent metaphors: the [[butterfly effect]], [[fractal]]s, [[artificial life]], the [[edge of chaos]], [[self organized criticality]].  But they have not told us anything about the world that is both concrete and truly surprising, either in a negative or in a positive sense."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J. Barkley | year = 1999 | title = On the Complexities of Complex Economic Dynamics | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1257/jep.13.4.169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horgan | first1 = John | year = 1995 | title = From Complexity to Perplexity | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 272 | issue = 6| pages = 104–09 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0695-104| bibcode = 1995SciAm.272f.104H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John, The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age. Paperback ed, New York: Broadway Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosser "granted" Horgan "that it  is hard to identify a concrete and surprising discovery (rather than "mere metaphor") that has arisen due to the emergence of complexity analysis" in the discussion journal of the [[American Economic Association]], the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]''.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;  Surveying economic studies based on complexity science, Rosser wrote that the findings, rather than being surprising, confirmed "already-observed facts."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Rosser wrote that there has been "little work on empirical techniques for testing dispersed&amp;nbsp;agent complexity&amp;nbsp;models."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Nonetheless, Rosser wrote that "there is a strain of common perspective that has been accumulating as the four C's of cybernetics, catastrophe, chaos, and complexity emerged, which may now be reaching a critical mass in terms of influencing the thinking of economists more broadly."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

In [[Microsoft Windows]], a '''Cryptographic Service Provider''' (CSP) is a software library that implements the [[Microsoft CryptoAPI]] (CAPI).  CSPs implement encoding and decoding functions, which computer application programs may use, for example, to implement strong user authentication or for secure email.  &lt;!-- garbled language from original stub, need rewrite and explanation of how applications can select between multiple CSPs. --&gt;

CSPs are independent modules that can be used by different applications. A user program calls CryptoAPI functions and these are redirected to CSPs functions. Since CSPs are responsible for implementing cryptographic algorithms and standards, applications do not need to be concerned about security details. Furthermore, one application can define which CSP it is going to use on its calls to CryptoAPI. In fact, all cryptographic activity is implemented in CSPs. CryptoAPI only works as a bridge between the application and the CSP.

CSPs are implemented basically as a special type of [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] with special restrictions on loading and use.  Every CSP must be digitally signed by Microsoft and the signature is verified when Windows loads the CSP.  In addition, after being loaded, Windows periodically re-scans the CSP to detect tampering, either by malicious software such as [[computer virus]]es or by the user him/herself trying to circumvent restrictions (for example on cryptographic key length) that might be built into the CSP's code.

To obtain a signature, non-Microsoft CSP developers must supply paperwork to Microsoft promising to obey various legal restrictions and giving valid contact information.  As of circa 2000, &lt;!-- I don't know about now --&gt; Microsoft did not charge any fees to supply these signatures.  For development and testing purposes, a CSP developer can configure Windows to recognize the developer's own signatures instead of Microsoft's, but this is a somewhat complex and obscure operation unsuitable for nontechnical end users.

The CAPI/CSP architecture had its origins in the era of restrictive US government controls on the [[export of cryptography]].  Microsoft's default or "base" CSP then included with Windows was limited to 512-bit [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[public-key cryptography]] and 40-bit symmetric cryptography, the maximum key lengths permitted in exportable mass market software at the time.  CSPs implementing stronger cryptography were available only to U.S. residents, unless the CSPs themselves had received U.S. government export approval.  The system of requiring CSPs to be signed only on presentation of completed paperwork was intended to prevent the easy spread of unauthorized CSPs implemented by anonymous or foreign developers.  As such, it was presented as a concession made by Microsoft to the government, in order to get export approval for the CAPI itself.

After the ''[[Bernstein v. United States]]'' court decision establishing computer source code as protected [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|free speech]] and the transfer of cryptographic regulatory authority from the U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to the more pro-export [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]], the restrictions on key lengths were dropped, and the CSPs shipped with Windows now include full-strength cryptography.  The main use of third-party CSPs is to interface with external cryptography hardware such as [[hardware security module]]s (HSM) or [[smart card]]s.

==Smart Card CSP==
These cryptographic functions can be realised by a [[smart card]], thus the Smart Card CSP is the Microsoft way of a [[PKCS#11]]. Microsoft Windows is identifying the correct Smart Card CSP, which have to be used, analysing the [[answer to reset]] (ATR) of the smart card, which is registered in the [[Windows Registry]]. Installing a new CSP, all ATRs of the supported smart cards are enlisted in the registry.

==Use of CSP in MS Office password protection==
{{Main|Microsoft Office password protection}}

Cryptographic service providers can be used for encryption of [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[PowerPoint]] documents starting from [[Microsoft Office XP]]. A standard encryption algorithm with a 40-bit [[Key (cryptography)|key]] is used by default, but enabling a CSP enhances [[key length]] and thus makes decryption process more continuous. This only applies to passwords that are required to ''open'' document because this password type is the only one that [[Encryption|encrypts]] a password-protected document.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">In [[mathematics]], a '''deformation ring''' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] that controls liftings of a representation of a [[Galois group]] from a [[finite field]] to a [[local field]]. In particular for any such lifting problem there is often a '''universal deformation ring''' that classifies all such liftings, and whose [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] is the '''universal deformation space'''.

A key step in [[Andrew Wiles|Wiles's]] proof of the [[modularity theorem]] was to study the relation between  universal deformation rings and [[Hecke algebra acting on modular forms|Hecke algebra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28027">In mathematics, '''Deligne–Lusztig theory''' is a way of constructing linear representations of finite [[groups of Lie type]] using [[l-adic cohomology|ℓ-adic cohomology]] with [[compact support]], introduced by {{harvtxt|Deligne|Lusztig|1976}}.

{{harvtxt|Lusztig|1984}} used these representations  to find all representations of all [[finite simple group]]s of Lie type.

==Motivation==
Suppose that ''G'' is a [[reductive group]] defined over a finite field, with [[Frobenius map]] ''F''.

[[Ian G. Macdonald]] conjectured that there should be a map from ''general position'' [[Group character|characters]] of ''F''-stable maximal [[algebraic torus|tori]] to irreducible representations of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; (the fixed points of ''F''). For [[general linear group]]s this was already known by the work of {{harvtxt|Green|1955}}. This was the main result proved by [[Pierre Deligne]] and [[George Lusztig]]; they found a virtual representation for all characters of an ''F''-stable maximal torus, which is irreducible (up to sign) when the character is in general position.

When the maximal torus is split, these representations were well known and are given by [[parabolic induction]] of characters of the torus (extend the character to a [[Borel subgroup]], then induce it up to ''G''). The representations of parabolic induction can be constructed using functions on a space, which can be thought of as elements of a suitable zeroth cohomology group.  Deligne and Lusztig's construction is a generalization of parabolic induction to non-split tori using higher cohomology groups. (Parabolic induction can also be done with tori of ''G'' replaced by [[Levi decomposition|Levi subgroups]] of ''G'', and there is a generalization of Deligne–Lusztig theory to this case too.)

[[Vladimir Drinfeld]] proved that the [[discrete series]] representations of SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) can be found in the  [[l-adic cohomology|ℓ-adic cohomology]] groups

:H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt;)

of the [[affine curve]] ''X'' defined by

:''xy&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;yx&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 1.

The polynomial ''xy&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;yx&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a determinant used in the construction of the  [[modular invariant of a group|Dickson invariant]] of the general linear group, and is an invariant of the special linear group.

The construction of Deligne and Lusztig is a generalization of this fundamental example to other groups. The affine curve ''X'' is generalized to a ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; bundle over a "Deligne–Lusztig variety" where ''T'' is a maximal torus of ''G'', and instead of using just the first cohomology group they use an alternating sum of ℓ-adic cohomology groups with compact support to construct virtual representations.

The Deligne-Lusztig construction is formally similar to [[Hermann Weyl]]'s construction of the representations of a compact group from the characters of a maximal torus. The case of compact groups is easier partly because there is only one conjugacy class of maximal tori. The [[Borel–Weil–Bott theorem|Borel–Weil–Bott construction]] of representations of algebraic groups using coherent sheaf cohomology is also similar.

For [[real semisimple group]]s there is an analogue of the construction of Deligne and Lusztig, using [[Zuckerman functor]]s to construct representations.

==Deligne–Lusztig varieties==
The construction of Deligne-Lusztig characters uses a family of auxiliary algebraic varieties ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; called Deligne–Lusztig varieties, constructed from a reductive [[linear algebraic group]] ''G'' defined over a [[finite field]] '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''B'' is a Borel subgroup of ''G'' and ''T'' a maximal torus of ''B'' then we write

:''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''B''&lt;/sub&gt;

for the [[Weyl group]] ([[normalizer]] mod [[centralizer]])

:''N''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/''T''

of ''G'' with respect to ''T'', together with the [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s corresponding to ''B''. If ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is another Borel subgroup with maximal torus ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then there is a canonical isomorphism from ''T'' to  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that identifies the two Weyl groups. So we can identify all these Weyl groups, and call it 'the' Weyl group ''W'' of ''G''. Similarly there is a canonical isomorphism between any two maximal tori with given choice of [[positive root]]s, so we can identify all these and call it 'the' maximal torus ''T'' of ''G''.

By the [[Bruhat decomposition]]

:''G'' = ''BWB'',

the subgroup ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as the conjugate of ''B'' by ''bw'' for some ''b''∈''B'' and ''w''∈''W'' (identified with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''B''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''w'' is uniquely determined. In this case we say that ''B'' and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are in '''relative position''' ''w''.

Suppose that ''w'' is in the Weyl group of ''G'', and write ''X'' for the smooth projective variety of all Borel subgroups of ''G''. 
The '''Deligne-Lusztig variety''' ''X''(''w'') consists of all Borel subgroups ''B'' of ''G'' such that ''B'' and ''F''(''B'') are in relative position ''w'' [recall that ''F'' is the [[Frobenius map]]]. In other words, it is the  inverse image of the ''G''-homogeneous space of pairs of Borel subgroups in relative position ''w'', under the [[Lang isogeny]] with formula

:''g''.''F''(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
For example, if ''w''=1 then ''X''(''w'') is 0-dimensional and its points are the rational Borel subgroups of ''G''.

We let ''T''(''w'') be the torus ''T'', with the rational structure for which the Frobenius is ''wF''.
The ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; conjugacy classes of ''F''-stable maximal tori of ''G'' can be identified with the ''F''-conjugacy classes of ''W'', where we say ''w''∈''W'' is ''F''-conjugate to elements of the form ''vwF''(''v'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''v''∈''W''. If the group ''G'' is [[split reductive group|split]], so that ''F'' acts trivially on ''W'', this is the same as ordinary conjugacy, but in general for non-split groups ''G'', ''F'' may act on ''W'' via a non-trivial [[diagram automorphism]]. The ''F''-stable conjugacy classes can be identified with elements of the non-abelian [[galois cohomology]] group of [[torsor]]s

:H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''F'',''W'').

Fix a maximal torus ''T'' of ''G'' and a Borel subgroup ''B'' containing it, both invariant under the Frobenius map ''F'', and write ''U'' for the unipotent radical of ''B''.
If we choose a representative ''w''&amp;prime; of the normalizer ''N''(''T'') representing ''w'', then we define ''X''&amp;prime;(''w''&amp;prime;) to be the elements of ''G''/''U'' with ''F''(''u'')=''uw''&amp;prime;.
This is acted on freely by ''T''(''F''), and the quotient is isomorphic to ''X''(''T''). So
for each character θ of ''T''(''w'')&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; we get a corresponding [[local system]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X''(''w''). The
Deligne-Lusztig virtual representation

:''R''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'')

of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by the alternating sum

:&lt;math&gt;R^\theta(w) = \sum_i(-1)^iH_c^i(X(w),F_\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
of ''l''-adic compactly supported cohomology groups of ''X''(''w'') with coefficients in the ''l''-adic local system ''F''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''T'' is a maximal ''F''-invariant torus of ''G'' contained in a Borel subgroup ''B'' such that
''B'' and ''FB'' are in relative position ''w'' then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'') is also 
denoted by ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''⊂''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, or by ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; as up to isomorphism it does not depend on the choice of ''B''.

==Properties of Deligne–Lusztig characters==
*The character of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; does not depend on the choice of prime ''l''≠''p'', and if θ=1 its values are rational integers.
*Every irreducible character of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; occurs in at least one character ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'').
*The inner product of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ′&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''′&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the number of elements of ''W''(''T'',''T''′)&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; taking θ to θ′. The set ''W''(''T'',''T''′) is the set of elements of ''G'' taking ''T'' to ''T''′ under conjugation, modulo the group ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; which acts on it in the obvious way (so if ''T''=''T''′ it is the Weyl group). In particular the inner product is 0 if ''w'' and ''w''′ are not ''F''-conjugate. If θ is in general position then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; has norm 1 and is therefore an irreducible character up to sign. So this verifies Macdonald's conjecture.
*The representation ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; contains the trivial representation if and only if θ=1 (in which case the trivial representation occurs exactly once).
*The representation ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; has dimension
:&lt;math&gt;\dim(R^\theta_{T})= {\pm|G^F| \over |T^F||U^F|}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;, of order the largest power of ''p'' dividing |''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;|.

*The restriction of the character ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; to unipotent elements ''u'' does not depend on θ and is called a '''Green function''', denoted by ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''u'') (the Green function is defined to be 0 on elements that are not unipotent). The character formula gives the character of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of Green functions of subgroups as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;R^\theta_T(x) = {1\over |G_s^F|}\sum_{g\in G^F, g^{-1}sg\in T} Q_{gTg^{-1},G_s}(u)\theta(g^{-1}sg)&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''x''=''su'' is the [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]] of ''x'' as the product of commuting semisimple and unipotent elements ''s'' and ''u'', and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity component of the centralizer of ''s'' in ''G''. In particular the character value vanishes unless the semisimple part of ''x'' is conjugate under ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; to something in the torus ''T''.

*The Deligne-Lusztig variety is usually affine, in particular whenever the characteristic ''p'' is larger than the [[Coxeter number]] ''h'' of the Weyl group. If it is affine and the character θ is in general position (so that the Deligne-Lusztig character is irreducible up to sign) then only one of the cohomology groups ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''(''w''),''F''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;) is non-zero (the one with ''i'' equal to the length of ''w'') so this cohomology group gives a model for the irreducible representation. In general it is possible for more than one cohomology group to be non-zero, for example when θ is 1.

==Lusztig's classification of irreducible characters==
Lusztig classified all the irreducible characters of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; by decomposing such a character into a semisimple character and a unipotent character (of another group) and separately classifying the semisimple and unipotent characters.

===The dual group===
The representations of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; are classified using conjugacy classes of the '''dual group''' of ''G''. 
A reductive group over a finite field determines a [[root datum]] (with choice of Weyl chamber) together with an action of the Frobenius element on it. 
The dual group ''G''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of a reductive  algebraic group ''G'' defined over a finite field is the one with dual root datum (and adjoint Frobenius action). 
This is similar to the [[Langlands dual group]] (or L-group), except here the dual group is defined over a finite field rather than over the complex numbers. The dual group has the same root system, except that root systems of type B and C get exchanged.

The local [[Langlands conjecture]]s state (very roughly) that representations of an algebraic group over a [[local field]] should be closely related to conjugacy classes in the Langlands dual group. Lusztig's classification of representations of reductive groups over finite fields can be thought of as a verification of an analogue of this conjecture for finite fields (though Langlands never  stated his conjecture for this case).

===Jordan decomposition===
In this section ''G'' will be a reductive group with connected center.

An irreducible character  is called '''unipotent''' if it occurs in some ''R''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, and is called '''semisimple''' if its average value on regular unipotent elements is non-zero (in which case the average value is 1 or &amp;minus;1). If ''p'' is a good prime for ''G'' (meaning that it does not divide any of the coefficients of roots expressed as linear combinations of simple roots) then an irreducible character is semisimple if and only if its order is not divisible by ''p''.

An arbitrary irreducible character has a "Jordan decomposition": to it one can associate a semisimple character (corresponding to some semisimple element ''s'' of the dual group), and a unipotent representation of the centralizer of ''s''. The dimension of the irreducible character is the product of the dimensions of its semisimple and unipotent components.

This (more or less) reduces the classification of irreducible characters to the problem of finding the semisimple and the unipotent characters.

===Geometric conjugacy===
Two pairs (''T'',θ), (''T''′,θ′) of a maximal torus ''T'' of ''G'' fixed by ''F'' and a character θ of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; are called '''geometrically conjugate''' if they are conjugate under some element of ''G''(''k''), where ''k'' is the algebraic closure of  '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;. If an irreducible representation occurs in both ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''′&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;θ′&lt;/sup&gt; then (''T'',θ), (''T''′,θ′) need not be conjugate under ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;, but are always geometrically conjugate. For example, if θ = θ′ = 1 and ''T'' and ''T''′ are not conjugate, then the identity representation occurs in both Deligne–Lusztig characters, and the corresponding pairs (''T'',1), (''T''′,1) are geometrically conjugate but not conjugate.

The geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (''T'',θ) are  parameterized by geometric conjugacy classes of semisimple elements ''s'' of the group  ''G''&lt;sup&gt;*''F''&lt;/sup&gt; of elements of the dual group ''G''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; fixed by ''F''. Two elements of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;*''F''&lt;/sup&gt; are called geometrically conjugate if they are conjugate over the algebraic closure of the finite field; if the center of ''G'' is connected this is equivalent to conjugacy in ''G''&lt;sup&gt;*''F''&lt;/sup&gt;. The number of geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (''T'',θ) is |''Z''&lt;sup&gt;0''F''&lt;/sup&gt;|''q''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the identity component of the center ''Z'' of ''G'' and ''l'' is the semisimple rank of ''G''.

===Classification of semisimple characters===
In this subsection ''G'' will be a reductive group with connected center ''Z''. (The case when the center is not connected has some extra complications.)

The semisimple characters of ''G'' correspond to geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (''T'',θ) (where ''T'' is a maximal torus invariant under ''F'' and θ is a character of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;); in fact among the irreducible characters occurring in the Deligne–Lusztig characters of a geometric conjugacy class there is exactly one semisimple character. If
the center of ''G'' is connected there are |''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;|''q''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; semisimple characters. If κ is a geometric conjugacy class of pairs (''T'',θ) then the character of the corresponding semisimple representation is given up to sign by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{(T,\theta)\in \kappa, \bmod G^F} {R_T^\theta\over (R_T^\theta,R_T^\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;
and its dimension is the ''p''&amp;prime; part of the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] of the centralizer of the element ''s'' of the dual group corresponding to it.

The semisimple characters are (up to sign) exactly the duals of the regular characters, under [[Alvis–Curtis duality]], a duality operation on generalized characters. 
An irreducible character is called '''regular''' if it occurs in the [[Gelfand–Graev representation]] 
''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;, which  is the representation induced from a certain "non-degenerate" 1-dimensional character of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup. It is reducible, and any irreducible character of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; occurs at most once in it. If κ is a geometric conjugacy class of pairs (''T'',θ) then the character of the corresponding regular representation is given  by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{(T,\theta)\in \kappa, \bmod G^F} {\epsilon_G\epsilon_TR_T^\theta\over (R_T^\theta,R_T^\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;
and its dimension is the ''p''&amp;prime; part of the index of the centralizer of the element ''s'' of the dual group corresponding to it times the ''p''-part of the order of the centralizer.

===Classification of unipotent characters===

{{main|unipotent representation}}

These can be found from the cuspidal unipotent characters: those that cannot be obtained from decomposition of parabolically induced characters of smaller rank groups. The unipotent cuspidal characters were listed by Lusztig using rather complicated arguments. The number of them depends only on the type of the group and not on the underlying field; and is given as follows:
*none for groups of type ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;;
*none for groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, unless ''n'' = ''s''(''s''+1)/2–1 for some ''s'', in which case there is one;
*none for groups of type ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, unless ''n'' = ''s''(''s''+1) for some ''s'', in which case there is one (called [[θ10|θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] when ''n'' = 2);
*2 for Suzuki groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;
*none for groups of type ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, unless ''n'' = ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some even ''s'', in which case there is one;
*none for groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, unless ''n'' = ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some odd ''s'', in which case there is one;
*2 for groups of type &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;;
*2 for groups of type ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;;
*3 for groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;;
*2 for groups of type ''E''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;;
*13 for groups of type ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;;
*7 for groups of type ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;;
*10 for Ree groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;;
*4 for groups of type ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;
*6 for Ree groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
The unipotent characters can be found by decomposing the characters induced from the cuspidal ones, using results of Howlett and Lehrer. The number of unipotent characters depends only on the root system of the group and not on the field (or the center). The dimension of the unipotent characters can be given by universal polynomials in the order of the ground field depending only on the root system; for example the Steinberg representation has dimension ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the number of positive roots of the root system.

Lusztig discovered that the unipotent characters of a group ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; (with irreducible Weyl group) fall into families of size  4&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' ≥ 0), 8, 21, or 39. The characters of each family are indexed by conjugacy classes of pairs (''x'',σ) where ''x'' is in one of the groups  '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, and σ is a representation of its centralizer. (The family of size 39 only occurs for groups of type ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and the family of size 21 only occurs for groups of type ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.) The families are in turn indexed by special representations of the Weyl group, or equivalently by 2-sided cells of the Weyl group. 
For example, the group ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) has 46 families of unipotent characters corresponding to the 46 special representations of the Weyl group of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 23 families with 1 character, 18 families with 4 characters, 4 families with 8 characters, and one family with 39 characters (which includes the 13 cuspidal unipotent characters).

==Examples==
Suppose that ''q'' is an odd prime power, and ''G'' is the algebraic group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
We describe the Deligne–Lusztig representations of the group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;). (The representation theory of these groups was well known long before Deligne–Lusztig theory.)

The irreducible representations are:
*The trivial representation of dimension 1.
*The [[Steinberg representation]]  of dimension ''q''
*The (''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3)/2 irreducible [[principal series representation]]s of dimension ''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, together with 2 representations of dimension (''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 coming from a reducible principal series representation.
*The (''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 irreducible discrete series representations of dimension ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, together with 2 representations of dimension (''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 coming from a reducible discrete series representation.

There are two classes of tori associated to the two elements (or conjugacy classes) of the
Weyl group, denoted by ''T''(1) (cyclic of order ''q''&amp;minus;1) and ''T''(''w'') (cyclic of order ''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1). The non-trivial element of the  Weyl group acts on the characters of these tori by changing each character to its inverse. So the Weyl group fixes a character if and only if it has order 1 or 2. By the orthogonality formula, 
''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'') is (up to sign) irreducible if θ does not have order 1 or 2, and a sum of two irreducible representations if it has order 1 or 2.

The Deligne-Lusztig variety ''X''(1) for the split torus is 0-dimensional with ''q''+1 points, and can be identified with the points of 1-dimensional projective space defined over '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;. 
The representations ''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;(1) are given as follows:
*1+Steinberg if θ=1
*The sum of the 2 representations of dimension (''q''+1)/2 if θ has order 2.
*An irreducible principal series    representation if θ has order greater than 2.

The Deligne-Lusztig variety ''X''(''w'') for the non-split torus is 1-dimensional, and can be identified with the complenent of ''X''(1) in 1-dimensional projective space. So it is the set of points (''x'':''y'') of projective space not fixed by the Frobenius map (''x'':''y'')→ (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;:''y''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;), in other words the points with
:&lt;math&gt;xy^q-yx^q\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
Drinfeld's variety of points (''x'',''y'') of affine space with
:&lt;math&gt;xy^q-yx^q=1&lt;/math&gt;
maps to ''X''(''w'') in the obvious way, and is acted on freely by the group of ''q''+1th roots
λ of 1 (which can be identified with the elements of the non-split torus that are defined over '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;), with λ taking (''x'',''y'') to (λ''x'',λ''y''). The Deligne Lusztig variety is the quotient of Drinfeld's variety by this group action. 
The representations &amp;minus;''R''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'') are given  as follows:
*Steinberg&amp;minus;1 if θ=1
*The sum of the 2 representations of dimension (''q''&amp;minus;1)/2 if θ has order 2.
*An irreducible discrete series representation if θ has order greater than 2.

The unipotent representations are the trivial representation and the Steinberg representation, and the semisimple  representations are all the representations other than the Steinberg representation. (In this case the semisimple representations do not correspond exactly to geometric conjugacy classes of the dual group, as the center of ''G'' is not connected.)

==Intersection cohomology and character sheaves==

{{harvtxt|Lusztig|1985}} replaced the ℓ-adic cohomology used to define the Deligne-Lusztig representations with [[intersection cohomology|intersection ℓ-adic cohomology]], and introduced certain [[perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]] called '''character sheaves'''. The representations defined using intersection cohomology are related to those defined using ordinary cohomology by [[Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials]]. The ''F''-invariant irreducible character sheaves are  closely related to the irreducible characters of the group ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the subject of [[manifold|manifold theory]] in [[mathematics]], if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold#Manifold_with_boundary|manifold with boundary]], its '''double''' is obtained by gluing two copies of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; together along their common boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to Smooth Manifolds|volume=218|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Lee|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9781441999825|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xygVcKGPsNwC&amp;pg=PA226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Precisely, the double is &lt;math&gt;M \times \{0,1\} / \sim&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(x,0) \sim (x,1)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \partial M&lt;/math&gt;. 

Although the concept makes sense for any manifold, and even for some non-manifold sets such as the [[Alexander horned sphere]], the notion of '''double''' tends to be used primarily in the context that &lt;math&gt;\partial M&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[compact_space|compact]].

== Doubles bound ==

Given a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the '''double''' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the boundary of &lt;math&gt;M \times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives doubles a special role in [[cobordism]].

== Examples ==

The [[sphere|'n'-sphere]] is the double of the [[ball_(mathematics)|''n''-ball]]. In this context, the two balls would be the upper and lower hemi-sphere respectively.  More generally, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is closed, the double of &lt;math&gt;M \times D^k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;M \times S^k&lt;/math&gt;. Even more generally, the double of a disc bundle over a manifold is a sphere bundle over the same manifold. More concretely, the double of the [[Möbius strip]] is the [[Klein bottle]].

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a closed, [[orientability|oriented]] manifold and if &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; by removing an open ball, then the [[connected sum]] &lt;math&gt;M \mathrel{\#} -M&lt;/math&gt; is the double of &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt;.   

The double of a [[Mazur manifold]] is a [[homotopy sphere|homotopy 4-sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14964">The '''Gram–Charlier A series''' (named in honor of [[Jørgen Pedersen Gram]] and [[Carl Charlier]]), and the '''Edgeworth series''' (named in honor of [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]]) are [[series (mathematics)|series]] that approximate a [[probability distribution]] in terms of its [[cumulant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, A., &amp; Kendall, M. G. (1968). The advanced theory of statistics. Hafner Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The series are the same; but, the arrangement of terms (and thus the accuracy of truncating the series) differ.&lt;ref&gt;Kolassa, J. E. (2006). Series approximation methods in statistics (Vol. 88). Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea of these expansions is to write the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the distribution whose [[probability density function]]  {{mvar|f}} is to be approximated in terms of the characteristic function of a distribution with known and suitable properties, and to recover {{mvar|f}} through the inverse [[Fourier transform]].

==Gram–Charlier A series==
We examine a continuous random variable. Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt; be the characteristic function of its distribution whose density function is {{mvar|f}}, and &lt;math&gt;\kappa_r&lt;/math&gt; its [[cumulant]]s. We expand in terms of a known distribution with probability density function {{math|ψ}}, characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\hat{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;, and cumulants &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt;. The density {{math|ψ}} is generally chosen to be that of the [[normal distribution]], but other choices are possible as well. By the definition of the cumulants, we have (see Wallace, 1958)&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, D. L. (1958). Asymptotic approximations to distributions. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 635-654.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(t)= \exp\left[\sum_{r=1}^\infty\kappa_r\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{\psi}(t)=\exp\left[\sum_{r=1}^\infty\gamma_r\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\right],&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the following formal identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(t)=\exp\left[\sum_{r=1}^\infty(\kappa_r-\gamma_r)\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\right]\hat{\psi}(t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By the properties of the Fourier transform, &lt;math&gt;(it)^r \hat{\psi}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;(-1)^r[D^r\psi](-x)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|D}} is the [[differential operator]] with respect to {{mvar|x}}. Thus, after changing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the equation, we find for {{mvar|f}} the formal expansion

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \exp\left[\sum_{r=1}^\infty(\kappa_r - \gamma_r)\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\right]\psi(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|ψ}} is chosen as the normal density 

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left[-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]&lt;/math&gt; 

with mean and variance as given by {{mvar|f}}, that is, mean &lt;math&gt;\mu = \kappa_1&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \kappa_2&lt;/math&gt;, then the expansion becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \exp\left[\sum_{r=3}^\infty\kappa_r\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\right] \phi(x),&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt; \gamma_r=0&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|r}}  &gt; 2, as higher cumulants of the normal distribution are 0. By expanding the exponential and collecting terms according to the order of the derivatives, we arrive at the Gram–Charlier A series. Such an expansion can be written compactly in terms of [[Bell polynomials]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left[\sum_{r=3}^\infty\kappa_r\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\right] = \sum_{n=0}^\infty B_n(0,0,\kappa_3,\ldots,\kappa_n)\frac{(-D)^n}{n!}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the n-th derivative of the Gaussian function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is given in terms of [[Hermite polynomial]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\phi^{(n)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^n}{\sigma^n} He_n \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right) \phi(x),&lt;/math&gt;

this gives us the final expression of the Gram-Charlier A series as

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \phi(x) \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n! \sigma^n} B_n(0,0,\kappa_3,\ldots,\kappa_n)  He_n \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the series gives us the [[cumulative distribution function]] 

:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(u) du = \Phi(x) - \phi(x) \sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n! \sigma^{n-1}} B_n(0,0,\kappa_3,\ldots,\kappa_n) He_{n-1} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the CDF of the normal distribution. 

If we include only the first two correction terms to the normal distribution, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left[-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]\left[1+\frac{\kappa_3}{3!\sigma^3}He_3\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)+\frac{\kappa_4}{4!\sigma^4}He_4\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\right]\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;He_3(x)=x^3-3x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;He_4(x)=x^4 - 6x^2 + 3&lt;/math&gt;. 

Note that this expression is not guaranteed to be positive, and is therefore not a valid probability distribution. The Gram–Charlier A series diverges in many cases of interest—it converges only if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; falls off faster than &lt;math&gt;\exp(-(x^2)/4)&lt;/math&gt; at infinity (Cramér 1957). When it does not converge, the series is also not a true [[asymptotic expansion]], because it is not possible to estimate the error of the expansion. For this reason, the Edgeworth series (see next section) is generally preferred over the Gram–Charlier A series.

==The Edgeworth series==
Edgeworth developed a similar expansion as an improvement to the [[central limit theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P. (2013). The bootstrap and Edgeworth expansion. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of the Edgeworth series is that the error is controlled, so that it is a true [[asymptotic expansion]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\{Z_i\}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables with mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; be their standardized sums:

:&lt;math&gt;X_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{Z_i - \mu}{\sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of the variables &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the central limit theorem,
: &lt;math&gt;
    \lim_{n\to\infty} F_n(x) = \Phi(x) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^x \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}q^2}dq
  &lt;/math&gt;

for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, as long as the mean and variance are finite.

Now assume that, in addition to having mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, the i.i.d. random variables &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt; have higher cumulants &lt;math&gt; \kappa_r&lt;/math&gt;. From the additivity and homogeneity properties of cumulants, the cumulants of &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the cumulants of &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt; are for &lt;math&gt;r \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, 

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa_r^{F_n} = \frac{n \kappa_r}{\sigma^r n^{r/2}} = \frac{\lambda_r}{n^{r/2 - 1}} \quad \mathrm{where} \quad \lambda_r = \frac{\kappa_r}{\sigma^r}.
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we expand in terms of the standard normal distribution, that is, if we set

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}x^2)&lt;/math&gt;

then the cumulant differences in the formal expression of the characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{F_n}_1-\gamma_1 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{F_n}_2-\gamma_2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{F_n}_r-\gamma_r = \frac{\lambda_r}{n^{r/2-1}}; \qquad r\geq 3.&lt;/math&gt;

The Gram-Charlier A series for the density function of &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; is now

:&lt;math&gt; f_n(x) = \phi(x) \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{1}{r!} B_r \left(0,0,\frac{\lambda_3}{n^{1/2}},\ldots,\frac{\lambda_r}{n^{r/2-1}}\right) He_r(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The Edgeworth series is developed similarly to the Gram–Charlier A series, only that now terms are collected according to powers of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;-m/2&lt;/sup&gt; term can be obtained by collecting the monomials of the Bell polynomials corresponding to the integer partitions of ''m''. Thus, we have the characteristic function as

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{f}_n(t)=\left[1+\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{P_j(it)}{n^{j/2}}\right] \exp(-t^2/2)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polynomial]] of degree &lt;math&gt;3j&lt;/math&gt;. Again, after inverse Fourier transform, the density function &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; follows as

:&lt;math&gt; f_n(x) = \phi(x) + \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{P_j(-D)}{n^{j/2}} \phi(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, integrating the series, we obtain the distribution function 

:&lt;math&gt; F_n(x) = \Phi(x) + \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{j/2}} \frac{P_j(-D)}{D} \phi(x)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

We can explicitly write the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P_m(-D)&lt;/math&gt; as 

:&lt;math&gt; P_m(-D) = \sum \prod_i  \frac{1}{k_i!} \left(\frac{\lambda_{l_i}}{l_i!}\right)^{k_i} (-D)^s,&lt;/math&gt;

where the summation is over all the integer partitions of ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_i i k_i = m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_i = i+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s = \sum_i k_i l_i.&lt;/math&gt; 

For example, if ''m'' = 3, then there are three ways to partition this number: 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. As such we need to examine three cases:

* 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 · ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so we have ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3,  ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, and ''s'' = 9. 
* 1 + 2 = 1 · ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 · ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so we have ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1,  ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4, and ''s'' = 7. 
* 3 = 3 · ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, so we have ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1,  ''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5, and ''s'' = 5. 

Thus, the required polynomial is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_3(-D) &amp;= \frac{1}{3!} \left(\frac{\lambda_3}{3!}\right)^3 (-D)^9 + \frac{1}{1! 1!} \left(\frac{\lambda_3}{3!}\right) \left(\frac{\lambda_4}{4!}\right) (-D)^7 + \frac{1}{1!} \left(\frac{\lambda_5}{5!}\right) (-D)^5 \\
&amp;= \frac{\lambda_3^3}{1296} (-D)^9 + \frac{\lambda_3 \lambda_4}{144} (-D)^7 + \frac{\lambda_5}{120} (-D)^5.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first five terms of the expansion are&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Edgeworth Series|urlname=EdgeworthSeries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_n(x) &amp;= \phi(x) \\
&amp;\quad -\frac{1}{n^{\frac{1}{2}}}\left(\tfrac{1}{6}\lambda_3\,\phi^{(3)}(x) \right) \\
&amp;\quad +\frac{1}{n}\left(\tfrac{1}{24}\lambda_4\,\phi^{(4)}(x) + \tfrac{1}{72}\lambda_3^2\,\phi^{(6)}(x) \right) \\
&amp;\quad -\frac{1}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}\left(\tfrac{1}{120}\lambda_5\,\phi^{(5)}(x) + \tfrac{1}{144}\lambda_3\lambda_4\,\phi^{(7)}(x) + \tfrac{1}{1296}\lambda_3^3\,\phi^{(9)}(x)\right) \\
&amp;\quad + \frac{1}{n^2}\left(\tfrac{1}{720}\lambda_6\,\phi^{(6)}(x) + \left(\tfrac{1}{1152}\lambda_4^2 + \tfrac{1}{720}\lambda_3\lambda_5\right)\phi^{(8)}(x) + \tfrac{1}{1728}\lambda_3^2\lambda_4\,\phi^{(10)}(x) + \tfrac{1}{31104}\lambda_3^4\,\phi^{(12)}(x) \right)\\
&amp;\quad + O \left (n^{-\frac{5}{2}} \right ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|φ&lt;sup&gt;(''j'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the ''j''-th derivative of {{math|φ(·)}} at point ''x''. Remembering that the [[Normal distribution#Symmetries and derivatives|derivatives of the density of the normal distribution]] are related to the normal density by &lt;math&gt;\phi^{(n)}(x) = (-1)^n He_n(x)\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;He_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hermite polynomial]] of order ''n''), this explains the alternative representations in terms of the density function. Blinnikov and Moessner (1998) have given a simple algorithm to calculate higher-order terms of the expansion.

Note that in case of a lattice distributions (which have discrete values), the Edgeworth expansion must be adjusted to account for the discontinuous jumps between lattice points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolassa |first=John E. |first2=Peter |last2=McCullagh |title=Edgeworth series for lattice distributions |journal=[[Annals of Statistics]] |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=981–985 |jstor=2242145 |doi=10.1214/aos/1176347637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration: density of the sample mean of three &lt;math&gt; \chi^2 &lt;/math&gt;==

[[File:Edgeworth expansion of the density of the sample mean of three Chi2 variables.png|thumb|Density of the sample mean of three chi2 variables. The chart compares the true density, the normal approximation, and two edgeworth expansions]]

Take  &lt;math&gt; X_i \sim \chi^2(k=2) \qquad i=1, 2, 3 &lt;/math&gt; and the sample mean &lt;math&gt; \bar X = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{3} X_i &lt;/math&gt;.

We can use several distributions for &lt;math&gt; \bar X &lt;/math&gt;:
* The exact distribution, which follows a [[gamma distribution]]: &lt;math&gt; \bar X \sim \mathrm{Gamma}\left(\alpha=n\cdot k /2, \theta= 2/n \right)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gamma}\left(\alpha=3, \theta= 2/3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
* The asymptotic normal distribution: &lt;math&gt; \bar X  \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} N(k, 2\cdot k /n ) = N(2, 4/3 )&lt;/math&gt;
* Two Edgeworth expansion, of degree 2 and 3

==Disadvantages of the Edgeworth expansion==

Edgeworth expansions can suffer from a few issues:
* They are not guaranteed to be a proper [[probability distribution]] as:
** The integral of the density need not integrate to 1
** Probabilities can be negative
* They can be inaccurate, especially in the tails, due to mainly two reasons:
** They are obtained under a Taylor series around the mean
** They guarantee (asymptotically) an [[Approximation error|absolute error]], not a relative one. This is an issue when one wants to approximate very small quantities, for which the absolute error might be small, but the relative error important.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Grünwald–Letnikov derivative''' is a basic extension of the [[derivative]] in [[fractional calculus]] that allows one to take the derivative a non-integer number of times. It was introduced by [[Anton Karl Grünwald]] (1838–1920) from [[Prague]], in 1867, and by [[Aleksey Letnikov|Aleksey Vasilievich Letnikov]] (1837–1888) in [[Moscow]] in 1868.

==Constructing the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative==

The formula 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
for the derivative can be applied recursively to get higher-order derivatives.  For example, the second-order derivative would be:

:&lt;math&gt;f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h_1 \to 0} \frac{\lim_{h_2 \to 0} \frac{f(x+h_1+h_2)-f(x+h_1)}{h_2}-\lim_{h_2 \to 0} \frac{f(x+h_2)-f(x)}{h_2}}{h_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the ''h'' 's converge synchronously, this simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+2h)-2f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^2},&lt;/math&gt;

which can be justified rigorously by the [[mean value theorem]]. In general, we have (see [[binomial coefficient]]):

:&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sum_{0 \le m \le n}(-1)^m {n \choose m}f(x+(n-m)h)}{h^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Removing the restriction that ''n'' be a positive integer, it is reasonable to define:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h^q}\sum_{0 \le m &lt; \infty}(-1)^m {q \choose m}f(x+(q-m)h).&lt;/math&gt;

This defines the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative.

To simplify notation, we set:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^q_h f(x) = \sum_{0 \le m &lt; \infty}(-1)^m {q \choose m}f(x+(q-m)h).&lt;/math&gt;

So the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative may be succinctly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q f(x) =  \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\Delta^q_h f(x)}{h^q}.&lt;/math&gt;

===An alternative definition===

In the preceding section, the general first principles equation for integer order derivatives was derived. It can be shown that the equation may also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(-1)^n}{h^n}\sum_{0 \le m \le n}(-1)^m {n \choose m}f(x+mh).&lt;/math&gt;

or removing the restriction that ''n'' must be a positive integer:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(-1)^q}{h^q}\sum_{0 \le m &lt; \infty}(-1)^m {q \choose m}f(x+mh).&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is called the reverse Grünwald–Letnikov derivative. If the substitution ''h'' → −''h'' is made, the resulting equation is called the direct Grünwald–Letnikov derivative:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diogenes.bg/fcaa/volume7/fcaa74/74_Ortigueira_Coito.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h^q}\sum_{0 \le m &lt; \infty}(-1)^m {q \choose m}f(x-mh).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Helly's theorem''' is a basic result in [[discrete geometry]] on the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of [[convex set]]s. It was discovered by [[Eduard Helly]] in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Danzer|Grünbaum|Klee|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not published by him until 1923, by which time alternative proofs by {{harvtxt|Radon|1921}} and {{harvtxt|König|1922}} had already appeared. Helly's theorem gave rise to the notion of a [[Helly family]].

==Statement==
Let {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be a finite collection of convex subsets of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with {{math|''n'' &gt; ''d''}}. If the intersection of every {{math|''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} of these sets is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{j=1}^n X_j\ne\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

For infinite collections one has to assume compactness: 

Let {{math|{''X&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''} }} be a collection of [[compact set|compact]] convex subsets of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such that every subcollection of [[cardinality]] at most {{math|''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} has nonempty intersection. Then the whole collection has nonempty intersection.

==Proof==
We prove the finite version, using [[Radon's theorem]] as in the proof by {{harvtxt|Radon|1921}}. The infinite version then follows by the [[finite intersection property]] characterization of [[Compact space|compactness]]: a collection of closed subsets of a compact space has a non-empty intersection if and only if every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection (once you fix a single set, the intersection of all others with it are closed subsets of a fixed compact space).

The proof is by [[mathematical induction|induction]]:

&lt;ins&gt;Base case:&lt;/ins&gt; Let {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}. By our assumptions, for every {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n''}} there is a point {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} that is in the common intersection of all {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with the possible exception of {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Now we apply [[Radon's theorem]] to the set {{math|''A'' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''},}} which furnishes us with disjoint subsets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{mvar|A}} such that the [[convex hull]] of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} intersects the convex hull of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Suppose that {{mvar|p}} is a point in the intersection of these two convex hulls. We claim that 

:&lt;math&gt;p\in\bigcap_{j=1}^n X_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, consider any {{math|''j'' ∈ {1, ..., ''n''}.}} We shall prove that {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.}} Note that the only element of {{mvar|A}} that may not be in {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∉ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and therefore {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊃ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is convex, it then also contains the convex hull of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and therefore also {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Likewise, if {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∉ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊃ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and by the same reasoning {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is in every {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, it must also be in the intersection.

Above, we have assumed that the points {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all distinct. If this is not the case, say {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for some {{math|''i'' ≠ ''k''}}, then {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is in every one of the sets {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and again we conclude that the intersection is nonempty. This completes the proof in the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}.

&lt;ins&gt;Inductive Step:&lt;/ins&gt; Suppose {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}} and that the statement is true for {{math|''n''−1}}. The argument above shows that any subcollection of {{math|''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}} sets will have nonempty intersection. We may then consider the collection where we replace the two sets {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with the single set {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In this new collection, every subcollection of {{math|''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} sets will have nonempty intersection. The inductive hypothesis therefore applies, and shows that this new collection has nonempty intersection. This implies the same for the original collection, and completes the proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2083">In [[mathematical logic]], '''indiscernibles''' are objects which cannot be distinguished by any [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] defined by a [[well-formed formula|formula]]. Usually only [[first-order logic|first-order]] formulas are considered. 
==Examples==
If ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] and {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} is a '''[[Set (mathematics)|set]] of indiscernibles''', then, for example, for each binary formula &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;, we must have

:&lt;math&gt; [ \beta (a, b) \land \beta (b, a) \land \beta (a, c) \land \beta (c, a) \land \beta (b, c) \land \beta (c, b) ] \lor  [ \lnot \beta (a, b) \land \lnot \beta (b, a) \land \lnot \beta(a, c) \land \lnot \beta (c, a) \land \lnot \beta (b, c) \land \lnot \beta (c, b) ] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Historically, the [[identity of indiscernibles]] was one of the [[laws of thought]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

==Generalizations==
In some contexts one considers the more general notion of '''order-indiscernibles''', and the term '''sequence of indiscernibles''' often refers implicitly to this weaker notion. In our example of binary formulas, to say that the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of distinct elements is a sequence of indiscernibles implies

:&lt;math&gt; ( [ \varphi (a, b) \land \varphi (a, c) \land \varphi (b, c) ] \lor  [ \lnot \varphi (a, b) \land \lnot \varphi (a, c) \land \lnot \varphi (b, c) ] ) \land ( [ \varphi (b, a) \land \varphi (c, a) \land \varphi (c, b) ] \lor  [ \lnot \varphi (b, a) \land \lnot \varphi (c, a) \land \lnot \varphi (c, b) ] ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
Order-indiscernibles feature prominently in the theory of [[Ramsey cardinal]]s, [[Erdős cardinal]]s, and [[Zero sharp]].

In [[geometry]], an '''inscribed angle''' is the [[angle]] formed in the interior of a [[circle]] when two [[secant line]]s (or, in a [[degenerate case]], when one [[secant line]] and one [[tangent line]] of that circle) intersect on the circle. It can also be defined as the angle subtended at a point on the circle by two given points on the circle.

Equivalently, an inscribed angle is defined by two [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] of the circle sharing an endpoint.

The '''inscribed angle theorem''' relates the [[Angle#Measuring angles|measure]] of an inscribed angle to that of the [[central angle]] subtending the same [[circular arc|arc]].

==Theorem==

===Statement===

[[File:ArcCapable.gif|thumb|For fixed points ''A'' and ''B'', the set of points ''M'' in the plane for which the angle ''AMB'' is equal to&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;'' is an arc of a circle. The measure of ∠ ''AOB'', where ''O'' is the center of the circle, is&amp;nbsp;2''&amp;alpha;''.]]

The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle ''θ'' inscribed in a circle is half of the central angle 2''θ'' that [[Subtended arc|subtend]]s the same [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] on the circle.  Therefore, the angle does not change as its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] is moved to different positions on the circle.

===Proof===

====Inscribed angles where one chord is a diameter====
[[File:InscribedAngle 1ChordDiam.svg|thumb|Case: One chord is a diameter]]
Let ''O'' be the center of a circle, as in the diagram at right.  Choose two points on the circle, and call them ''V'' and ''A''.  Draw line ''VO'' and extended past ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''B'' which is [[diametrically opposite]] the point ''V''. Draw an angle whose [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] is point ''V'' and whose sides pass through points ''A'' and ''B''.

Draw line ''OA''.  Angle ''BOA'' is a [[central angle]]; call it ''θ''.  Lines ''OV'' and ''OA'' are both [[radius|radii]] of the circle, so they have equal lengths.  Therefore, triangle ''VOA'' is [[isosceles]], so angle ''BVA'' (the inscribed angle) and angle ''VAO'' are equal; let each of them be denoted as ''ψ''.

Angles ''BOA'' and ''AOV'' are [[supplementary angle|supplementary]].  They add up to 180°, since line ''VB'' passing through ''O'' is a straight line.  Therefore, angle ''AOV'' measures 180°&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''θ''.

It is known that the three angles of a [[triangle]] add up to 180°, and the three angles of triangle ''VOA'' are:

: 180° &amp;minus; ''θ''
: ''ψ''
: ''ψ''.

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \psi + 180^\circ - \theta = 180^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

Subtract 180° from both sides,

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \psi = \theta, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the central angle subtending arc ''AB'' and ''ψ'' is the inscribed angle subtending arc ''AB''.

====Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their interior====
[[File:InscribedAngle CenterCircle.svg|thumb|Case: Center interior to angle]]
Given a circle whose center is point ''O'', choose three points ''V'', ''C'', and ''D'' on the circle.  Draw lines ''VC'' and ''VD'': angle ''DVC'' is an inscribed angle.  Now draw line ''VO'' and extend it past point ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''E''.  Angle ''DVC'' subtends arc ''DC'' on the circle.

Suppose this arc includes point ''E'' within it.  Point ''E'' is diametrically opposite to point ''V''.  Angles ''DVE'' and ''EVC'' are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; \angle DVC = \angle DVE + \angle EVC. &lt;/math&gt;

then let

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_0 = \angle DVC, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_1 = \angle DVE, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_2 = \angle EVC, &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_0 = \psi_1 + \psi_2. \qquad \qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

Draw lines ''OC'' and ''OD''.  Angle ''DOC'' is a central angle, but so are angles ''DOE'' and ''EOC'', and
:&lt;math&gt; \angle DOC = \angle DOE + \angle EOC. &lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = \angle DOC, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_1 = \angle DOE, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_2 = \angle EOC, &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = \theta_1 + \theta_2. \qquad \qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

From Part One we know that &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 = 2 \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; \theta_2 = 2 \psi_2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Combining these results with equation (2) yields

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = 2 \psi_1 + 2 \psi_2 &lt;/math&gt;

therefore, by equation (1),

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = 2 \psi_0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their exterior====
[[Image:InscribedAngle CenterCircleExtV2.svg|thumb|Case: Center exterior to angle]]
The previous case can be extended to cover the case where the measure of the inscribed angle is the ''difference'' between two inscribed angles as discussed in the first part of this proof.

Given a circle whose center is point ''O'', choose three points ''V'', ''C'', and ''D'' on the circle.  Draw lines ''VC'' and ''VD'': angle ''DVC'' is an inscribed angle.  Now draw line ''VO'' and extend it past point ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''E''.  Angle ''DVC'' subtends arc ''DC'' on the circle.

Suppose this arc does not include point ''E'' within it.  Point ''E'' is diametrically opposite to point ''V''.  Angles ''DVE'' and ''EVC'' are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; \angle DVC = \angle EVC - \angle DVE &lt;/math&gt;.
then let
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_0 = \angle DVC, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_1 = \angle DVE, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_2 = \angle EVC, &lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_0 = \psi_2 - \psi_1. \qquad \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

Draw lines ''OC'' and ''OD''.  Angle ''DOC'' is a central angle, but so are angles ''DOE'' and ''EOC'', and
:&lt;math&gt; \angle DOC = \angle EOC - \angle DOE. &lt;/math&gt;
Let
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = \angle DOC, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_1 = \angle DOE, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_2 = \angle EOC, &lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = \theta_2 - \theta_1. \qquad \qquad (4) &lt;/math&gt;

From Part One we know that &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 = 2 \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; \theta_2 = 2 \psi_2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Combining these results with equation (4) yields
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = 2 \psi_2 - 2 \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt;
therefore, by equation (3),
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_0 = 2 \psi_0. &lt;/math&gt;

===Corollary===
By a similar argument, the angle between a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] and the [[tangent]] line at one of its intersection points equals half of the central angle subtended by the chord.  See also [[Tangent lines to circles]].

==Applications==

The inscribed angle [[theorem]] is used in many proofs of elementary [[Euclidean geometry of the plane]].  A special case of the theorem is [[Thales' theorem]], which states that the angle subtended by a [[diameter]] is always 90°, i.e., a right angle.  As a consequence of the theorem, opposite angles of [[cyclic quadrilateral]]s sum to 180°; conversely, any quadrilateral for which this is true can be inscribed in a circle.  As another example, the inscribed angle theorem is the basis for several theorems related to the [[power of a point]] with respect to a circle. Further, it allows one to prove that when two chords intersect in a circle, the products of the lengths of their pieces are equal.

== Inscribed angle theorems for ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas ==
Inscribed angle theorems exist for  ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas, too. The essential differences are the measurements of an angle. (An angle is considered as a pair of intersecting lines.)

In [[mathematics]], the '''intersection''' ''A'' ∩ ''B'' of two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] ''A'' and ''B'' is the set that contains all elements of ''A'' that also belong to ''B'' (or equivalently, all elements of ''B'' that also belong to ''A''), but no other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html |title=Stats: Probability Rules |publisher=People.richland.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the [[table of mathematical symbols]].

==Basic definition==
[[File:Venn 0000 0001.svg|thumb|Intersection of three sets:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;~A \cap B \cap C&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Venn diagram gr la ru.svg|thumb|Intersections of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[English alphabet|English]] and [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] alphabet, considering only the shapes of the letters and ignoring their pronunciation]]
[[File:PolygonsSetIntersection.svg|thumb|Example of an intersection with sets]]
The intersection of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by {{math|''A'' ∩ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.
In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''x'' is an element of the intersection ''A'' ∩ ''B'' [[if and only if]] ''x'' is both an element of ''A'' and an element of ''B''.

For example:
* The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.
* The number 9 is {{em|not}} in the intersection of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of [[odd numbers]] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}, because 9 is not prime.

Intersection is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', one has ''A'' ∩ (''B'' ∩ ''C'')&amp;nbsp;= (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ∩ ''C''.  Intersection is also [[Commutative property|commutative]]; for any ''A'' and ''B'', one has ''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;nbsp;= ''B'' ∩ ''A.''  It thus makes sense to talk about intersections of multiple sets.  The intersection of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', for example, is unambiguously written ''A'' ∩ ''B'' ∩ ''C'' ∩ ''D''.

Inside a universe ''U'' one may define the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; of ''A'' to be the set of all elements of ''U'' not in ''A''. Now the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' may be written as the complement of the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of their complements, derived easily from [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;br&gt;
''A'' ∩ ''B'' = (''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;

===Intersecting and disjoint sets===
We say that ''A intersects (meets) B at an element x'' if ''x'' belongs to ''A'' and ''B''. We say that ''A intersects (meets) B'' if ''A'' intersects B at some element. ''A'' intersects ''B'' if their intersection is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

We say that ''A and B are disjoint'' if ''A'' does not intersect ''B''. In plain language, they have no elements in common. ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint if their intersection is [[empty set|empty]], denoted &lt;math&gt;A\cap B=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint, while the set of even numbers intersects the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3 at the multiples of 6.

==Arbitrary intersections==

The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary ''nonempty'' collection of sets.
If ''M'' is a [[empty set|nonempty]] set whose elements are themselves sets, then ''x'' is an element of the ''intersection'' of ''M'' if and only if [[universal quantification|for every]] element ''A'' of ''M'', ''x'' is an element of ''A''.
In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( x \in \bigcap_{A \in M} A \right) \Leftrightarrow \left( \forall A \in M, \ x \in A \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The notation for this last concept can vary considerably. [[Set theory|Set theorists]] will sometimes write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;''M''", while others will instead write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''∈''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''".
The latter notation can be generalized to "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;", which refers to the intersection of the collection {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''}.
Here ''I'' is a nonempty set, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a set for every ''i'' in ''I''.

In the case that the [[index set]] ''I'' is the set of [[natural number]]s, notation analogous to that of an [[infinite product]] may be seen:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i.&lt;/math&gt;

When formatting is difficult, this can also be written "''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ...".  This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example see the article on [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]].

==Nullary intersection==

[[File:Multigrade operator AND.svg|thumb|[[Logical conjunction|Conjunctions]] of the arguments in parentheses&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conjunction of no argument is the [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (compare: [[empty product]]); accordingly the intersection of no set is the [[universe (set theory)|universe]].]]
Note that in the previous section we excluded the case where ''M'' was the [[empty set]] (∅). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection ''M'' is defined as the set (see [[set-builder notation]])
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \{x : \forall A \in M, x \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'' is empty there are no sets ''A'' in ''M'', so the question becomes "which ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be ''every possible x''. When ''M'' is empty the condition given above is an example of a [[vacuous truth]]. So the intersection of the empty family should be the [[universal set]] (the [[identity element]] for the operation of intersection) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, according to standard ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]) set theory, the universal set does not exist. A fix for this problem can be found if we note that the intersection over a set of sets is always a subset of the union over that set of sets. This can symbolically be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A \subseteq \bigcup_{A \in M} A.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we can modify the definition slightly to
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \left\{x \in \bigcup_{A \in M} A : \forall A \in M, x \in A\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if ''M'' is empty there is no problem. The intersection is the empty set, because the union over the empty set is the empty set. In fact, this is the operation that we would have defined in the first place if we were defining the set in ZFC, as except for the operations defined by the axioms (the [[power set]] of a set, for instance), every set must be defined as the subset of some other set or by [[Axiom schema of replacement | replacement]].

In [[orbital mechanics]], a '''Lissajous orbit''' ({{IPA-fr|li.sa.ʒu|pron}}), named after [[Jules Antoine Lissajous]], is a quasi-periodic orbital trajectory that an object can follow around a [[Lagrangian point]] of a three-body system without requiring any propulsion. [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov orbits]] around a Lagrangian point are curved paths that lie entirely in the plane of the two primary bodies. In contrast, Lissajous orbits include components in this plane and perpendicular to it, and follow a [[Lissajous curve]]. [[Halo orbit]]s also include components perpendicular to the plane, but they are periodic, while Lissajous orbits are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

In practice, any orbits around Lagrangian points {{L1}}, {{L2}}, or {{L3}} are dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ESA Science &amp; Technology: Orbit/Navigation |url= http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34699 |date= 14 June 2009 |publisher= [[European Space Agency]] |accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, spacecraft in these Lagrangian point orbits must use their propulsion systems to perform [[orbital station-keeping]]. Although they are not perfectly stable, a modest effort of station keeping keeps a spacecraft in a desired Lissajous orbit for a long time.

In the absence of other influences, orbits about Lagrangian points {{L4}} and {{L5}} are dynamically stable so long as the ratio of the masses of the two main objects is greater than about 25 {{OEIS|A230242}}, meaning the natural dynamics keep the spacecraft (or natural celestial body) in the vicinity of the Lagrangian point, without energy input such as use of a propulsion system, even when slightly perturbed from equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vallado |first= David A. |title= Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications |publisher= Springer New York |date= 2007 |edition= 3rd |isbn= 978-1-881883-14-2 |id= (paperback),  {{ISBN|978-0-387-71831-6}} (hardback)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These orbits can however be destabilized by other nearby massive objects. It has been found for example that the {{L4}} and {{L5}} points in the Earth–Moon system would be stable for billions of years, even with perturbations from the sun, but because of smaller perturbations by the planets, orbits around these points can last only a few million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.12.024 | bibcode=2008Icar..195...16L | volume=195 | title=Solar and planetary destabilization of the Earth–Moon triangular Lagrangian points | year=2008 | journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] | pages=16–27 | last1 = Lissauer | first1 = Jack J. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = John E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 2]] left lunar orbit on June 8, 2011 and was placed in a Lissajous orbit at Earth-Sun {{L2}} until mid-2012 prior to leaving Earth orbit entirely to fly by the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://scitech.people.com.cn/GB/14041406.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;!--  The [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] (DSCOVR) lies in a Lissajous orbit at Sun-Earth {{L1}}.&lt;repetition of fact just a few lines above.&gt;--&gt;

==Fictional appearances==
In the 2005 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Sunstorm (novel)|Sunstorm]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], a huge shield is constructed in space to protect the Earth from a deadly solar storm.  The shield is described to have been in a Lissajous orbit at {{L1}}.  In the story a group of wealthy and powerful people shelter opposite the shield at {{L2}} so as to be protected from the solar storm by the shield, the Earth and the Moon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69449">The following list comprehensively shows '''[[Fields Medal]] winners by university affiliations''' since 1936 (as of 2018, 60 winners in total).&lt;ref name=":71" /&gt; This list considers Fields medalists as equal individuals, regardless of the total number of winners who received the medal each time at the quadrennial [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM).&lt;ref name=":71"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal|title=Fields Medal {{!}} International Mathematical Union (IMU)|website=www.mathunion.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/icm/past-icms|title=Past ICMs {{!}} International Mathematical Union (IMU)|website=www.mathunion.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include affiliations with research institutes such as [[Institute for Advanced Study|IAS]] and [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|MSRI]] in the [[United States]], as well as [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|IHES]] and [[CNRS]] in [[France]]. In this list, universities are presented in descending order starting from those affiliated with most Fields medal winners.

The university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) ''Alumni (graduate &amp; attendee)'', 2) ''Long-term academic Staff'', and 3) ''Short-term academic staff''. Graduates are defined as those who hold [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], [[Doctorate]] or equivalent degrees from a university, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in degree programs at a university but did not complete the programs; thus, honorary degrees, summer attendees, exchange students and auditing students are excluded. The category of "Long-term academic staff" consists of [[Academic tenure|tenure]]/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of "Short-term academic staff" consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers, visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At any university, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a medalist.

Further explanations on "visitors" under "Short-term academic staff" are now presented. 1) All informal/personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award/honor-based visiting positions, this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the medalists were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the medalists specifically classified the visiting positions as "appointment" or similar in reliable sources such as  their [[curriculum vitae]]. To be specific, some award/honor-based visiting positions such as the "[[Shiing-Shen Chern]] Visiting Professorship" in [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] are awards/honors/recognition without employment-level duty;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/chern|title=The Chern Lectures {{!}} Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley|website=math.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; attending meetings and giving public lectures, talks or non-curricular seminars are not employment-level duties. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Fields-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years; the same rule applies to extension schools of universities.

The number following a person's name is the year he/she received the Fields Medal; in particular, a number with asterisk (*) means the person received the award while he/she was working at the institution (including [[emeritus]] staff) containing that asterisk. A name underlined implies that this person has been listed for a same institution previously (i.e., multiple affiliations). If a person had multiple positions under one category, only the position with highest rank is considered.

This list, together with '''[[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation]]''' and '''[[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation]]''', presents the university affiliations of people who have won highest honors in fundamental academic disciplines.

== Summary of results ==

=== Top 15 universities worldwide since 1936 ===
According to Wikipedia policies on [[wikipedia:No original research|no original research]] and [[wikipedia:Neutral point of view|objectivity/neutrality]], it is impossible in Wikipedia to assign various weights to different types of affiliations. Hence, all types of affiliations count equally in the following table and throughout the whole page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9815">The following is a '''list of Laplace transforms''' for many common functions of a single variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=J. J. |last1=Distefano |first2=A. R. |last2=Stubberud |first3=I. J. |last3=Williams |page=78 |title=Feedback systems and control |edition=2nd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |series=Schaum's outlines |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-07-017052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laplace transform]] is an [[integral transform]] that takes a function of a positive real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a complex variable {{mvar|s}} (frequency).

==Properties==
{{Main|Laplace transform#Properties and theorems}}

The Laplace transform of a function &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained using the [[Laplace transform#Formal definition|formal definition]] of the Laplace transform. However, some properties of the Laplace transform can be used to obtain the Laplace transform of some functions more easily.

===Linearity===

Because the Laplace transform is a linear operator, the Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of Laplace transforms of each term.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f(t) + g(t)\}  = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + \mathcal{L}\{ g(t)\}  &lt;/math&gt;

Also, this implies that the Laplace transform of a multiple of a function is that multiple times the Laplace transformation of that function.

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{a f(t)\}  = a \mathcal{L}\{ f(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Time shifting===

The Laplace transform of &lt;math&gt; f(t - a) u(t - a) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; e^{-as} F(s) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Frequency shifting===

&lt;math&gt; F(s - a) &lt;/math&gt; is the Laplace transform of &lt;math&gt; e^{at} f(t)  &lt;/math&gt;.

==Explanatory notes==

The unilateral Laplace transform takes as input a function whose time domain is the [[non-negative]] reals, which is why all of the time domain functions in the table below are multiples of the [[Heaviside step function]], {{math|''u''(''t'')}}.

The entries of the table that involve a time delay {{math|''τ''}} are required to be [[causal system|causal]] (meaning that {{math|''τ'' &gt; 0}}).  A causal system is a system where the [[impulse response]] {{math|''h''(''t'')}} is zero for all time {{mvar|t}} prior to {{math|1=''t'' = 0}}. In general, the region of convergence for causal systems is not the same as that of [[anticausal system]]s.

The following functions and variables are used in the table below:

* {{math|''δ''}}  represents the [[Dirac delta function]].
* {{math|''u''(''t'')}} represents the [[Heaviside step function]].
* {{math|Γ(''z'')}} represents the [[Gamma function]].
* {{math|''γ''}} is the [[Euler&amp;ndash;Mascheroni constant]].
* {{math|''t''}} is a [[real number]]. It typically represents ''time'', although it can represent ''any'' independent dimension.
* {{math|''s''}} is the [[complex number|complex]] frequency domain parameter, and  {{math|Re(''s'')}} is its [[real part]].
* {{math|''n''}} is an [[integer]].
* {{math|''α'', ''τ,'' and ''ω''}} are real numbers.
* {{math|''q''}} is a complex number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31342">This page lists notable examples of incomplete published [[mathematical proof]]s. Most of these  were accepted as correct for several years but later discovered to contain gaps. There are both examples where a complete proof was later found and where the alleged result turned out to be false.

==Examples==

This section lists examples of proofs that were published and accepted as complete before a gap or error was found in them. It does not include any of the many incomplete attempted solutions by amateurs of famous problems such as Fermat's last theorem or the squaring of the circle. It also does not include unpublished preprints that were withdrawn because an error was found before publication.

The examples are arranged roughly in order of the publication date of the incomplete proof. Several of the examples on the list were taken from answers to questions on the [[MathOverflow]] site, listed in the external links below. The examples use the following symbols:
*{{tick}} Result is correct and was later rigorously proved.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} Result is wrong as stated, but a modified version was later rigorously proven.
*{{hmmm}} Status of the result is unclear
*{{cross}}{{hmmm}} Result is wrong as stated, but a modified version was suggested whose status is unclear.
*{{cross}} Result is wrong
&lt;br&gt;
*{{tick}} [[Euclid's Elements]]. Euclid's proofs are essentially correct, but strictly speaking sometimes contain gaps because he tacitly uses some unstated assumptions, such as the existence of [[Line–line intersection|intersection points]]. In 1899 [[David Hilbert]] gave a complete set of ([[second-order logic|second order]]) axioms for Euclidean geometry, called [[Hilbert's axioms]], and between 1926 and 1959 Tarski gave some complete sets of [[First-order logic|first order axioms]], called [[Tarski's axioms]].
*{{tick}} [[Isoperimetric inequality]]. For three dimensions it states that the shape enclosing the minimum single volume for its surface area is the sphere. It was formulated by [[Archimedes]] but not proved rigorously until the 19th century, by [[Hermann Schwarz]].
*{{tick}} [[Infinitesimals]]. In the 18th century there was widespread use of infinitesimals in calculus, though these were not really well defined. Calculus was put on firm foundations in the 19th century, and Robinson put infinitesimals in a rigorous basis with the introduction of [[nonstandard analysis]] in the 20th century.
*{{cross}} In 1759 Euler claimed that there were no closed [[knight's tour|knight tour]]s on a chess board with 3 rows, but in 1917 Ernest Bergholt found  tours on 3 by 10 and 3 by 12 boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zubkov | first1 = A. M. | year = 2011 | title = Euler and combinatorial calculus | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 162–168 | doi=10.1134/s0081543811070030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{cross}} Euler's conjecture on [[Graeco-Latin square]]s. In the 1780s Euler conjectured that no such squares exist for any oddly even number n ≡ 2 (mod 4). In 1959, [[Raj Chandra Bose|R. C. Bose]] and [[Sharadchandra Shankar Shrikhande|S. S. Shrikhande]] constructed counterexamples of order 22. Then [[E. T. Parker]] found a counterexample of order 10 using a one-hour computer search. Finally Parker, Bose, and Shrikhande showed this conjecture to be false for all n ≥ 10.
*{{cross}} In 1798 [[A. M. Legendre]] claimed that 6 is not the sum of 2 rational cubes,&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Adrien-Marie. Essai sur la théorie des nombres. 1798.&lt;/ref&gt; which as Lamé pointed out in 1865 is false as 6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(37/21)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(17/21)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
*{{cross}} In 1803, [[Gian Francesco Malfatti]] claimed to prove that a certain arrangement of three circles would cover the maximum possible area inside a right triangle.  However, to do so he made certain unwarranted assumptions about the configuration of the circles.  It was shown in 1930 that circles in a different configuration could cover a greater area, and in 1967 that Malfatti's configuration was ''never'' optimal.  See [[Malfatti circles]].
*{{cross}} In 1806 [[André-Marie Ampère]] claimed to prove that a [[continuous function]] is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at most points (though it is not entirely clear what he was claiming as he did not give a precise definition of a function).  However, in 1872 [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] gave an example of a continuous function that was not differentiable anywhere: The [[Weierstrass function]].
*{{tick}} [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]]. In 1808 Legendre published an attempt at a proof of Dirichlet's theorem, but as Dupre pointed out in 1859 one of the lemmas used by Legendre is false. Dirichlet gave a complete proof in 1837.
*{{hmmm}}{{tick}} [[Uniform convergence]]. In his ''Cours d'analyse'' of 1821, [[Augustin Cauchy|Cauchy]] "proved" that if a sum of [[continuous function]]s [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]], then its limit is also continuous.  However, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] observed three years later that this is not the case.  For the conclusion to hold, "pointwise convergence" must be replaced with "[[uniform convergence]]". It is not entirely clear that Cauchy's original result was wrong, because his definition of pointwise converegence was a little vague and may have been stronger than the one currently in use, and there are ways to interpret his result so that it is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cambridge History of Science | last = Porter | first = Roy | page = 476 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-521-57199-5|authorlink=Roy Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many counterexamples using the standard definition of pointwise convergence.   For example, a [[Fourier series]] of [[sine]] and [[cosine]] functions, all continuous, may converge pointwise to a discontinuous function such as a [[step function]].
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Intersection theory]]. In 1848 Steiner claimed that [[Steiner's conic problem|the number of conics tangent to 5 given conics]] is 7776&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, but later realized this was wrong. The correct number 3264 was found by Berner in 1865 and by [[Ernest de Jonquieres]] around 1859 and by Chasles in 1864 using his theory of characteristics. However these results, like many others in classical intersection theory, do not seem to have been given complete proofs until the work of Fulton and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Macpherson]] in about 1978.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Dirichlet's principle]]. This was used by Riemann in 1851, but Weierstrass found a counterexample to one version of this principle in 1870, and Hilbert stated and proved a correct version in 1900.
*{{tick}} The proofs of the [[Kronecker–Weber theorem]] by Kronecker (1853) and Weber (1886) both had gaps. The first complete proof was given by Hilbert in 1896.
*{{cross}} {{harvs|txt|last=Cayley|year=1878}} incorrectly claimed that there are three different groups of order 6. This mistake is strange because in an earlier 1854 paper he correctly stated that there are just two such groups.
*{{tick}} In 1879, [[Alfred Kempe]] published a purported proof of the [[four color theorem]], whose validity as a proof was accepted for eleven years before it was refuted by [[Percy Heawood]]. [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] gave another incorrect proof in 1880 which was shown to be incorrect by Julius Petersen in 1891. Kempe's proof did, however, suffice to show the weaker [[five color theorem]]. The four-color theorem was eventually proved by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas L. Saaty]] and [[Paul Chester Kainen|Paul C. Kainen]]|title=The Four-Color Problem: Assaults and Conquest|isbn=978-0-486-65092-0|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{cross}} [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s [[foundations of mathematics]] in his 1879 book [[Begriffsschrift]] turned out to be inconsistent because of [[Russell's paradox]], found in 1901.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} In 1885, [[Evgraf Fedorov]] classified the [[convex polyhedra]] with congruent rhombic faces, but missed a case. [[Stanko Bilinski]] in 1960 rediscovered the [[Bilinski dodecahedron]] (forgotten after its previous 1752 publication) and proved that, with the addition of this shape, the classification was complete.&lt;ref name="grun"&gt;{{citation

* {{tick}} [[Schröder–Bernstein theorem]]. In 1896 Schröder published a proof sketch&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Ernst Schröder | editor=Kaiserliche Leopoldino-Carolinische Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher | title=Ueber zwei Definitionen der Endlichkeit und G.

*{{tick}} [[Jordan curve theorem]]. There has been some controversy about whether Jordan's original proof of this in 1887 contains gaps. [[Oswald Veblen]] in 1905 claimed that Jordan's proof is incomplete, but in 2007 Hales  said that the gaps are minor and that Jordan's proof is essentially complete.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Wronskian]]s. In 1887 Mansion claimed in his textbook that if a Wronskian of some functions vanishes everywhere then the functions are linearly dependent. In 1889 Peano pointed out the counterexample ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''|''x''|. The result is correct if the functions are analytic.
*{{cross}} {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Theodor Vahlen|last=Vahlen|year=1891}} published a purported example of an [[algebraic curve]] in 3-dimensional projective space that could not be defined as the zeros of 3 polynomials, but in 1941 Perron found 3 equations defining Vahlen's curve. In 1961 Kneser showed that any algebraic curve in projective 3-space can be given as the zeros of 3 polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/35476&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{cross}} In 1898 Miller published a paper incorrectly claiming to prove that the [[Mathieu group]] M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; does not exist, though in 1900 he pointed out that his proof was wrong.
*{{cross}} Little claimed in 1900 that the writhe of a reduced knot diagram is an invariant. However, in 1974 Perko discovered a counterexample called the [[Perko pair]], a pair of knots listed as distinct in tables for many years that are in fact the same.
*{{tick}} In 1905 [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] tried to prove the (correct) result that a function implicitly defined by a [[Baire function]] is Baire, but his proof incorrectly assumed that the [[projection (measure theory)|projection]] of a [[Borel set]] is Borel. [[Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin|Suslin]] pointed out the error and was inspired by it to define [[analytic set]]s as continuous [[Image (mathematics)|images]] of Borel sets.
*{{hmmm}} [[Carmichael's totient function conjecture]] was stated as a theorem by [[Robert Daniel Carmichael]] in 1907, but in 1922 he pointed out that his proof was incomplete. As of 2016 the problem is still open.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Hilbert's twenty-first problem]]. In 1908 Plemelj claimed to have shown the existence a Fuchsian [[differential equation]]s with any given [[monodromy]] group, but in 1989 Bolibruch discovered a counterexample.
*{{tick}} [[Dehn's lemma]]. Dehn published an attempted proof in 1910, but Kneser found a gap in 1929. It was finally proved in 1956 by [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]].
*{{hmmm}} [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. Most gaps in proofs are caused either by a subtle technical oversight, or before the 20th century by a lack of precise definitions. A major exception to this is the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the first half of the 20th century, where lower standards of rigor gradually became acceptable. The result was that there are many papers in this area where the proofs are incomplete, or the theorems are not stated precisely. This list  contains a few representative examples, where the result was not just incompletely proved but also hopelessly wrong.
*{{tick}} [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]] about the finiteness of the number of limit cycles of a plane polynomial vector field. [[Henri Dulac]] published a partial solution to this problem in 1923, but in about 1980 Écalle and Ilyashenko independently found a serious gap, and fixed it in about 1991.&lt;ref name=ilu&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yulij  Ilyashenko|title=Centennial History of Hilbert's 16th problem|journal=Bulletin of the AMS|year=2002|volume=39|issue=3|pages=301–354|pmid=|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2002-39-03/S0273-0979-02-00946-1/S0273-0979-02-00946-1.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-02-00946-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{cross}} In 1925 Ackermann published a proof that a weak system can prove the consistency of a version of analysis, but von Neumann found an explicit mistake in it a few years later. Godel's incompleteness theorem showed that it is not possible to prove the consistency of analysis using weaker systems.
*{{tick}} In 1929 [[Lazar Lyusternik]] and [[Lev Schnirelmann]] published a proof of the [[theorem of the three geodesics]], which was later found to be flawed. The proof was completed by Werner Ballmann about 50 years later.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} Groups of order 64. In 1930 Miller published a paper claiming that there are 294 groups of order 64. Hall and Senior showed in 1964 that the correct number is 267.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s original published attempt in 1932 to define a formal system was inconsistent, as was his correction in 1933. The consistent part of his system later became the [[lambda calculus]].
*{{cross}} [[Kurt Gödel]] proved in 1933 that the truth of a certain class of sentences of [[first-order arithmetic]], known in the literature as &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;∃&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;∀&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;∃&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''all'',&amp;nbsp;(0)&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, was [[decidability (logic)|decidable]].  That is, there was a method for deciding correctly whether any statement of that form was true.  In the final sentence of that paper, he asserted that the same proof would work for the decidability of the larger class  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;∃&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;∀&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;∃&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''all'',&amp;nbsp;(0)&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;=&lt;/sub&gt;, which also includes formulas that contain an equality predicate.  However, in the mid-1960s, [[Stål Aanderaa]] showed that Gödel's proof would ''not'' go through for the larger class, and in 1982 [[Warren Goldfarb]] showed that validity of formulas from the larger class was in fact undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Classical Decision Problem | last1 = Boerger | first1 = Egon |last2=Grädel |first2= Erich |last3= Gurevich |first3=Yuri | page = 188 | publisher = Springer | year =  1997| isbn = 3-540-42324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Feferman |editor-first=Solomon |editor-link=Solomon Feferman|title = Kurt Gödel: Collected Works | volume = 1 | last = Goldfarb | first = Warren | authorlink = Warren Goldfarb | pages = 229–231 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year =  1986 | isbn = 0-19-503964-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Grunwald–Wang theorem]]. [[Wilhelm Grunwald]] published an incorrect proof in 1933 of an incorrect theorem, and Whaples later published another incorrect proof. [[Shianghao Wang]] found a counterexample in 1948 and published a corrected version of the theorem in 1950.
*{{cross}} In 1934 Severi claimed that the [[Chow group|space of rational equivalence classes of cycles]] on an [[algebraic surface]] is finite-dimensional, but {{harvtxt|Mumford|1968}} showed that this is false for surfaces of positive geometric genus.
*{{tick}} [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]]. Robinson published an incomplete proof in 1938, though the gaps were not noticed for many years. The first complete proofs were given by [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] in 1977  and Thomas in 1974.
*{{hmmm}} [[Jacobian conjecture]]. Keller asked this as a question in 1939, and in the next few years there were several published incomplete proofs, including 3 by B. Segre,   but  Vitushkin found gaps in many of them. The Jacobian conjecture is (as of 2016) an open problem, and more incomplete proofs are regularly announced. {{harvs|txt | last1=Bass | first1=Hyman | last2=Connell | first2=Edwin H. | last3=Wright | first3=David | year=1982 }} discuss the errors in some of these incomplete proofs.
*{{cross}}{{hmmm}} Quine published his original description of the system [[New Foundations|Mathematical Logic]] in 1940, but in 1942 Rosser showed it was inconsistent. Wang found a correction in 1950; the consistency of this revised system is still unclear.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} One of many examples from algebraic geometry in the first half of the 20th century: {{harvtxt|Severi|1946}} claimed that  a degree-''n'' surface in 3-dimensional projective space has at most ({{su|b=3|p=''n''+2}})−4 nodes, [[Beniamino Segre|B. Segre]] pointed out that this was wrong; for example, for degree 6 the maximum number of nodes is 65, achieved by the [[Barth sextic]], which is more than the maximum of 52 claimed by Severi.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Rokhlin invariant]]. {{harvtxt|Rokhlin|1951}} incorrectly claimed that the third stable stem of the homotopy groups of spheres is of order 12. In 1952 he discovered his error: it is in fact cyclic of order 24. The difference is crucial as it results in the existence of the Rokhlin invariant, a fundamental tool in the theory of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.
*{{tick}} [[Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields]]. In 1952 [[Kurt Heegner|Heegner]] published a solution to this problem. His paper was not accepted as a complete proof as it contained a gap, and the first complete proofs were given in about 1967 by Baker and Stark. In 1969 Stark showed how to fill the gap in Heegner's paper.
*{{hmmm}} A strengthening of [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]] asking whether there exists a uniform finite upper bound for the number of limit cycles of planar polynomial vector fields of given degree ''n''. In the 1950s, [[Evgenii Landis]] and [[Ivan Petrovsky]] published a purported solution, but it was shown wrong in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=ilu/&gt;
*{{hmmm}} In 1954  K. Zarankiewicz claimed to have solved [[Turán's brick factory problem]] about the crossing number of complete bipartite graphs, but Kainen and Ringel later noticed a gap in his proof.
*{{tick}} In 1954 [[Igor Shafarevich]] published a proof that [[Shafarevich's theorem on solvable Galois groups|every finite solvable group is a Galois group over the rationals]]. However Schmidt pointed out a gap in the argument at the prime 2, which Shafarevich fixed in 1989.
*{{tick}} [[Nielsen realization problem]]. Kravetz claimed to solve this in 1959 by first showing that Teichmuller space is negatively curved, but in 1974 Masur showed that it is not negatively curved. The Nielsen realization problem was finally solved in 1980 by Kerskhoff.
*{{tick}} [[Yamabe problem]]. Yamabe claimed  a solution in 1960, but Trudinger discovered a gap in 1968, and a complete proof was not given until 1984.

*{{tick}} [[Mordell conjecture]] over [[Global function field|function field]]s. [[Yuri I. Manin|Manin]] published a proof in 1963, but {{harvtxt|Coleman|1990}} found and corrected a gap in the proof.
*{{cross}}{{cross}}{{tick}} The [[Schur multiplier]] of the [[Mathieu group M22|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]] is particularly notorious as it was miscalculated more than once: {{harvtxt|Burgoyne|Fong|1966}} first claimed it had order 3, then in a 1968 correction claimed it had order 6; its order is in fact (currently believed to be) 12. This caused an error in the title of Janko's paper ''A new finite simple group of order 86,775,570,046,077,562,880 which possesses M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and the full covering group of M&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroup'' on [[Janko group J4|J4]]: it does not have the full covering group as a subgroup, as the full covering group is larger than was realized at the time.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} The original statement of the classification of [[N-groups]] by Thompson in 1968 accidentally omitted the [[Tits group]], though he soon fixed this.
*{{cross}}{{hmmm}} In 1967 Reinhardt proposed [[Reinhardt cardinal]]s, which Kunen showed to be inconsistent with ZFC in 1971, though they are not known to be inconsistent with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].
*{{hmmm}} Complex structures on the 6-sphere. In 1969 Alfred Adler published a paper in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]] claiming that the 6-sphere has no complex structure. His argument was incomplete, and this is (as of 2016) still a major open problem.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s original version of [[intuitionistic type theory]] proposed in 1971 was shown to be inconsistent by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] in 1972, and was replaced by a corrected version.
*{{tick}} In 1973 Britton published a 282-page attempted solution of [[Burnside's problem]]. In his proof he assumed the existence of a set of parameters satisfying some inequalities, but Adian pointed out that these inequalities were inconsistent. Novikov and Adian had previously found a correct solution around 1968.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} In 1975, Leitzel, Madan, and Queen incorrectly claimed that there are only 7 function fields over [[finite field]]s with genus &gt;0 and class number 1, but in 2013 Stirpe found another; there are in fact exactly 8.
*{{hmmm}} [[Closed geodesic]]s. In 1978 [[Wilhelm Klingenberg]] published a proof that smooth [[closed manifold|compact manifolds without boundary]] have infinitely many closed geodesics. His proof was controversial, and there is currently (as of 2016) no consensus on whether his proof is complete.
*{{tick}} [[Classification of finite simple groups]]. In 1983, Gorenstein announced that the proof of the classification had been completed, but he had been misinformed about the status of the proof of classification of [[quasithin group]]s, which had a serious gap in it. A complete proof for this case was published by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.
*{{hmmm}} [[Telescope conjecture]]. Ravenel announced a refutation of this in 1992, but later withdrew it, and the conjecture is still open.
*{{tick}} [[Kepler conjecture]]. Hsiang published an incomplete proof of this in 1993. In 1998 Hales published a proof depending on long computer calculations.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Busemann–Petty problem]]. Zhang published two papers in the [[Annals of Mathematics]] in 1994 and 1999, in the first of which he proved that the Busemann–Petty problem in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; has a negative solution, and in the second of which he proved that it has a positive solution.
*{{cross}}{{tick}} [[Algebraic stack]]s. The book {{harvtxt|Laumon|Moret-Bailly|2000}} on algebraic stacks mistakenly claimed that [[morphism]]s of algebraic stacks induce morphisms of lisse-étale [[topos|topoi]]. The results depending on this were repaired by {{harvtxt|Olsson|2007}}.
*{{hmmm}} Matroid bundles. In 2003 Biss published a paper in the Annals of Mathematics claiming to show that matroid bundles are equivalent to real vector bundles, but in 2009 published a correction pointing out a serious gap in the proof.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1955665/has-anyone-ever-actually-seen-this-daniel-biss-paper&lt;/ref&gt; His correction was based on 2007 paper by Mnëv.&lt;ref&gt;Mnev, N. "On DK Biss' papers" The homotopy type of the matroid Grassmannian" and" Oriented matroids, complex manifolds, and a combinatorial model for BU"." ''arXiv preprint arXiv:0709.1291'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8861">{{more footnotes|date=February 2016}}'''Management cybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[management]] and [[organizations]]. "Management cybernetics" was first introduced by [[Stafford Beer]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=rosehead /&gt; Beer developed the theory through a combination of practical applications  and a series of influential books. The practical applications involved steel production, publishing and operations research in a large variety of different industries.

== Research into operations ==

As practiced by Beer, research into operations involved multidisciplinary teams seeking practical assistance for difficult managerial issues. It often involved the development of models borrowed from basic sciences and put into an isomorphic relationships with an organizational situation. Beer initially called this "[[operations research]]" (OR) but, along with [[Russell Ackoff]], became increasingly disenchanted with that term as the field transitioned into one in which a predefined set of mathematical tools was applied to well-formulated problems. Beer's critique of traditional OR, in part, was that it became a matter of experts in mathematics looking for situations that could be conformed to their methods. Beer insisted that what was needed for effective research into operations was to first understand the key dynamics within the situation and only then to select the theory or methods that would allow one to understand that situation in detail. Beer's "Decision and Control", especially chapter six, discusses the methodology in some detail.

== Viable system model ==

Viable means capable of independent existence and implies both maintaining internal stability and adaptation to a changing environment. "Internal stability" and "adaptation" can be in conflict, particularly if the relevant environment is changing rapidly, so the [[viable system model]] (VSM) is about maintaining a balance between the two such that the system is able to survive.

The VSM is a model of the structures and functions that are both necessary and sufficient for the long term survival of a system in a changing environment. Allenna Leonard, Beer's longtime partner, suggested that the most useful way to think about the VSM is as a language. The VSM is a language of viability. The VSM is a language for diagnosing organizations and managerial teams in terms of their viability or lack thereof. The VSM is also a language for designing organizations and managerial teams that will be viable.

== Syntegration ==

One of the great difficulties in managing  the modern large organization is that many of the issues are far too [[complexity|complex]] for even small groups. The critical knowledge is often dispersed among a substantial number of people. Organizations are often faced with choosing between 1) very costly and time-consuming meetings of large groups or 2) making bad decisions based on an inadequate grasp of the relevant factors. Syntegration is a group method designed to solve this conundrum.

Syntegration melds a number of cybernetic principles with [[Bucky Fuller]]'s ideas on [[tensegrity]]. The initial "team [[syntegrity]]" format involved 30 people divided into 12 overlapping teams to deal with some broad and initially ill-defined issue.  The teams and roles within the teams are arranged to achieve the mathematically optimum degree of resonance of information throughout the entire group. In practice, syntegration achieves a remarkable degree of shared understanding of the initial issue. In syntegrations intended to develop a plan of action, the implementation phase is usually very quick and effective, probably because of the shared understanding developed among the participants.

== Learning ==

The literature on management cybernetics is extensive. Beer wrote hundreds of papers and about ten books. Others have contributed perhaps an equal amount.  [[Barry Clemson]], at Beer's urging,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} wrote an introduction to management cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1968|author=Barry Clemson|title=Cybernetics: A new management tool|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqQpICD5IXgC|isbn=9782881245183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Hoverstadt wrote an introduction using real-life examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Hoverstadt|title=The Fractal Organization:Creating sustainable organizations with the Viable System Model|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-06056-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational cybernetics ==

Organizational cybernetics (OC) is distinguished from management cybernetics. Both use many of the same terms but interpret them according to another philosophy of systems thinking. The full flowering of management cybernetics is represented in Beer's books&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. Jackson]] (1991), ''Systems Methodology for the Management Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational cybernetics studies organizational design, and the regulation and self-regulation of organizations from a [[systems theory]] perspective that also takes the social dimension into consideration. Extending the principles of [[autonomous agency theory]] (AAT), cultural agency theory (CAT) has been formulated for the generation of higher cybernetic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I, Fink, G. (2014). Personality, pathology and mindsets: – Agency, Personality and Mindscapes, Kybernetes, 43(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers in economics, public administration and political science focus on the changes in institutions, organisation and mechanisms of social steering at various levels (sub-national, national, European, international) and in different sectors (including the private, semi-private and public sectors; the latter sector is emphasised).&lt;ref name = "NSM"&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/imr/programmes/programmes/oc/ Organisational Cybernetics], Nijmegen School of Management, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maximum downside exposure (MDE)''' values the maximum downside to the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. In other words, it tells you the most your portfolio could lose in the event of a catastrophe. As such, MDE obviates the need to worry about the market's unpredictable swings as it virtually eliminates downside surprises.

The formula is simple and easy to calculate: MDE = unhedged exposure/total portfolio value. For example, if you have half of your funds in inflation-protected cash, and the other half in stocks, you can’t possibly lose more than 50% of your money – that’s your portfolio’s MDE.

The main benefit of MDE is that – unlike probabilistic risk models (such as [[Value at risk|VaR]]) – it appropriately factors in all risks to the portfolio without looking at historical (and often erroneous) data and relying on simplistic statistical assumptions that don’t correspond to the real world. This makes MDE a very robust risk management tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marjanovic|first1=Boris|title=What Turkeys Can Teach Us About Risk Management|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3694906-what-turkeys-can-teach-us-about-risk-management|website=Seeking Alpha|publisher=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nocera|first1=Joe|title=Risk Mismanagement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11778">In algebra, a '''module homomorphism''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[module (mathematics)|module]]s that preserves module structures. Explicitly, if ''M'' and ''N'' are left modules over a ring ''R'', then a function &lt;math&gt;f: M \to N&lt;/math&gt; is called a module homomorphism or an ''R''-linear map if for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' and ''r'' in ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(rx) = rf(x).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'', ''N'' are right modules, then the second condition is replaced with
:&lt;math&gt;f(xr) = f(x)r.&lt;/math&gt;

The pre-image of the zero element under ''f'' is called the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''f''. The set of all module homomorphisms from ''M'' to ''N'' is denoted by Hom&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', ''N''). It is an abelian group (under pointwise addition) but is not necessarily a module unless ''R'' is commutative.

The composition of module homomorphisms is again a module homomorphism. Thus, all the (say left) modules together with all the module homomorphisms between them form the [[category of modules]].

== Terminology ==
A module homomorphism is called an [[isomorphism]] if it admits an inverse homomorphism; in particular, it is a [[bijection]]. One can show a bijective module homomorphism is an isomorphism; i.e., the inverse is a module homomorphism. In particular, a module homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is an isomorphism between the underlying abelian groups.

The [[isomorphism theorem]]s hold for module homomorphisms.

A module homomorphism from a module ''M'' to itself is called an [[endomorphism]] and an isomorphism from ''M'' to itself an [[automorphism]]. One writes &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(M) = \operatorname{Hom}_R(M, M)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of all endomorphisms between a module ''M''. It is not only an abelian group but is also a ring with multiplication given by [[function composition]], called the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M''.

[[Schur's lemma]] says that a homomorphism between [[simple module]]s (a module having only two submodules) must be either zero or an isomorphism. In particular, the endomorphism ring of a simple module is a [[division ring]].

In the language of the [[category theory]], an injective homomorphism is also called a [[monomorphism]] and a surjective homomorphism an [[epimorphism]].

== Examples ==
*The [[zero map]] ''M'' → ''N'' that maps every element to zero.
*A [[linear transformation]] between vector spaces.
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}/n, \mathbb{Z}/m) = \mathbb{Z}/\operatorname{gcd}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;.
*For a commutative ring ''R'' and ideals ''I'', ''J'', there is the canonical identification
*:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(R/I, R/J) = \{ r \in R | r I \subset J \}/J&lt;/math&gt;
:given by &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto f(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(R/I, R)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of ''I''.
*Given a ring ''R'' and an element ''r'', let &lt;math&gt;l_r: R \to R&lt;/math&gt; denote the left multiplication by ''r''. Then for any ''s'', ''t'' in ''R'',
*:&lt;math&gt;l_r(st) = rst = l_r(s)t&lt;/math&gt;.
:That is, &lt;math&gt;l_r&lt;/math&gt; is ''right'' ''R''-linear.
*For any ring ''R'',
**&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(R) = R&lt;/math&gt; as rings when ''R'' is viewed as a right module over itself. Explicitly, this isomorphism is given by the [[left regular representation]] &lt;math&gt;R \overset{\sim}\to \operatorname{End}_R(R), \, r \mapsto l_r&lt;/math&gt;.
**&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(R, M) = M&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto f(1)&lt;/math&gt; for any left module ''M''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|loc=§ 1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The module structure on Hom here comes from the right ''R''-action on ''R''; see [[#Module structures on Hom]] below.)
**&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, R)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[dual module]] of ''M''; it is a left (resp. right) module if ''M'' is a right (resp. left) module over ''R'' with the module structure coming from the ''R''-action on ''R''. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt;.
*Given a ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' of commutative rings and an ''S''-module ''M'', an ''R''-linear map θ: ''S'' → ''M'' is called a [[derivation (algebra)|derivation]] if for any ''f'', ''g'' in ''S'', {{nowrap|θ(''f g'') &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''f'' θ(''g'') + θ(''f'') ''g''}}.
*If ''S'', ''T'' are unital [[associative algebra]]s over a ring ''R'', then an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''S'' to ''T'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] that is also an ''R''-module homomorphism.

== Module structures on Hom ==
In short, Hom inherits a ring action that was not ''used up'' to form Hom. More precise, let ''M'', ''N'' be left ''R''-modules. Suppose ''M'' has a right action of a ring ''S'' that commutes with the ''R''-action; i.e., ''M'' is an (''R'', ''S'')-module. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, N)&lt;/math&gt;
has the structure of a left ''S''-module defined by: for ''s'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''M'',
:&lt;math&gt;(s \cdot f)(x) = f(xs).&lt;/math&gt;
It is well-defined (i.e., &lt;math&gt;s \cdot f&lt;/math&gt; is ''R''-linear) since
:&lt;math&gt;(s \cdot f)(rx) = f(rxs) = rf(xs) = r (s \cdot f)(x).&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;s \cdot f&lt;/math&gt; is a ring action since
:&lt;math&gt;(st \cdot f)(x) = f(xst) = (t \cdot f)(xs) = s \cdot (t \cdot f)(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: the above verification would "fail" if one used the left ''R''-action in place of the right ''S''-action. In this sense, Hom is often said to "use up" the ''R''-action.

Similarly, if ''M'' is a left ''R''-module and ''N'' is an (''R'', ''S'')-module, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, N)&lt;/math&gt; is a right ''S''-module by &lt;math&gt;(f \cdot s)(x) = f(x)s&lt;/math&gt;.

== A matrix representation ==
The relationship between matrices and linear transformations in [[linear algebra]] generalizes in a natural way to module homomorphisms. Precisely, given a right ''R''-module ''U'', there is the [[canonical isomorphism]] of the abelian groups
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_R(U^{\oplus n}, U^{\oplus m}) \overset{f \mapsto [f_{ij}]}\underset{\sim}\to M_{m, n}(\operatorname{End}_R(U))&lt;/math&gt;
obtained by viewing &lt;math&gt;U^{\oplus n}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of column vectors and then writing ''f'' as an ''m'' × ''n'' matrix. In particular, viewing ''R'' as a right ''R''-module, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \simeq M_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;,
which turns out to be a ring isomorphism.

Note the above isomorphism is canonical; no choice is involved. On the other hand, if one is given a module homomorphism between finite-rank [[free module]]s, then a choice of an ordered basis corresponds to a choice of an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;F \simeq R^n&lt;/math&gt;. The above procedure then gives the matrix representation with respect to such choices of the bases. For more general modules, matrix representations may either lack uniqueness or not exist.

== Defining ==
In practice, one often defines a module homomorphism by specifying its values on a [[generating set of a module]]. More precise, let ''M'' and ''N'' be left ''R''-modules. Suppose a subset ''S'' generates ''M''; i.e., there is a surjection &lt;math&gt;F \to M&lt;/math&gt; with a free module ''F'' with a basis indexed by ''S'' and kernel ''K'' (i.e., the [[free presentation]]). Then to give a module homomorphism &lt;math&gt;M \to N&lt;/math&gt; is to give a module homomorphism &lt;math&gt;F \to N&lt;/math&gt; that kills ''K'' (i.e., maps ''K'' to zero).

== Operations ==
If &lt;math&gt;f: M \to N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g: M' \to N'&lt;/math&gt; are module homomorphisms, then their direct sum is
:&lt;math&gt;f \oplus g: M \oplus M' \to N \oplus N', \, (x, y) \mapsto (f(x), g(y))&lt;/math&gt;
and their tensor product is
:&lt;math&gt;f \otimes g: M \otimes M' \to N \otimes N', \, x \otimes y \mapsto f(x) \otimes g(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f: M \to N&lt;/math&gt; be a module homomorphism between left modules. The [[graph of a function|graph]] Γ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''f'' is the submodule of ''M'' ⊕ ''N'' given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_f = \{ (x, f(x)) | x \in M \}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the image of the [[graph morphism]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} {{nowrap|''M'' → ''M'' ⊕ ''N'', ''x'' → (''x'', ''f''(''x'')).&lt;!-- how to write mapsto in html? --&gt;}}

The [[transpose]] of ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt;f^*: N^* \to M^*, \, f^*(\alpha) = \alpha \circ f.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''f'' is an isomorphism, then the transpose of the inverse of ''f'' is called the '''contragredient''' of ''f''.

== Exact sequences ==
{{main|exact sequences}}

A short sequence of modules over a commutative ring
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to A \overset{f}\to B \overset{g}\to C \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
consists of modules ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and homomorphisms ''f'', ''g''. It is exact if ''f'' is injective, the kernel of ''g'' is the image of ''f'' and ''g'' is surjective. A longer exact sequence is defined in the similar way. A sequence of modules is exact if and only if it is exact as a sequence of abelian groups. Also the sequence is exact if and only if it is exact at all the maximal ideals:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to A_{\mathfrak{m}} \overset{f}\to B_{\mathfrak{m}} \overset{g}\to C_{\mathfrak{m}} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt; means the [[localization of a module]] at &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any module homomorphism ''f'' fits into
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to K \to M \overset{f}\to N \to C \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' is the kernel of ''f'' and ''C'' is the cokernel, the quotien of ''N'' by the image of ''f''.

If &lt;math&gt;f : M \to B, g: N \to B&lt;/math&gt; are module homomorphisms, then they are said to form a '''fiber square''' (or '''[[pullback square]]'''), denoted by ''M'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''N'', if it fits into
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to M \times_{B} N \to M \times N \overset{\phi}\to B \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi(x, y) = f(x) - g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;B \subset A&lt;/math&gt; be commutative rings, and let ''I'' be the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of the quotient ''B''-module ''A''/''B'' (which is an ideal of ''A''). Then canonical maps &lt;math&gt;A \to A/I, B/I \to A/I&lt;/math&gt; form a fiber square with &lt;math&gt;B = A \times_{A/I} B/I.&lt;/math&gt;

== Endomorphisms of finitely generated modules ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi: M \to M&lt;/math&gt; be an endomorphism between finitely generated ''R''-modules for a commutative ring ''R''. Then
*&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is killed by its characteristic polynomial relative to the generators of ''M''; see [[Nakayama's lemma#Proof]].
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, then it is injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|loc=Theorem 2.4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: [[Herbrand quotient]] (which can be defined for any endomorphism with some finiteness conditions.)

== Variants ==
=== Additive relations ===
An '''additive relation''' &lt;math&gt;M \to N&lt;/math&gt; from a module ''M'' to a module ''N'' is a submodule of &lt;math&gt;M \oplus N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ujRqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22additive+relation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ruT-hTS7i7&amp;sig=RC0wWkWvedG48NjRd0L52OgAgJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X2piVYKwDqHIsQSQtoCYCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22additive%20relation%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a "many-valued" homomorphism defined on some submodule of ''M''. The inverse &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; of ''f'' is the submodule &lt;math&gt;\{ (y, x) | (x, y) \in f \}&lt;/math&gt;. Any additive relation ''f'' determines a homomorphism from a submodule of ''M'' to a quotient of ''N''
:&lt;math&gt;D(f) \to N/\{ y | (0, y) \in f \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt; consists of all elements ''x'' in ''M'' such that (''x'', ''y'') belongs to ''f'' for some ''y'' in ''N''.

A [[spectral sequences#Edge maps and transgressions|transgression]] that arises from a spectral sequence is an example of an additive relation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5405">A '''''Nasik magic hypercube''''' is a [[magic hypercube]] with the added restriction that all possible lines through each cell sum correctly to &lt;math&gt; S = \frac{m(m^n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;  where ''S'' = the magic constant, ''m'' = the order and ''n'' = the dimension, of the hypercube.

Or, to put it more concisely, all pan-''r''-agonals sum correctly for ''r'' = 1...''n''.

The above definition is the same as the Hendricks definition of '''''perfect''''', but different from the Boyer/Trump definition. See [[Perfect magic cube]]

==Definitions==
A '''''Nasik magic cube''''' is a magic cube with the added restriction that all 13''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; possible lines sum correctly to the magic constant. This class of magic cube is commonly called perfect (John Hendricks definition.). See [[Magic cube classes]].
However, the term ''perfect'' is ambiguous because it is also used for other types of magic cubes. [[Perfect magic cube]] demonstrates just one example of this.&lt;br&gt;
The term ''nasik'' would apply to all dimensions of magic hypercubes in which the number of correctly summing paths (lines) through any cell of the hypercube is ''P'' = (3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;- 1)/2

A [[pandiagonal magic square]] then would be a ''nasik'' square because 4 magic line pass through each of the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;cells. This was A.H. Frost’s original definition of nasik.&lt;br&gt;
A ''nasik'' magic cube would have 13 magic lines passing through each of its ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cells. (This cube also contains 9''m'' pandiagonal magic squares of order ''m''.)&lt;br&gt;
A ''nasik'' magic tesseract would have 40 lines passing through each of its ''m''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells.&lt;br&gt; And so on.

== History ==

In 1866 and 1878, Rev. A. H. Frost coined the term ''Nasik'' for the type of magic square we commonly call ''pandiagonal'' and often call ''perfect''. He then demonstrated the concept with an order-7 cube we now class as  ''pandiagonal'', and an order-8 cube we class as ''pantriagonal''.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, A. H., Invention of Magic Cubes, ''Quarterly Journal of Mathematics'', 7,1866, pp92-102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, A. H., ''On the General Properties of Nasik Squares'', QJM, 15, 1878, pp 34-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In another 1878 paper he showed another ''pandiagonal'' magic cube and a cube where all 13''m'' lines sum correctly&lt;ref&gt;Frost, A. H. ''On the General Properties of Nasik Cubes'', QJM, 15, 1878, pp 93-123&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. Hendricks ''perfect''.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz, H.D., and Hendricks, J.R., ''Magic Square Lexicon: Illustrated'', 2000, 0-9687985-0-0 pp 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;
He referred to all of these cubes as '''''nasik''''' as a respect to the great Indian Mathematician [[D R Kaprekar]] who hails from [[Deolali]] in [[Nasik]] District in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].
In 1905 Dr. Planck expanded on the nasik idea in his Theory of Paths Nasik. In the introductory to his paper, he wrote;
{{Quotation|Analogy suggest that in the higher dimensions we ought to employ the term nasik as implying the existence of magic summations parallel to any diagonal, and not restrict it to diagonals in sections parallel to the plane faces. The term is used in this wider sense throughout the present paper.| C. Planck, M.A.,M.R.C.S., The Theory of Paths Nasik, 1905&lt;ref&gt;Planck, C., M.A.,M.R.C.S., ''The Theory of Paths Nasik'', 1905, printed for private circulation. Introductory letter to the paper.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1917, Dr. Planck wrote again on this subject.
{{Quotation|It is not difficult to perceive that if we push the Nasik analogy to higher dimensions the number of magic directions through any cell of a k-fold must be ½(3&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-1).| W. S. Andrews, Magic Squares and Cubes, Dover Publ., 1917, page 366&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, W. S., Magic Squares and Cubes, Dover Publ. 1917. Essay pages 363-375 written by C. Planck&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1939, B. Rosser and R. J. Walker published a series of papers on diabolic (perfect) magic squares and cubes. They specifically mentioned that these cubes contained 13''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; correctly summing lines. They also had 3''m'' pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the faces of the cube, and 6''m'' pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the triagonal planes.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser, B. and Walker, R. J., ''Magic Squares: Published papers and Supplement'', 1939. A bound volume at Cornell University, catalogued as QA 165 R82+pt.1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olle Häggström''' (born 4 October 1967) is a professor of mathematical statistics at [[Chalmers University]]. He is an elected member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien - Matematik|url=http://www.kva.se/kontakt/Ledamoter/Matematik/|website=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Here Be Dragons''==
In 2016, Häggström published (via [[Oxford University Press]]) ''Here Be Dragons: Science, Technology and the Future of Humanity'', an attempt to draft a road map of potential dangers that could be associated with various emerging technologies: "There is no denying that advances in science and technology have brought us prosperity and improved our lives tremendously... but there is a flip side: some of the advances that may lie ahead of us can actually make us worse off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is predicting the future futile or necessary?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5815c14a-b2e7-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On human enhancement, Häggström argues that any enhancement, from growth hormones to cognitive enhancement, can encourage an "arms race" in which everyone is compelled to participate for fear of falling behind: "It is hard to imagine the US silently sitting still and watching a cognitive enhancement development that can turn China into the world’s military overlords." On geoengineering, Häggström discusses a proposed form of geoengineering that involves continuously pumping sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere to counteract global warming, and warns this could create a catastrophic risk of a massive temperature spike if a future generation were unable to continue pumping.&lt;ref name=newscientist&gt;{{cite news|title=&lt;em&gt;Here Be Dragons&lt;/em&gt;: Hostile aliens, tall people and black holes|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22930540-900-here-be-dragons-hostile-aliens-tall-people-and-black-holes/|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On nanotechnology, Häggström discusses concerns about self-replicating nanobots, as well as the potential for emerging manufacturing technologies to undo existing gun control measures and to radically upscale the quantities of existing weaponry, and to create destabilizing new classes of weapons.&lt;ref name=theiet /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Häggström|first1=Olle|title=Here Be Dragons: Science, Technology and the Future of Humanity|date=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780191035395|chapter=5.4: Grey Goo and Other Dangers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other topics include [[existential risks]] from high-energy physics experiments, as well as from advanced artificial intelligence: Häggström poses a scenario in which a superintelligent computer, aiming to maximise happiness in the universe, calculates that sentient beings are happy less than half the time, and proceeds to exterminate all sentient life, in order to increase the existing sum of happiness a negative number to zero. Häggström also discusses [[SETI]], criticizing "inexcusably reckless" attempts to communicate with aliens.&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt;

In a positive review in ''[[New Scientist]]'', a reviewer raises the question: "What if extraterrestrial advice could have saved us from some other danger, and we doomed civilisation by not asking?" and cautions there are "no easy answers" to these questions.&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10066">In applied mathematics – specifically in [[fuzzy logic]] – the '''ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators''' provide a [[parameter]]ized class of mean type aggregation operators. They were introduced by [[Ronald R. Yager]]. Many notable mean operators such as the max, [[arithmetic average]], median and min, are members of this class. They have been widely used in [[computational intelligence]] because of their ability to model linguistically expressed aggregation instructions.

== Definition ==

Formally an '''OWA''' operator of dimension &lt;math&gt; \ n &lt;/math&gt; is a mapping &lt;math&gt; F: R_n \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt; that has an associated collection of weights &lt;math&gt; \  W = [w_1, \ldots, w_n] &lt;/math&gt; lying in the unit interval and summing to one and with 		

:&lt;math&gt; F(a_1, \ldots , a_n) =  \sum_{j=1}^n  w_j b_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; b_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest of the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt;.

By choosing different ''W'' one can implement different aggregation operators. The OWA operator is a non-linear operator as a result of the process of determining the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Properties ==

The OWA operator is a mean operator. It is [[Bounded operator|bounded]], [[monotonic]], [[symmetric operator|symmetric]], and [[idempotent]], as defined below.

{|class="wikitable"
|[[Bounded operator|Bounded]]
|&lt;math&gt;   \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[Monotonic]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \ge F(g_1, \ldots, g_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a_i \ge g_i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ i = 1,2,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[symmetric operator|Symmetric]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  = F(a_\boldsymbol{\pi(1)}, \ldots, a_\boldsymbol{\pi(n)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\pi} &lt;/math&gt; is a permutation map
|-
|[[Idempotent]]
|&lt;math&gt;  \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  =  a &lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt; \ a_i = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Notable OWA operators ==
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne n &lt;/math&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \mathrm{average}(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; j \in [1, n] &lt;/math&gt;

== Characterizing features ==

Two features have been used to characterize the OWA operators. The first is the attitudinal character(orness).

This is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A-C(W)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^n (n - j) w_j. &lt;/math&gt;

It is known that &lt;math&gt; A-C(W) \in [0, 1] &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''C''(max) = 1, A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(ave) = A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(med) = 0.5 and A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(min) = 0. Thus the A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C goes from 1 to 0 as we go from Max to Min aggregation. The attitudinal character characterizes the similarity of aggregation to OR operation(OR is defined as the Max).

The second feature is the dispersion. This defined as

:&lt;math&gt;H(W) = -\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \ln (w_j).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition is &lt;math&gt;E(W) = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 .&lt;/math&gt; The dispersion characterizes how uniformly the arguments are being used

== A literature survey: OWA (1988-2014)==
The historical reconstruction of scientific development of the OWA field, the identification of the dominant direction of knowledge accumulation that emerged since the publication of the first OWA paper, and to discover the most active lines of research has recently been published, (see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full). The results suggest, as expected, that Yager's paper[1] (IEEE Trans. Systems Man Cybernet, 18(1), 183–190, 1988) is the most influential paper and the starting point of all other research using OWA. Starting from his contribution, other lines of research developed and we describe them. Full list of papers published in OWA is also available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full)

== Type-1 OWA aggregation operators ==

The above Yager's OWA operators are used to aggregate the crisp values. Can we aggregate fuzzy sets in the OWA mechanism ? The
'''[[Type-1 OWA operators]]''' have been proposed for this purpose. So the '''[[type-1 OWA operators]]''' provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA operator]]''' is defined according to the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets as follows:

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is given as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \ldots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \ldots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The computation of the '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA]]''' output is implemented by computing the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_ {+},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha ^i=[A_{\alpha-}^i, A_{\alpha+}^i], W_\alpha ^i=[W_{\alpha-}^i, W_{\alpha+}^i]&lt;/math&gt;. Then membership function of resulting aggregation fuzzy set is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \mathop \vee _{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \min\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \max\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.191 This paper] has presented a fast method to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently.

In [[geometry]], an '''orthant'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FV_s8W58D4UC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=positive+orthant+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LV7f7KQZIP&amp;sig=445iHTVnZB4MJ6-BNOoAeHpz-1A&amp;ei=ajp8TPeUFs2nnQfmraSdCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=positive%20orthant%20definition&amp;f=false Advanced linear algebra By Steven Roman, Chapter 15]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hyperoctant'''&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Hyperoctant|urlname=Hyperoctant}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the analogue in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] of a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|quadrant]] in the plane or an [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]] in three dimensions.

In general an orthant in ''n''-dimensions can be considered the intersection of ''n'' mutually orthogonal [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s. By independent selections of half-space signs, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; orthants in ''n''-dimensional space.

More specifically, a '''closed orthant''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset defined by constraining each [[Cartesian coordinate]] to be nonnegative or nonpositive.  Such a subset is defined by a system of inequalities:
:&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0,
where each ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is +1 or &amp;minus;1.

Similarly, an '''open orthant''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset defined by a system of strict inequalities
:&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,
where each ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is +1 or &amp;minus;1.

By dimension:
#In one dimension, an orthant is a [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]].
#In two dimensions, an orthant is a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|quadrant]].
#In three dimensions, an orthant is an [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]].

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] defined the term ''n''-[[orthoplex]] from '''orthant complex''' as a [[regular polytope]] in n-dimensions with 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[simplex]] [[Facet (geometry)|facet]]s, one per orthant.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Conway, N. J. A. Sloane, ''The Cell Structures of Certain Lattices'' (1991) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=3212CE9783BF85105D10AEA85A4FF816?doi=10.1.1.48.2837&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nonnegative orthant''' is the generalization of the first [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] to n dimensions and is important in many [[constrained optimization]] problems.

A '''package''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] is used "to group elements, and to provide a namespace for the grouped elements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Infrastructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Infrastructure, V2.1.1] p.158.&lt;/ref&gt; A package may contain other packages, thus providing for a hierarchical organization of packages.

Pretty much all UML elements can be grouped into packages. Thus, classes, objects, [[use case]]s, [[component (UML)|components]], [[Node (UML)|nodes]], node instances etc. can all be organized as packages, thus enabling a manageable organization of the myriad elements that a real-world UML model entails.

== Usage ==
When organizing functional models (use case models, workflow models etc.), use packages to model the real-world modular structure of the system being modeled. When organizing source code, use packages to represent the different layers of the source code. For instance:
* [[Presentation logic|presentation layer]]
* controller layer
* [[data access layer]]
* integration layer
* business services layer

When organizing component models, use packages to group the components according to ownership and/or reuse possibilities. For instance:
* [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf products]]
* [[Open-source software|open-source]] framework components
* custom-built framework components
* custom-built application components

When organizing deployment models, use packages to represent the different types of deployment environments that you will be modeling. For instance:
* production environment
* pre-production environment
* [[integration test]] environment
* [[system test]] environment
* [[Development environment (software development process)|development environment]]

[[File:Primes-vs-composites.svg|thumb|The prime numbers are the natural numbers greater than one that are not products of two smaller numbers.|alt=Groups of two to twelve dots, showing that the composite numbers of dots (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12) can be arranged into rectangles but the prime numbers cannot]]

A '''prime number''' (or a '''prime''') is a [[natural number]] greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a [[composite number]]. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a [[Product (mathematics)|product]], {{nowrap|1 × 5}} or {{nowrap|5 × 1}}, involve 5 itself.
However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers ({{nowrap|2 × 3}}) that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in [[number theory]] because of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be [[factorization|factorized]] as a product of primes that is unique [[up to]] their order.

The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, called [[trial division]], tests whether &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of any integer between 2 and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Faster algorithms include the [[Miller–Rabin primality test]], which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the [[AKS primality test]], which always produces the correct answer in [[polynomial time]] but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as [[Mersenne number]]s. {{As of|2018|01}} the [[largest known prime number]] has 23,249,425 [[numerical digit|decimal digits]].

There are [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] primes, as [[Euclid's theorem|demonstrated by Euclid]] around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the [[prime number theorem]], proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the [[probability]] of a randomly chosen number being prime is inversely [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its number of digits, that is, to its [[logarithm]].

Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include [[Goldbach's conjecture]], that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the [[twin prime]] conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on [[analytic number theory|analytic]] or [[algebraic number theory|algebraic]] aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in [[information technology]], such as [[public-key cryptography]], which relies on the difficulty of [[Integer factorization|factoring]] large numbers into their prime factors. In [[abstract algebra]], objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include [[prime element]]s and [[prime ideal]]s.

==Definition and examples==
{{main|List of prime numbers}}
A [[natural number]] (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a '''prime number''' (or a '''prime''') if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as a product of two natural numbers that are both smaller than it. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called [[composite number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mathematical Olympiad Handbook: An Introduction to Problem Solving Based on the First 32 British Mathematical Olympiads 1965–1996|first=Anthony|last=Gardiner|authorlink=Tony Gardiner|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780198501053|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyFLrAEVgv8C&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is prime if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dyslexia, Dyscalculia and Mathematics: A practical guide|first=Anne|last=Henderson|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781136636622|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy-yGVRUilMC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if it is not possible to arrange &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dots into a rectangular grid that is more than one dot wide and more than one dot high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Giant Golden Book of Mathematics: Exploring the World of Numbers and Space|first=Irving|last=Adler|authorlink=Irving Adler|publisher=Golden Press|year=1960|page=16|oclc=6975809}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lhL-aEZuSRoC&amp;pg=PA360 | page = 360 | title = Math Workbook for the SAT I | first = Lawrence S. | last = Leff | publisher = Barron's Educational Series | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780764107689}}&lt;/ref&gt; as there are no other numbers that divide them evenly (without a remainder).
1 is not prime, as it is specifically excluded in the definition. {{nowrap|1=4 = 2 &amp;times; 2}} and {{nowrap|1=6 = 2 &amp;times; 3}} are both composite.

[[File:Prime number Cuisenaire rods 7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Demonstration, with [[Cuisenaire rods]], that 7 is prime, because none of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 divide it evenly|alt=Demonstration, with Cuisenaire rods, that 7 is prime, because none of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 divide it evenly]]
The [[divisor]]s of a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers that divide &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; evenly.
Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This idea leads to a different but equivalent definition of the primes: they are the numbers with exactly two positive [[divisor]]s, 1 and the number itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dudley| first1=Underwood|authorlink=Underwood Dudley | title=Elementary number theory | publisher=W.

Yet another way to say the same thing is that a number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is prime if it is greater than one and if none of the numbers &lt;math&gt;2, 3, \dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sierpiński | first = Wacław | authorlink = Wacław Sierpiński | title = Elementary Theory of Numbers | edition = 2nd | volume = 31 | series = North-Holland Mathematical Library | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780080960197 | page = 113 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ktCZ2MvgN3MC&amp;pg=PA113 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[even number]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; greater than 2 is prime because any such number can be expressed as the product &lt;math&gt;2\times n/2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, every prime number other than 2 is an [[odd number]], and is called an ''odd prime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Numbers and Geometry|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=Springer|year=1997|isbn=9780387982892|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4elkHwVS0eUC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when written in the usual [[decimal]] system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.

decimal numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, and decimal numbers that end in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sierpiński | first = Wacław | authorlink = Wacław Sierpiński | location = New York | mr = 0170843 | page = 40 | publisher = Macmillan | title = A Selection of Problems in the Theory of Numbers | year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.jpg|thumb|The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]|alt=The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]
The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], from around 1550 BC, has [[Egyptian fraction]] expansions of different forms for prime and composite numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Bruins, Evert Marie, review in ''Mathematical Reviews'' of {{cite journal | last = Gillings | first = R.

How did the ancient Egyptian scribe prepare it? | volume = 12 | year = 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from [[Greek mathematics|Ancient Greek mathematics]]. [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' (circa 300 BC) proves the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of primes]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and shows how to construct a [[perfect number]] from a [[Mersenne prime]].&lt;ref name="stillwell-2010-p40"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics and Its History|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9781441960528|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7mxZqjs5yUC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Greek invention, the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes|Sieve]] of [[Eratosthenes]], is still used to construct lists of primes.&lt;ref name="pomerance-sciam"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Search for Prime Numbers|first=Carl|last=Pomerance|authorlink=Carl Pomerance|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=247|issue=6|date=December 1982|pages=136–147|jstor=24966751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mollin"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mollin | first = Richard A. | doi = 10.2307/3219180 | issue = 1 | journal = Mathematics Magazine | mr = 2107288 | pages = 18–29 | title = A brief history of factoring and primality testing B.

Around 1000 AD, the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Islamic]] mathematician [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] found [[Wilson's theorem]], characterizing the prime numbers as the numbers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; that evenly divide &lt;math&gt;(n-1)!+1&lt;/math&gt;. Alhazen also conjectured that all even perfect numbers come from Euclid's construction using Mersenne primes, but was unable to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Islamic mathematician, [[Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi]], observed that the sieve of Eratosthenes can be sped up by testing only the divisors up to the square root of the largest number to be tested. [[Fibonacci]] brought the innovations from Islamic mathematics back to Europe. His book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' (1202) was the first to describe [[trial division]] for testing primality, again using divisors only up to the square root.&lt;ref name="mollin"/&gt;

In 1640 [[Pierre de Fermat]] stated (without proof) [[Fermat's little theorem]] (later proved by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandifer|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&amp;pg=PA45 8.

At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss conjectured that as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity, the number of primes up to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;x/\log x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\log x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural logarithm]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.   Ideas of Riemann in his [[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|1859 paper on the zeta-function]] sketched an outline for proving this. Although the closely related [[Riemann hypothesis]] remains unproven, Riemann's outline was completed in 1896 by [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|de la Vallée Poussin]], and the result is now known as the [[prime number theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Apostol | first = Tom M. | author-link = Tom M.

Many mathematicians have worked on [[primality test]]s for numbers larger than those where trial division is practicably applicable. Methods that are restricted to specific number forms include [[Pépin's test]] for Fermat numbers (1877),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip|first=Jean-Luc|last=Chabert|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9783642181924|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcDqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proth's theorem]] (around 1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Elementary Number Theory and Its Applications|first=Kenneth H.|last=Rosen|edition=4th|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2000|isbn=9780201870732|contribution=Theorem 9.20.

A few mathematicians from this time also considered the prime numbers to be a subdivision of the odd numbers, so they also did not consider 2 to be prime. However, Euclid and a majority of the other Greek mathematicians considered 2 as prime. The [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic mathematicians]] largely followed the Greeks in viewing 1 as not being a number.&lt;ref name="crxk-34"/&gt;
By the Middle Ages and Renaissance mathematicians began treating 1 as a number, and some of them included it as the first prime number.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caldwell|Reddick|Xiong|Keller|2012}}, pp. 7–13. See in particular the entries for Stevin, Brancker, Wallis, and Prestet.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century [[Christian Goldbach]] listed 1 as prime in his correspondence with [[Leonhard Euler]]; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caldwell|Reddick|Xiong|Keller|2012}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered 1 to be prime,&lt;ref name="cx"/&gt; and lists of primes that included 1 continued to be published as recently as 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Riesel | first=Hans | authorlink= Hans Riesel | title=Prime Numbers and Computer Methods for Factorization | publisher=Birkhäuser | location=Basel, Switzerland | isbn=978-0-8176-3743-9 | year=1994|page=36|edition=2nd|mr=1292250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITvaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cg-bon-129-130"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Guy | first2=Richard K. | author2-link=Richard K.

If the definition of a prime number were changed to call 1 a prime, many statements involving prime numbers would need to be reworded in a more awkward way. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic would need to be rephrased in terms of factorizations into primes greater than 1, because every number would have multiple factorizations with different numbers of copies of 1.&lt;ref name="cx"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caldwell | first1 = Chris K. | last2 = Xiong | first2 = Yeng | issue = 9 | journal = [[Journal of Integer Sequences]] | mr = 3005530 | page = Article 12.9.7 | title = What is the smallest prime? | url = https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell1/cald5.pdf | volume = 15 | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] would not work correctly if it handled 1 as a prime, because it would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and output only the single number 1.&lt;ref name="cg-bon-129-130"/&gt; Some other more technical properties of prime numbers also do not hold for the number 1: for instance, the formulas for [[Euler's totient function]] or for the [[Sum-of-divisors function|sum of divisors function]] are different for prime numbers than they are for 1.&lt;ref&gt;For the totient, see {{harvnb|Sierpiński|1988}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ktCZ2MvgN3MC&amp;pg=PA245 p. 245].

==Elementary properties==
===Unique factorization===
{{Main|Fundamental theorem of arithmetic}}
Writing a number as a product of prime numbers is called a ''prime factorization'' of the number. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
34866 &amp;= 2\cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot 13 \cdot 149\\
&amp;=2\cdot 3^2\cdot 13 \cdot 149
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The terms in the product are called '''prime factors'''. The same prime factor may occur more than once; this example has two copies of the prime factor &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.
When a prime occurs multiple times, [[exponentiation]] can be used to group together multiple copies of the same prime number: for instance, in the second way of writing the product above, &lt;math&gt;3^2&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Square (algebra)|square]] or second power of &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.

The central importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the ''fundamental theorem of arithmetic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Mathematics
|first=Karl J.|last=Smith|edition=12th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9780538737586|page=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0HyCgDYq8C&amp;pg=PA188}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes. More strongly, 
this product is unique in the sense that any two prime factorizations of the same number will have the same numbers of copies of the same primes,
although their ordering may differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1978}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tr7SzBTsk1UC&amp;pg=PA16 Section 2, Theorem 2, p. 16]; {{cite book|title=Closing the Gap: The Quest to Understand Prime Numbers|first=Vicky|last=Neale|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780191092435|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7Q1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So, although there are many different ways of finding a factorization using an [[integer factorization]] algorithm, they all must produce the same result. Primes can thus be considered the "basic building blocks" of the natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics|first=Marcus|last=du Sautoy|authorlink=Marcus du Sautoy|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2003|isbn=9780060935580|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1Jlf9e3EgsC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations are based on [[Euclid's lemma]]: If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime number and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides a product &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; of integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (or both).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1978}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tr7SzBTsk1UC&amp;pg=PA15 Section 2, Lemma 5, p. 15]; {{cite book|title=Mathematics for the Curious|first=Peter M.|last=Higgins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780191500503|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeYH8P8S9oQC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if a number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has the property that when it divides a product it always divides at least one factor of the product, then &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; must be prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra|first=Joseph J.|last=Rotman|edition=2nd|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000|isbn=9780130115843|at=Problem 1.40, p. 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infiniteness===
{{Main|Euclid's theorem}}
There are [[infinitely]] many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence
:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...
of prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as ''Euclid's theorem'' in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician [[Euclid]], since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] proof by [[Euler]], [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach's]] [[Fermat number#Basic properties|proof]] based on  [[Fermat number]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0722.pdf Letter] in [[Latin]] from Goldbach to Euler, July 1730.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Furstenberg|Furstenberg's]] [[Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes|proof using general topology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furstenberg | first1=Harry | author1-link=Hillel Furstenberg | title=On the infinitude of primes | doi=10.2307/2307043 | year=1955 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]   | volume=62 | page=353 | mr=0068566 | issue=5 | publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] elegant proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ribenboim | first1=Paulo | author1-link=Paulo Ribenboim | title=The little book of bigger primes | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-20169-6 | year=2004|page=4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvnTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid's theorem|Euclid's proof]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], Book IX, Proposition 20. See [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX20.html David Joyce's English translation of Euclid's proof] or {{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000084215o;view=1up;seq=95|title=The Elements of Euclid, With Dissertations|last=Williamson|first=James|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|year=1782|isbn=|location=Oxford|page=63|pages=|oclc=642232959}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that every [[finite set|finite list]] of primes is incomplete. The key idea is to multiply together the primes in any given list and add &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. If the list consists of the primes
&lt;math&gt;p_1,p_2,\dots p_n&lt;/math&gt;, this gives the number
: &lt;math&gt; N = 1 + p_1\cdot p_2\cdots p_n. &lt;/math&gt;
By the fundamental theorem, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has a prime factorization
: &lt;math&gt; N =  p'_1\cdot p'_2\cdots p'_m &lt;/math&gt;
with one or more prime factors. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is evenly divisible by each of these factors, but &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has a remainder of one when divided by any of the prime numbers in the given list, so none of the prime factors of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be in the given list. Because there is no finite list of all the primes, there must be infinitely many primes.

The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest primes are called [[Euclid number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computational Recreations in Mathematica|first=Ilan|last=Vardi|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1991|isbn=9780201529890|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first five of them are prime, but the sixth,
:&lt;math&gt;30031 = 1+2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13=59\cdot 509,&lt;/math&gt;
is a composite number.

===Formulas for primes===
{{main|Formula for primes}}
There is no known efficient formula for primes.  For example, there is no non-constant [[polynomial]], even in several variables, that takes ''only'' prime values.&lt;ref name="matiyasevich"/&gt;  However, there are numerous expressions that do encode all primes, or only primes. One possible formula is based on [[Wilson's theorem]] and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackinnon | first = Nick | date = June 1987 | doi = 10.2307/3616496 | issue = 456 | journal = [[The Mathematical Gazette]] | page = 113 | title = Prime number formulae | volume = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a set of [[Diophantine equations]] in nine variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its ''positive'' values are prime.&lt;ref name="matiyasevich"&gt;{{cite book | last = Matiyasevich | first = Yuri V. | authorlink = Yuri Matiyasevich | year=1999 | chapter = Formulas for prime numbers | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLKlk5o6WroC&amp;pg=PA13 | editor1-first=Serge | editor1-last = Tabachnikov | editorlink1=Sergei Tabachnikov| title = Kvant Selecta: Algebra and Analysis, | volume = II | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]] | isbn = 978-0-8218-1915-9 | pages=13–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of prime-generating formulas come from [[Mills' theorem]] and a theorem of [[E. M. Wright|Wright]].  These assert that there are real constants &lt;math&gt;A&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor A^{3^n}\right \rfloor \text{ and } \left \lfloor 2^{\cdots^{2^{2^\mu}}} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
are prime for any natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the first formula, and any number of exponents in the second formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. M. |last= Wright | authorlink=E. M. Wright |title=A prime-representing function |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=58 |issue=9 |year=1951 |pages=616–618 |jstor=2306356 |doi= 10.2307/2306356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;\lfloor {}\cdot{} \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[floor function]], the largest integer less than or equal to the number in question. However, these are not useful for generating primes, as the primes must be generated first in order to compute the values of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="matiyasevich"/&gt;

===Open questions===
{{Further|:Category:Conjectures about prime numbers}}
Many  conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood proof for decades: all four of [[Landau's problems]] from 1912 are still unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2013}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbLzBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7 p. vii].&lt;/ref&gt; One of them is [[Goldbach's conjecture]], which asserts that every even integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2013}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbLzBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 C1 Goldbach's conjecture, pp. 105–107].&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to &lt;math&gt;n=4\cdot 10^{18}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oliveira e Silva | first1 = Tomás | last2 = Herzog | first2 = Siegfried | last3 = Pardi | first3 = Silvio | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-2013-02787-1 | issue = 288 | journal = [[Mathematics of Computation]] | mr = 3194140 | pages = 2033–2060 | title = Empirical verification of the even Goldbach conjecture and computation of prime gaps up to &lt;math&gt;4\cdot10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; | volume = 83 | year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example, [[Vinogradov's theorem]] says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tao|2009}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NxnVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239 3.1 Structure and randomness in the prime numbers, pp. 239–247]. See especially p.&amp;nbsp;239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chen's theorem]] says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a [[semiprime]], the product of two primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2013}}, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramaré | first = Olivier | issue = 4 | journal = Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa | mr = 1375315 | pages = 645–706 | title = On Šnirel'man's constant | url = https://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASNSP_1995_4_22_4_645_0 | volume = 22 | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of number theory studying such questions is called [[additive number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rassias | first = Michael Th. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-57914-6 | isbn = 978-3-319-57912-2 | location = Cham | mr = 3674356 | page = vii | publisher = Springer | title = Goldbach's Problem: Selected Topics | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ibwpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP6 | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of problem concerns [[prime gap]]s, the differences between consecutive primes.
The existence of arbitrarily large prime gaps can be seen by noting that the sequence &lt;math&gt;n!+2,n!+3,\dots,n!+n&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; composite numbers, for any natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koshy|2002}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-9pg-4Pa19IC&amp;pg=PA109 Theorem 2.14, p. 109]. {{harvnb|Riesel|1994}} gives a similar argument using the [[primorial]] in place of the factorial.&lt;/ref&gt; However, large prime gaps occur much earlier than this argument shows.&lt;ref name="riesel-gaps"/&gt; For example, the first prime gap of length 8 is between the primes 89 and 97,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A100964|name=Smallest prime number that begins a prime gap of at least 2n}}&lt;/ref&gt; much smaller than &lt;math&gt;8!=40320&lt;/math&gt;. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many [[twin prime]]s, pairs of primes with difference 2; this is the [[twin prime conjecture]]. [[Polignac's conjecture]] states more generally that for every positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="rib-gaps"&gt;{{harvnb|Ribenboim|2004}}, Gaps between primes, pp. 186–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

while the much stronger [[Cramér conjecture]] sets the largest gap size at &lt;math&gt;O((\log n)^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="rib-gaps"/&gt;
Prime gaps can be generalized to [[Prime k-tuple|prime &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuples]], patterns in the differences between more than two prime numbers. Their infinitude and density are the subject of the [[first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]], which can be motivated by the [[heuristic]] that the prime numbers behave similarly to a random sequence of numbers with density given by the prime number theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ribenboim|2004}}, Prime &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuples conjecture, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic properties==
[[Analytic number theory]] studies number theory through the lens of [[continuous function]]s, [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], and the related mathematics of the infinite and [[infinitesimal]].

This area of study began with [[Leonhard Euler]] and his first major result, the solution to the [[Basel problem]].
The problem asked for the value of the infinite sum &lt;math&gt;1+\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{1}{9}+\tfrac{1}{16}+\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
which today can be recognized as the value &lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. This function is closely connected to the prime numbers and to one of the most significant unsolved problems in mathematics, the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Euler showed that &lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandifer|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&amp;pg=PA205 Chapter 35, Estimating the Basel problem, pp. 205–208].&lt;/ref&gt;
The reciprocal of this number, &lt;math&gt;6/\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;, is the limiting probability that two random numbers selected uniformly from a large range are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] (have no factors in common).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ogilvy | first1 = C.

The distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the [[prime number theorem]], but no efficient [[formula for primes|formula for the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th prime]] is known.
[[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;p(n) = a + bn&lt;/math&gt;
with relatively prime integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different linear polynomials with the same &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; have approximately the same proportions of primes.
Although conjectures have been formulated about the proportions of primes in higher-degree polynomials, they remain unproven, and it is unknown whether there exists a quadratic polynomial that (for integer arguments) is prime infinitely often.

===Analytical proof of Euclid's theorem===
[[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|Euler's proof that there are infinitely many primes]] considers the sums of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of primes,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 5 + \frac 1 7 + \cdots + \frac 1 p.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler showed that, for any arbitrary [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; for which this sum is bigger than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1976}}, Section 1.6, Theorem 1.13&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that there are infinitely many primes, because if there were finitely many primes the sum would reach its maximum value at the biggest prime rather than growing past every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 
The growth rate of this sum is described more precisely by [[Mertens' theorems|Mertens' second theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1976}}, Section 4.8, Theorem 4.12&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {1^2} + \frac 1 {2^2} + \frac 1 {3^2} + \cdots + \frac 1 {n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

does not grow to infinity as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity (see the [[Basel problem]]). In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers,
although both sets are infinite.&lt;ref name="mtb-invitation"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Invitation to Modern Number Theory|first1=Steven J.|last1=Miller|first2=Ramin|last2=Takloo-Bighash|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780691120607|pages=43–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLz4z8iwKiwC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brun's theorem]] states that the sum of the reciprocals of [[twin prime]]s,

:&lt;math&gt; \left( {\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}} \right) + \left( {\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7}} \right) + \left( {\frac{1}{{11}} + \frac{1}{{13}}} \right) +  \cdots, &lt;/math&gt;
is finite. Because of Brun's theorem, it is not possible to use Euler's method to solve the [[twin prime conjecture]], that there exist infinitely many twin primes.&lt;ref name="mtb-invitation"/&gt;

The [[prime counting function]] &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of primes not greater than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crandall|Pomerance|2005}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RbEz-_D7sAUC&amp;pg=PA6 p.&amp;nbsp;6].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &lt;math&gt;\pi(11)=5&lt;/math&gt;, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. Methods such as the [[Meissel–Lehmer algorithm]] can compute exact values of &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt; faster than it would be possible to list each prime up to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crandall|Pomerance|2005}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXjHKPS1LEAC&amp;pg=PA152 Section 3.7, Counting primes, pp. 152–162].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prime number theorem]] states that &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;n/\log n&lt;/math&gt;, which is denoted as
: &lt;math&gt;\pi(n) \sim \frac{n}{\log n},&lt;/math&gt;
and means that the ratio of &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt; to the right-hand fraction [[convergent sequence|approaches]] 1 as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; grows to infinity.&lt;ref name="cranpom10"&gt;{{harvnb|Crandall|Pomerance|2005}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RbEz-_D7sAUC&amp;pg=PA10 p.&amp;nbsp;10].&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the likelihood that a randomly chosen number less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Number Mysteries: A Mathematical Odyssey through Everyday Life|first=Marcus|last=du Sautoy|authorlink=Marcus du Sautoy|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2011|isbn=9780230120280|pages=50–52|contribution=What are the odds that your telephone number is prime?|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snaUbkIb8SEC&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also implies that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th prime number is proportional to &lt;math&gt;n\log n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1976}}, Section 4.6, Theorem 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arithmetic progressions===
An [[arithmetic progression]] is a finite or infinite sequence of numbers such that consecutive numbers in the sequence all have the same difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algebra|first1=I. M.|last1=Gelfand|author1-link=Israel Gelfand|first2=Alexander|last2=Shen|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9780817636777|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is called the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]] of the progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Number Theory with Applications|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first=Richard A.|last=Mollin|publisher=CRC Press|year=1997|isbn=9780849339875|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fsaa3MUUQYkC&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,
:3, 12, 21, 30, 39, ...,
is an infinite arithmetic progression with modulus 9. In an arithmetic progression, all the numbers have the same remainder when divided by the modulus; in this example, the remainder is 3. Because both the modulus 9 and the remainder 3 are multiples of 3, so is every element in the sequence. Therefore, this progression contains only one prime number, 3 itself. In general, the infinite progression
:&lt;math&gt;a, a+q, a+2q, a+3q, \dots&lt;/math&gt;
can have more than one prime only when its remainder &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and modulus &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime. If they are relatively prime, [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crandall|Pomerance|2005}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXjHKPS1LEAC&amp;pg=PA Theorem 1.1.5, p. 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green–Tao theorem]] shows that there are arbitrarily long finite arithmetic progressions consisting only of primes.&lt;ref name="neale-18-47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Ben|last1=Green|author1-link=Ben J.

The [[Ulam spiral]] arranges the natural numbers in a two-dimensional grid, spiraling in concentric squares surrounding the origin with the prime numbers highlighted.

===Zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis===
{{Main|Riemann hypothesis}}
[[File:Riemann zeta function absolute value.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Plot of the absolute values of the zeta function, showing some of its features|alt=Plot of the absolute values of the zeta function]]
One of the most famous unsolved questions in mathematics, dating from 1859, and one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]], is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], which asks where the [[zero of a function|zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; are located.
This function is an [[analytic function]] on the [[complex number]]s. For complex numbers &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; with real part greater than one it equals both an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] over all integers, and an [[infinite product]] over the prime numbers,
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}=\prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac 1 {1-p^{-s}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equality between a sum and a product, discovered by Euler, is called an [[Euler product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = S.

It leads to another proof that there are infinitely many primes: if there were only finitely many,
then the sum-product equality would also be valid at &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt;, but the sum would diverge (it is the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] &lt;math&gt;1+\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{3}+\dots&lt;/math&gt;) while the product would be finite, a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandifer|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&amp;pg=PA191 pp. 191–193].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Riemann hypothesis states that the [[zero of a function|zeros]] of the zeta-function are all either negative even numbers, or complex numbers with [[real part]] equal to 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borwein|Choi|Rooney|Weirathmueller|2008}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm1aZA-UwX4C&amp;pg=PA15 Conjecture 2.7 (the Riemann hypothesis), p. 15].&lt;/ref&gt;  The original proof of the [[prime number theorem]] was based on a weak form of this hypothesis, that there are no zeros with real part equal to 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1988}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcrw18"&gt;{{harvnb|Borwein|Choi|Rooney|Weirathmueller|2008}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm1aZA-UwX4C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; although other more elementary proofs have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nathanson|2000}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sE7lBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289 Chapter 9, The prime number theorem, pp. 289–324].&lt;/ref&gt;
The prime-counting function can be expressed by [[Riemann's explicit formula]] as a sum in which each term comes from one of the zeros of the zeta function; the main term of this sum is the logarithmic integral, and the remaining terms cause the sum to fluctuate above and below the main term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zagier | first = Don | authorlink = Don Zagier | doi = 10.1007/bf03351556 | issue = S2 | journal = [[The Mathematical Intelligencer]] | pages = 7–19 | title = The first 50 million prime numbers | volume = 1 | year = 1977}} See especially pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this sense, the zeros control how regularly the prime numbers are distributed. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, these fluctuations will be small, and the
[[asymptotic distribution]] of primes given by the prime number theorem will also hold over much shorter intervals (of length about the square root of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for intervals near a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="bcrw18"/&gt;

==Abstract algebra==

===Modular arithmetic and finite fields===
{{Main|Modular arithmetic}}
Modular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt;, for a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; called the modulus.
Any other natural number can be mapped into this system by replacing it by its remainder after division by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kraft|Washington|2014}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VG9YBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 Proposition 5.3], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modular sums, differences and products are calculated by performing the same replacement by the remainder
on the result of the usual sum, difference, or product of integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algebra in Action: A Course in Groups, Rings, and Fields|volume=27|series=Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts|first=Shahriar|last=Shahriari|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2017|isbn=9781470428495|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJwxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of integers corresponds to ''congruence'' in modular arithmetic:
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are congruent (written &lt;math&gt;x\equiv y&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) when they have the same remainder after division by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1978}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tr7SzBTsk1UC&amp;pg=PA28 Theorem 3, p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this system of numbers, [[Division (mathematics)|division]] by all nonzero numbers is possible if and only if the modulus is prime. For instance, with the prime number &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt; as modulus, division by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is possible: &lt;math&gt;2/3\equiv 3\bmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;, because [[clearing denominators]] by multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; gives the  valid formula &lt;math&gt;2\equiv 9\bmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;. However, with the composite modulus &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt;, division by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is impossible. There is no valid solution to &lt;math&gt;2/3\equiv x\bmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;: clearing denominators by multiplying by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; causes the left-hand side to become &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; while the right-hand side becomes either &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.
In the terminology of [[abstract algebra]], the ability to perform division means that modular arithmetic modulo a prime number forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]] or, more specifically, a [[finite field]], while other moduli only give a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] but not a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahriari|2017}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GJwxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 pp. 27–28].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theorems about primes can be formulated using modular arithmetic. For instance, [[Fermat's little theorem]] states that if
&lt;math&gt;a\not\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; (mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1}\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt; (mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ribenboim|2004}}, Fermat's little theorem and primitive roots modulo a prime, pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt;
Summing this over all choices of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; gives the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} a^{p-1} \equiv (p-1) \cdot 1 \equiv -1 \pmod p,&lt;/math&gt;
valid whenever &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime.
[[Giuga's conjecture]] says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to be prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ribenboim|2004}}, The property of Giuga, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Wilson's theorem]] says that an integer &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is prime if and only if the [[factorial]] &lt;math&gt;(p-1)!&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. For a composite {{nowrap|number &lt;math&gt;\;n = r\cdot s\; &lt;/math&gt;}} this cannot hold, since one of its factors divides both {{mvar|n}} and &lt;math&gt;(n-1)!&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;(n-1)!\equiv -1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ribenboim|2004}}, The theorem of Wilson, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''p''-adic numbers===
{{main|p-adic number}}
The [[p-adic order|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic order]] &lt;math&gt;\nu_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; of an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of copies of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in the prime factorization of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The same concept can be extended from integers to rational numbers by defining the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic order of a fraction &lt;math&gt;m/n&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\nu_p(m)-\nu_p(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic absolute value &lt;math&gt;|q|_p&lt;/math&gt; of any rational number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is then defined as
&lt;math&gt;|q|_p=p^{-\nu_p(q)}&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying an integer by its &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic absolute value cancels out the factors of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in its factorization, leaving only the other primes. Just as the distance between two real numbers can be measured by the absolute value of their distance, the distance between two rational numbers can be measured by their &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic distance, the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic absolute value of their difference. For this definition of distance, two numbers are close together (they have a small distance) when their difference is divisible by a high power of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way that the real numbers can be formed from the rational numbers and their distances, by adding extra limiting values to form a [[complete field]], the rational numbers with the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic distance can be extended to a different complete field, the [[p-adic number|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic numbers]].&lt;ref name="childress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Marty | last2 = Vazzana | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Garth | first3 = David | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-1-4987-1749-6 | mr = 3468748 | page = 200 | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | series = Textbooks in Mathematics | title = Introduction to Number Theory | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QpLwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200 | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This picture of an order, absolute value, and complete field derived from them can be generalized to [[algebraic number field]]s and their [[Valuation (algebra)|valuations]] (certain mappings from the [[multiplicative group]] of the field to a [[totally ordered group|totally ordered additive group]], also called orders), [[Absolute value (algebra)|absolute values]] (certain multiplicative mappings from the field to the real numbers, also called norms),&lt;ref name="childress"&gt;{{citation | last = Childress | first = Nancy | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-72490-4 | isbn = 978-0-387-72489-8 | mr = 2462595 | pages = 8–11 | publisher = Springer, New York | series = Universitext | title = Class Field Theory | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RYdy4PCJYosC&amp;pg=PA8 | year = 2009 | ref = harv}} See also p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and places (extensions to [[complete field]]s in which the given field is a [[dense set]], also called completions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weil | first = André | authorlink = André Weil | isbn = 3-540-58655-5 | mr = 1344916 | page = 43 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | series = Classics in Mathematics | title = Basic Number Theory | year = 1995}} Note however that some authors such as {{harvtxt|Childress|2009}} instead use "place" to mean an equivalence class of norms.&lt;/ref&gt; The extension from the rational numbers to the [[real number]]s, for instance, is a place in which the distance between numbers is the usual [[absolute value]] of their difference.

===Prime elements in rings===
{{Main|Prime element|Irreducible element}}
[[File:Gaussian primes.png|thumb|The [[Gaussian prime]]s with norm less than 500]]
A [[commutative ring]] is an [[algebraic structure]] where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined. The integers are a ring, and the prime numbers in the integers have been generalized to rings in two different ways, ''prime elements'' and ''irreducible elements''. An element &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called prime if it is nonzero, has no [[multiplicative inverse]] (that is, it is not a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]]), and satisfies the following requirement: whenever &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides the product &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; of two elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, it also divides at least one of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. An element is irreducible if it is neither a unit nor the product of two other non-unit elements. In the ring of integers, the prime and irreducible elements form the same set,
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \dots, -11, -7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots \}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
In an arbitrary ring, all prime elements are irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for [[unique factorization domain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lauritzen | first = Niels | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511804229 | isbn = 0-521-53410-0 | location = Cambridge | mr = 2014325 | page = 127 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | title = Concrete Abstract Algebra: From numbers to Gröbner bases | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BdAbcje-TZUC&amp;pg=PA127 | year = 2003 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold (by definition) in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the [[Gaussian integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of [[complex number]]s of the form &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[imaginary unit]] and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as [[Gaussian prime]]s. Not every number that is prime among the integers remains prime in the Gaussian integers; for instance, the number 2 can be written as a product of the two Gaussian primes &lt;math&gt;1+i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-i&lt;/math&gt;. Rational primes (the prime elements in the integers) congruent to 3 mod 4 are Gaussian primes, but rational primes congruent to 1 mod 4 are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lauritzen|2003}}, Corollary 3.5.14, p. 133; Lemma 3.5.18, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a consequence of [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]],
which states that an odd prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is expressible as the sum of two squares, &lt;math&gt;p=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore factorizable as &lt;math&gt;p=(x+iy)(x-iy)&lt;/math&gt;, exactly when &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is 1 mod 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraft|Washington|2014}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4NAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 Section 12.1, Sums of two squares, pp. 297–301].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime ideals===
{{Main|Prime ideals}}
Not every ring is a unique factorization domain. For instance, in the ring of numbers &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{-5}&lt;/math&gt; (for integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) the number &lt;math&gt;21&lt;/math&gt; has two factorizations &lt;math&gt;21=3\cdot7=(1+2\sqrt{-5})(1-2\sqrt{-5})&lt;/math&gt;, where neither of the four factors can be reduced any further, so it does not have a unique factorization. In order to extend unique factorization to a larger class of rings, the notion of a number can be replaced with that of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], a subset of the elements of a ring that contains all sums of pairs of its elements, and all products of its elements with ring elements.
''Prime ideals'', which generalize prime elements in the sense that the [[principal ideal]] generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in [[commutative algebra]], [[number theory|algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]], which expresses every ideal in a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[commutative ring]] as an intersection of [[primary ideal]]s, which are the appropriate generalizations of [[prime power]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Eisenbud | first1=David | author1-link= David Eisenbud | title=Commutative Algebra | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94268-1| mr=1322960 | year=1995 | volume=150 | at=Section 3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[spectrum of a ring]] is a geometric space whose points are the prime ideals of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shafarevich | first = Igor R. | authorlink = Igor Shafarevich | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-38010-5 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 978-3-642-38009-9 | mr = 3100288 | publisher = Springer, Heidelberg | title = Basic Algebraic Geometry 2: Schemes and Complex Manifolds | year = 2013 | contribution = Definition of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt; | page = 5 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zDW8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arithmetic geometry]] also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|ramification]] of prime ideals when lifted to an [[field extension|extension field]], a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with [[ramified cover|ramification in geometry]]. These concepts can even assist with in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the [[ring of integers]] of [[quadratic number field]]s can be used in proving [[quadratic reciprocity]], a statement that concerns the existence of square roots modulo integer prime numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neukirch | first = Jürgen | authorlink = Jürgen Neukirch | doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-03983-0 | isbn = 3-540-65399-6 | location = Berlin | mr = 1697859 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | series = Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences] | title = Algebraic Number Theory | volume = 322 | year = 1999 | ref = harv | at = Section I.8, p. 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] led to [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]'s introduction of [[regular prime]]s, integer prime numbers connected with the failure of unique factorization in the [[cyclotomic field|cyclotomic integers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neukirch|1999}}, Section I.7, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
The question of how many integer prime numbers factor into a product of multiple prime ideals in an algebraic number field is addressed by [[Chebotarev's density theorem]], which (when applied to the cyclotomic integers) has Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions as a special case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stevenhagen | first1 = P. | last2 = Lenstra | first2 = H. W., Jr. | author2-link = Hendrik Lenstra | doi = 10.1007/BF03027290 | issue = 2 | journal = [[The Mathematical Intelligencer]] | mr = 1395088 | pages = 26–37 | title = Chebotarëv and his density theorem | volume = 18 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group theory===
In the theory of [[finite group]]s the [[Sylow theorems]] imply that, if a power of a prime number &lt;math&gt;p^n&lt;/math&gt; divides the [[order of a group|order]] of a group, then it has a subgroup of order &lt;math&gt;p^n&lt;/math&gt;. By [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], any group of prime order is a [[cyclic group]],
and by the [[Burnside theorem]] any group whose order is divisible by only two primes is [[solvable group|solvable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory of Groups|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Marshall|last=Hall|authorlink=Marshall Hall (mathematician)|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2018|isbn=9780486816906|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8hEDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}} For the Sylow theorems see p. 43; for Lagrange's theorem, see p. 12; for the Burnside theorem see p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational methods==
[[File:Gears large.jpg|thumb|The small gear in this piece of farm equipment has 13 teeth, a prime number, and the middle gear has 21, relatively prime to 13]]
For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of mathematics{{efn|name="pure"}} with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Round is Your Circle?: Where Engineering and Mathematics Meet|first1=John|last1=Bryant|first2=Christopher J.|last2=Sangwin|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780691131184|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIN_2WjBH1cC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, number theorists such as [[United Kingdom|British]] mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[A Mathematician's Apology]]|last1=Hardy|first1=Godfrey Harold|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-521-42706-7|location=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EkY2im6xkVkC&amp;pg=PA140 140]|pages=|oclc=922010634|quote=No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.|author1-link=G. H. Hardy|orig-year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision of the purity of number theory was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of [[public key cryptography]] algorithms.&lt;ref name="ent-7"/&gt;
These applications have led to significant study of [[algorithm]]s for computing with prime numbers, and in particular of [[primality test]]ing, methods for determining whether a given number is prime.
The most basic primality testing routine, trial division, is too slow to be useful for large numbers. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for numbers of special types. Most primality tests only tell whether their argument is prime or not. Routines that also provide a prime factor of composite arguments (or all of its prime factors) are called [[integer factorization|factorization]] algorithms.
Prime numbers are also used in computing for [[checksum]]s, [[hash table]]s, and [[pseudorandom number generator]]s.

===Trial division===
{{main|Trial division}}
The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is called ''[[trial division]]''. This method divides &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by each integer from 2 up to the [[square root]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Any such integer dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; evenly establishes &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as composite; otherwise it is prime.
Integers larger than the square root do not need to be checked because, whenever &lt;math&gt;n = a\cdot b&lt;/math&gt;, one of the two factors &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to the [[square root]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Another optimization is to check only primes as factors in this range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Primes and Programming|first=P. J.|last=Giblin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=9780521409889|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbEOBIlZYUC&amp;pg=PA39|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, to check whether 37 is prime, this method divides it by the primes in the range from 2 to {{radic|37}}, which are 2, 3, and 5. Each division produces a nonzero remainder, so 37 is indeed prime.

Although this method is simple to describe, it is impractical for testing the primality of large integers, because the number of tests that it performs [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]] as a function of the number of digits of these integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giblin|1993}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbEOBIlZYUC&amp;pg=PA54 p.&amp;nbsp;54]&lt;/ref&gt; However, trial division is still used, with a smaller limit than the square root on the divisor size, to quickly discover composite numbers with small factors, before using more complicated methods on the numbers that pass this filter.&lt;ref name="p. 220"&gt;{{harvnb|Riesel|1994}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITvaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p.&amp;nbsp;220].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sieves===
[[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|frame|The [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] starts with all numbers unmarked (gray). It repeatedly finds the first unmarked number, marks it as prime (dark colors) and marks its square and all later multiples as composite (lighter colors). After marking the multiples of 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (blue), and 7 (yellow), all primes up to the square root of the table size have been processed, and all remaining unmarked numbers (11, 13, etc.) are marked as primes (magenta).|alt=Animation of the sieve of Eratosthenes]]

{{main|Sieve of Eratosthenes}}
Before computers, [[mathematical table]]s listing all of the primes or prime factorizations up to a given limit were commonly printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maarten|last=Bullynck|title=A history of factor tables with notes on the birth of number theory 1657–1817|journal=Revue d'Histoire des Mathématiques|year=2010|pages=133–216|volume=16|issue=2|url=https://hal-univ-paris8.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01103903/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest method for generating a list of primes is called the sieve of Eratosthenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Joy of Factoring|volume=68|series=Student mathematical library|first=Samuel S.

Another more efficient sieving method for the same problem is the [[sieve of Atkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Farach-Colton | first1 = Martín | author1-link = Martin Farach-Colton | last2 = Tsai | first2 = Meng-Tsung | editor1-last = Elbassioni | editor1-first = Khaled | editor2-last = Makino | editor2-first = Kazuhisa | arxiv = 1504.05240 | contribution = On the complexity of computing prime tables | doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-48971-0_57 | pages = 677–688 | publisher = Springer | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | title = Algorithms and Computation: 26th International Symposium, ISAAC 2015, Nagoya, Japan, December 9-11, 2015, Proceedings | volume = 9472 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advanced mathematics, [[sieve theory]] applies similar methods to other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sieves in Number Theory|volume=43|series=Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete (3.

===Primality testing versus primality proving===
Some of the fastest modern tests for whether an arbitrary given number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is prime are [[probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] (or [[Monte Carlo algorithm|Monte Carlo]]) algorithms, meaning that they have a small random chance of producing an incorrect answer.&lt;ref name="hromkovic"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hromkovič | first = Juraj | authorlink = Juraj Hromkovič | contribution = 5.5 Bibliographic Remarks | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nkeqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-04616-6 | isbn = 3-540-66860-8 | mr = 1843669 | pages = 383–385 | publisher = Springer-Verlag, Berlin | series = Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series | title = Algorithmics for Hard Problems | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance the [[Solovay–Strassen primality test]] on a given number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; chooses a number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; randomly from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p-1&lt;/math&gt; and uses [[modular exponentiation]] to check
whether &lt;math&gt;a^{(p-1)/2}\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.{{efn|In this test, the &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; term is negative if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a square modulo the given (supposed) prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and positive otherwise. More generally, for non-prime values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; term is the (negated)
 [[Jacobi symbol]], which can be calculated using [[quadratic reciprocity]].}} If so, it answers yes and otherwise it answers no. If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; really is prime, it will always answer yes, but if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is composite then it answers yes with probability at most 1/2 and no with probability at least 1/2.&lt;ref name="koblitz"/&gt;
If this test is repeated &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times on the same number,
the probability that a composite number could pass the test every time is at most &lt;math&gt;1/2^n&lt;/math&gt;. Because this decreases exponentially with the number of tests, it provides high confidence (although not certainty) that a number that passes the repeated test is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then the number is certainly composite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Computer Security | first1 = Josef | last1 = Pieprzyk | first2 = Thomas | last2 = Hardjono | first3 = Jennifer | last3 = Seberry | author3-link =  Jennifer Seberry | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | isbn = 9783662073247 | contribution = 2.3.9 Probabilistic Computations | pages = 51–52 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BG2rCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A composite number that passes such a test is called a [[pseudoprime]].&lt;ref name="koblitz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Koblitz | first = Neal | authorlink = Neal Koblitz | contribution = Chapter V. Primality and Factoring | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4684-0310-7_5 | isbn = 0-387-96576-9 | mr = 910297 | pages = 112–149 | publisher = Springer-Verlag, New York | series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics | title = A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography | volume = 114 | year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some other algorithms guarantee that their answer will always be correct: primes will always be determined to be prime and composites will always be determined to be composite.
For instance, this is true of trial division.
The algorithms with guaranteed-correct output include both [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] (non-random) algorithms, such as the [[AKS primality test]],&lt;ref name="tao-aks"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tao | first = Terence | authorlink = Terence Tao | contribution = 1.11 The AKS primality test | contribution-url = https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/the-aks-primality-test/ | doi = 10.1090/gsm/117 | isbn = 978-0-8218-5280-4 | location = Providence, RI | mr = 2780010 | pages = 82–86 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | title = An epsilon of room, II: Pages from year three of a mathematical blog | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and randomized [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s where the random choices made by the algorithm do not affect its final answer, such as some variations of [[elliptic curve primality proving]].&lt;ref name="hromkovic"/&gt;
The elliptic curve primality test is the fastest in practice of the guaranteed-correct primality tests, but its runtime analysis is based on [[heuristic argument]]s rather than rigorous proofs. The [[AKS primality test]] has mathematically proven time complexity, but is slower than elliptic curve primality proving in practice.&lt;ref name="morain"/&gt; These methods can be used to generate large random prime numbers, by generating and testing random numbers until finding one that is prime;
when doing this, a faster probabilistic test can quickly eliminate most composite numbers before a guaranteed-correct algorithm is used to verify that the remaining numbers are prime.{{efn|Indeed, much of the analysis of elliptic curve primality proving is based on the assumption that the input to the algorithm has already passed a probabilistic test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atkin | first1 = A. O. L. | author1-link = A. O. L.

The following table lists some of these tests. Their running time is given in terms of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of tests performed. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the [[logarithm]] to an unspecified base. The [[big O notation]] means that each time bound should be multiplied by a [[constant factor]] to convert it from dimensionless units to units of time; this factor depends on implementation details such as the type of computer used to run the algorithm, but not on the input parameters &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

===Special-purpose algorithms and the largest known prime===
{{Further|List of prime numbers}}
In addition to the aforementioned tests that apply to any natural number, some numbers of a special form can be tested for primality more quickly.
For example, the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] can determine whether a [[Mersenne number]] (one less than a [[power of two]]) is prime, deterministically,
in the same time as a single iteration of the Miller–Rabin test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tao | first = Terence | author-link = Terence Tao | contribution = 1.7 The Lucas–Lehmer test for Mersenne primes | contribution-url = https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/10/02/the-lucas-lehmer-test-for-mersenne-primes/ | isbn = 978-0-8218-4883-8 | location = Providence, RI | mr = 2523047 | pages = 36–41 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | title = Poincaré's legacies, pages from year two of a mathematical blog.

It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.&lt;ref&gt;For instance see {{harvnb|Guy|2013}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BnoBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 A3 Mersenne primes. Repunits. Fermat numbers. Primes of shape &lt;math&gt;k\cdot 2^n+1&lt;/math&gt;. pp. 13–21].&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table gives the largest known primes of various types. Some of these primes have been found using [[distributed computing]]. In 2009, the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0  | title= Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize | date= October 14, 2009 | publisher= Electronic Frontier Foundation | accessdate= 2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url= https://www.eff.org/awards/coop | title= EFF Cooperative Computing Awards | date= | publisher= Electronic Frontier Foundation | accessdate= 2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integer factorization===
{{main|Integer factorization}}
Given a composite integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the task of providing one (or all) prime factors is referred to as ''factorization'' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. It is significantly more difficult than primality testing,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraft|Washington|2014}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4NAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275 p.&amp;nbsp;275].&lt;/ref&gt; and although many factorization algorithms are known, they are slower than the fastest primality testing methods. Trial division and [[Pollard's rho algorithm]] can be used to find very small factors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="p. 220"/&gt; and [[elliptic curve factorization]] can be effective when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has factors of moderate size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|first1=Jeffrey|last1=Hoffstein|first2=Jill|last2=Pipher|author2-link=Jill Pipher|first3=Joseph H.|last3=Silverman|author3-link=Joseph H.

As with primality testing, there are also factorization algorithms that require their input to have a special form, including the [[special number field sieve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pomerance | first = Carl | authorlink = Carl Pomerance | issue = 12 | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | mr = 1416721 | pages = 1473–1485 | title = A tale of two sieves | volume = 43 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|01}} the [[Integer factorization records|largest number known to have been factored]] by a general-purpose algorithm is [[RSA-768]], which has 232 decimal digits (768 bits) and is the product of two large primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf|accessdate=2013-04-11 |title=Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus|first1=T.|last1=Kleinjung |first2=K.|last2=Aoki |first3=J.|last3=Franke|author3-link=Jens Franke|first4=A.

[[Shor's algorithm]] can factor any integer in a polynomial number of steps on a [[quantum computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction|first1=Eleanor G.|last1=Rieffel|author1-link=Eleanor Rieffel|first2=Wolfgang H.|last2=Polak|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=9780262015066|contribution=Chapter 8.

===Other computational applications===
Several [[public-key cryptography]] algorithms, such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]], are based on large prime numbers (2048-[[bit]] primes are common).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/09/crypto_needs_more_transparency_researchers_warn/|title=Crypto needs more transparency, researchers warn|first=Richard|last=Chirgwin|date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (that is, more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; than to calculate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (assumed [[coprime]]) if only the product &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is known.&lt;ref name="ent-7"/&gt; The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for [[modular exponentiation]] (computing &lt;math&gt;a^b\bmod{c}&lt;/math&gt;), while the reverse operation (the [[discrete logarithm]]) is thought to be a hard problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffstein|Pipher|Silverman|2014}}, Section 2.3, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime numbers are frequently used for [[hash table]]s. For instance the original method of Carter and Wegman for [[universal hashing]] was based on computing [[hash function]]s by choosing random [[linear function]]s modulo large prime numbers. Carter and Wegman generalized this method to [[k-independent hashing|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-independent hashing]] by using higher-degree polynomials, again modulo large primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=2|chapter=11.3 Universal hashing|pages=232–236}} For &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-independent hashing see problem 11–4, p. 251. For the credit to Carter and Wegman, see the chapter notes, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as in the hash function, prime numbers are used for the hash table size in [[quadratic probing]] based hash tables to ensure that the probe sequence covers the whole table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Java|edition=4th|first1=Michael T.|last1=Goodrich|author1-link=Michael T.

Some [[checksum]] methods are based on the mathematics of prime numbers. For instance the checksums used in [[International Standard Book Number]]s are defined by taking the rest of the number modulo 11, a prime number. Because 11 is prime this method can detect both single-digit errors and transpositions of adjacent digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Identification Numbers and Check Digit Schemes|volume=18|series=Classroom Resource Materials|first=Joseph|last=Kirtland|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2001|isbn=9780883857205|pages=43–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8eka35WUb8C&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another checksum method, [[Adler-32]], uses arithmetic modulo 65521, the largest prime number less than &lt;math&gt;2^{16}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt|title=ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3|last=Deutsch|first=P.|publisher=Network Working Group|year=1996|isbn=|series=[[Request for Comments]]|volume=1950|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prime numbers are also used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s including [[linear congruential generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Vol. 2: Seminumerical algorithms|edition=3rd|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1998|contribution=3.2.1 The linear congruential model|pages=10–26|isbn=978-0-201-89684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mersenne Twister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matsumoto | first1 = Makoto | last2 = Nishimura | first2 = Takuji | doi = 10.1145/272991.272995 | issue = 1 | journal = ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation | pages = 3–30 | title = Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudo-random number generator | volume = 8 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime numbers are of central importance to number theory but also have many applications to other areas within mathematics, including [[abstract algebra]] and elementary geometry. For example, it is possible to place prime numbers of points in a two-dimensional grid so that [[no-three-in-line problem|no three are in a line]], or so that every triangle formed by three of the points [[Heilbronn triangle problem|has large area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roth | first = K.

[[File:Sum_of_knots3.svg|thumb|The connected sum of two prime knots]]
The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the [[prime field]] of a given field is its smallest subfield that contains both 0 and 1. It is either the field of rational numbers or a [[finite field]] with a prime number of elements, whence the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lang | first1=Serge | author1-link=Serge Lang | title=Algebra | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-95385-4 | mr=1878556 | year=2002 | volume=211}}, Section II.1, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in [[knot theory]], a [[prime knot]] is a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the [[connected sum]] of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first= Horst|title=Die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit eines Knotens in Primknoten|journal=S.-B Heidelberger Akad.

Beyond mathematics and computing, prime numbers have potential connections to [[quantum mechanic]]s, and have been used metaphorically in the arts and literature.  They have also been used in [[evolutionary biology]] to explain the life cycles of [[cicada]]s.

Beginning with the work of [[Hugh Lowell Montgomery|Hugh Montgomery]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] in the 1970s, mathematicians and physicists have speculated that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are connected to the energy levels of [[quantum system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ivars|last=Peterson|authorlink=Ivars Peterson |work=MAA Online |url=http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_6_28_99.html |title=The Return of Zeta |date=June 28, 1999 |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020141624/http://maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_6_28_99.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Hayes (scientist)|date=2003|title=Computing science: The spectrum of Riemannium|jstor=27858239|journal=[[American Scientist]]|volume=91|issue=4|pages=296–300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime numbers are also significant in [[quantum information science]], thanks to mathematical structures such as [[mutually unbiased bases]] and [[SIC-POVM|symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967938939|title=Geometry of quantum states : an introduction to quantum entanglement|last=Bengtsson|first=Ingemar|last2=Życzkowski|first2=Karol|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|others=|year=2017|isbn=9781107026254|edition=Second|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=313&amp;ndash;354|oclc=967938939|author-link2=Karol Życzkowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Huangjun|date=|title=SIC POVMs and Clifford groups in prime dimensions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1751-8121/43/i=30/a=305305?key=crossref.45cb006b9f3c7e510461594ea8dfa7f7|journal=[[Journal of Physics A]]: Mathematical and Theoretical|volume=43|issue=30|pages=|arxiv=1003.3591|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/43/30/305305|via=|bibcode=2010JPhA...43D5305Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
The evolutionary strategy used by [[cicada]]s of the genus ''[[Magicicada]]'' makes use of prime numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goles |first=E. |last2=Schulz |first2=O. |first3=M. |last3=Markus |year=2001 |title=Prime number selection of cycles in a predator-prey model |journal=[[Complexity (journal)|Complexity]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=33–38 |doi=10.1002/cplx.1040 |bibcode=2001Cmplx...6d..33G }}&lt;/ref&gt; These insects spend most of their lives as [[larva|grubs]] underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. Biologists theorize that these prime-numbered breeding cycle lengths have evolved in order to prevent predators from synchronizing with these cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paulo R.

In contrast, the multi-year periods between flowering in [[bamboo]] plants are hypothesized to be [[smooth number]]s, having only small prime numbers in their factorizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Zimmer|first1=Carl|author-link=Carl Zimmer|date=May 15, 2015|title=Bamboo Mathematicians|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/15/bamboo-mathematicians/|department=Phenomena: The Loom|magazine=[[National Geographic]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and literature===
Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers.
The French [[composer]] [[Olivier Messiaen]] used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena". In works such as ''[[La Nativité du Seigneur]]'' (1935) and ''[[Quatre études de rythme]]'' (1949–50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47  and 53 appear in the third étude, "Neumes rythmiques". According to Messiaen this way of composing was "inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Hill | editor1-first=Peter Jensen | title=The Messiaen companion | publisher=Amadeus Press | location=Portland, Or | isbn=978-0-931340-95-6 | year=1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7ag3ymWqvfgC&amp;pg=PT225 | at = Ex. 13.2 ''Messe de la Pentecôte'' 1 'Entrée'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', scientist [[Carl Sagan]] suggested that prime factorization could be used as a means of establishing two-dimensional image planes in communications with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer [[Frank Drake]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pomerance | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Pomerance | editor1-last = Hayes | editor1-first = David F. | editor2-last = Ross | editor2-first = Peter | contribution = Prime Numbers and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence | contribution-url = https://gauss.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/extraterrestrial.pdf | isbn = 0-88385-548-8 | location = Washington, DC | mr = 2085842 | pages = 3–6 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | series = MAA Spectrum | title = Mathematical Adventures for Students and Amateurs | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]], the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers as a way to convey the mental state of its main character, a mathematically gifted teen with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/sep/16/curious-incident-dog-night-time|title=The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time|author=GrrlScientist|first=|date=September 16, 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=February 22, 2010|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|department=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the [[Paolo Giordano]] novel ''[[The Solitude of Prime Numbers (novel)|The Solitude of Prime Numbers]]'', in which they are portrayed as "outsiders" among integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Counting on Each Other|first=Liesl|last=Schillinger|date=April 9, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schillinger-t.html|department=Sunday Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Principles and Standards for School Mathematics''''' ('''''PSSM''''') are guidelines produced by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) in 2000, setting forth recommendations for mathematics educators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctm.org/about/content.aspx?id=210&lt;/ref&gt; They form a national vision for preschool through twelfth grade [[mathematics education]] in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]].  It is the primary model for [[Reform mathematics|standards-based mathematics]].

The NCTM employed a consensus process that involved classroom teachers, [[mathematician]]s, and educational researchers. The resulting document sets forth a set of six principles (Equity, Curriculum, Teaching, Learning, Assessment, and Technology) that describe NCTM's recommended framework for mathematics programs, and ten general strands or standards that cut across the school mathematics curriculum.  These strands are divided into mathematics content (Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability) and processes (Problem Solving, Reasoning and Proof, Communication, Connections, and Representation).  Specific expectations for student learning are described for ranges of [[Educational stages#United States and Canada|grade]]s ([[preschool]] to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 8, and 9 to 12).

== Origins ==
The ''Principles and Standards for School Mathematics'' was developed by the NCTM. The NCTM's stated intent was to improve mathematics education.  The contents were based on surveys of existing curriculum materials, curricula and policies from many countries, educational research publications, and government agencies such as the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="titlePrinciples and Standards - Standards 2000 Project" /&gt;  The original draft was widely reviewed at the end of 1998 and revised in response to hundreds of suggestions from teachers.

The ''PSSM'' is intended to be "a single resource that can be used to improve mathematics curricula, teaching, and assessment."&lt;ref name="titlePrinciples and Standards - Standards 2000 Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/prepost/project.htm |title=Principles and Standards - Standards 2000 Project |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest update was published in 2000. The ''PSSM'' is available as a book, and in hypertext format on the NCTM web site.

The ''PSSM'' replaces three prior publications by NCTM:&lt;ref name="titlePrinciples and Standards - Standards 2000 Project" /&gt; 
* ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics'' (1989), which was the first such publication by an independent professional organization instead of a government agency and outlined what students should learn and how to measure their learning.
* ''Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics'' (1991), which added information about best practices for teaching mathematics. 
* ''Assessment Standards for School Mathematics'' (1995), which focused on the use of accurate assessment methods.

== Six principles ==
*'''Equity''':  The NCTM standards for equity, as outlined in the ''PSSM'', encourage equal access to mathematics for all students, "especially students who are poor, not native speakers of English, disabled, female, or members of minority groups."&lt;ref name="titleThe Equity Principle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter2/equity.htm |title=The Equity Principle |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''PSSM'' makes explicit the goal that all students should learn higher level mathematics, particularly underserved groups such as minorities and women.  This principle encourages provision of extra help to students who are struggling and advocates high expectations and excellent teaching for all students.&lt;ref name="titleThe Equity Principle"/&gt;
*'''Curriculum:'''  In the ''PSSM''{{'}}s curriculum section, the NCTM promotes a "coherent" curriculum, in which an orderly and logical progression increases students' understanding of mathematics and avoids wasting time with unnecessary repetition.&lt;ref name="titleThe Curriculum Principle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter2/curric.htm |title=The Curriculum Principle |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They acknowledge that the relative importance of some specific topics changes over time.&lt;ref name="titleThe Curriculum Principle"/&gt;  For example, a basic understanding of [[iteration]] is important to students who are learning computer programming, and is almost absent from 19th century textbooks.  Similarly, older American math textbooks included lessons that are no longer considered important, such as rules for calculating the number of [[bushel]]s of [[hay]] that could be stored in a bin of stated dimensions, because this skill was useful to [[farmer]]s at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Raub, Albert N.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk2xQJaz5pAC Complete Arithmetic.]''  Porter and Coates, 1877.  See "Measurements of grain and hay" on page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCTM proposes that mathematics taught in modern classrooms be the skills that are most important to the students' lives and careers.
*'''Teaching:'''  In the ''PSSM'', the NCTM promotes sound teaching methods, without prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach.&lt;ref name="titleThe Teaching Principle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter2/teach.htm |title=The Teaching Principle |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCTM wants teachers to be able to use their professional judgment in choosing teaching techniques. They favor professional development opportunities in both mathematics (content) and in effective teaching techniques (methods).
*'''Learning:'''  According to the ''PSSM'', a combination of "factual knowledge, procedural facility, and conceptual understanding" is necessary for students to use mathematics.&lt;ref name="titleThe Learning Principle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter2/learn.htm |title=The Learning Principle |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While they state that "learning the 'basics' is important",&lt;ref name="titleThe Learning Principle"/&gt; the NCTM does not consider [[rote learning|the most simplistic forms of memorization by repetition]] to be ''sufficient'' achievement in mathematics.  A good student not only understands how and when to use facts, procedures, and concepts, but he or she also wants to figure things out and perseveres in the face of challenge.  The NCTM particularly deprecates attitudes in schools that suggest only certain students are capable of mastering math.
*'''Assessment'''
*'''Technology'''

== Standards ==
Ten general strands or standards of mathematics content and processes were defined that cut across the school mathematics curriculum.  Specific expectations for student learning, derived from the philosophy of [[outcome-based education]], are described for ranges of [[educational stages|grade]]s ([[preschool]] to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 8, and 9 to 12).  These standards were made an integral part of nearly all outcome-based education and later [[standards-based education reform]] programs that were widely adopted across the United States.{{Citation needed|reason="Widely needs to be justified by a statistic; is this at the state level or the school level?"|date=August 2013}}

=== Content standards ===
* '''Number and Operations:'''  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard.  All students must be taught to "understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; [and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Number and Operations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter3/numb.htm |title=Standards for School Mathematics: Number and Operations |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Number and Operations"/&gt;
* '''Algebra:'''  The ''PSSM'' names four skills related to algebra that should be taught to all students:  to "understand patterns, relations, and functions; represent and analyze mathematical situations and structures using algebraic symbols; use mathematical models to represent and understand quantitative relationships; [and] analyze change in various contexts."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Algebra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter3/alg.htm |title=Standards for School Mathematics: Algebra |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very simple algebra skills are often taught to young children.  For example, a student might convert an addition equation such as 19&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;? into a simpler equation, 20&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;14&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;? for easy calculation.  Formally, this is described in algebraic notation like this: (19&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(15&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'', but even a young student might use this technique without calling it algebra.  The PSSM recommends that all students complete pre-algebra coursework by the end of eighth grade and take an algebra class during high school.&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Algebra"/&gt;
* '''Geometry:'''  The overall goals for learning geometry are to "analyze characteristics and properties of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes and develop mathematical arguments about geometric relationships; specify locations and describe spatial relationships using coordinate geometry and other representational systems; apply transformations and use symmetry to analyze mathematical situations; [and] use visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric modeling to solve problems."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Geometry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter3/geom.htm |title=Standards for School Mathematics: Geometry |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project.  Teaching should be appropriate to students' developmental level: Young students should be able to explain the difference between a [[rectangle]] and a [[square (geometry)|square]], while older students should be able to express more complex reasoning, including simple [[mathematical proof]]s.&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Geometry"/&gt; (See [[van Hiele model]].) The ''PSSM'' promotes the appropriate use of physical objects, drawings, and computer software for teaching geometry.&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Geometry"/&gt;
* '''Measurement:'''  Measurement skills have many practical applications, as well as providing opportunities for advancing mathematical understand and for practicing other mathematical skills, especially number operations (e.g., addition or subtraction) and geometry.  Students should "understand measurable attributes of objects and the units, systems, and processes of measurement; [and] apply appropriate techniques, tools, and formulas to determine measurements."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Measurement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter3/meas.htm |title=Standards for School Mathematics: Measurement |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike more abstract skills, the practical importance of measurement is readily apparent to students and parents.
* '''Data analysis and probability:'''  The ''PSSM'' says that all students should learn to "formulate questions that can be addressed with data and collect, organize, and display relevant data to answer them; select and use appropriate statistical methods to analyze data; develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are based on data; [and] understand and apply basic concepts of probability."&lt;ref name="titleStandards for School Mathematics: Data Analysis and Probability"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter3/data.htm |title=Standards for School Mathematics: Data Analysis and Probability |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These skills allow students to make sense of critical information, such as medical statistics and the results of political surveys.  These skills are increasingly important as statistical data are used selectively by manufacturers to promote products.  While young students learn simple skills such as ways to represent the number of pets belonging to their classmates,&lt;ref name="titleFeldman_Norton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbmsweb.org/NationalSummit/WG_Speakers/feldman_norton.htm |title=Feldman_Norton |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or traditional skills such as calculating the [[arithmetic mean]] of several numbers, older students might learn concepts that were traditionally neglected, such as the difference between the occasionally dramatic [[relative risk reduction]] figures and the more concrete [[absolute risk reduction]], or why political pollsters report the [[margin of error]] with their survey results.

=== Process standards ===
* Problem Solving
* Reasoning and Proof
* Communication
* Connections
* Representation

== Curriculum Focal Points ==
In 2006, NCTM issued a document called "Curriculum Focal Points" that presented the most critical mathematical topics for each grade in elementary and middle schools.  American mathematics instruction tends to be diffuse and is criticized for including too many topics each year.  In part, this publication is intended to assist teachers in identifying the most critical content for targeted attention.  More such publications are planned.

NCTM stated that "Focal Points" was a step in the implementation of the Standards, not a reversal of its position on teaching students to learn foundational topics with conceptual understanding.&lt;ref name="titleHow Do the Curriculum Focal Points Relate to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=268 |title=How Do the Curriculum Focal Points Relate to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics? |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the expectation of many textbook publishers and educational progressives, the 2006 Curriculum Focal Points strongly emphasized the importance of basic arithmetic skills in lower and middle grades.  Because of this, the "Curriculum Focal Points" was perceived by the media&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/education/13math.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us] Report Urges Changes in the Teaching of Math in U.S. Schools by TAMAR LEWIN New York Times September 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/output/commentary/cst-edt-edits13b.html] ''Chicago Sun Times'' "Fuzzy teaching ideas never added up" September 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as an admission that the PSSM had originally recommended, or at least had been interpreted as recommending, reduced instruction in basic arithmetic facts.

The 2006 Curriculum Focal Points identifies three critical areas at each grade level for pre-kindergarten through Grade 8.&lt;ref name="titleHow Do the Curriculum Focal Points Relate to Principles and Standards for School Mathematics?"/&gt;  Samples of the specific focal points for three grades are below. (Note that the Simple Examples below are not quotes from the Focal Points, but are based on the descriptions of activities found in the Focal Points.)

The Focal Points define not only the recommended curriculum emphases, but also the ways in which students should learn them, as in the PSSM. An example of a complete description of one focal point is the following for fourth grade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Number and Operations'' and ''Algebra'': Developing quick recall of multiplication facts and related division facts and fluency with whole number multiplication'''&lt;br /&gt;Students use understandings of multiplication to develop quick recall of the basic multiplication facts and related division facts. They apply their understanding of models for multiplication (i.e., equal-sized groups, arrays, area models, equal intervals on the number line), place value, and properties of operations (in particular, the distributive property) as they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to multiply multidigit whole numbers. They select appropriate methods and apply them accurately to estimate products or calculate them mentally, depending on the context and numbers involved. They develop fluency with efficient procedures, including the standard algorithm, for multiplying whole numbers, understand why the procedures work (on the basis of place value and properties of operations), and use them to solve problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a specialized form of a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] defined by the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] mathematician [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] in 1989. It is also a generalized form of a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra]].

A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A} = (\mathcal{A}, R, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B_A} = (\mathcal{A}, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] and &lt;math&gt;R \in \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt; known as the R-matrix, is an invertible element such that 

:&lt;math&gt; R \Delta(a) = \sigma \circ \Delta(a) R, a \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma: \mathcal{A \otimes A} \rightarrow \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \otimes y \rightarrow y \otimes x &lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the switch map and

:&lt;math&gt; (\Delta \otimes \operatorname{id})R = \Phi_{321}R_{13}\Phi_{132}^{-1}R_{23}\Phi_{123} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{id} \otimes \Delta)R = \Phi_{231}^{-1}R_{13}\Phi_{213}R_{12}\Phi_{123}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{abc} = x_a \otimes x_b \otimes x_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Phi_{123}= \Phi = x_1 \otimes x_2 \otimes x_3 \in \mathcal{A \otimes A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The quasi-Hopf algebra becomes ''triangular'' if in addition, &lt;math&gt;R_{21}R_{12}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The twisting of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F \in \mathcal{A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as for a quasi-Hopf algebra, with the additional definition of the twisted ''R''-matrix

A quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) quasi-Hopf algebra with &lt;math&gt; \Phi=1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra|quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) Hopf algebra]] as the latter two conditions in the definition reduce the conditions of quasi-triangularity of a Hopf algebra.

Similarly to the [[quasi-bialgebra#Twisting|twisting]] properties of the [[quasi-Hopf algebra]], the property of being quasi-triangular or triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is preserved by twisting.

It is a machine independent method of assigning a probability value to each hypothesis (algorithm/program) that explains a given observation, with the simplest hypothesis (the shortest program) having the highest probability and the increasingly complex hypotheses receiving increasingly small probabilities.

Solomonoff founded the theory of universal [[inductive inference]], which is based on solid philosophical foundations&lt;ref name="Entropy 1136"/&gt; and has its root in [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[algorithmic information theory]]. The theory uses algorithmic probability in a Bayesian framework. The universal prior is taken over the class of all computable measures; no hypothesis will have a zero probability. This enables Bayes' rule (of causation) to be used to predict the most likely next event in a series of events, and how likely it will be.&lt;ref name="world.std.com"/&gt;

Although he is best known for [[algorithmic probability]] and his general theory of [[inductive inference]], he made many other important discoveries throughout his life, most of them directed toward his goal in artificial intelligence: to develop a machine that could solve hard problems using probabilistic methods.

== Life history through 1964 ==

Ray Solomonoff was born on July 25, 1926, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], son of Jewish [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants Phillip Julius and Sarah Mashman Solomonoff.  He attended Glenville High School, graduating in 1944. In 1944 he joined the [[United States Navy]] as Instructor in Electronics.  From 1947–1951 he attended the [[University of Chicago]], studying under Professors such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], and graduated with an M.S. in Physics in 1951.

From his earliest years he was motivated by the pure joy of mathematical discovery and by the desire to explore where no one had gone before{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.  At age of 16, in 1942, he began to search for a general method to solve mathematical problems.

In 1952 he met [[Marvin Minsky]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] and others interested in machine intelligence.  In 1956 Minsky and McCarthy and others organized the [[Dartmouth workshop|Dartmouth Summer Research Conference on Artificial Intelligence]], where Ray was one of the original 10 invitees—he, McCarthy, and Minsky were the only ones to stay all summer.  It was for this group that [[Artificial Intelligence]] was first named as a science.   Computers at the time could solve very specific mathematical problems, but not much else.  Ray wanted to pursue a bigger question, how to make machines more generally intelligent, and how computers could use probability for this purpose.

== Work history through 1964 ==

He wrote three papers, two with [[Anatol Rapoport]], in 1950–52,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://world.std.com/~rjs/exactneuralnets.pdf An Exact Method for the Computation of the Connectivity of Random Nets]", ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'', Vol 14, p. 153, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; that are regarded as the earliest statistical analysis of networks.

He was one of the 10 attendees at the 1956 [[Dartmouth Workshop|Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence]].  He wrote and circulated a report among the attendees: "An Inductive Inference Machine".&lt;ref name="pdf scanned copy of the original"/&gt; It viewed machine learning as probabilistic, with an emphasis on the importance of training sequences, and on the use of parts of previous solutions to problems in constructing trial solutions for new problems.  He published a version of his findings in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;An Inductive Inference Machine," IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56–62.[http://world.std.com/~rjs/An%20Inductive%20Inference%20Machine1957.pdf  (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These were the first papers to be written on probabilistic Machine Learning.

In the late 1950s, he invented probabilistic languages and their associated grammars.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://world.std.com/~rjs/A%20Progress%20Report%20on%20Machines%20_%20Translate%20_%20Retrieve%20Information.pdf A Progress Report on Machines to Learn to Translate Languages and Retrieve Information]", Advances in Documentation and Library Science, Vol III, pt. 2, pp. 941–953. (Proceedings of a conference in Sept. 1959.)&lt;/ref&gt;  A probabilistic language assigns a probability value to every possible string. 
 
Generalizing the concept of probabilistic grammars led him to his discovery in 1960 of Algorithmic Probability and General Theory of Inductive Inference.

Prior to the 1960s, the usual method of calculating probability was based on frequency:  taking the ratio of favorable results to the total number of trials.  In his 1960 publication, and, more completely, in his 1964 publications,  Solomonoff seriously revised this definition of probability.  He called this new form of probability "Algorithmic Probability" and showed how to use it for prediction in his theory of inductive inference. As part of this work, he produced the philosophical foundation for the use of Bayes rule of causation for prediction.

The basic theorem of what was later called [[Kolmogorov complexity|Kolmogorov Complexity]] was part of his General Theory. Writing in 1960, he begins: "Consider a very long sequence of symbols ...We shall consider such a sequence of symbols to be 'simple' and have a high a priori probability, if there exists a very brief description of this sequence – using, of course, some sort of stipulated description method.  More exactly, if we use only the symbols 0 and 1 to express our description, we will assign the probability 2&lt;sup&gt;−''N''&lt;/sup&gt; to a sequence of symbols if its shortest possible binary description contains  ''N'' digits."&lt;ref&gt;"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference,", 1960 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability is with reference to a particular [[Universal Turing machine]].  Solomonoff showed and in 1964 proved that the choice of machine, while it could add a constant factor would not change the probability ratios very much.  These probabilities are machine independent.

In 1965, the Russian mathematician Kolmogorov [[multiple discovery|independently]] published similar ideas. When he became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff, and for several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was more concerned with randomness of a sequence. Algorithmic Probability and Universal (Solomonoff) Induction became associated with Solomonoff, who was focused on prediction—the extrapolation of a sequence.

Later in the same 1960 publication Solomonoff describes his extension of the single-shortest-code theory. This is Algorithmic
Probability.  He states: "It would seem that if there are several different methods of describing a sequence, each of these methods should be given ''some'' weight in determining the probability of that sequence."&lt;ref&gt;"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference,",1960, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He then shows how this idea can be used to generate the universal a priori probability distribution and how it enables the use of Bayes rule in inductive inference.  Inductive inference, by adding up the predictions of all models describing a particular sequence, using suitable weights based on the lengths of those models, gets the probability distribution for the extension of that sequence.  This method of prediction has since become known as [[Solomonoff induction]].

He enlarged his theory, publishing a number of reports leading up to the publications in 1964.  The 1964 papers give a more detailed description of Algorithmic Probability, and Solomonoff Induction, presenting five different models, including the model popularly called the Universal Distribution.

== Work history from 1964 to 1984 ==

Other scientists who had been at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Conference (such as [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]) were developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence  which used machines governed by if-then rules, fact based.  Solomonoff was developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence that focussed on probability and prediction; his specific view of A.I. described machines that were governed by the Algorithmic Probability distribution.  The machine generates theories together with their associated probabilities, to solve problems, and as new problems and theories develop, updates the probability distribution on the theories.

In 1968 he found a proof for the
efficacy of Algorithmic Probability,&lt;ref&gt;"Complexity-based Induction Systems, Comparisons and convergence Theorems" ''IEEE Trans. on Information Theory'' Vol. IT-24, No. 4, pp.422–432, July,1978. [http://world.std.com/~rjs/solo1.pdf (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly because of lack of general interest at that time, did not publish it until 10 years later.  In his report, he published the proof for the convergence theorem.

In the years following his discovery of Algorithmic Probability he focused on how to use this probability and Solomonoff Induction in actual prediction and problem solving for A.I.  He also wanted to understand the deeper implications of this probability system.

One important aspect of Algorithmic Probability is that it is complete and incomputable.

In the 1968 report he shows that Algorithmic Probability is ''complete''; that is, if there is any describable regularity in a body of data, Algorithmic Probability will eventually discover that regularity, requiring a relatively small sample of that data.  Algorithmic Probability is the only probability system known to be complete in this way.  As a necessary consequence of its completeness it is ''incomputable''.  The incomputability is because some algorithms—a subset of those that are partially recursive—can never be evaluated fully because it would take too long.  But these programs will at least be recognized as possible solutions.  On the other hand, any ''computable'' system is ''incomplete''.  There will always be descriptions outside that system's search space which will never be acknowledged or considered, even in an infinite amount of time.  Computable prediction models hide this fact by ignoring such algorithms.

In many of his papers he described how to search for solutions to problems and in the 1970s and early 1980s developed what he felt was the best way to update the machine.

The use of probability in A.I., however, did not have a completely smooth path.  In the early years of A.I., the relevance of probability was problematic.  Many in the A.I. community felt probability was not usable in their work.  The area of pattern recognition did use a form of probability, but because there was no broadly based theory of how to incorporate probability in any A.I. field, most fields did not use it at all.

There were, however, researchers such as [[Judea Pearl|Pearl]] and Peter Cheeseman who argued that probability could be used in artificial intelligence.

About 1984, at an annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), it was decided that probability was in no way relevant to A.I.

A protest group formed, and the next year there was a workshop at the AAAI meeting devoted to "Probability and Uncertainty in AI."  This yearly workshop has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://world.std.com/~rjs/kollect.pdf The Universal Distribution and Machine Learning]", The Kolmogorov Lecture, Feb. 27, 2003, Royal Holloway, Univ. of London.  The Computer Journal, Vol 46, No. 6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the protest at the first workshop, Solomonoff gave a paper on how to apply the universal distribution to problems in A.I.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://world.std.com/~rjs/86.pdf The Application of Algorithmic Probability to Problems in Artificial Intelligence]", in Kanal and Lemmer (Eds.), ''Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence,'', Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., pp 473–491, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an early version of the system he has been developing since that time.

In that report, he described the search technique he had developed.  In search problems, the best order of search, is time &lt;math&gt;T_i/P_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the time needed to test the trial and &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of success of that trial.  He called this the "Conceptual Jump Size" of the problem.  Levin's search technique approximates this order,&lt;ref&gt;Levin, L.A., "Universal Search Problems", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115–116, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and so Solomonoff, who had studied Levin's work, called this search technique Lsearch.

== Work history — the later years ==
In other papers he explored how to limit the time needed to search for solutions, writing on resource bounded search.  The search space is limited by available time or computation cost rather than by cutting out search space as is done in some other prediction methods, such as Minimum Description Length.

Throughout his career Solomonoff was concerned with the potential benefits and dangers of A.I., discussing it in many of his published reports.  In 1985 he analyzed a likely evolution of A.I., giving a formula predicting when it would reach the "Infinity Point".&lt;ref&gt;"The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence: Reflections on Social Effects," Human Systems Management, Vol 5, pp. 149–153, 1985 [http://world.std.com/~rjs/timesc.pdf (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This work is part of the history of thought about a possible [[Technological Singularity|technological singularity]].

Originally algorithmic induction methods extrapolated ordered sequences of strings.  Methods were needed for dealing with other kinds of data.

A 1999 report,&lt;ref&gt;"Two Kinds of Probabilistic Induction," The Computer Journal, Vol 42, No. 4, 1999. [http://world.std.com/~rjs/compj99.pdf (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the Universal Distribution and associated convergence theorems to unordered sets of strings and a 2008 report,&lt;ref&gt;"Three Kinds of Probabilistic Induction, Universal Distributions and Convergence Theorems" 2008. [http://world.std.com/~rjs/chris1.pdf (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt; to unordered pairs of strings.

In 1997,&lt;ref&gt;"The Discovery of Algorithmi Probability," Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol 55, No. 1, pp. 73–88 [http://world.std.com/~rjs/barc97.pdf (pdf version)]&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 and 2006 he showed that incomputability and subjectivity are both necessary and desirable characteristics of any high performance induction system.

In 1970 he formed his own one man company, Oxbridge Research, and continued his research there except for periods at other
institutions such as MIT, University of Saarland in Germany and the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Lugano, Switzerland.  In 2003 he was the first recipient of the Kolmogorov Award by The Computer Learning Research Center at the Royal Holloway, University of London, where he  gave the inaugural Kolmogorov Lecture. Solomonoff was most recently a visiting Professor at the CLRC.

In 2006 he spoke at [[AI@50]], "Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: the Next Fifty Years"  commemorating the fiftieth anniversary
of the original Dartmouth summer study group.  Solomonoff was one of five original participants to attend.

In Feb. 2008, he gave the keynote address at the Conference "Current Trends in the Theory and Application of Computer Science" (CTTACS), held at Notre Dame University in Lebanon.  He followed this with a short series of lectures, and began research on new applications of Algorithmic Probability.

Algorithmic Probability and Solomonoff Induction have many advantages for Artificial Intelligence.  Algorithmic Probability gives extremely accurate probability estimates.  These estimates can be revised by a reliable method so that they continue to be acceptable.  It utilizes search time in a very efficient way.  In addition to probability estimates, Algorithmic Probability "has for AI another important value:  its multiplicity of models gives us many different ways to understand our data;

A description of Solomonoff's life and work prior to 1997 is in "The Discovery of Algorithmic Probability", Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol 55, No. 1, pp 73–88, August 1997. The paper, as well as most of the others mentioned here, are available on his website at the [http://world.std.com/~rjs/pubs.html publications page].

In an article published the year of his death, a journal article said of Solomonoff: "A very conventional scientist understands his science using a single 'current paradigm'—the way of understanding that is most in vogue at the present time.  A more creative scientist understands his science in very many ways, and can more easily create new theories, new ways of understanding, when the 'current paradigm' no longer fits the current data".&lt;ref&gt;"Algorithmic Probability, Theory and Applications," In Information Theory and Statistical Learning, Eds Frank Emmert-Streib and Matthias Dehmer, Springer Science and Business Media, 2009, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[operations research]], a '''regular constraint''' is a kind of [[global constraint]].  It can be used to solve a particular type of puzzle called a [[nonogram]] or logigrams.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''sequent''' is a very general kind of conditional assertion.

: &lt;math&gt;A_1,\,\dots,A_m \,\vdash\, B_1,\,\dots,B_n.&lt;/math&gt;

A sequent may have any number ''m'' of condition [[Well-formed formula|formulas]] ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (called "[[Antecedent (logic)|antecedents]]") and any number ''n'' of asserted formulas ''B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' (called "succedents" or "[[consequent]]s"). A sequent is understood to mean that if all of the antecedent conditions are true, then at least one of the consequent formulas is true. This style of conditional assertion is almost always associated with the conceptual framework of [[sequent calculus]].

== Introduction ==

=== The form and semantics of sequents ===

Sequents are best understood in the context of the following three kinds of [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|logical judgments]]:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Unconditional assertion'''. No antecedent formulas.
* Example:  ⊢ ''B''
* Meaning: ''B'' is true.
&lt;li&gt;'''Conditional assertion'''. Any number of antecedent formulas.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Simple conditional assertion'''. Single consequent formula.
* Example: ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊢ ''B''
* Meaning: IF ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' AND ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' AND ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' are true, THEN ''B'' is true.
&lt;li&gt;'''Sequent'''. Any number of consequent formulas. 
* Example: ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊢ ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''
* Meaning: IF ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' AND ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' AND ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''  are true, THEN ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' OR ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' OR ''B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' OR ''B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' is true.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Thus sequents are a generalization of simple conditional assertions, which are a generalization of unconditional assertions.

The word "OR" here is the [[logical disjunction|inclusive OR]].&lt;ref&gt;The disjunctive semantics for the right side of a sequent is stated and explained by {{harvnb|Curry|1977|pp=189–190}}, {{harvnb|Kleene|2002|pp=290, 297}}, {{harvnb|Kleene|2009|p=441}}, {{harvnb|Hilbert|Bernays|1970|p=385}}, {{harvnb|Smullyan|1995|pp=104–105}}, {{harvnb|Takeuti|2013|p=9}}, and {{harvnb|Gentzen|1934|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation for disjunctive semantics on the right side of a sequent comes from three main benefits.
# The symmetry of the classical [[rule of inference|inference rules]] for sequents with such semantics.
# The ease and simplicity of converting such classical rules to intuitionistic rules.
# The ability to prove completeness for predicate calculus when it is expressed in this way.
All three of these benefits were identified in the founding paper by {{harvtxt|Gentzen|1934|p=194}}.

Not all authors have adhered to Gentzen's original meaning for the word "sequent". For example, {{harvtxt|Lemmon|1965}} used the word "sequent" strictly for simple conditional assertions with one and only one consequent formula.&lt;ref name=Lemmon1965p12&gt;{{harvnb|Lemmon|1965|p=12}}, wrote: "Thus a sequent is an argument-frame containing a set of assumptions and a conclusion which is claimed to follow from them. [...] The propositions to the left of '⊢' become assumptions of the argument, and the proposition to the right becomes a conclusion validly drawn from those assumptions."&lt;/ref&gt; The same single-consequent definition for a sequent is given by {{harvnb|Huth|Ryan|2004|p=5}}.

=== Syntax details ===
In a general sequent of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;
both Γ and Σ are [[sequence]]s of logical formulas, not [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. Therefore both the number and order of occurrences of formulas are significant. In particular, the same formula may appear twice in the same sequence. The full set of [[Sequent calculus#Inference rules|sequent calculus inference rules]] contains rules to swap adjacent formulas on the left and on the right of the assertion symbol (and thereby arbitrarily [[Permutation|permute]] the left and right sequences), and also to insert arbitrary formulas and remove duplicate copies within the left and  the right sequences. (However, {{harvtxt|Smullyan|1995|pp=107–108}}, uses ''sets'' of formulas in sequents instead of sequences of formulas. Consequently the three pairs of ''structural rules'' called "thinning", "contraction" and "interchange" are not required.)

The symbol ' &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; ' is often referred to as the "[[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]", "right tack", "tee", "assertion sign" or "assertion symbol". It is often read, suggestively, as "yields", "proves" or "entails".

=== Properties ===

==== Effects of inserting and removing propositions ====
Since every formula in the antecedent (the left side) must be true to conclude the truth of at least one formula in the succedent (the right side), adding formulas to either side results in a weaker sequent, while removing them from either side gives a stronger one. This is one of the symmetry advantages which follows from the use of disjunctive semantics on the right hand side of the assertion symbol, whereas conjunctive semantics is adhered to on the left hand side.

==== Consequences of empty lists of formulas ====
In the extreme case where the list of ''antecedent'' formulas of a sequent is empty, the consequent is unconditional. This differs from the simple unconditional assertion because the number of consequents is arbitrary, not necessarily a single consequent. Thus for example, ' ⊢ ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ' means that either ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', or  ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or both must be true. An empty antecedent formula list is equivalent to the "always true" proposition, called the "[[Tautology (logic)|verum]]", denoted "⊤". (See [[Tee (symbol)]].)

In the extreme case where the list of ''consequent'' formulas of a sequent is empty, the rule is still that at least one term on the right  be true, which is clearly [[Contradiction|impossible]]. This is signified by the 'always false' proposition, called the "[[False (logic)|falsum]]", denoted "⊥". Since the consequence is false, at least one of the antecedents must be false. Thus for example, ' ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊢ ' means that at least one of the antecedents ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' must be false.

One sees here again a symmetry because of the disjunctive semantics on the right hand side. If the left side is empty, then one or more right-side propositions must be true. If the right side is empty, then one or more of the left-side propositions must be false.

The doubly extreme case ' ⊢ ', where both the antecedent and consequent lists of formulas are empty is "[[Interpretation (logic)#Non-empty domain requirement|not satisfiable]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smullyan|1995|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the meaning of the sequent is effectively ' ⊤ ⊢ ⊥  '. This is equivalent to the sequent ' ⊢ ⊥ ', which clearly cannot be valid.

=== Examples ===
A sequent of the form ' ⊢ α, β ', for logical formulas α and β, means that either α is true or β is true. But it does not mean that either α is a tautology or β is a tautology. To clarify this, consider the example ' ⊢ B ∨ A, C ∨ ¬A '. This is a valid sequent because either B ∨ A is true or C ∨ ¬A is true. But neither of these expressions is a tautology in isolation. It is the ''disjunction'' of these two expressions which is a tautology.

Similarly, a sequent of the form ' α, β ⊢ ', for logical formulas α and β, means that either α is false or β is false. But it does not mean that either α is a contradiction or β is a contradiction. To clarify this, consider the example ' B ∧ A, C ∧ ¬A ⊢ '. This is a valid sequent because either B ∧ A is false or C ∧ ¬A is false. But neither of these expressions is a contradiction in isolation. It is the ''conjunction'' of these two expressions which is a contradiction.

=== Rules ===
Most proof systems provide ways to deduce one sequent from another. These inference rules are written with a list of sequents above and below a [[Coplanarity|line]]. This rule indicates that if everything above the line is true, so is everything under the line.

A typical rule is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Gamma,\alpha\vdash\Sigma\qquad \Gamma\vdash\alpha}{\Gamma\vdash\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

This indicates that if we can deduce that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\alpha&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then we can also deduce that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; yields  &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. (See also the full set of [[sequent calculus#Inference rules|sequent calculus inference rules]].)

== Interpretation ==

=== History of the meaning of sequent assertions ===
The assertion symbol in sequents originally meant exactly the same as the implication operator. But over time, its meaning has changed to signify provability within a theory rather than semantic truth in all models.

In 1934, Gentzen did not define the assertion symbol ' ⊢ ' in a sequent to signify provability. He defined it to mean exactly the same as the implication operator ' ⇒ '. Using ' → ' instead of ' ⊢ ' and ' ⊃ ' instead of ' ⇒ ', he wrote: "The sequent A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; signifies, as regards content, exactly the same as the formula (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;amp; ... &amp;amp; A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊃ (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934|p=180}}.
: 2.4. Die Sequenz A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; bedeutet inhaltlich genau dasselbe wie die Formel
::: (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;amp; ... &amp;amp; A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊃ (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; (Gentzen employed the right-arrow symbol between the antecedents and consequents of sequents. He employed the symbol ' ⊃ ' for the logical implication operator.)

In 1939, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Paul Bernays|Bernays]] stated likewise that a sequent has the same meaning as the corresponding implication formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbert|Bernays|1970|p=385}}.
: Für die inhaltliche Deutung ist eine Sequenz
::: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;,
: worin die Anzahlen r und s von 0 verschieden sind, gleichbedeutend mit der Implikation
::: (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;amp; ... &amp;amp; A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) → (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[Alonzo Church]] emphasized that Gentzen's sequent assertions did not signify provability.

: "Employment of the deduction theorem as primitive or derived rule must not, however, be confused with the use of ''Sequenzen'' by Gentzen. For Gentzen's arrow, →, is not comparable to our syntactical notation, ⊢, but belongs to his object language (as is clear from the fact that expressions containing it appear as premisses and conclusions in applications of his rules of inference)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Church|1996|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous publications after this time have stated that the assertion symbol in sequents does signify provability within the theory where the sequents are formulated. [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|1977|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lemmon|Lemmon]] in 1965,&lt;ref name=Lemmon1965p12 /&gt; and Huth and Ryan in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Huth|Ryan|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; all state that the sequent assertion symbol signifies provability. However, {{harvtxt|Ben-Ari|2012|p=69}} states that the assertion symbol in Gentzen-system sequents, which he denotes as ' ⇒ ', is part of the object language, not the metalanguage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|2012|p=69}}, defines sequents to have the form ''U'' ⇒ ''V'' for (possibly non-empty) sets of formulas ''U'' and ''V''. Then he writes:
: "Intuitively, a sequent represents 'provable from' in the sense that the formulas in ''U'' are assumptions for the set of formulas ''V'' that are to be proved. The symbol ⇒ is similar to the symbol ⊢ in Hilbert systems, except that ⇒ is part of the object language of the deductive system being formalized, while ⊢ is a metalanguage notation used to reason about deductive systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]] (1965): "The calculi of sequents can be understood as meta-calculi for the deducibility relation in the corresponding systems of natural deduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prawitz|2006|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And furthermore: "A proof in a calculus of sequents can be looked upon as an instruction on how to construct a corresponding natural deduction."&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Prawitz|2006|p=91}}, for this and further details of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the assertion symbol is part of the object language for the sequent calculus, which is a kind of meta-calculus, but simultaneously signifies deducibility in an underlying natural deduction system.

=== Intuitive meaning ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014|talk=Assertion symbols in sequents do not signify provability.}}
A sequent is a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]] statement of [[Proof theory|provability]] that is frequently used when specifying [[proof calculus|calculi]] for [[deductive reasoning|deduction]]. In the sequent calculus, the name ''sequent'' is used for the construct, which can be regarded as a specific kind of [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgment]], characteristic to this deduction system.

The intuitive meaning of the sequent &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is that under the assumption of Γ the conclusion of Σ is provable. Classically, the formulae on the left of the turnstile can be interpreted [[logical conjunction|conjunctively]] while the formulae on the right can be considered as a [[logical disjunction|disjunction]]. This means that, when all formulae in Γ hold, then at least one formula in Σ also has to be true. If the succedent is empty, this is interpreted as falsity, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash&lt;/math&gt; means that Γ proves falsity and is thus inconsistent. On the other hand an empty antecedent is assumed to be true, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\vdash\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; means that Σ follows without any assumptions, i.e., it is always true (as a disjunction).  A sequent of this form, with Γ empty, is known as a [[logical assertion]].

Of course, other intuitive explanations are possible, which are classically equivalent.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be read as asserting that it cannot be the case that every formula in Γ is true and every formula in Σ is false (this is related to the double-negation interpretations of classical [[intuitionistic logic]], such as [[Glivenko's translation|Glivenko's theorem]]).

In any case, these intuitive readings are only pedagogical. Since formal proofs in proof theory are purely [[syntax|syntactic]], the [[semantics|meaning]] of (the derivation of) a sequent is only given by the properties of the calculus that provides the actual [[rule of inference|rules of inference]].

Barring any contradictions in the technically precise definition above we can describe sequents in their introductory logical form. &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; represents a set of assumptions that we begin our logical process with, for example "Socrates is a man" and "All men are mortal". The &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; represents a logical conclusion that follows under these premises. For example "Socrates is mortal" follows from a reasonable formalization of the above points and we could expect to see it on the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; side of the ''turnstile''. In this sense, &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; means the process of reasoning, or "therefore" in English.

== Variations ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
The general notion of sequent introduced here can be specialized in various ways. A sequent is said to be an '''intuitionistic sequent''' if there is at most one formula in the succedent (although multi-succedent calculi for intuitionistic logic are also possible). More precisely, the restriction of the general sequent calculus to single-succedent-formula sequents, ''with the same inference rules'' as for general sequents, constitutes an intuitionistic sequent calculus. (This restricted sequent calculus is denoted LJ.)

Similarly, one can obtain calculi for [[dual-intuitionistic logic]] (a type of [[paraconsistent logic]]) by requiring that sequents be singular in the antecedent.

In many cases, sequents are also assumed to consist of [[multiset]]s or [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] instead of sequences. Thus one disregards the order or even the numbers of occurrences of the formulae. For classical [[propositional logic]] this does not yield a problem, since the conclusions that one can draw from a collection of premises do not depend on these data. In [[substructural logic]], however, this may become quite important.

[[Natural deduction]] systems use single-consequence conditional assertions, but they typically do not use the same sets of inference rules as Gentzen introduced in 1934. In particular, [[System L|tabular natural deduction]] systems, which are very convenient for practical theorem-proving in propositional calculus and predicate calculus, were applied by {{harvtxt|Suppes|1957}} and {{harvtxt|Lemmon|1965}} for teaching introductory logic in textbooks.

== Etymology ==
Historically, sequents have been introduced by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in order to specify his famous [[sequent calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934}}, {{harvnb|Gentzen|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his German publication he used the word "Sequenz". However, in English, the word "[[sequence]]" is already used as a translation to the German "Folge" and appears quite frequently in mathematics. The term "sequent" then has been created in search for an alternative translation of the German expression.

Kleene&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kleene|2002|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the following comment on the translation into English: "Gentzen says 'Sequenz', which we translate as 'sequent', because we have already used 'sequence' for any succession of objects, where the German is 'Folge'."

The '''significant figures''' (also known as the '''significant digits''') of a number are [[Numerical digit|digits]] that carry meaning contributing to its [[Accuracy and precision|measurement resolution]]. This includes all digits ''except'':&lt;ref&gt;''Chemistry in the Community''; Kendall-Hunt:Dubuque, IA 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
*  All [[leading zeros]];
* [[Trailing zeros]] when they are merely placeholders to indicate the scale of the number (exact rules are explained at [[#Identifying significant figures|identifying significant figures]]); and
* [[wikt:spurious|Spurious]] digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater precision than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports.

[[Significance arithmetic]] are approximate rules for roughly maintaining significance throughout a computation.  The more sophisticated scientific rules are known as [[propagation of uncertainty]].

Numbers are often [[rounding|rounded]] to avoid reporting insignificant figures. For example, it would create [[false precision]] to express a measurement as 12.34500&amp;nbsp;kg (which has seven significant figures) if the scales only measured to the nearest gram and gave a reading of 12.345&amp;nbsp;kg (which has five significant figures).  Numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than to indicate a given precision of measurement, for example, to make them faster to pronounce in news broadcasts.

==Identifying significant figures==

===Concise rules===
*All non-zero digits are significant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
*Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 102, 2005, 50009.
*Leading zeros are never significant: 0.02, 001.887, 0.000515.
*In a number ''with'' a decimal point, trailing zeros (those to the right of the last non-zero digit) are significant: 2.02000, 5.400, 57.5400.
*In a number ''without'' a decimal point, trailing zeros may or may not be significant.  More information through additional graphical symbols or explicit information on errors is needed to clarify the significance of trailing zeros.

===Significant figures rules explained===
Specifically, the rules for identifying significant figures when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Giving a precise definition for the number of correct significant digits is surprisingly subtle, see {{cite book |first= Nicholas |last= Higham |title= Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms |edition= 2nd |publisher= SIAM |year= 2002 |pages = 3–5  | url=http://ftp.demec.ufpr.br/CFD/bibliografia/Higham_2002_Accuracy%20and%20Stability%20of%20Numerical%20Algorithms.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*All non-zero digits are considered significant. For example, 91 has two significant figures (9 and 1), while 123.45 has five significant figures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).
*Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant. Example: 101.1203 has seven significant figures: 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0 and 3.
*Leading zeros are not significant. For example, 0.00052 has two significant figures: 5 and 2.
*Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant. For example, 12.2300 has six significant figures: 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 and 0. The number 0.000122300 still has only six significant figures (the zeros before the 1 are not significant). In addition, 120.00 has five significant figures since it has three trailing zeros. This convention clarifies the precision of such numbers; for example, if a measurement precise to four decimal places (0.0001) is given as 12.23 then it might be understood that only two decimal places of precision are available. Stating the result as 12.2300 makes clear that it is precise to four decimal places (in this case, six significant figures).
*The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if a number like 1300 is precise to the nearest unit (and just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundred due to rounding or uncertainty. Many conventions exist to address this issue:

:*An [[overline]], sometimes also called an overbar, or less accurately, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], may be placed over the last significant figure; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 13{{overline|0}}0 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is precise to the nearest ten).

:*Less often, using a closely related convention, the last significant figure of a number may be [[underline]]d; for example, "2&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;00" has two significant figures.

:*A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example "100." indicates specifically that three significant figures are meant.&lt;ref name="Chemistry Significant Figures"&gt;{{cite book |last= Myers |first= R. Thomas |last2= Oldham |first2= Keith B. |last3= Tocci |first3= Salvatore |title= Chemistry |year= 2000 |publisher= Holt Rinehart Winston |location= Austin, Texas  |isbn= 0-03-052002-9 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In the combination of a number and a [[unit of measurement]], the ambiguity can be avoided by choosing a suitable [[unit prefix]]. For example, the number of significant figures in a mass specified as 1300&amp;nbsp;g is ambiguous, while in a mass of 13&amp;nbsp;[[Hecto-|h]]g or 1.3&amp;nbsp;kg it is not.

:*The number can be expressed in Scientific Notation (see below).

:However, these conventions are not universally used, and it is often necessary to determine from context whether such trailing zeros are intended to be significant. If all else fails, the level of rounding can be specified explicitly. The abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used, for example "20&amp;nbsp;000 to 2&amp;nbsp;s.f." or "20&amp;nbsp;000 (2&amp;nbsp;sf)". Alternatively, the uncertainty can be stated separately and explicitly with a [[plus-minus sign]], as in 20&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1%, so that significant-figures rules do not apply.  This also allows specifying a precision in-between powers of ten (or whatever the base power of the numbering system is).

===Scientific notation===
In most cases, the same rules apply to numbers expressed in [[scientific notation]]. However, in the normalized form of that notation, placeholder leading and trailing digits do not occur, so all digits are significant. For example, {{val|0.00012}} (two significant figures) becomes {{val|1.2|e=-4}}, and {{val|0.00122300}} (six significant figures) becomes {{val|1.22300|e=-3}}. In particular, the potential ambiguity about the significance of trailing zeros is eliminated. For example, {{val|1300}} to four significant figures is written as {{val|1.300|e=3}}, while {{val|1300}} to two significant figures is written as {{val|1.3|e=3}}.

The part of the representation that contains the significant figures (as opposed to the base or the exponent) is known as the [[significand]] or mantissa.

==Rounding and decimal places==

The basic concept of significant figures is often used in connection with [[rounding]]. Rounding to significant figures is a more general-purpose technique than rounding to ''n'' decimal places, since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way. For example, the population of a city might only be known to the nearest thousand and be stated as 52,000, while the population of a country might only be known to the nearest million and be stated as 52,000,000. The former might be in error by hundreds, and the latter might be in error by hundreds of thousands, but both have two significant figures (5 and 2). This reflects the fact that the significance of the error (its likely size relative to the size of the quantity being measured) is the same in both cases.

To round to ''n'' significant figures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Identify the significant figures before rounding.  These are the ''n'' consecutive digits beginning with the first non-zero digit.
* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is greater than 5 or is a 5 followed by other non-zero digits, add 1 to the last significant figure. For example, 1.2459 as the result of a calculation or measurement that only allows for 3 significant figures should be written 1.25.
* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is a 5 not followed by any other digits or followed only by zeros, rounding requires a [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie-breaking]] rule. For example, to round 1.25 to 2 significant figures:
**[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round half away from zero]] (also known as "5/4"){{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=By who?}} rounds up to 1.3. This is the default rounding method implied in many disciplines{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=How many, and which, disciplines?}} if not specified.
** [[Rounding#Round half to even|Round half to even]], which rounds to the nearest even number, rounds down to 1.2 in this case. The same strategy applied to 1.35 would instead round up to 1.4.
* Replace non-significant figures in front of the decimal point by zeros.
* Drop all the digits after the decimal point to the right of the significant figures (do not replace them with zeros).

In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the [[decimal separator]] for many world currencies).  Rounding to a fixed number of decimal places in this way is an orthographic convention that does not maintain significance, and may either lose information or create false precision.

In UK personal tax returns payments received are always rounded down to the nearest pound, whilst tax paid is rounded up although tax deducted at source is calculated to the nearest penny. This creates an interesting situation where anyone with tax accurately deducted at source has a significant likelihood of a small rebate if they complete a tax return.

As an illustration, the [[decimal]] quantity '''12.345''' can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.  If insufficient precision is available then the number is [[rounding|rounded]] in some manner to fit the available precision.  The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places.

The representation of a positive number ''x'' to a precision of ''p'' significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula:{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
:[[Rounding|round]](10&lt;sup&gt;''−n''&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'')⋅10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' = [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]](log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''x'') + 1 − ''p''.
For negative numbers, the formula can be used on the [[absolute value]]; for zero, no transformation is necessary.  Note that the result may need to be written with one of the above conventions explained in the section "Identifying significant figures" to indicate the actual number of significant digits if the result includes for example trailing significant zeros.

==Arithmetic==
{{Main|Significance arithmetic}}
As there are rules for determining the number of significant figures in directly ''measured'' quantities, there are rules for determining the number of significant figures in quantities ''calculated'' from these ''measured'' quantities.

Only ''measured'' quantities figure into the determination of the number of significant figures in ''calculated quantities''.  Exact mathematical quantities like the {{math|π}} in the formula for the [[area of a disk|area of a circle]] with radius {{math|''r''}}, {{math|π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has no effect on the number of significant figures in the final calculated area.  Similarly the {{math|½}} in the formula for the [[kinetic energy]] of a mass {{math|''m''}} with velocity {{math|''v''}}, {{math|½''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, has no bearing on the number of significant figures in the final calculated kinetic energy.  The constants {{math|π}} and {{math|½}} are considered to have an ''infinite'' number of significant figures.

For quantities created from measured quantities by '''multiplication''' and '''division''', the calculated result should have as many significant figures as the ''measured'' number with the ''least'' number of significant figures.  For example, 
:1.234 × 2.0 =  2.{{overline|4}}68… ≈ 2.5, 
with only ''two'' significant figures.  The first factor has four significant figures and the second  has two significant figures.  The factor with the least number of significant figures is the second one with only two, so the final calculated result should also have a total of two significant figures.

For quantities created from measured quantities by '''addition''' and '''subtraction''', the last significant [[Positional notation|''decimal place'']] (hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, and so forth) in the calculated result should be the same as the ''leftmost'' or largest ''decimal place'' of the last significant figure out of all the ''measured'' quantities in the terms of the sum.  For example, 
:100.0 + 1.234 = 101.{{overline|2}}34… ≈ 101.2 
with the last significant figure in the ''tenths'' place.  The first term has its last significant figure in the tenths place and the second term has its last significant figure in the thousandths place.  The leftmost of the decimal places of the last significant figure out of all the terms of the sum is the tenths place from the first term, so the calculated result should also have its last significant figure in the tenths place.

The rules for calculating significant figures for multiplication and division are opposite to the rules for addition and subtraction.  For multiplication and division, only the total number of significant figures in each of the factors matter; the decimal place of the last significant figure in each factor is irrelevant.  For addition and subtraction, only the decimal place of the last significant figure in each of the terms matters; the total number of significant figures in each term is irrelevant.

&lt;!-- see [[Significance arithmetic#Addition and subtraction using significance arithmetic]] for details --&gt;
In a [[Base (exponentiation)|base]] 10 [[logarithm]] of a [[normalized number]], the result should be rounded to the number of significant figures in the normalized number. For example, log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(3.000×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) + log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(3.000) ≈ 4 + 0.47712125472, should be rounded to 4.4771.

When taking antilogarithms, the resulting number should have as many significant figures as the [[Common logarithm|mantissa]] in the logarithm.

When performing a calculation, do not follow these guidelines for intermediate results; keep as many digits as is practical (at least 1 more than implied by the precision of the final result) until the end of calculation to avoid cumulative rounding errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf |format= PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618184216/http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf |archivedate= June 18, 2013 |title= Measurements and Significant Figures (Draft) |first= Virgínio |last= de Oliveira Sannibale |year= 2001 |work= Freshman Physics Laboratory |publisher= California Institute of Technology, Physics Mathematics And Astronomy Division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimating tenths==
When using a ruler, initially use the smallest mark as the first estimated digit. For example, if a ruler's smallest mark is cm, and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm is read, it is 4.5 (±0.1&amp;nbsp;cm) or 4.4&amp;nbsp;– 4.6&amp;nbsp;cm.

It is possible that the overall length of a ruler may not be accurate to the degree of the smallest mark and the marks may be imperfectly spaced within each unit. However assuming a normal good quality ruler, it should be possible to estimate tenths between the nearest two marks to achieve an extra decimal place of accuracy. Failing to do this adds the error in reading the ruler to any error in the calibration of the ruler.&lt;ref name="UMmeasurements"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurements|url=http://slc.umd.umich.edu/slconline/SIGF/page7.html|website=slc.umd.umich.edu|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weston"&gt;{{cite book|title=Experimental Electrical Testing|date=1914|publisher=Weston Electrical Instruments Co.|location=Newark, NJ|page=9|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation==
{{Main|Estimation}}
When estimating the proportion of individuals carrying some particular characteristic in a population, from a random sample of that population, the number of significant figures should not exceed the maximum precision allowed by that sample size. The correct number of significant figures is given by the [[order of magnitude]] of sample size. This can be found by taking the base 10 logarithm of sample size and rounding to the nearest integer.

For example, in a poll of 120 randomly chosen viewers of a regularly visited web page we find that 10 people disagree with a proposition on that web page. The order of magnitude of our sample size is Log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(120) = 2.0791812460..., which rounds to 2. Our estimated proportion of people who disagree with the proposition is therefore 0.083, or 8.3%, with 2 significant figures. This is because in different samples of 120 people from this population, our estimate would vary in units of 1/120, and any additional figures would misrepresent the size of our sample by giving spurious precision. To interpret our estimate of the number of viewers who disagree with the proposition we should then calculate some measure of our [[Binomial proportion confidence interval|confidence]] in this estimate.

==Relationship to accuracy and precision in measurement==
{{main|Accuracy and precision}}

Traditionally, in various technical fields, "accuracy" refers to the closeness of a given measurement to its true value; "precision" refers to the stability of that measurement when repeated many times.  Hoping to reflect the way the term "accuracy" is actually used in the scientific community, there is a more recent standard, ISO 5725, which keeps the same definition of precision but defines the term "trueness" as the closeness of a given measurement to its true value and uses the term "accuracy" as the combination of trueness and precision.  (See the [[Accuracy and precision]] article for a fuller discussion.)  In either case, the number of significant figures roughly corresponds to ''precision'', not to either use of the word accuracy or to the newer concept of trueness. &lt;!--The smaller digits are not significant because they effectively random noise generated by the measurement process having little to do with the true value; they, they can be omitted for some reporting purposes. (This approach ignores techniques such as averaging to produce a higher-precision result.) *****NOTE: Aside from being broken grammatically, the previous blanket statement is unlikely to be true—it depends on the precision of the instruments and the exact situation. --&gt;

==In computing==
{{main|Floating point}}
Computer representations of [[floating point numbers]] typically use a form of rounding to significant figures, but with [[binary number]]s. The number of correct significant figures is closely related to the notion of [[Approximation error|relative error]] (which has the advantage of being a more accurate measure of precision, and is independent of the radix of the number system used).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">In [[geometry]] and [[combinatorics]], a '''simplicial''' (or '''combinatorial''') '''''d''-sphere''' is a [[simplicial complex]] [[homeomorphic]] to the [[n-sphere|''d''-dimensional sphere]]. Some simplicial spheres arise as the boundaries of [[convex polytope]]s, however, in higher dimensions most simplicial spheres cannot be obtained in this way.

The most important open problem in the field is the '''g-conjecture''', formulated by [[Peter McMullen]], which asks about possible numbers of faces of different dimensions of a simplicial sphere.

== Examples ==
* For any ''n'' ≥ 3, the [[cycle graph|simple ''n''-cycle]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''simplicial circle''', i.e. a simplicial sphere of dimension 1. This construction produces all simplicial circles.
* The boundary of a convex [[polyhedron]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with triangular faces, such as an [[octahedron]] or [[icosahedron]], is a simplicial 2-sphere.
* More generally, the boundary of any (''d''+1)-dimensional [[compact space|compact]] (or [[bounded set|bounded]]) simplicial [[convex polytope]] in the [[Euclidean space]] is a simplicial ''d''-sphere.

== Properties ==
It follows from [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] that any simplicial 2-sphere with ''n'' vertices has 3''n'' &amp;minus; 6 edges and 2''n'' &amp;minus; 4 faces. The case of ''n'' = 4 is realized by the tetrahedron. By repeatedly performing the [[barycentric subdivision]], it is easy to construct a simplicial sphere for any ''n'' ≥ 4. Moreover, [[Ernst Steinitz]] gave a [[Steinitz's theorem|characterization of 1-skeleta]] (or edge graphs) of convex polytopes in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; implying that any simplicial 2-sphere is a boundary of a convex polytope.

[[Branko Grünbaum]] constructed an example of a non-polytopal simplicial sphere. [[Gil Kalai]] proved that, in fact, "most" simplicial spheres are non-polytopal. The smallest example is of dimension ''d'' = 4 and has ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 vertices.

The [[upper bound theorem]] gives upper bounds for the numbers ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''i''-faces of any simplicial ''d''-sphere with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'' vertices. This conjecture was proved for polytopal spheres by [[Peter McMullen]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;McMullen, P. On the upper-bound conjecture for convex polytopes. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 10 1971 187–200.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Richard P. Stanley|Richard Stanley]] for general simplicial spheres in 1975.

The '''''g''-conjecture''', formulated by McMullen in 1970, asks for a complete characterization of ''f''-vectors of simplicial ''d''-spheres. In other words, what are the possible sequences of numbers of faces of each dimension for a simplicial ''d''-sphere? In the case of polytopal spheres, the answer is given by the '''''g''-theorem''', proved in 1979 by Billera and Lee (existence) and Stanley (necessity). It has been conjectured that the same conditions are necessary for general simplicial spheres. The conjecture is open for ''d'' at least 5 (as of 2018).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5390">In [[mathematics]], the Fourier '''sine and cosine transforms''' are forms of the [[Fourier transform|Fourier integral transform]] that do not use [[complex number]]s. They are the forms originally used by [[Joseph Fourier]] and are still preferred in some applications, such as [[signal processing]] or [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pulse.embs.org/january-2016/highlights-in-the-history-of-the-fourier-transform/|title=Highlights in the History of the Fourier Transform|website=pulse.embs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The '''Fourier sine transform''' of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''t'')}}, sometimes denoted by either &lt;math&gt; {\hat f}^s &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal F}_s (f) &lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)\sin(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|t}} means time, then {{mvar|ν}} is frequency in cycles per unit time, but in the abstract, they can be any pair of variables which are dual to each other.

This transform is necessarily an [[odd function]] of frequency, i.e. for all {{mvar|ν}}:

:&lt;math&gt;  {\hat f}^s(-\nu) = - {\hat f}^s(\nu).&lt;/math&gt;

The numerical factors in the [[Fourier transform]]s are defined uniquely only by their product.  Here, in order that the Fourier inversion formula not have any numerical factor, the factor of 2 appears because the sine function has {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} norm of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\sqrt2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Fourier cosine transform''' of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''t'')}}, sometimes denoted by either &lt;math&gt; {\hat f}^c &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal F}_c (f)&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)\cos(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

It is necessarily an [[even function]] of frequency, i.e. for all {{mvar|ν}}:

:&lt;math&gt;{\hat f}^c(\nu) =  {\hat f}^c(-\nu).&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary L. Boas]], ''[[Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences]]'', 2nd Ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 1983. {{ISBN|0-471-04409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; only define the cosine transform for [[even function]]s of {{mvar|t}}, in which case its sine transform is zero. Since cosine is also even, a simpler formula can be used, 

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \int_0^\infty f(t)\cos(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt; 

Similarly, if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is an [[odd function]], then the cosine transform is zero and the sine transform can be simplified to 

:&lt;math&gt;2\int_0^\infty f(t)\sin(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Other authors also define the cosine transform as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cnyack.homestead.com/files/afourtr/ftcosin.htm|title=Fourier Transform, Cosine and Sine Transforms|website=cnyack.homestead.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_0^\infty f(t)\cos(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

and sine as

&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_0^\infty f(t)\sin(2\pi \nu t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

==Fourier inversion==
The original function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} can be recovered from its transform under the usual hypotheses, that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} and both of its transforms should be absolutely integrable. For more details on the different hypotheses, see [[Fourier inversion theorem]].

The inversion formula is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Poincaré]]|first=Henri|title=Theorie analytique de la propagation de chaleur|year=1895|publisher=G. Carré|location=Paris|pages= 108ff.|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5500702f/f115.image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f(t) = \int _0^\infty {\hat f}^c(\nu) \cos (2\pi \nu t) d\nu + \int _0^\infty {\hat f}^s(\nu) \sin (2\pi \nu t) d\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

which has the advantage that all frequencies are positive and all quantities are real. If the numerical factor 2 is left out of the definitions of the transforms, then the inversion formula is usually written as an integral over both negative and positive frequencies.

Using the addition formula for [[cosine]], this is sometimes rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{\pi}{2} \left(f(x+0)+f(x-0) \right ) = \int _0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty  f(t) \cos ( \omega (t-x) ) dt d\omega, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x'' + 0)}} denotes the one-sided [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} as {{mvar|x}} approaches zero from above, and {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x'' − 0)}} denotes the one-sided limit of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} as {{mvar|x}} approaches zero from below.

If the original function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is an [[even function]], then the sine transform is zero; if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is an [[odd function]], then the cosine transform is zero. In either case, the inversion formula simplifies.

==Relation with complex exponentials==
The form of the [[Fourier transform]] used more often today is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat{f}(\nu) &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{-2\pi i\nu t}\,dt \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)(\cos (2\pi\nu t) - i\,\sin (2\pi\nu t))\,dt &amp;&amp; \text{Euler's Formula} \\
&amp;= \left (\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)\cos(2\pi \nu t) \,dt \right ) - i \left (\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)\sin(2\pi \nu t) \,dt \right )\\
&amp;= {\hat f}^c (\nu) - i {\hat f}^s (\nu)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:LindnerAttractor.webm|thumb|Delay Coordinate Embedding Attractor Reconstruction of the strange nonchaotic dynamics of the pulsating star KIC 5520878]]

In mathematics, a '''strange nonchaotic attractor''' ('''SNA''') is a form of [[attractor]] which, while converging to a limit, is [[strange attractor|strange]], because it is not [[piecewise differentiable]], and also non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]], in that its [[Lyapunov exponents]] are non-positive.&lt;ref name=alseda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/talks/SNA_Defin20070308.pdf|title=On the definition of Strange Nonchaotic Attractor|author=Lluís Alsedà|date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs were introduced as a topic of study by Grebogi et al. in 1984.&lt;ref name=alseda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Grebogi, E. Ott, S. Pelikan, and J. A. Yorke. Strange attractors that are not chaotic. Phys. D, 13(1-2):261–268, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs can be distinguished from [[periodic attractor|periodic]], [[quasiperiodic]] and [[chaotic attractor]]s using the [[0-1 test for chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1303.0169|last1= Gopal|first1= R.|title= Applicability of 0-1 Test for Strange Nonchaotic Attractors|last2=  Venkatesan|first2= A.|last3=  Lakshmanan|first3= M.|year= 2013|doi=10.1063/1.4808254|pmid= 23822488|volume=23|issue= 2|journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science|page=023123|bibcode=2013Chaos..23b3123G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically driven damped nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamics characterized by strange chaotic attractors, where strange refers  to  the  fractal  geometry of the attractor and chaotic refers to the exponential sensitivity of orbits on the attractor. Quasiperiodically driven systems forced by incommensurate frequencies are natural extensions of periodically driven ones and are phenomenologically richer. In addition to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, they can exhibit chaotic or nonchaotic motion on strange  attractors. Although quasiperiodic forcing is not necessary for strange nonchaotic  dynamics (e.g., the period doubling accumulation point of a period doubling cascade), if quasiperiodic driving is not present, strange nonchaotic attractors are typically not robust and not expected to occur naturally because they exist only when the system is carefully tuned to a precise critical parameter value.  On the other hand, it was shown in the paper of Grebogi et al. that SNA's can be robust when the system is quasiperiodically driven. The  first  experiment  to  demonstrate a robust strange nonchaotic attractor involved  the  buckling of a magnetoelastic ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies in the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, W.

Lett. 65 (5), (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Strange nonchaotic attractors have been robustly observed in laboratory experiments involving magnetoelastic ribbons, electrochemical cells, electronic circuits, a neon glow discharge and most recently detected in the dynamics of the pulsating [[RR Lyrae variables]] KIC 5520878 (as obtained from the [[Kepler Space Telescope]]) which may be the first strange nonchaotic [[dynamical system]] observed in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Lindner, John F. and Kohar, Vivek and Kia, Behnam and Hippke, Michael and Learned, John G. and Ditto, William L., Strange Nonchaotic Stars, Phys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">In [[information visualization]] and [[graphic design]], '''Truchet tiles''' are square tiles decorated with patterns that are not [[rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetric]]. When placed within a [[square tiling]] of the plane, they can form varied patterns, and the orientation of each tile can be used to visualize information associated with the tile's position within the tiling.&lt;ref name="browne08"&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 32
 | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Truchet tiles were first described in a 1704 memoir by [[Sébastien Truchet]] entitled "Mémoire sur les combinaisons", and were popularized in 1987 by [[Cyril Stanley Smith]].&lt;ref name="browne08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Variations==
===Contrasting triangles===
The tile originally studied by Truchet is split along the diagonal into two triangles of contrasting colors. The tile has four possible orientations.

[[File:Truchet base tiles bordered.png|center]]

Some examples of surface filling made tiling such a [[pattern]].

With a scheme:
[[File:Truchet ordered tiling.svg|center]]

With random placement:
[[File:Truchet base tiling.svg|center|thumb|250px]]

===Quarter-circles===
A second common form of the Truchet tiles, due to {{harvtxt|Smith|1987}}, decorates each tile with two quarter-circles connecting the midpoints of adjacent sides. Each such tile has two possible orientations.

{{multiple image
| align     = center
| footer    = 
| width     = 120
| image1    = Truchet tile.svg
| alt1      = Truchet tile
| caption1  = The Truchet tile
| image2    = Truchet tile inverse.svg
| alt2      = Truchet tile inverse
| caption2  = Inverse of the Truchet tile, created by any 90° rotation or orthogonal flip
}}

We have such a tiling:

[[File:Truchet tiling.svg|thumb|center|250px]]

This type of tile has also been used in abstract strategy games [[Trax (game)|Trax]] and the [[Black Path Game]], prior to Smith's work.&lt;ref name="browne08"/&gt;

===Diagonal===
A [[labyrinth]] can be generated by tiles in the form of a white square with a black diagonal. As with the quarter-circle tiles, each such tile has two orientations.&lt;ref name="goto"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://news.mit.edu/2013/10-print-chr2055rnd1-goto-10 | title=10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 | publisher=MIT Press | author=Montfort, Nick | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The connectivity of the resulting labyrinth can be analyzed mathematically using [[percolation theory]] as bond percolation at the critical point of a diagonally-oriented grid.
[[Nick Montfort]] considers the single line of [[Commodore 64]] [[BASIC]] required to generate such patterns - &lt;code&gt;10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10&lt;/code&gt; - to be "a [[concrete poetry|concrete poem]], a found poem".&lt;ref name="goto"/&gt;

In [[plane geometry]], '''Van Aubel's theorem''' describes a relationship between squares constructed on the sides of a [[quadrilateral]]. Starting with a given quadrilateral (a polygon having four sides), construct a [[square (geometry)|square]] on each side.  Van Aubel's theorem states that the two line segments between the centers of opposite squares are of equal lengths and are at [[right angle]]s to one another. Another way of saying the same thing is that the center points of the four squares form the vertices of an [[equidiagonal quadrilateral|equidiagonal]] [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]].  The theorem is named after H. H. van Aubel, who published it in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=van Aubel|first=H.

He completed his [[undergraduate]] in [[Computer Science]] from [[IIT Madras]] and his [[doctorate]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] under the supervision of [[Madhu Sudan]] in 2001 [http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/]. After receiving his PhD, he spent a year at [[UC Berkeley]] as a [[Miller Fellow]], and then was a member of the faculty at the [[University of Washington]] from 2002 to 2009. His primary area of research is [[computer science]], and in particular on error-correcting codes. During 2007-2008, he visited the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] as a Member of School of Mathematics. He also visited SCS at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] during 2008-09 as a Visiting Faculty. In July 2009, he joined the School of Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] as Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department.

Guruswami was awarded the 2002 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Doctoral Dissertation Award for his dissertation ''List Decoding of Error-Correcting Codes''. [http://www1.acm.org/awards/dd_citation/2002.html], which introduced an algorithm that allowed for the correction of errors beyond half the minimum distance of the code. It applies to [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon codes]] and more generally to [[algebraic geometric code]]s. This algorithm produces a list of codewords (it is a [[list-decoding]] algorithm) and is based on interpolation and factorization of polynomials over &lt;math&gt;GF(2^m)&lt;/math&gt; and its extensions.

He was an invited speaker in [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] 2010, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] on the topic of "''Mathematical Aspects of Computer Science.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1897|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByCongress.php|publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guraswami was one of two winners of the 2012 [[Presburger Award]], given by the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] for outstanding contributions by a young theoretical computer scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/1243-presburger-award-2012 Presburger Award 2012], EATCS, retrieved 2012-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was elected as an [[ACM Fellow]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.acm.org/media-center/2017/december/fellows-2017|title=ACM Recognizes 2017 Fellows for Making Transformative Contributions and Advancing Technology in the Digital Age|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1582">In the study of [[permutation]]s and [[permutation pattern]]s, '''Wilf equivalence''' is an [[equivalence relation]] on [[permutation class]]es.
Two permutation classes are Wilf equivalent when they have the same numbers of permutations of each possible length, or equivalently if they have the same [[generating function]]s.{{r|bevan}} The equivalence classes for Wilf equivalence are called '''Wilf classes''';{{r|open}} they are the [[combinatorial class]]es of permutation classes. The counting functions and Wilf equivalences among many [[Enumerations of specific permutation classes|specific permutation classes]] are known.

Wilf equivalence may also be described for individual permutations rather than permutation classes. In this context, two permutations are said to be Wilf equivalent if the principal permutation classes formed by forbidding them are Wilf equivalent.{{r|bevan}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">'''Δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''' ('''Delta P''') is a mathematical term used to illustrate a change (Δ) in pressure (&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Uses==
*[[Young–Laplace equation]]

===Darcy–Weisbach equation===
As used in the '''[[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]''' — Given that the [[head loss]] ''h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' expresses the [[pressure]] loss ''&amp;Delta;p'' as the height of a column of fluid,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h_f&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the density of the fluid, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of pressure loss:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho V^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Lung compliance===
In general, compliance is defined by the change in volume ([[ΔV]]) versus the associated change in pressure (ΔP), or [[ΔV/ΔP]]. During [[mechanical ventilation]], compliance can be influenced by 3 key physiologic factors:
#[[Lung compliance]]
#[[Chest wall compliance]]
#[[Airway resistance]]

Lung compliance is influenced by a variety of primary abnormalities of [[lung parenchyma]], both chronic and acute. [[Airway resistance]] is typically increased by [[bronchospasm]] and airway secretions. Chest wall compliance can be decreased by fixed abnormalities (e.g. [[kyphoscoliosis]], [[morbid obesity]]) or more variable problems driven by patient agitation while intubated.&lt;ref name="pmid21866369"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dellamonica J, Lerolle N, Sargentini C, Beduneau G, Di Marco F, Mercat A, etal | title=PEEP-induced changes in lung volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two methods to estimate alveolar recruitment. | journal=Intensive Care Med | year= 2011 | volume=  37| issue=  10| pages=  1595–604| pmid=21866369 | doi=10.1007/s00134-011-2333-y | pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating Compliance on [[minute volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;: [[ΔV]] is always defined by [[tidal volume]] (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), but ΔP is different for the measurement of dynamic vs. static compliance.

====Dynamic Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{dyn} = \frac{V_T}\mathrm{PIP-PEEP}&lt;/math&gt;

where PIP = [[peak inspiratory pressure]] (the maximum pressure during inspiration), and PEEP = [[positive end expiratory pressure]]. Alterations in airway resistance, [[lung compliance]] and chest wall compliance influence C&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Static Compliance (C&lt;sub&gt;stat&lt;/sub&gt;)====
:&lt;math&gt;C_{stat} = \frac{{V_T}}{{P_{plat}-PEEP}}&lt;/math&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; = plateau pressure. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. P&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is never &gt; PIP and is typically &lt; 3-5 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O lower than PIP when airway resistance is normal.
