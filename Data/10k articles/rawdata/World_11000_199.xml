64 cyclists took off from Milan and 32 of them completed the race.

==Development==
Mollo won this edition of the Giro of Lombardy culminating a solo escape originated in the first ascent of the day-mount Guello (km. 40). Bartali passed very close to him by the top but decided to wait for his companions thinking about the Italian championship, which was also decided in this test. This circumstance favored Mollo which by Grantola had more than eight minutes. A sufficient advantage to win the competition despite suffering in the last ascent to Brinzio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1935/10/21/pagina-2/629882/pdf.html Noticia en Mundo Deportivo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.les-sports.info/cyclisme-sur-route-tour-de-lombardie-resultats-1935-epr10564.html|title=Tour de Lombardie 1935|work=LesSports.info|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=24&amp;y=1935|title=1935 Il Lombardia|work=First Cycling|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet is found in a prayer by the 18th-century lama [[Mergen Gegen Lubsangdambijalsan]], where it is added to the name of the "Khan of the fire". "Arshi" derives from Sanskrit ''rsi''; "tngri" refers to the 99 [[tngri]] or Mongolian deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atwood|first=Christopher P.|year=1996|title=Buddhism and Popular Ritual in Mongolian Religion: A Reexamination of the Fire cult|journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]|jstor=3176686|pages=112–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, run by a steering committee, worked to ensure the rights of young people were heard by decision makers. It was founded after a young people's rights conference in [[Greenwich]], [[London]] ([[England]]) and was run by and for young people aged 18 and under.  The administrative duties of Article 12 were run by [[CRAE]] (Children's Rights Alliance for England).

The group's most high-profile campaigns included 'Stop Smacking Us' (challenging [[Reasonable Chastisement]]) when it led a rally in [[Westminster]] to [[10 Downing Street]] with 100 children. Its members have represented the United Kingdom at several United Nation's sessions.  In 1999 Daisy Langmaid and [[David Joseph Henry]] took part in 10th commemorative meeting of the UNCRC in Geneva.  In 2001 James Anderson and Lucy Mason took part in the Special Session on Children in New York. Many of its key members have gone on to become [[Human Rights]] activists.

Article 12 also produced a report in 2000. It was called Respect and was "a report into how well Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is put into Practice across the UK". The team who produced this report called themselves CR2000, which stood for Children's Rights 20000. The report was put together by the members of CR2000 conducting interviews and research with children in schools, youth groups etc., gaining their opinions and views on how well their rights were upheld and how much their opinions were heard. Members of the team were :

Anna Fisher,
Daisy Langmaid,
Emma Richardson,
Francine Lansdown,
Georgia Lansdown,
Hossnieh Nayyeri,
James Anderson,
Laura Fisher,
Lucy Mason,
Michael Baker,
Millie Collins,
Robert O'Farrell,
Tamsin Landells,

This organisation is no longer active but its work continues through CRAE and work of former members who continue to work in the young people's rights movement.

{{moreref|date=July 2008}}

The '''Automatic Transmitter Identification System''' ('''ATIS''') is a [[communications protocol]] used for the [[station identification]] of [[television channel]]s carried on [[satellite TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.G. Johannsen|title=Automatic transmitter identification system|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|date=1992|volume=38|page=127-132|issn=0018-9316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATIS is only required for [[analog TV]] transmission and only via satellites or [[earth station]]s under [[United States]] jurisdiction. It is continuously repeated whilst an earth station is using a [[transponder]] on a satellite. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules for ATIS are set forth in [[CFR Title 47|47]] [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] §25.281.

The system was developed in response to the [[Captain Midnight (HBO)|"Captain Midnight"]] satellite jamming incident. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award#2009 Awards|Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]] for ATIS.

ATIS is a [[Morse code]] transmission sent on a [[subcarrier]] of 7.1&amp;nbsp;MHz and must activate automatically any time the station is transmitting. The [[center frequency]] must be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;kHz from this [[nominal value]] and the [[frequency deviation]] must be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;kHz peak when being [[modulation|modulated]]. Injection must be at a minimum of −26[[decibel|dB]] referenced to the [[unmodulated carrier]]. The [[pure tone|tone]] used to modulate the subcarrier is nominally 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, but may vary by as much as 800&amp;nbsp;Hz (400 to 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The ATIS message is sent at a [[bit rate|transmission rate]] of 15 to 25 [[words per minute]] and must not exceed 30 seconds in its entire length. The message includes the FCC-assigned [[callsign]] of the earth station, its [[telephone number]], a ten-digit [[serial number]], and sometimes other information which is voluntary. The telephone number must immediately connect to personnel who can resolve [[radio interference]] and other [[frequency coordination]] issues. The serial number cannot be easily changed.

ATIS encoders must be included in the [[uplink]] [[airchain]] of all transmitters as of March 1, 1991 "in a method that cannot easily be defeated".

Other subcarriers piggybacked on the [[video]] carrier are also included in transmissions, often at 6.2&amp;nbsp;MHz and 6.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, just above the [[bandpass]] of the video signal (even if [[TV scrambling|scrambled]]). These carry left and right [[stereophonic|stereo]] audio and [[second audio program]], and sometimes [[radio station]]s or [[radio network]]s which may be unrelated to the [[TV network]]. [[Backhaul (broadcasting)|Backhaul]]s are too intermittent for such uses but may carry in-house private audio channels instead. Because all of these, including ATIS, are all audio, they can all be tuned by an analog [[TVRO]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. However, [[digital TV]] has overtaken analog because multiple channels can be transmitted on one transponder. These signals carry their station ID as [[data]] instead.

'''Beekeeping in Ukraine''' is a major [[economic activity]]. 700,000 people, 1.5% of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] population, are engaged in the production of [[honey]]. Ukraine is ranked as the number one country in [[Europe]] and among the top five countries in the world for honey production, producing 75 thousand [[metric ton|metric tons]] annually&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.souz-inform.com.ua/index.php?language=ukr&amp;menu=article/honey_market_review Honey Market Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ukraine's gross honey production was 66,500 tonnes in 2014, of which 36,300 tonnes were exported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.info/economics/1114653-ukrainian-honey-exports-on-rise-in-h1.html UNIAN: Ukrainian honey exports on rise in H1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 World Beekeeping Congress was held in October of 2013 in [[Kiev]], Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5fd2b1aa990e63193af2a573d&amp;id=d02449ad62&amp;e=076a74d5d1 American Bee Journal: International Honey Market, May 16, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petro Prokopovych]] ({{lang-uk|Петро Прокопович|italic=yes}}) (1775–1850) was the founder of [[beekeeping|commercial beekeeping]]. He introduced novelties in traditional beekeeping that allowed for great advancement in the field. Among his most important inventions was a [[hive frame]] in a separate honey chamber of his [[beehive]]. He also invented a crude [[queen excluder]] between brood and honey chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Haydak, M.H. (1957) ''Petro Prokopovich – Ukrainian beekeeper, teacher and scientist.''

The Ukraine National Beekeeping Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://unbm.org.ua/ The Ukraine National Beekeeping Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; located in Kiev is one of the world's largest beekeeping museums. It contains displays about beekeeping history, hive types, smoker display, art, and other areas of beekeeping. The grounds include a library and laboratory for beekeeping.

'''Busk Land''' ({{lang-pl|ziemia buska}}, [[Latin]]: Тerraе Buscensis) was an administrative unit of Polish county level ([[ziemia]]) in both the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was part of [[Belz Voivodeship]], and existed from the 15th century until the [[Partitions of Poland]], when its territory was annexed by the [[Habsburg Empire]] (1772).

It was named after the town of [[Busk, Ukraine|Busk]] (now [[Ukraine]]) and unlike the other subdivisions of the [[Belz Voivodeship]], it was the only one that was not county (powiat).

'''{{lang|is|Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur}}''' ({{IPA-is|ˈpaːijarɪns ˈpɛstʏ ˈpʰɪlsʏr̥}}, {{lang-en|The Town's Best Sausages}}), is a small chain of [[hot dog]] stands located in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]].

== History ==

The chain has been in continuous operation since 1937 when the first stand was set up on Austurstræti street at the very centre of the city by the grandfather of the current owner, Guðrún Kristmundsdóttir. In the 1960s, it moved two streets north to {{lang|is|Tryggvagata}}, across from the [[Harpa (concert hall)|Harpa Concert Hall]], where the current flagship stand remains today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexandra Young|title=Bæjarins Beztu, Seriously|url=http://grapevine.is/culture/food/2010/07/07/food-baejarins-beztu-seriously/|website=The Reykjavík Grapevine|accessdate=8 August 2015|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, the stand was visited by former United States president [[Bill Clinton]] while he was visiting Iceland for a [[UNICEF]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton fékk sér pylsu á Bæjarins bestu|url=https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2004/08/24/clinton_fekk_ser_pylsu_a_baejarins_bestu/|accessdate=17 April 2018|work=[[Morgunblaðið]]|date=24 August 2004|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fyrrum íorseti á Bæjarins bestu Clinton vildi bara sinnep|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=5478135|accessdate=17 April 2018|work=[[Dagblaðið Vísir]]|date=25 August 2004|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This celebrity appearance led to a boost in popularity for the stand as it began appearing in tourism guidebooks on Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selur bestu pylsur í Evrópu|url=https://www.mbl.is/vidskipti/frettir/2016/11/02/baejarins_bestu_faerast_til/|accessdate=17 April 2018|work=[[Vísir.is]]|date=22 August 2006|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in August 2006, the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' selected {{lang|is|Bæjarins Beztu}} as the best hot dog stand in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five best European food stalls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/aug/12/travelfoodanddrink.foodanddrink.guardiansaturdaytravelsection|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 August 2015|language=English|date=12 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the chain is popular with both tourists and locals. There are three additional locations in the city,&lt;ref name="Opening Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opnunartími|url=http://bbp.is/category/opnunartimi|website=Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together sell over one thousand hot dogs on a busy day.

[[Image:Hot dog from Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Hot dog from Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur]]

{{lang|is|Bæjarins Beztu}} sells hot dogs that are lamb-based with pork and beef. They're served in a bun with a choice of condiments: ketchup, sweet mustard, [[remoulade]], [[Fried onion#Crisp fried onions|crisp fried onion]] and raw onion. Customers who want everything often use the Icelandic phrase "''{{lang|is|eina með öllu}}''" ({{lang-en|"one with everything"}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tori Haschka|title=Is This the Best Hot Dog in the World?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victoria-haschka/best-hot-dog-in-the-world-iceland_b_844305.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 August 2015|language=English|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|March}}, a hot dog costs 450 [[Icelandic króna|krónur]] (€4).

'''CFCA-FM''' is a Canadian radio station  licensed to transmit from [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Ontario]] and serving the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality|Waterloo Region]] area broadcasting at 105.3 FM. The station currently plays a [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40/CHR]] format branded as ''105.3 Virgin Radio'' and is owned by [[Bell Media]].

CFCA's studios &amp; offices are located in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], and their transmitter is on [[Baden Hill]] also known as the [[Baden Tower]], just west of the Kitchener city limits.

Based on the current format, CFCA-FM competes with [[CKBT-FM]].

==History==
CFCA was first launched on 106.1 FM in 1949 by local broadcaster [[Carl Pollock|Carl A. Pollock]]. It was the first FM radio station in Canada to operate independently, without an [[AM radio]] sister station. Due to the limited audience reach of FM radio at the time, however, the station left the air in 1951. Pollock subsequently launched television station [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in 1954 and AM radio station [[CKKW-FM|CKKW]] in 1959, and then relaunched CFCA in 1967 as an [[easy listening]] station. Pollock's broadcast holdings became part of [[Electrohome]] in 1970.

CFCA and CKKW were tentatively sold in 1992 to a local consortium consisting of Jack Schoone, a former local radio announcer, and Irving Zucker, a former owner of competing stations [[CKGL]] and [[CHYM-FM]], but the deal fell through and the stations were instead acquired by [[CHUM Radio]] in 1993. By then the station had migrated from its beautiful music/easy listening sound to a brighter [[adult contemporary]] format. On August 12, 1994 at Noon, CFCA flipped to [[classic rock]] as ''105.3 Kool FM''.

During the early 2000s, the station added pop/rock songs into their playlist, and shifted towards [[Hot AC]].

[[CTVglobemedia]] became the stations' owner when it acquired CHUM Radio in [[2007 in radio|2007]], and is currently owned by [[Bell Media]] since 2011.

[[Image:CFCA-FM.png|thumb|150px|left|Former "Kool" logo (2012-2016)]]
On July 26, 2016, CFCA began stunting with [[Christmas music]], while teasing a change to come that Friday (July 29) at Noon. At that time, CFCA flipped to [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40/CHR]], branded as ''105.3 Virgin Radio'', making CFCA the 8th station in Canada to utilize the "Virgin Radio" branding. (At the same time as CFCA's flip, sister [[CJCH-FM]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] rebranded to "Virgin".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Brent|title=Kool-FM lays off staff in advance of expected format change|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/6786302-kool-fm-lays-off-staff-in-advance-of-expected-format-change/|publisher=Waterloo Region Record|accessdate=18 September 2016|quote=Radio industry websites RadioInsight and Puget Sound Radio both reported that the station is expected to be reborn as a Virgin Radio "contemporary hit radio" station.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/107433/kool-christmas-stunt-in-kitchener-on/|title=Kool Christmas Stunt In Kitchener ON - RadioInsight|author=|date=26 July 2016|website=radioinsight.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/107445/more-virgin-radio-for-canada/|title=Virgin Radio Launches In Halifax &amp; Kitchener - RadioInsight|author=|date=29 July 2016|website=radioinsight.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729172858/https://twitter.com/BellMediaPR/status/759059923539988480|title=Bell Media PR on Twitter: "Bell Media Radio Extends Canada's #1 Hit Music Brand as 105.3 Becomes 105-3 Virgin Radio @VirginRadio_KW"|author=|date=29 July 2016|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formatchange.com/cfca-becomes-105-3-virgin-radio/|title=CFCA Becomes 105.3 Virgin Radio - Format Change Archive|author=|date=30 July 2016|website=formatchange.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first song on "Virgin" was "[[This Is What You Came For]]" by [[Calvin Harris]].

The '''Calor Village of the Year''' comprised 4 annual competitions organised by [[Liquified petroleum gas|gas]] provider [[Calor Gas|Calor]] to identify the villages that best met the following criteria: "a well-balanced, pro-active, caring community which has made the best of local opportunities to maintain and enhance the quality of life for all residents".

Four separate competitions were run:
* '''Calor Scottish Community of the Year'''
* '''Calor Village of the Year for England'''
* '''Calor Village of the Year for Wales'''
* '''Calor Village of the Year Northern Ireland'''

The competitions began in 1997 and ran yearly until 2009. Some 1,650 villages entered the competitions each year.

'''European Imaging and Sound Association''' is a collaboration between different [[multimedia]] magazines, that offer tests of [[camera]]s, [[videocamera]]s, audio equipment, [[mobile phone]]s, etc. The organization was established in 1982. The current president of EISA is [[Paul Miller]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}.

In 2018 the organisation was renamed as the '''Expert Imaging and Sound Association''' to reflect new members from outside the European area, including Australian magazines '''Sound+Image''' and '''Australian Hi-Fi''', and US magazines '''Stereophile''' and '''Sound and Vision'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">{{Politics of the European Union}} The '''Committee on Foreign Affairs''' (AFET, after the French name "Affaires étrangères"), previously called '''Political Affairs''', is a [[committee]] of the [[European Parliament]]. Composed of 75 members and 74 substitutes, it has two subcommittees: the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]] (DROI) and the [[Subcommittee on Security and Defence]] (SEDE).

Foreign affairs is not an area that Parliament has much power over, yet attracts a high proportion of the more well-known and influential MEPs given the prestige of the area{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

The '''Flag of the City of [[Madrid]]''' represents the city's [[Coat of arms of Madrid|coat of arms]] centred on a [[crimson]] field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munimadrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid/menuitem.8522c2ac1498b7f5b1e77112b95286a0/?vgnextoid=739d9d2e3fd4f010VgnVCM1000009b25680aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=00dfb351fd18d010VgnVCM1000009b25680aRCRD&amp;idSubPage=3 Ordinance ANM 1988\2 of the Madrid Council]&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is made either in the proportions 3:5 or 2:3, and in shades of crimson corresponding to [[Pantone]] 207 or 208.

The significance of the bear leaning against a [[Arbutus unedo|madroño]], or strawberry tree, is unknown however, the tree is native to Madrid. One known theory is that bear and tree represent a farming rights dispute between the clergy and citizens. The seven stars supposedly represent the seven stars in the [[Big Dipper|Starry Plough]] constellation closest to the [[Ursa Major]] (Great Bear) Constellation. These stars symbolise the North and therefore, since North is the direction on which all others are based, the stars represent Madrid as the seat of government for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/madrid/madrid.htm Madrid the Capital of Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flamingosi''' ({{lang-sr|Фламингоси}}) was a popular [[Serbia]]n-[[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.co.rs/cms/view.php?id=446516|title=Pjesmom na pesmu

Renato) and actor [[Marinko Madžgalj]] (a.k.a. Valentino).  The group was founded in the summer of 2005. Their style was a mix of typical Serbian Folk, rock and jazz. They became a big hit that year, in turn gaining mass popularity. Together with the [[folk-jazz]] singer [[Ljubiša Stojanović Louis|Louis]] they were the favourites to win the national pre-selection for the [[2006 Eurovision Song Contest]], [[Evropesma]] with their song ''Ludi letnji ples'' (Crazy Summer Dance), however due to the [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|dispute]] they came second, eventually [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]] having to pull out of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2006.

The duo hosted a Serbian game show called [[Ciao Darwin]] (Ћао, Дaрвинe, ''Ćao, Darvine'') on [[RTV Pink]]. [[Marinko Madžgalj]] died in 2016, after a long illness.

The '''Global Economic Symposium''' (abbreviated ''GES'') is an annual conference organized by the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy]] and the [[Bertelsmann Stiftung]] in cooperation with the [[German National Library of Economics]] (ZBW) – Leibniz Information Centre for Economics – that seeks to address global problems and formulate socially desirable responses. The GES primarily focuses on problems that cannot be solved by individual countries or organizations alone and therefore require global cooperation between leading policy makers, business executives, academics and other representatives of civil communities. [[José Manuel Barroso]], President of the [[European Commission]] is the Patron of the GES. The conferences each year are attended by more than 400 people from around the globe, among them Nobel Laureates, Ministers, EU-Commissioners, CEOs and Academics.

==Annual Meetings==

===GES 2008===
The first annual Global Economic Symposium convened at Schloss Plön [[Plön Castle]] in the city of  [[Plön]], Schleswig-Holstein, Germany on September 4–5th 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Handelsblatt]] web site {{De icon}}[https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/nachrichten/ein-hauch-von-davos-in-der-holsteinischen-schweiz;2034298]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/review-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===GES 2009===
The Global Economic Symposium (GES) 2009 addressed the question “Where do we go from here?”. The GES 2009 was also held at Schloss Plön on September 10–11th 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/review-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===GES 2010===
The GES 2010 addressed the issue of “Achieving Sustainability in the Face of Systemic Risks.” Hosted by the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] the GES 2010 took place in [[Istanbul]] on September 28- 29th 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,718835,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/review-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===GES 2011===
The overarching theme of the GES 2011 is “New Forces of Global Governance”. The GES 2011 will take place in the city of [[Kiel]], Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the hometown of the Kiel Institute, on October 5–6th 2011. The location of the GES will continue to alternate between Schleswig-Holstein and a major international center. Next year’s GES will be held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertelsmann Stiftung]] web site {{De icon}}[http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xchg/bst/hs.xsl/nachrichten_106623.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/review-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The Symposium is divided into four themes, ''The Global Economy'', ''The Global Society'', ''The Global Environment'' and ''The Global Polity'', each of which includes a number of panel sessions that deal with specific problems relevant to the global economy. Unlike at other symposia the sessions at the GES are meant to be primarily solution-oriented, that is, moderators are asked to focus discussions on suggested solutions. In order not to stifle creative thinking and open discussion the session are off-the-record.

===Advisory Board===
The Advisory Board of the GES provides advice on the development of the GES. It may suggest themes and special events at the GES, and helps attract insightful, top-flight participants. The honorary Chairperson of the Advisory Board is former German Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Other members include Nobel Laureates, Ministers, CEOs and high-level representatives of the Civil Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/communities/advisory-board&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Economic Partnership (GEP)===
The Global Economic Partnership aims to identify business strategies and economic policies that address the challenges discussed during the GES.

===Global Economic Solutions===
The main publication of the GES, entitled ''Global Economic Solutions'', summarizes areas of agreement and disagreement concerning suggested solutions to the problems discussed in each session. It is meant to stimulate an ongoing discussion that eventually feeds back into the next Global Economic Symposium. To this end, it is presented at major international institutions like the [[European Commission]] or the [[OECD]]. The Global Economic Solutions 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 have been published by the Kiel Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/solutions/solutions&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participants===
Participants of the GES take an active part in the open discussions following each panel debate. Furthermore, they have the right to contribute to the discussion of policy and strategy proposals in the Virtual GES, the web-based communication and information platform containing suggested policy recommendations and business strategies as well as state-of-the-art research publications.

===Global Economic Fellows Program===
The aim of the Global Economic Fellows Program is to promote the initiatives of young, exceptionally promising individuals in the mission of global problem-solving. This program is meant to initiate an ongoing international effort that taps some of the brightest minds of the next generation to identify, evaluate and implement solutions to global problems.

===Global Economic Student Association (GESA)===
The goal of the Global Economic Student Association (GESA) is to expose bright, active, promising students from around the world to the challenges of global problem-solving. Through this Community, university students are exposed to the debates on how to deal with major global problems and are called to contribute to this debate.
Members of the GESA contribute their ideas on global problem-solving. The discussions will take place in the GESA Solution Fora. Members are invited to suggest and discuss topics of global importance and develop concrete solutions proposals for them. The authors of the best contributions will receive the GES Outstanding Young Scholars Award, entitling them to participation in the GES and interaction with the senior GES Community.

==Quotes==
[[Dennis Snower]] (Director of the GES and President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy): 
''“The present Age of Globalization must now be supplemented by an Age of Global Cooperation, where shared goals motivate diverse stakeholders to pull in the same direction.”''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/solutions/publications/global-economic-solutions/global-economic-solutions-2008-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessio Brown (Executive Director of the GES):
''"The GES is a facilitating movement. The underlying idea is that if we all join forces to solve problems that affect us all, we are more likely to recognize our common  humanity and our common destiny than if we address global problems from the perspective of special interest groups or focus all our attention on national, cultural, and religious rivalries."''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/solutions/publications/global-economic-solutions/global-economic-solutions-2009-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Joffe]] (Publisher-Editor, DIE ZEIT)
''“Take Germany’s most renowned economics institute, add one of the country’s most beautiful spots, Lake Ploen, and you get the Global Economic Symposium, a gathering of first-rate minds that will soon become a global household term.”''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/review-2008/table-of-contents/quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valaoritis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Aristotelis Valaoritis]]]]

The term '''Heptanese School of literature''' ({{lang-el|Επτανησιακή Σχολή|links=no}}, literally: "The School of the [[Ionian Islands|Seven Islands]]", also known as the '''Ionian School''') denotes the literary production of the Ionian Island's literature figures from the late 18th century till the end of the 19th century. The center of this production is considered to be the poet [[Dionysios Solomos]], so its periods are conventionally divided as follows: Pre-Solomian poets (Προσολωμικοί ποιητές), Solomian poets, Post-Solomian poets, Minors and Descendants.

==General traits==
Some general traits of the Ionian style were:
*the use of [[Dimotiki]] instead of [[Katharevousa]] (with some exceptions),
*the manifest influence that the contemporary [[Italian literature#The revival in the 18th century|Italian poets]] had in its thematology, that is regarding the depiction of real-life scenes,
*the worship of homeland,
*the worship of nature,
*a "[[Romanticism#Visual art and literature|romantic]] impulse" (also described as [[folkloric idealism]]),
*an emphasis on the importance of love and freedom,
*an appreciation of religion's role in man's life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">The '''Holly King''' is a speculative archetype of modern studies of [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] which has been popularized in some [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religions. In his book ''[[The White Goddess]]'', the author [[Robert Graves]] proposed that the mythological figure of the Holly King represents one half of the year, while the other is personified by his counterpart and adversary the '''Oak King''': the two battle endlessly as the seasons turn. At [[Midsummer]] the Oak King is at the height of his strength, while the Holly King is at his weakest. The Holly King begins to regain his power, and at the Autumn Equinox, the tables finally turn in the Holly King's favor; his strength peaks at [[Winter solstice|Midwinter]].  Graves identified a number of paired hero-figures which he believes are variants of this myth, including [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]] and [[Gronw Pebr]], [[Gwyn ap Nudd|Gwyn]] and [[Gwythr ap Greidawl|Gwythr]], [[Lugh]] and [[Balor]], [[Sir Balan|Balan]] and [[Sir Balin|Balin]], [[Gawain and the Green Knight]], the robin and the wren, and even [[Jesus]] and [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Graves]]|title=The White Goddess; a historical grammar of poetic myth |year=1978|publisher=Octagon Books|location=New York|isbn=9780374932398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;

A similar idea was suggested previously by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his work ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' in Chapter XXVIII, ''The Killing of The Tree Spirit'' in the section entitled ''The Battle of Summer and Winter''.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;&lt;ref name=bough/&gt;&lt;ref name=uu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anna Franklin|title=Midsummer|url=http://www.merciangathering.com/coamhain.htm|publisher=merciangathering.com|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer drew parallels between the folk-customs associated with [[May Day]] or the changing seasons in [[Scandinavia]]n, [[Bavaria]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures, amongst others, in support of this theory.&lt;ref name=bough&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir [[James George Frazer]]|title=[[The Golden Bough|The golden bough; a study in magic and religion, Volume 6]]|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Divine King of Frazer was split into the kings of winter and summer in Graves' work.&lt;ref name=williamson&gt;{{cite book|author=John Williamson|title=The oak king, the holly king, and the unicorn: the myths and symbolism of the unicorn tapestries |year=1986|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=9780060155308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uu&gt;{{cite web|title=Pagan Readings|url=http://www.uueugene.org/CUUPs/Readings.html|publisher=uueugene.org|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pairs are seen as the dual aspects of the male Earth deity, one ruling the waxing year, the other ruling the waning year. [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]] and [[Janet Farrar]], following Graves' theory, gave a similar interpretation to [[Wicca]]n seasonal rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farrar, Janet and Stewart|title=Eight Sabbats for Witches, revised edition|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|year=1988|isbn=0-919345-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joanne Pearson, the Holly King is represented by [[holly]] and other [[evergreen]]s, and personifies the dark half of the [[Wicca]]n [[Wheel of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanne Pearson|title=A Popular Dictionary of Paganism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3W02UMPejRwC |year=2002|pages=80|location=London|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd|isbn=9780700715916}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also seen by some Neopagans as an early inspiration for the [[Father Christmas]] legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raven Grimassi |title=Encyclopedia of Wicca &amp; Witchcraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzp63ep-MlQC |year=2000|pages=219|location=St Paul, Minnesota|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9781567182576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle of light with dark is commonly played out in traditional folk dance and [[mummers play]]s across Britain such as [[Calan Mai]] in Wales, [[Mazey Day]] in Cornwall and [[Jack in the Green]] traditions in England which typically include a ritual ''battle'' in some form.

'''Iceland''' ({{Lang-is|Ísland}} {{IPA-is|ˈistlant|}})&lt;ref&gt;''Interinstitutional Style Guide of the European Union'' guidance on Iceland reading "Do not use 'Republic of Iceland'. Although this name is found in some documents, it does not have official status."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[island country]] in the [[North Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], with a population of {{Ispop}} and an area of {{Convert|103000|km2|abbr=on}}, making it the most sparsely populated country in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Statice"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Statistics Iceland|title=Statistics Iceland|work=Government|publisher=The National Statistical Institute of Iceland|date=14 September 2008|url=http://www.statice.is#Govt|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital and largest city is [[Reykjavík]], with Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country being home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is [[High island|volcanically]] and [[geothermal (geology)|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, [[mountains]], and [[glacier]]s, and many [[river|glacial rivers]] flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a [[tundra climate]].

According to the ancient manuscript ''[[Landnámabók]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in 874 AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.&lt;ref name = tomasson/&gt; In the following centuries, [[Norwegians]], and to a lesser extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s (i.e., slaves or serfs) of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin. The island was governed as an [[Icelandic Commonwealth|independent commonwealth]] under the [[Althing]], one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a [[Age of Sturlungs|period of civil strife]], Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced [[Lutheranism]] forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence. In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union|independence in 1918]] and the founding of a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]]. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture, and was among the poorest countries in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.

Iceland has a [[market economy]] with relatively low taxes, compared to other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Tax Database |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125144548/http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and tertiary education for its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |title=The Icelandic Welfare State and the Conditions of Children |last=Ólafsson |first=Stefán |date=12 May 2004 |website=borg.hi.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818131819/http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |archivedate=18 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland ranks high in economic, [[Democracy Index#Democracy Index by country (2017)|democratic]], social stability, and [[Human Development Index#Inequality-adjusted HDI|equality]], currently ranking first in the world by [[List of countries by wealth per adult#List of countries by median and mean wealth per adult (USD)|median wealth per adult]].

[[Culture of Iceland|Icelandic culture]] is founded upon the nation's Scandinavian heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Gael]]ic settlers. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], is descended from [[Old West Norse]] and is closely related to [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Norwegian dialects|West Norwegian dialects]]. The country's cultural heritage includes traditional [[Icelandic cuisine]], [[Icelandic literature]], and [[Sagas of Icelanders|medieval sagas]]. Iceland has the smallest population of any [[Member states of NATO|NATO member]] and is the only one with [[List of countries without armed forces|no standing army]], with a lightly armed [[Icelandic Coast Guard|coast guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Military Balance 2014|publisher = The International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS)|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{See also|Names of Iceland}}
[[File:Norsemen Landing in Iceland.jpg|thumb|left|Norsemen landing in Iceland – a 19th-century depiction by [[Oscar Wergeland]].]]The [[Sagas of Icelanders]] say that a Norwegian named [[Naddodd]] (or Naddador) was the first [[Norsemen|Norseman]] to reach Iceland, and in the 9th century he named it Snæland or "snow land" because it was snowing. Following Naddodd, the Swede [[Garðar Svavarsson]] arrived, and so the island was then called Garðarshólmur which means "Garðar's Isle".

Then came a Viking named [[Flóki Vilgerðarson]]; his daughter drowned en route, then his livestock starved to death. The sagas say that the rather despondent Flóki climbed a mountain and saw a fjord ([[Arnarfjörður]]) full of icebergs, which led him to give the island its new and present name.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;Evans, Andrew. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/iceland-greenland-name-swap/ "Is Iceland Really Green and Greenland Really Icy?"], [[National Geographic]] (June 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that Iceland's Viking settlers chose that name to discourage oversettlement of their verdant isle is a myth.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;

According to both [[Landnámabók]] and [[Íslendingabók]], monks known as the [[Papar]] lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]. Recent [[archaeological]] excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in [[Hafnir]] on the [[Reykjanes|Reykjanes peninsula]]. [[Carbon dating]] indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/A_New_View_on_the_Origin_of_First_Settlers_in_Iceland_0_378670.news.aspx New View on the Origin of First Settlers in Iceland], ''Iceland Review Online'', 4 June 2011.

===The Middle Ages===
{{See also|Age of the Sturlungs}}
[[File:Bolungarvik 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Ósvör'', a replica of an old fishing outpost outside [[Bolungarvík]]]]
The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html|title = The History of Iceland (Gunnar Karlsson)&amp;nbsp;– book review|publisher = Dannyreviews.com|accessdate = 10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal struggles and civil strife of the [[Age of the Sturlungs]] led to the signing of the [[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Old Covenant]] in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)]] to the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and [[Sweden]] were united. After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of [[Denmark–Norway]].

In the ensuing centuries, Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe. Infertile soil, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The [[Black Death]] swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495.&lt;ref&gt;Pulsiano, Phillip and Wolf, Kirsten (1993) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=d-XiZO8V4qUC&amp;pg=PA312 Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia]''.

===Reformation and the Early Modern period===
{{See also|Icelandic Reformation|Danish-Icelandic Trade Monopoly|Móðuharðindin}}
Around the middle of the 16th century, as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]], King [[Christian III of Denmark]] began to impose [[Lutheranism]] on all his subjects. [[Jón Arason]], the last Catholic bishop of [[Hólar]], was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons. The country subsequently became officially Lutheran and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed [[Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly|harsh trade restrictions]] on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruption and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. Pirates from several countries, including the [[Barbary Coast]], raided Iceland's coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Davis, Robert C.|title = Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&amp;pg=PA7|year = 2003|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|isbn = 978-0-333-71966-4|pages = 7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One slaving expedition is inaccurately termed the [[Turkish Abductions]] in Icelandic historiography.

===1814–1918: Independence movement===
{{See also|Icelandic independence movement|Fjölnir (journal)}}
In 1814, following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the [[Treaty of Kiel]] but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the [[New World]], particularly to the region of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], [[Manitoba]] in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as [[New Iceland]]. About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php |title=For Iceland, an exodus of workers |work=The New York Times |date=5 December 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074725/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century, inspired by [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalism|nationalist]] ideas from mainland Europe. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of [[Jón Sigurðsson]], based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the ''[[Fjölnismenn]]'' and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. This was expanded in 1904, and [[Hannes Hafstein]] served as the first [[Minister for Iceland]] in the Danish cabinet.

===1918–1944: Independence and the Kingdom of Iceland===
{{See also|Kingdom of Iceland|Invasion of Iceland|Iceland in World War II}}
[[File:HMS Berwick (65).jpg|right|thumb|{{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} led the British [[invasion of Iceland]]]]

The [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]], an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25&amp;nbsp;years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a [[personal union]] with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the [[Althing]]. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations such as Canada whose sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II.

During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs. A month later, British armed forces [[Operation Fork|invaded and occupied the country]], violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. In 1941, the Government of Iceland invited the United States to take over its defence so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere.

===1944–present: Republic of Iceland===

{{See also|Icelandic constitutional referendum, 1944|Iceland in the Cold War|Cod Wars}}

On 31 December 1943, the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]] expired after 25&amp;nbsp;years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|year = 1944|title = Video: Allies Study Post-War Security Etc. (1944)|url = https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39024|publisher = [[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate = 21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with [[Sveinn Björnsson]] as its first president.

In 1946, the US Defence Force Allied left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of [[NATO]] on 30 March 1949, amid [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|domestic controversy and riots]]. On 5 May 1951, a defence agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the [[Iceland Defence Force]], and remained throughout the [[Cold War]]. The US withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.

Iceland prospered during the Second World War. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial [[economic growth]], driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the US [[Marshall Plan]] programme, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at US$209, with the war-ravaged [[Netherlands]] a distant second at US$109).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=3411|title=Vísindavefurinn: ''Hversu há var Marshallaðstoðin sem Ísland fékk eftir seinni heimsstyrjöld?''|date= 13 May 2003|work=Vísindavefurinn|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Müller, Margrit |author2=Myllyntaus, Timo|title = Pathbreakers: Small European Countries Responding to Globalisation and Deglobalisation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zdXTV8xO3xQC&amp;pg=PA385|year = 2007|publisher = Peter Lang|isbn = 978-3-03911-214-2|pages = 385–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s were marked by the [[Cod Wars]]—several disputes with the [[United Kingdom]] over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Iceland hosted a [[Reykjavík Summit|summit in Reykjavík in 1986]] between United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], during which they took significant steps toward [[nuclear disarmament]]. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognise the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] as they [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|broke away]] from the USSR. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], and [[First Gulf War|Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland joined the [[European Economic Area]] in 1994, after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised. International economic relations increased further after 2001, when Iceland's newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of [[external debt]], contributing to a 32% increase in Iceland's [[gross national income]] between 2002 and 2007.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Financial Times]]|author=Robert Jackson|title=The Big Chill|date=15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statice.is/?PageID=1267&amp;src=https://rannsokn.hagstofa.is/pxen/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=THJ01000%26ti=Overview+of+Gross+Domestic+Product+and+Gross+National+Product+1945%2D2013%26path=../Database/thjodhagsreikningar/landsframleidsla/%26lang=1%26units=Index/percent/number|title=Home – Hagstofa|work=Hagstofa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

{{Details|Geography of Iceland}}

Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The main island is entirely south of the [[Arctic Circle]], which passes through the small Icelandic island of [[Grímsey]] off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63]] and [[68th parallel north|68°N]], and longitudes [[25th meridian west|25]] and [[13th meridian west|13°W]].

Geologically, Iceland is part of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a ridge along which the [[oceanic crust]] spreads and forms new oceanic crust. This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be [[subaerial]] (above the surface of the sea). The ridge marks the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[North American Plate]]s, and Iceland was created by [[rift]]ing and [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] through volcanism along the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/country-and-nature/nature/Geology/ |title=Geology of Iceland |publisher=Iceland.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113144/http://www.iceland.is/country-and-nature/nature/Geology/ |archivedate=14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[fjord]]s punctuate Iceland's 4,970-km-long (3,088-mi) coastline, which is also where most settlements are situated. The island's interior, the [[Highlands of Iceland]], is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand, mountains, and [[lava field]]s. The major towns are the capital city of [[Reykjavík]], along with its outlying towns of [[Kópavogur]], [[Hafnarfjörður]], and [[Garðabær]], nearby [[Reykjanesbær]] where the international airport is located, and the town of [[Akureyri]] in northern Iceland.

A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the [[Iceland hotspot]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes, notably [[Hekla]], [[Eldgjá]], [[Herðubreið]], and [[Eldfell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simmonds |first=Jane |year=1999 |url={{Google books|4-puvJH_lykC|page=PA100|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |title=Iceland |publisher=[[Langenscheidt]] |page=100 |isbn=0-88729-176-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanic eruption of [[Laki]] in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/ice/lec19/holocene.htm |title=Late Holocene climate |author=James S.

Iceland has many [[geyser]]s, including [[Geysir]], from which the English word is derived, and the famous [[Strokkur]], which erupts every 8–10&amp;nbsp;minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a [[2000 Iceland earthquakes|series of earthquakes in 2000]]. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2016/02/21/rare_eruption_of_iceland_s_most_famous_hot_spring_g/ Rare eruption of Iceland's most famous hot spring].

With the widespread availability of [[geothermal power]], and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for [[hydroelectricity]], most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating, and electricity. The island is composed primarily of [[basalt]], a low-[[silica]] lava associated with [[effusive eruption|effusive volcanism]] as has occurred also in [[Hawaii]]. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as [[rhyolite]] and [[andesite]].

Another large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011. This time it was the [[Grímsvötn]] volcano, located under the thick ice of Europe's largest glacier, [[Vatnajökull]]. Grímsvötn is one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull activity, with ash and lava hurled {{Convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere, creating a large cloud.&lt;ref name=connor&gt;{{cite news |title=Steve Connor: Larger ash particles will mean less chaos |date=24 May 2011| work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/steve-connor-larger-ash-particles-will-mean-less-chaos-2288154.html |accessdate=30 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Climate of Iceland}}

The climate of Iceland's coast is [[subarctic climate|subarctic]]. The warm [[North Atlantic Current]] ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world. Regions in the world with similar climates include the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Alaska Peninsula]], and [[Tierra del Fuego]], although these regions are closer to the equator. Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter. Ice incursions are rare, the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamb H. |year=1995 |title=Climate, History and the Modern World |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415127351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate varies between different parts of the island. Generally speaking, the south coast is warmer, wetter, and windier than the north. The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country. Low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid. Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south.

The highest air temperature recorded was {{Convert|30.5|°C|°F}} on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast. The lowest was {{Convert|−38|°C|°F|1}} on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland. The temperature records for Reykjavík are {{Convert|26.2|°C|°F}} on 30 July 2008, and {{Convert|−24.5|°C|°F|1}} on 21 January 1918.

On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there. [[Polar bears]] occasionally come over from [[Greenland]], but they are just visitors, and no Icelandic populations exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.is/Spendyr/polar_bear.htm |title=Polar bears |publisher=Nordic Adventure Travel |accessdate=7 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No native or free-living reptiles or amphibians are on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.is/Spendyr/wild_mammals.htm |title=Wild Mammals in Iceland |publisher=Nordic Adventure Travel |accessdate=7 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. Around three-quarters of the island is barren of vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]''), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (''[[Populus tremula]]''), rowans (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common junipers (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), and other smaller trees, mainly willows.

When the island was first settled, it was extensively forested. In the late 12th century, [[Ari the Wise]] described it in the [[Íslendingabók]] as "forested from mountain to sea shore".&lt;ref name="Dirt"&gt;{{cite book |author=David R. Montgomery |title=Dirt: The Erosion of Civilisations |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |pages=224–225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited [[species richness|species diversity]]. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber.&lt;ref name="wildlife"/&gt; [[Deforestation]], climatic deterioration during the [[Little Ice Age]], and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to [[erosion]]. Today, many farms have been abandoned. Three-quarters of Iceland's 100,000 square kilometres is affected by soil erosion, {{convert|18000|km2|abbr=on}} serious enough to make the land useless.&lt;ref name="Dirt"/&gt; Only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees, but the result does not compare to the original forests. Some of the planted forests include [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name="wildlife" /&gt; The tallest tree in Iceland is a [[sitka spruce]] planted in 1949 in [[Kirkjubæjarklaustur]]; it was measured at {{Convert|25.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skogur.is/um-skograekt-rikisins/frettir/nr/1882 |title=Fyrsta tréð á Íslandi til að rjúfa 25 metra múrinn |language=Icelandic |trans-title=The first tree in Iceland to break the 25 meter barrier |author=Pure Oskarsson |date=26 February 2013 |publisher=Iceland forest service |accessdate=25 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304121114/http://www.skogur.is/um-skograekt-rikisins/frettir/nr/1882 |archive-date=4 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animals of Iceland include the [[Icelandic sheep]], [[Icelandic cattle|cattle]], [[Icelandic chicken|chickens]], [[Icelandic goat|goats]], the sturdy [[Icelandic horse]], and the [[Icelandic Sheepdog]], all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. Wild mammals include the Arctic fox, [[mink]], mice, rats, rabbits, and [[reindeer]]. Polar bears occasionally visit the island, travelling on icebergs from Greenland. In June 2008, two polar bears arrived in the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/06/17/second-polar-bear-killed-in-iceland/ |title=Second polar bear killed in Iceland |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=IceNews |accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marine mammals]] include the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') and [[harbor seal]] (''Phoca vitulina'').

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Iceland}}
[[File:Politics Of Iceland.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|The political system of Iceland]]
Iceland has a [[left–right politics|left–right]] [[multi-party system]]. Following the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2017|2017 parliamentary election]], the biggest parties are the centre-right [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] (''Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn''), the [[Left-Green Movement]] (''Vinstrihreyfingin&amp;nbsp;– grænt framboð'') and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] (''Framsóknarflokkurinn''). These three parties form the current ruling coalition in the cabinet led by leftist [[Katrín Jakobsdóttir]].
Other political parties with seats in the [[Althing]] (Parliament) are the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] (''Samfylkingin''), the [[Centre Party (Iceland)|Centre Party]] (''Miðflokkurinn''), Iceland's [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirates]], the [[People's Party (Iceland, 2016)|People's Party]] (''Flokkur fólksins''), and the [[Reform Party (Iceland)|Reform Party]] (''Viðreisn'').

Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (''Kvennalistinn''), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women. After participating in its first parliamentary elections, the Women's List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chumirethicsfoundation.ca/files/pdf/HANDOUT%20-%20AllWoman'sParty020908.pdf |title=The Icelandic Experience |publisher=Chumirethicsfoundation.ca |accessdate=19 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it disbanded in 1999, merging with the Social Democratic Alliance, it left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women, and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female, compared to the global average of 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|title = Women in national parliaments|publisher = Ipu.org|date = 1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 elections, 48% of members of parliament are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/31/iceland-us-women-in-parliament-congress/ |title=Iceland just elected a record number of women to Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland is a [[representative democracy]] and a [[parliamentary republic]]. The modern parliament, ''Alþingi'' (English: [[Althing]]), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, "it is arguably the world's oldest [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Del Giudice, Marguerite (March 2008) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2008/03/iceland/del-giudice-text "Power Struggle"]. ''National Geographic''. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/ |title=Government &amp; Politics |publisher=Iceland.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153818/http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/ |archivedate=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing, and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/Government/LocalGovernment/ |title=Local Government |publisher=Iceland.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015155838/http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/Government/LocalGovernment/ |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[president of Iceland]] is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-type-of-government-does-iceland-have.html|title=What Type Of Government Does Iceland Have?|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is [[Guðni Th. Jóhannesson]]. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the [[Cabinet of Iceland|cabinet]], is responsible for [[executive (government)|executive]] government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Björnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.

The governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars{{which|date=June 2016}}, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1980, Icelanders elected [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] became prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/11/us-iceland-gaymarriage-idUSTRE65A3V020100611 "Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote"].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Iceland}}
Iceland is divided into regions, constituencies and municipalities. The eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes. District court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division.&lt;ref name = "CIA Govt"/&gt; Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Reykjavík North]]'' and ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Reykjavík South]]'' (city regions);
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Southwest]]'' (four [[Enclave and exclave|non-contiguous]] suburban areas around Reykjavík);
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Northwest]]'' and ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Northeast]]'' (northern half of Iceland, split); and,
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|South]]'' (southern half of Iceland, excluding Reykjavík and suburbs).

The redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country, since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.&lt;ref name = "CIA Govt"/&gt;

74 municipalities in Iceland govern local matters like schools, transport, and zoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statice.is/media/49863/icelandinfigures2016.pdf Iceland in figures 2016]. Statistics Iceland. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the actual [[Administrative division|second-level subdivisions]] of Iceland, as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes. Reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality, about four times more populous than [[Kópavogur]], the second one.&lt;ref name = "CIA Govt"/&gt;

{{Main|Foreign relations of Iceland|Accession of Iceland to the European Union}}

Iceland, which is a member of the [[UN]], [[NATO]], [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]], [[Council of Europe]] and [[OECD]], maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada and the other NATO nations are particularly close. Historically, due to cultural, economic and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a [[Nordic country]], and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the [[Nordic Council]].

Iceland is a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union (EU). It was not a member of the EU, but in July 2009 the Icelandic parliament, the Althing, voted in favour of application for EU membership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author = Associated Press in Reykjavík|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/16/iceland-parliament-votes-eu-membership|title = Icelandic parliament votes for EU membership |work = The Guardian|date = 16 July 2009|accessdate = 10 February 2010|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially applied on 17 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/07/17/iceland.eu.application/index.html|publisher = CNN|title = Iceland applies to join European Union|date = 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, opinion polls showed that many Icelanders were now against joining the EU; following [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 elections]] the two parties that formed the island's new government—the centrist Progressive Party and the right-wing Independence Party—announced they would hold a referendum on EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22624110|title = Icelanders to get a referendum on joining the EU|publisher = BBC News|date = 22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/icleand-new-government-centre-right-coalition-conservative-prime-minister-bjarni-benediktsson-a7519691.html*|title=Iceland has a new government, and it could result in the country joining the EU|date=2017-01-10|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Iceland}}
Iceland has no [[standing army]], but the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] which also maintains the [[Iceland Air Defence System]], and an [[Iceland Crisis Response Unit]] to support peacekeeping missions and perform paramilitary functions.

The [[Iceland Defense Force|Iceland Defense Force (IDF)]] was a [[military]] [[command (military formation)|command]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]] from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created at the request of [[NATO]], came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defense of Iceland. The IDF also consisted of civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations. The IDF was downsized after the end of the [[Cold War]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] maintained four to six [[interceptor aircraft]] at the [[Naval Air Station Keflavik]], until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the [[Icelandic Air Policing]] mission.&lt;ref name = "French_Air_Force_in_Iceland"&gt;{{cite web|title = French Air Force in Iceland|url = http://www.mfa.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4240|publisher = Ministry for Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2 October 2010|date = 5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NATO_ACO"&gt;{{cite web|title = Air Policing|url = http://www.aco.nato.int/page142085426.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100124134809/http://www.aco.nato.int/page142085426.aspx|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 24 January 2010|publisher = NATO Air Command Operations|access-date = 2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite much domestic controversy, deploying a [[Icelandic Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] team to Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhg.is/starfsemi/stjornsyslusvid/frettir/nr/618 |title=Stjórnsýslusvið &lt; Starfsemi &lt; Vefsvæði |publisher=Lhg.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516073708/http://www.lhg.is/starfsemi/stjornsyslusvid/frettir/nr/618 |archive-date=16 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was replaced later by members of the [[Iceland Crisis Response Unit]]. Iceland has also participated in the ongoing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|conflict in Afghanistan]] and the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. Despite the ongoing financial crisis the first [[ICGV Þór|new patrol ship]] in decades was launched on 29 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhg.is/starfsemi/stjornsyslusvid/frettir/nr/1363 |title=Stjórnsýslusvið &lt; Starfsemi &lt; Vefsvæði |publisher=Lhg.is |access-date=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113021551/http://www.lhg.is/starfsemi/stjornsyslusvid/frettir/nr/1363 |archive-date=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland was the neutral host of the historic 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit|Reagan–Gorbachev summit]] in Reykjavík, which set the stage for the end of the [[Cold War]]. Iceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Conflict with the United Kingdom led to a series of so-called [[Cod Wars]], which included confrontations between the Icelandic Coast Guard and the [[Royal Navy]] over British fishermen, in 1952–1956 due to the extension of Iceland's fishing zone from {{Convert|3|to|4|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on|lk = in}}, 1958–1961 following a further extension to {{Convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}, 1972–1973 with another extension to {{Convert|50|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}; and in 1975–1976 another extension to {{Convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

According to the [[Global Peace Index]], Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world, due to its lack of armed forces, low crime rate, and high level of socio-political stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/PDF/2011/2011%20GPI%20Results%20Report.pdf 2011 Methodology, Ethodology, Results &amp; Findings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/668ElP9zm?url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/PDF/2011/2011%20GPI%20Results%20Report.pdf |date=13 March 2012 }}.

In 2007, Iceland was the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|seventh most productive country in the world per capita]] (US$54,858), and the fifth most productive by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP]] at [[purchasing power parity]] ($40,112). About 85 percent of total [[primary energy]] supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://askjaenergy.org/iceland-introduction/energy-data/|title = Energy Data|publisher = Askja Energy – The Independent [[Icelandic Energy Portal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilisation of abundant [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] and [[geothermal power]] has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = World's largest Electricity Producer per Capita|url = http://askjaenergy.org/2012/06/04/worlds-largest-electricity-producer-per-capita/|work = [[Icelandic Energy Portal]]|publisher = Askja Energy|accessdate = 4 August 2013|date = 4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its commitment to renewable energy, the 2016 Global Green Economy Index ranked Iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world.&lt;ref name=ggei&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Green Economy Index|url=http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-2016.pdf |publisher=Dual Citizen LLC|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, Iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force.&lt;ref name = "CIA Govt"/&gt; The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and [[ferrosilicon]]. [[Whaling in Iceland]] has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.org/us/the-embassy/trade-economy/ |title=Trade and Economy, Embassy of Iceland, Undated.

Until the 20th century, Iceland was among the poorest countries in Europe. Currently, it remains one of the most developed countries in the world. Strong economic growth had led Iceland to be ranked [[List of countries by Human Development Index|first]] in the [[United Nations]]' [[Human Development Index]] report for 2007/2008,&lt;ref name = "HDI"/&gt; although in 2011 its HDI rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis.

[[File:W16 Protesters 2659.JPG|thumb|[[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests]]]]
Iceland had been hit especially hard by the [[Great Recession]] that began in December 2007, because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]], [[Landsbanki]] and [[Kaupthing]], their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14&amp;nbsp;billion ($19&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref name = "bbc.1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7852275.stm|title = Waking up to reality in Iceland|publisher = BBC News|accessdate = 27 January 2009|date = 26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/creditors_call_time_on_iceland.html|title=Robert Peston|publisher = BBC|date = 4 October 2008|accessdate = 8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e24.no/spesial/finanskrisen/article2696518.ece |title=Gud velsigne Island!( Finanskrisen, Makro og politkk, Utenriks ) |publisher=E24.no |date=6 October 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120702211413/http://e24.no/spesial/finanskrisen/article2696518.ece |archivedate=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic officials, including central bank governor [[Davíð Oddsson]], stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.

On 28 October 2008, the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18% ({{as of|2010|August|lc=y}}, it was 7%), a move forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). After the rate hike, trading on the Icelandic króna finally resumed on the open market, with valuation at around 250 ISK per Euro, less than one-third the value of the 1:70 exchange rate during most of 2008, and a significant drop from the 1:150 exchange ratio of the week before. On 20 November 2008, the [[Nordic countries]] agreed to lend Iceland $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/nordic-countries-provide-iceland-with-new-loan|title = Nordic countries provide Iceland with new loan|publisher = [[Nordic Council]]|date = 20 November 2008|accessdate = 25 November 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001844/http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/nordic-countries-provide-iceland-with-new-loan|archive-date = 3 December 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the coalition government collapsed due to the public dissent over the handling of the financial crisis. A new left-wing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson and his aides from the bank through changes in law. Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5811719.ece|title = Iceland's central bank chief David Oddsson is forced out|last = Gilmore|first = Gráinne|date = 27 February 2009|work = [[The Times]]|accessdate = 22 April 2010|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]] is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to [[Homeschooling|Home educate]] their children, however under a very strict set of demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Mayor-Does-Not-Feel-School-Should-Be-Mandatory|title = ReadArticle / Mayor Does Not Feel School Should Be Mandatory|language = Is|publisher = Grapevine.is|date = 25 August 2011|accessdate = 22 September 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130501135434/http://grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Mayor-Does-Not-Feel-School-Should-Be-Mandatory|archivedate = 1 May 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.

Nursery school, or ''leikskóli'', is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years, and is the first step in the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible.

Compulsory education, or ''grunnskóli'', comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often is conducted at the same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16&amp;nbsp;years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week. All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity, although an exemption may be considered by the [[Minister of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Minister of Education]].&lt;ref name = "Jonathan Fox"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rE0NcgxNaKEC&amp;pg=PA118|author = Fox, Jonathan|title = A World Survey of Religion and the State (Cambridge Studies in Social Theory, Religion and Politics)|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote = All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity. Formally, only the Minister of Education has the power to exempt students from this but individual schools usually grant informal exemptions.|isbn = 978-0-521-70758-9|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upper secondary education, or ''framhaldsskóli'', follows lower secondary education. These schools are also known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] in English. Though not compulsory, everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the [[University of Iceland]], which has its main campus in central Reykjavík. Other schools offering university-level instruction include [[Reykjavík University]], [[University of Akureyri]], [[Agricultural University of Iceland]] and [[Bifröst University]].

An OECD assessment found 64% of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, which is lower than the OECD average of 73%.

The original population of Iceland was of [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin. This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as [[blood type]] and genetic analyses. One such genetic study indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin, meaning many settlers of Iceland were Norsemen who brought Gaelic slaves with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Helgason|first1 = Agnar|year = 2000|title = Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland|pmc = 1287529|journal = American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 67|issue = 3|pages = 697–717|doi = 10.1086/303046|pmid = 10931763|last2 = Sigureth Ardóttir|first2 = S|last3 = Nicholson|first3 = J|last4 = Sykes|first4 = B|last5 = Hill|first5 = EW|last6 = Bradley|first6 = DG|last7 = Bosnes|first7 = V|last8 = Gulcher|first8 = JR|last9 = Ward|first9 = R|displayauthors = 9|last10 = Stefánsson|first10 = Kári}}

Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the [[Settlement of Iceland|Age of Settlement]]. The biopharmaceutical company [[deCODE genetics]] has funded the creation of a [[genealogy]] database that is intended to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called ''[[Íslendingabók (genealogical database)|Íslendingabók]]'', as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.

The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and [[bubonic plague]]s adversely affected the population several times.&lt;ref name = tomasson&gt;{{Cite book|last = Tomasson|first = Richard F.|title = Iceland, the first new society|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|year = 1980|isbn = 0-8166-0913-6|page = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 37 [[famine]] years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lancaster|first=H.

Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14&amp;nbsp;years old or younger.

In December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of the total population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, including children of Icelandic parents living abroad. Around 19,000 people (6% of the population) held foreign citizenship. [[Polish diaspora|Polish]] people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin, and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce. About 8,000 Poles now live in Iceland, 1,500 of them in [[Fjarðabyggð]] where they make up 75% of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572 |title=Iceland: Migration Appears Here Too&amp;nbsp;– IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511062508/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent increase in [[immigration]] has been credited{{by whom|date=November 2014}} to a [[labour shortage]] due to the booming economy at the time, as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Large-scale construction projects in the east of Iceland (see [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]]) have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary.

The southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region. It is also the location of the capital Reykjavík, the northernmost national capital in the world. The largest towns outside the Greater Reykjavík area are [[Akureyri]] and [[Reykjanesbær]], although the latter is relatively close to the capital.

{{See also|Icelandic name}}
Iceland's official written and spoken language is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] descended from [[Old Norse]]. In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun [[inflection]], and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages. The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation. Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the [[runic]] letter [[Þ]] in [[Latin script]]. The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is [[Faroese language|Faroese]].

[[Icelandic Sign Language]] was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011. In education, its use for Iceland's deaf community is [[Legal recognition of sign languages|regulated]] by the ''National Curriculum Guide''.

[[English language|English]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. English is widely understood and spoken, while basic to moderate knowledge of Danish is common mainly among the older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/icelandic_language/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013003321/http://www.icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/icelandic_language/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2006 |title=Icelandic Language |work=Iceland Trade Directory |publisher=icelandexport.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish language|Polish]] is mostly spoken by the local Polish community (the largest minority of Iceland), and Danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to Swedes and Norwegians—it is often referred to as ''skandinavíska'' (i. e. ''Scandinavian'') in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heimur.is/heimur/leit/frettir/Default.asp?ew_1_a_id=138249 |title=Heimur&amp;nbsp;– Útgáfufyrirtækið |publisher=Heimur.is |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511213824/http://www.heimur.is/heimur/leit/frettir/Default.asp?ew_1_a_id=138249 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than using family names, as is the usual custom in most Western nations, Icelanders carry [[patronymic]] or [[matronymic]] surnames, patronyms being far more commonly practiced. Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father, while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother. These follow the person's given name, e.g. ''Elísabet Jónsdóttir'' ("Elísabet, Jón's daughter" (Jón, being the father)) or ''Ólafur Katrínarson'' ("Ólafur, Katrín's son" (Katrín being the mother)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Surnames Surnames – Nordic Names Wiki – Name Origin, Meaning and Statistics]. Nordicnames.de (16 September 2013). Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Icelanders refer to one another by their given name, and the Icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel-wonders.com/2009/09/28/the-icelandic-phonebook-surprise/ The Icelandic Phonebook Surprise|Travel Wonders of the World].

{{Quote|text=The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the State Church in Iceland and, as such, it shall be supported and protected by the State.|author=Article 62, Section IV of [[Constitution of Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Iceland|url=http://www.government.is/constitution/|publisher=Government of Iceland|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Registers Iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen. In 2017, Icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows:
* 67.22% members of the [[Church of Iceland]];
* 11.56% members of other [[Christianity in Iceland|Christian]] denomination;
* 11.29% other religions and not specified;
* 6.69% unaffiliated;
* 1.19% members of [[Heathenism (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathen]] groups (99% of them belonging to [[Ásatrúarfélagið]]);
* 0.67% members of the [[Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association]];
* 0.55% members of [[Zuism|Zuist]] groups.

Iceland is a very [[secular]] country; as with other Nordic nations, [[church attendance]] is relatively low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/1997/Dec97/chr121097a|title = University of Michigan News Service|publisher = Umich.edu|date = 10 December 1997|accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iceland.is/people-and-society/Religion/|title = Religion &lt; People and Society &lt; Iceland.is&amp;nbsp;– Gateway to Iceland|publisher = Iceland.is|accessdate = 26 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301083304/http://www.iceland.is/people-and-society/Religion/|archive-date=1 March 2010|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations, which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population.

&lt;/ref&gt; A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57% of Icelanders considered themselves "religious", 31% considered themselves "non-religious", while 10% defined themselves as "convinced atheists", placing Iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world.&lt;ref name="Religion-and-Atheism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf|title = Global index of religion and atheism|accessdate = 10 October 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf|archivedate = 21 October 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelanders registered in the state church, the Church of Iceland, is declining rapidly, at a rate of more than 1% per year.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Iceland}}
Icelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions. [[Icelandic literature]] is popular, in particular the [[sagas of Icelanders|sagas]] and [[edda]]s that were written during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]]. Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the [[Icelandic language]], which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hvert norðulandamálanna fimm líkist mest frumnorrænu?|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=47634|website=Vísindavefurinn|accessdate=12 September 2017|language=is|date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to other Nordic countries, Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency; in a public opinion analysis conducted by the [[European Commission]], over 85% of Icelanders believe independence is "very important," compared to 47% of Norwegians, 49% of Danes, and an average of 53% for the EU25.&lt;ref name="europeancommission"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |title=Social values, Science and Technology analysis |publisher=European Commission Eurobarometer |date=June 2005 |page=35 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524004644/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic, working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 65, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll conducted by the OECD, 66% of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives, while 70% believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future. Similarly, 83% reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones, compared to an OECD average of 72%, which makes Iceland one of the [[happiest country|happiest countries]] in the OECD.&lt;ref name = "Iceland – OECD Better Life Index"/&gt; A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives, compared to a global average of about 53%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/01/05/iceland-among-the-happiest-nations/|title = Iceland among the happiest nations|publisher = Icenews.is|date = 5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland is liberal with regard to [[LGBT]] rights issues. In 1996, the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create [[registered partnership]]s for same-sex couples, conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. In 2006, parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment. On 11 June 2010, the [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law]], making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]]s. The law took effect on 27 June 2010.&lt;ref name = "gaymarriage"&gt;{{cite web|title = Iceland parliament votes for gay marriage|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/11/iceland-parliament-votes-for-gay-marriage/|publisher = Icenews.is|accessdate = 9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible, and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name = "gaymarriage"/&gt;

Icelanders are known for their deep sense of community: An OECD survey found that 98% believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need, higher than in any other industrialised country. Similarly, only 6% reported "rarely" or "never" socialising with others.&lt;ref name = "Iceland – OECD Better Life Index"/&gt; This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egalitarianism]] is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated1"/&gt; The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges, titles, and ranks.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated60"&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone is addressed by their first name. As in other Nordic countries, equality between the sexes is very high; Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/galleries/2011/09/18/the-best-places-to-be-a-woman-photos.html#slide2 Best and Worst Countries for Women, from Iceland to the U.S. to Pakistan and Afghanistan].

===Literature===
{{Main|Icelandic literature}}In 2011, Reykjavik was designated a UNESCO City of Literature.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/25/167537939/literary-iceland-revels-in-its-annual-christmas-book-flood|title=Literary Iceland Revels In Its Annual 'Christmas Book Flood'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Möðruvallabók f13r.jpg|thumb|A page of [[Njáls saga]] from [[Möðruvallabók]]. The sagas are a significant part of the Icelandic heritage]]
Iceland's best-known classical works of literature are the [[Icelanders' sagas]], prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include ''[[Njáls saga]]'', about an epic blood feud, and ''[[Grænlendinga saga]]'' and ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Eiríks saga]]'', describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). ''[[Egils saga]]'', ''[[Laxdæla saga]]'', ''[[Grettis saga]]'', ''[[Gísla saga]]'' and ''[[Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu]]'' are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.

A translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the [[Passion Hymns]] of [[Hallgrímur Pétursson]], and ''[[rímur]]'', rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, ''rímur'' were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, [[Romantic nationalism|National-Romantic]] writer [[Jónas Hallgrímsson]]. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halldór Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.

Icelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated60"/&gt; Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = Cultural Achievements|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most books in Iceland are sold between late September to early November. This time period is known as ''Jolabokaflod'', the Christmas Book Flood.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Flood begins with the Iceland Publisher's Association distributing ''Bokatidindi'', a catalog of all new publications, free to each Icelandic home.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Art===
{{Main|Icelandic art}}
The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for [[History of Iceland#Home rule and sovereignty|home rule and independence]], which was very active in the mid-19th century.

Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of [[Þórarinn Þorláksson]], who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in [[Copenhagen]], returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]], who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur. These included [[Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval|Jóhannes Kjarval]] and [[Júlíana Sveinsdóttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar Hákonarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.

In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&amp;|title=Kling &amp; Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjavík Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Iceland}}
[[File:Bjork Hurricane.jpg|thumb|Singer-songwriter [[Björk]], the best-known Icelandic musician]]
Much Icelandic music is related to [[Nordic music]], and includes [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music|pop]] traditions. Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock acts such as [[The Sugarcubes]], [[Sóley]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], pop singers such as [[Hafdís Huld]], [[Emilíana Torrini]] and [[Björk]], solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], and [[post-rock]] bands such as [[Amiina]] and [[Sigur Rós]]. [[Independent music]] is strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[múm]] and solo artists.

Traditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmoniums]]. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) "Iceland". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp.&amp;nbsp;168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was [[Sigurður Breiðfjörð]] (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.{{Clarify|reason = What is Iðunn?

Among Iceland's best-known classical composers are [[Daníel Bjarnason]] and [[Anna S. Þorvaldsdóttir]] (Anna Thorvaldsdottir), who in 2012 received the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] and in 2015 was chosen as the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s Kravis Emerging Composer, an honor that includes a $50,000 cash prize and a commission to write a composition for the orchestra; she is the second recipient.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cooper, "Philharmonic Chooses Anna Thorvaldsdottir for Emerging Composer Program," New York Times, 5 June 2015, URL=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/philharmonic-chooses-anna-thorvaldsdottir-for-emerging-composer-porgram/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national anthem]] of Iceland is ''[[Lofsöngur]]'', written by [[Matthías Jochumsson]], with music by [[Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Icelandic National Anthem|work = musik og saga|accessdate = 11 November 2005|url = http://www.musik.is/Lof/E/lofe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Icelandic cuisine|Þorramatur}}
[[File:Thorramatur.jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[Þorramatur]] assortment]]
Much of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], and [[dairy product]]s, with little to no utilisation of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. [[Þorramatur]] is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of [[Month#Germanic calendar|Þorri]], which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include [[skyr]] (a yoghurt-like cheese), [[hákarl]] (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and [[black pudding]], Flatkaka (flat bread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas.&lt;ref name="Icelandic delicacies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thorkelsdottir|first1=Nina|title=The ultimate guide to Icelandic delicacies, part one|url=https://www.travelade.com/iceland/stories/the-ultimate-guide-to-icelandic-delicacies-part-one/|website=Travelade|publisher=Nina Thorkelsdottir|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puffin]] is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.

Breakfast usually consists of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch may take the form of a [[smörgåsbord]]. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikjöt]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkjöt''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[slátur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.

Coffee is a popular beverage in Iceland, with the country being third placed by per capita consumption worldwide in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is drunk at breakfast, after meals, and with a light snack in mid-afternoon. [[Coca-Cola]] is also widely consumed, to the extent that the country is said to have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland's signature alcoholic beverage is ''[[brennivín]]'' (literally "burnt [i.e., distilled] wine"), which is similar in flavouring to the [[akvavit]] variant of Scandinavian [[brännvin]]. It is a type of [[schnapps]] made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either [[caraway]] seeds or [[angelica]]. Its potency&lt;!-- in combination with the fact that it had a white scull on the black label, as a warning, according to the wp article, but that needs sources --&gt; has earned it the nickname ''svarti dauði'' ("Black Death"). Modern distilleries on Iceland produce [[vodka]] ([[Reyka]]), [[gin]] (Ísafold), [[moss]] schnapps (Fjallagrasa), and a [[birch]]-flavoured schnapps and [[liqueur]] (Foss Distillery's Birkir and Björk). Martin Miller blends Icelandic water with its England-distilled gin on the island. Strong beer was [[Prohibition in Iceland|banned until 1989]], so ''bjórlíki'', a mixture of legal, low-alcohol [[pilsner]] beer and vodka, became popular. Several strong beers are now made by Icelandic breweries.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Iceland}}
[[File:Iceland's Olympic Handball Team, Beijing 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Iceland national handball team]] (pictured) [[Handball at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|won the silver medal]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. [[Team handball|Handball]] is considered Iceland's national sport.&lt;ref name=handball/&gt;]]
Sport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The main traditional sport in Iceland is ''[[Glíma]]'', a form of [[wrestling]] thought to have originated in medieval times.

[[File:FWC 2018 - Group D - ARG v ISL - Photo 195.jpg|thumb|Iceland fans at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia]]Popular sports include [[association football|football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[basketball]].

They recorded a draw against later winners [[Portuguese national football team|Portugal]] in the group stage, and defeated [[England national football team|England]] 2–1 in the round of 16, with goals from [[Ragnar Sigurðsson]] and [[Kolbeinn Sigþórsson]].

For both the European and the world championship, Iceland is to date the smallest nation in terms of population to qualify.

Iceland is also the smallest country to ever qualify for [[Eurobasket]]. They did it in both 2015 and 2017. Although Iceland has had great success qualifying for [[Eurobasket]], they have not managed to win a single game in the European Basketball final stages.

Iceland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Iceland is also a world-class destination for alpine ski touring and [[Telemark skiing]], with the Troll Peninsula in Northern Iceland being the main centre of activity. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless lots of golf courses throughout the island, and Iceland has a greater percentage of the population playing golf than Scotland with over 17,000 registered golfers out of a population of approximately 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tee Off In The Midnight Sun of Reykjavik|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/other-sport/golf/tee-midnight-sun-reykjavik-4449000|accessdate=4 May 2016|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland hosts an annual international golf tournament known as the Arctic Open played through the night during the summer solstice at [[Akureyri Golf Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective, Volume 4|date=2008|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781589806160|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = w111&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland has also won the second most [[World's Strongest Man]] competitions of any country with nine titles, including four by both [[Magnús Ver Magnússon]] and [[Jón Páll Sigmarsson]] and most recently [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]] in 2018.

Iceland is also one of the leading countries in [[ocean rowing]], Icelandic rower [[Fiann Paul]] became the fastest and the most record-breaking ocean rower. He has claimed overall speed [[Guinness World Records]] for the fastest rowing of all four oceans (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Arctic) in a [[Human-powered watercraft|man-powered row boat]], as well as the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] title of the first rower to ever hold the record for all four oceans simultaneously, claiming 24 Guinness  World Records in total for Iceland by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/articles/speaking-with-the-men-of-the-record-breaking-polar-row-expedition-w501659|title=Freezing Temps and Rotting Hands: Speaking With the Men of the Record-Breaking Polar Row Expedition|work=Men's Journal|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/8/polar-row-exploration-team-smashes-world-records-i/|title='Polar Row' exploration team smashes world records in icy north|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-boyd/team-uniting-nations-on-p_b_10930774.html|title=Team Uniting Nations On Pace To Shatter A World Record In Rowing|last=Boyd|first=Marc|date=2016-07-12|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guinnessworldrecords.com/search?term=%22Fiann%20Paul%22&amp;page=2|title=Guinness World Records by Fiann Paul|last=|first=|date=|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915221950/https://guinnessworldrecords.com/search?term%3D%22Fiann+Paul%22%26page%3D2|archive-date=2018-09-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming is popular in Iceland. Geothermally heated outdoor pools are widespread, and swimming courses are a mandatory part of the national curriculum.&lt;ref name = w111/&gt; [[Horseback riding]], which was historically the most prevalent form of transportation on the island, remains a common pursuit for many Icelanders.

The oldest sport association in Iceland is the Reykjavík Shooting Association, founded in 1867. Rifle shooting became very popular in the 19th century with the encouragement of politicians and nationalists who were pushing for Icelandic independence. To this day, it remains a significant pastime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skotfélag Reykjavíkur |accessdate=2 September 2007 |url=http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013013843/http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland has also produced many chess masters and hosted the historic [[World Chess Championship 1972]] in Reykjavík during the height of the [[Cold War]]. {{As of|2008}}, there have been nine Icelandic chess grandmasters, a considerable number given the small size of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bridge (card game)|Bridge]] is also popular, with Iceland participating in a number of international tournaments. Iceland won the world bridge championship (the [[Bermuda Bowl]]) in Yokohama, Japan, in 1991 and took second place (with Sweden) in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1950.

[[File:Johnny Strange world first Globe of Death sword swallow.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Globe of Death sword swallow]]
In 2014 Johnny Strange made headlines in several national and international newspapers after teaming up with stunt rider, Vesko Lesev, to perform a unique sword swallowing stunt in [[Brussels, Belgium]], when he became the first person to swallow a sword inside the [[Globe of death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripleys.com/?attachment_id=26295 |title=johnny strange sword swallower globe of death 3 – Ripley's Believe It or Not! |website=''Ripleys.com'' |accessdate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205093552/http://www.ripleys.com/?attachment_id=26295 |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strange swallowed a 17-inch long sword blade while standing in the centre of a 5-meter round steel mesh ball as a motorbike rode around him at speeds in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (70&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/11644722.VIDEO__Blackburn_stunt_man_performs_world_s_first____Globe_of_Death______inside_five_meter_cage/ |title=VIDEO: Blackburn stunt man performs world's first ‘Globe of Death’ – inside five-meter cage (From Lancashire Telegraph) |website=''Lancashiretelegraph.co.uk'' |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange has been quoted as saying that it took three years of practising to master the art of sword swallowing, and that he had to practice daily to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/photos/wc_15_september/johnny_strange_entertainer/ |title=Johnny Strange – gallery – from Lancashire Telegraph |website=''Lancashiretelegraph.co.uk'' |date=17 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say;

''"I have been performing sword swallowing for a few years now, it is extremely dangerous. Lesev is a great rider, the skill he shows in the Globe of Death fascinates me but teaming up was still no easy decision to make. There is a lot of trust needed on both parties as one false move could have had devastating consequences for either of us. I have performed in Belgium before but have never performed in Brussels until now, there was an amazing atmosphere and the audiences throughout the weekend were fantastic."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediazink.com/dare-devil-sharp-act-swallow/ |title=Dare devil has sharp act to swallow |website=''MediaZink.com'' |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the inherent danger and dedication required to perform such a stunt there are very few sword swallowers in the world, with the Sword Swallowers Association International (SSAI) listing Johnny Strange as one of Europe's last actively performing professional sword swallowers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swordswallow.com/performers.php/:&lt;br&gt;''Actively Performing Professional Sword Swallowers.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conquest of Mallorca by James I of Aragon 01.jpg|thumb|[[Conquest of Majorca]] by [[James I of Aragon]] (1229)]]

The '''Kingdom of Majorca''' ({{lang-ca|Regne de Mallorca}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈreŋnə ðə məˈʎɔɾkə|IPA}}; {{lang-es|Reino de Mallorca}}; {{lang-la|Regnum Maioricae}}) was founded by [[James I of Aragon]], also known as ''James The Conqueror''. After the death of his firstborn son Alfonso, a will was written in 1262 and created the kingdom to cede it to his son James. The disposition was maintained during successive versions of his will and so when James I died in 1276, the [[Crown of Aragon]] passed to his eldest son [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter]], known as Peter III of Aragon or ''Peter the Great''. The Kingdom of Majorca passed to James, who reigned under the name of [[James II of Majorca]]. After 1279, Peter III of Aragon established that the king of Majorca was a vassal to the king of Aragon. The title continued to be employed by the Aragonese and Spanish monarchs until its dissolution by the 1715 [[Nueva Planta decrees]].

==Geography==
The kingdom included the [[Balearic Islands]]:  [[Majorca]], [[Menorca]] (which was still under the rule of Muslims until 1231 when its sovereignty was surrendered to James I), [[Ibiza]] and [[Formentera]]. The king was also lord of the mainland counties of [[Roussillon]] and [[Cerdanya]], and the territories James I kept in [[Occitania]]: the signory of [[Montpellier]], the viscountcy of [[Carlat]] in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and the barony of [[Aumelas]], contiguous with Montpellier.

==History==
The legacy of James I included the creation of a strategic Mediterranean enclave, including territories between two large kingdoms, the [[House of Capet|Capetians]] of [[France]] and the Crown of Aragon, which were in constant conflict at the time. Conscious of the fragility of the Kingdom of Majorca, James I undertook the conquest of Cerdanya to unify the new kingdom. He also entered into negotiations to arrange the marriage of his son James to Beatrice of [[Savoy]], daughter to [[Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy|Count Amadeus of Savoy]]. Neither plan was successful.

On the death of James I, the new king of Majorca, [[James II of Majorca|James II]], decided not to pay tribute to [[Peter III of Aragon]]. Preoccupied with diverse problems within the realm, it was not until 1279 when the Majorcan monarch reconciled to have his states recognized as subordinate to the king of Aragon. As a consequence the Kingdom of Majorca could not hold court, and the king of Majorca was forced to go to [[Catalonia]] to present tribute to the king of Aragon. By means of the [[Treaty of Perpignan]] in 1279, an imbalance of power between the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Majorca was created. The Aragonese king maintained the political and economic control of Aragon over the Kingdom of Majorca, reestablishing the unified jurisdiction of the Crown of Aragon, which was broken by the will of James I. This treaty would condition relations between the Kingdom of Majorca and the Crown of Aragon throughout the former's existence. The lack of courts later aggravated the destabilization of a kingdom already on the brink of fracture, which, besides this, lacked any common institution beyond the monarchy.

During the [[Aragonese Crusade]], James II of Majorca allied himself with the Pope and the French against Peter of Aragon. As a result, Peter's successor [[Alfonso III of Aragon|Alfonso]] conquered the kingdom in 1286. However, by the [[Treaty of Anagni]] in 1295, [[James II of Aragon]] was required to restore the Balearics to James of Majorca.

On the death of James II of Majorca's son [[Sancho of Majorca|Sancho]] in 1324, [[James III of Majorca|James III]] took the throne at the age of nine, necessitating a regency council headed by his uncle [[Philip of Majorca|Philip]] to govern the realm. The situation was difficult since James II of Aragon did not renounce his claim to the Majorcan throne. In 1325, Philip secured the renunciation by the Aragonian king of any claim on the rights of succession of the Majorcan throne after the repayment of a great debt incurred by Sancho during an invasion by [[Sardinia]]. While the act solved the problem of succession, it also plunged the kingdom into a serious financial crisis.

James was forced to develop policies similar to that of Aragon's. To that end, he was forced to participate in the war against [[Genoa]] (1329-1336), which resulted in the loss of various economic markets for the kingdom. Again, it was necessary to impose new taxes and fines on the Jewish community though this was insufficient to resolve the financial crisis. The problems of the kingdom did not appear to have an end since in 1341, [[Peter IV of Aragon]] closed relations with the Kingdom of Majorca as a prelude to invasion. In May 1343, Peter IV invaded the Balearic Islands and followed that in 1344 with the invasions of the counties of [[Roussillon]] and [[Cerdanya]]. James III was able to keep only his French possessions. After the sale of these possessions to the king of France in 1349, James III left for Majorca. He was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Llucmajor]] on 25 October 1349. Then, the Kingdom of Majorca was definitively incorporated into the Crown of Aragon.

==Fall of Majorca==
The extinction of the Kingdom of Majorca was inevitable given the conflicts by which it was affected: the [[Hundred Years War]] between [[France]] and [[England]]; the war of the ''benimerines'', which involved [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and the Crown of Aragon as well as attempts by the Genoese to make the Balearics a satellite state. The kingdom of Majorca, which had bonds of vassalage with the crowns of France (through Montpellier) and Aragon, could not remain neutral during the conflicts. In addition, increased taxes to fund the kingdom's economy during its neutrality managed to unsettle the people of the kingdom.

==Plot==
Somewhere in southern Africa, in a huge region populated by poor peasants, two friends dream of a better life, far from their village, and decide to leave and make their dream come true. To leave, they attempt to repair an old car with second-hand spare parts, but their family and friends make fun of them. Little by little, their impetus dies down and so does their friendship. Finally, bitterness and jealousy put an end to the friendship between the two men and they become fierce enemies.

'''"L-imħabba"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Love") was the [[Malta|Maltese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]], performed in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] by [[Helen &amp; Joseph]].

The song is a mid-tempo [[duet]] with the singers describing a search to find the answer to the question of "What is youth's big love?" Initially, they ask this of "wise men, philosophers and poets" and receive the answer that "Love is a kiss" - a word present in Maltese, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], English and [[German language|German]] (in the plural) in the lyrics. Subsequently, the pair asks "freaks, [[Hells Angels]] and [[hippie]]s" the same question and receives the same answer, with the unusual image of a notorious motorcycle gang answering the question in such a way being remarked upon by Des Mangan in his study of the Contest.

Finally, the pair explain that the Italians, Spanish, Germans, English and Maltese all answer the question in the same way - thus explaining the translated word "kiss" in the chorus.

The song was performed ninth on the night (following [[Switzerland]]'s [[Véronique Müller]] with "[[C'Est La Chanson De Mon Amour]]" and preceding [[Finland]]'s [[Päivi Paunu]] &amp; [[Kim Floor]] with "[[Muistathan]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 48 points, placing 18th (last) in a field of 18. The abnormally high last-place score by contemporary standards is due to the voting system in place at the time, which guaranteed all songs at least 34 points.
After this the group Helen &amp; Joseph also named "9 th group"

Following their failure to move beyond last place with their first two entries, Malta opted not to enter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] or [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] Contests, but returned the year after that. Hence, the song was succeeded as [[Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest|Maltese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Contest]] by [[Renato Micallef|Renato]] with "[[Singing This Song]]".

'''MAT Airways''' was an airline based in [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Its main base was [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport]].

==History==
The biggest Serbian tourist agency Kon Tiki Travel, Belgrade, and Metropolitan Investment Group, Belgrade, in accordance with Macedonian statutory regulations have established the new air transport company. The airline leased its first aircraft from [[Aviogenex]], however, this plane has been returned to its owner.

[[Skywings International Airlines]], Macedonia’s largest charter airline, was left without an operating license and decided to merge with its rival MAT, with the aim of reducing costs and optimizing operations. As a result, MAT operated 2 aircraft.
In May 2011 Skywings decided to split from MAT, only a month after they merged.

On Monday, 4 July it was announced that MAT Airways has suspended its services. Their only aircraft is currently grounded and it's not announced when they will resume flights.
The Macedonian Civil Aviation Agency says that it did not play a part in MAT’s service suspension and adds that the airline has a permit to operate flights from Skopje and Ohrid to Zurich, Düsseldorf, Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna and Copenhagen until June 15, 2012.

On Friday, 15 July MAT Airways resumed their services. The airline voluntarily grounded its sole aircraft, a Boeing 737-500. According to MAT’s management it did so in order to review its position on the market in face of increased competition. However, other sources claim that the airline has been having financial problems.

==Destinations==
According to the Skopje Airport and MAT Airways websites, MAT operated the following service (as of May 2011):

It is served as a first course soup if the main ingredients are vegetables, but it can be served as a main course if it is made of "stronger ingredients" such as [[meat]].

In Greek cooking manestra is the name used for a rice-like pasta (see [[Orzo (pasta)|orzo]]), often used in casseroles and soups, or for a tomato-based vegetable stew made with the pasta.

'''Offshoring''' is the relocation of a [[business process]] from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Typically this refers to a [[company]] business, although state governments may also employ offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;"The Offshoring of American Government", Cornell Law Review, Nov. 2008, available: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143044&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, offshoring has been associated primarily with the [[outsourcing]] of technical and administrative services supporting domestic and global operations from outside the home country ("[[offshore outsourcing]]"), by means of internal (captive) or external (outsourcing) delivery models.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1287369 |title=SSRN-A Dynamic Perspective on Next-Generation Offshoring: The Global Sourcing of Science and Engineering Talent |authors=Stephan Manning, Silvia Massini, Arie Lewin |journal=[[Academy of Management Perspectives]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=35–54|publisher=[[Social Science Electronic Publishing]]|date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=|doi=10.5465/amp.2008.34587994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is in use in several distinct but closely related ways.  It is sometimes used broadly to include substitution of a service from any foreign source for a service formerly produced internally to the firm.  In other cases, only imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included.  A further complication is that intermediate goods, such as partially completed computers, are not consistently included in the scope of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See "Appendix II: Definitions of Offshoring" in General Accounting Office: "International Trade: Current Government Data Provide Limited Insight into Offshoring of Services", September 2004.  Imported intermediate goods are included in offshoring in "Swenson, D: "International Outsourcing", in ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring. After its accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 2001, the [[People's Republic of China]] emerged as a prominent destination for production offshoring. Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.

The economic logic is to reduce costs, sometimes called [[labor arbitrage]], to improve corporate profitability. Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services (generally a lower-cost labor country), but are subtracted in the higher-cost labor country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=Milosz|date=2016-06-22|title=Labour arbitrage: the lifecycle of a global production node|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography|volume=5|issue=2|pages=106–122|doi=10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|issn=2046-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the United States due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569567-european-jobs-are-not-coming-back-because-few-them-went-first-place-staying-put|title=Staying put. European jobs are not coming back because few of them went in the first place|date=January 2013|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequently used terms ==
Offshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same or another company in another, different country. Almost always work is moved because of a lower cost of operations in the new location. More recently, offshoring drivers also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and increasing speed to market.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; Offshoring is sometimes contrasted with [[outsourcing]] or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Outsourcing is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. Outsourcing refers to the process by which an organization gives part of its work to another firm / organization and makes it responsible for most of the applications as well as the design of the enterprise business process. This process is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns. However, subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring.

Related terms include [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting [[United States]]-based business processes to [[Canada]]/[[Latin America]]); inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the "best shore" based on various criteria. [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] &amp; [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced.
More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.

A further term sometimes associated with offshoring is [[bodyshopping]] which is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.

=== Production offshoring ===
Production offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes to a lower-cost destination. Examples of production offshoring include the manufacture of electronic components in [[Costa Rica]], production of apparel, toys, and consumer goods in China, [[Vietnam]] etc.

Product design, research and the development process that leads to new products, are relatively difficult to offshore. This is because research and development, in order to improve products and create new reference designs, require a skill set that is harder to obtain in regions with cheap labor. For this reason, in many cases only the manufacturing will be offshored by a company wishing to reduce costs.

However, there is a relationship between offshoring and patent-system strength. This is because companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.

A major incentive for [[physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]]. This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, T: "China, Inc." Scribner, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; NAFTA has increased the velocity at which [[physical restructuring]] is occurring.

=== IT-enabled services offshoring ===
The growth of IT-enabled services offshoring is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s. This was seen all the way up to the year 2000. Coupled with the digitization of many services, it was possible to shift the actual production location of services to low-cost countries in a manner theoretically transparent to end-users. Services include administrative services, such as finance and accounting, HR, and legal; call centers; marketing and sales services; IT infrastructure; application development; and knowledge services, including engineering support, product design, research and development, and analytics.

India first benefited from the offshoring trend, as it has a large pool of [[English language|English]] speaking people and technically proficient manpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=cgirs Working Through Outsourcing: Software Practice, Industry Organization and Industry Evolution in India] Kyle Eischen. eScholarship Repository, 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; India's offshoring industry took root in low-end IT functions in the early 1990s and has since moved to back-office processes such as call centers and transaction processing. This spawned the [[neologism]] ''Bangalored'', used to indicate a [[layoff]], often systemic, and usually resulting from corporate [[outsourcing]] to lower wage economies – derived from [[Bangalore]] in [[India]], where some of the first outsource centers were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-ban1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Bangalored|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, India's low-cost labor has made it an offshoring destination for global firms like [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Accenture]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Cisco]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]].

Because of inflation, high domestic interest rates, robust economic growth and increased IT offshoring, the Indian IT sector has witnessed 10 - 15% wage growth in the 21st century. Consequently, Indian's operations and firms are concerned that they are becoming too expensive in comparison with competition from the other offshoring destinations. To maintain high growth rates, attempts have been made to grow up the value chain and diversify to other high-end work in addition to software and hardware engineering. These jobs include research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, [[medical transcription]], and more.

The choice of offshoring destination is often made according to cultural concerns. Japanese companies are starting to outsource to China, where large numbers of Japanese speakers can be found—particularly in the city of [[Dalian]], which was Japanese-occupied Chinese territory for decades (this is discussed in the book ''[[The World is Flat]]''). German companies tend to outsource to [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, such as [[Poland]] and [[Romania]], where proficiency in German is common.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephan |last=Manning |first2=Jörg |last2=Sydow |first3=Arnold |last3=Windeler |title=Securing Access to Lower-cost Talent Globally: The Dynamics of Active Embedding and Field Structuration |journal=Regional Studies |volume=46 |year=2012 |issue=9 |pages=1201–1218 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2011.571243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French companies outsource to North Africa for similar reasons. For Australian IT companies, [[Indonesia]] is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.

Other offshoring destinations include [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/technology/colombia-moves-towards-top-of-outsourcing-a-list-says-nearshore-americas|title=Colombia Moves Towards Top of Outsourcing A-List|work=BnAmericas|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries.

The [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) made [[nearshoring]] more attractive between the Central American countries of [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] and the US.

=== Innovation offshoring ===
Once companies are comfortable with services offerings and started realizing the cost savings, many high-tech product companies, including some in [[Silicon Valley]], started offshoring innovation work to countries like [[Colombia]], [[Belarus]], South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. Accessing the talent pools in these countries has the potential to cut costs or even shorten product lifecycles. Developing countries like India are also involved in this practice.

When offshoring knowledge work, firms heavily rely on the availability of technical personnel at offshore locations. One of the challenges in offshoring engineering innovation is a reduction in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moe|first=Nils Brede|last2=Šmite|first2=Darja|last3=Hanssen|first3=Geir Kjetil|last4=Barney|first4=Hamish|date=2013-08-29|title=From offshore outsourcing to insourcing and partnerships: four failed outsourcing attempts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1225–1258|doi=10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|issn=1382-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure access to talent and possibly improve long-term quality, Western firms often establish collaborative relationships with technical universities abroad and thereby customize university programs to serve their particular needs. Examples include universities in Shanghai, such as [[Tong-Ji University]], where German firms and scholars co-sponsor labs, courses, and provide internships. Similar examples of collaborative arrangements can be found in Eastern Europe, e.g. Romania.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Additionally, EU companies looking for IT innovation often setup collaboration with universities in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine, which have a high percentage of ICT graduates and overall a very skilled IT labor.&lt;ref&gt;Opportunities for EU ICT Actors. Oct 2009. http://www.eeca-ict.eu/uploads/dmdocuments/Opportunities_Report_for_EU_ICT_actors_in_UKRAINE.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327141043/http://www.eeca-ict.eu/uploads/dmdocuments/Opportunities_Report_for_EU_ICT_actors_in_UKRAINE.pdf |date=2014-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways to mitigate quality challenges include dual exposure between Western and offshore development teams, significant interview period, equity options for key personnel, and PR presence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/27/build-an-offshore-development-team-that-wont-suck/|title=Build An Offshore Development Team That Won’t Suck|last=Mikado|first=Mikita|date=2015-11-27|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

===Re-shoring===

"Re-shoring", also known as "backshoring"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.workforce.com/section/09/feature/25/27/70/ |title=Workforce Management Online, Dec 2007 |access-date=2010-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217231946/http://www.workforce.com/section/09/feature/25/27/70 |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "inshoring"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inshoring |publisher=Mike Karlesky |date=17 May 2005 |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/inshoring.asp |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is offshoring that has been brought back onshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/91918/reshoring-bringing-back-jobs-to-usa|title=Reshoring Bringing Back Jobs to USA|author=Zacks Investment Research|date=29 April 2015|work=Zacks Investment Research|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Urry (distinguished professor of sociology at [[Lancaster University]]) argues that the concealment of income, the avoidance of taxation and eluding legislation relating to work, finance, pleasure, waste, energy and security may be becoming a serious concern for democratic governments and ordinary citizens who may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] mature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Offshoring|author=John Urry|date=14 April 2014|isbn= 978-0745664866|publisher=polity UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of intellectual property ==
Offshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.

== Debate ==
Offshoring has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists, some of which overlap those related to the topic of [[free trade]]. It is seen as benefiting both the origin and destination country through [[free trade]], providing jobs to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country. This makes both sides see increased [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).  And the total number of jobs increases in both countries since those workers in the origin country that lost their job can move to higher-value jobs in which their country has a [[comparative advantage]].

On the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition to offshoring. Experts argue that the quality of any new jobs in developed countries are less than the jobs lost and offer lower pay.  Economists against offshoring charge that currency manipulation by governments and their central banks causes the difference in labor cost creating an illusion of comparative advantage.  Further, they point out that even more educated highly trained workers with higher-value jobs such as software engineers, accountants, radiologists, and journalists in the developed world have been displaced by highly educated and cheaper workers from India and China. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador [[Ernest H. Preeg]] testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the [[International Monetary Fund]] Articles of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest H. Preeg (May 1, 2002). [http://www.mapi.net/html/testimony2.html Testimony on Chinese Currency Manipulation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427064913/http://www.mapi.net/html/testimony2.html |date=2006-04-27 }} Manufacturers Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on jobs in western countries===
''The Economist'' reported in January 2013 that: "High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards offshoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring The Economist-Here, there and everywhere-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2007 that while free trade among high-wage countries is viewed as win-win, free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html NYT-Paul Krugman-Trouble with Trade-December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Two estimates of the impact of offshoring on U.S. jobs were between 150,000 and 300,000 per year from 2004-2015. This represents 10-15% of U.S. job creation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569568-offshored-jobs-return-rich-countries-must-prove-they-have-what-it-takes-shape The Economist-What to Do Now: Shape Up-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the U.S. due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

The study also found that "offshoring increases real wages for both high- and low-skilled workers, but more so for the former, increasing inequality." 

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; highlights how offshoring can shape the demand for skills in receiving countries and explores how increasing automation can lead to [[reshoring]] of production in some cases.

===Legal implications in Japan===
Japanese companies use offshoring to exploit foreign laborers, particularly Chinese and Vietnamese, in violation of the Employment Security Act and Labor Standard Act guidelines set by the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]]. Article 44 of the Employment Security Act implicitly bans unauthorized companies supplying domestic/foreign workers, regardless of their operating locations. The laws apply if at least one party among suppliers, clients and workers reside in Japan, and if the workers are part of the integral part of the chain of command of the client company or the supplier:

{{Cquote|No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.|Employment Security Act}}

{{Cquote|Unless permitted by act, no person shall obtain profit by intervening, as a business, in the employment of other|Labor Standards Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?yo=%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E5%9F%BA%E6%BA%96%E6%B3%95&amp;ft=2&amp;re=01&amp;ky=|title=日本法令外国語訳データベースシステム - [法令本文表示] - 労働基準法|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Employment Security Act sets punishment guidelines as follows:

{{Cquote|A person who falls under any of the following items shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen|Employment Security Act states, Article 64}}

Victims can lodge a criminal complaint against the CEO's of the suppliers and clients to the Labor Standards Inspection Office (in the case of the Labor Standards Act) or Public Prosecutor's Office in the company's location. Due to the risk of CEO's arrest, Japanese companies tend to privately settle with plaintiffs, offering between 20 and 100 million JPY (approximately 200,000 - 1 million USD) in damages.

===Competitive concerns===
In 2015, IT employment in the United States has recently reached pre-2001 levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=185303797|title=IT Employment Reaches Record High In U.S.|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2006/08/us_tech_workers.html|title=Business Technology News and Commentary - InformationWeek|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been rising since. The number of jobs lost to offshoring is less than 1 percent of the total US labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/bg1757.cfm|title=Myths and Realities: The False Crisis of Outsourcing|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=29 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303032902/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/bg1757.cfm|archive-date=3 March 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by the Heritage foundation, outsourcing represents a very small proportion of jobs lost in the US. The total number of jobs lost to offshoring, both manufacturing and technical represent only 4 percent of the total jobs lost in the US. Major reasons for cutting jobs are from contract completion and downsizing.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/34690 |title=Samuelson: Debunking the Great Offshoring Myth |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists and commentators claim that the offshoring phenomenon is way overblown.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
U.S. opinion polls indicate that between 76-95% of Americans surveyed agreed that "outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more people aren't being hired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703466104575529753735783116|title=Americans Sour on Trade|author=Sara Murray And Douglas Belkin|date=2 October 2010|work=WSJ|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/146915/americans-top-job-creation-idea-stop-sending-work-overseas.aspx|title=Americans’ Top Job–Creation Idea: Stop Sending Work Overseas|author=Gallup, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of factor of production mobility ==
According to [[classical economics]], the three [[factors of production]] are [[land (economics)|land]], [[labor (economics)|labor]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]].  Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of two of these factors.  That is, how offshoring affects economies depends on how easily capital and labor can be repurposed. Land, as a factor of production, is generally seen to have little or no mobility potential.

The effects of [[capital mobility]] on offshoring have been widely discussed.  In [[microeconomics]], a corporation must be able to spend [[working capital]] to afford the initial costs of offshoring.  If the state heavily regulates how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.  Generally, those who favor offshoring support capital mobility, and those who oppose offshoring call for greater [[regulation]].

Labor mobility also plays a major role, and it is hotly debated. When computers and the Internet made work electronically portable, the forces of free market resulted in a global mobility of work in the services industry. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if they have to obtain employment by downpricing themselves back into the labor market (by accepting lower salaries) or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.

Offshoring faces criticism from labor scholars who argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|url=http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0896920515623076|journal=Critical Sociology|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the developed world, moving manufacturing jobs out of the country dates to at least the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;General Accounting Office: [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06423.pdf "Offshoring:  U.S. Semiconductor and Software Industries Increasingly Produce in China and India"], September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while moving knowledge service jobs offshore dates to the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.012|title=History of offshoring knowledge services|journal=Journal of Operations Management|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141|year=2008|last1=Metters|first1=Richard|last2=Verma|first2=Rohit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued since then.  It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.

During the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication crossed with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the [[Internet]], particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the [[World Wide Web]] reduced "transportation" costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Baase |title=A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet |edition=Third |location=Harlow |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-13-600848-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the Internet, many new categories of work such as call centres, computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], medical transcription, income tax preparation, and title searching are being offshored.

Before the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU. Because of Ireland's relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech "boom" and which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect. As concerns are widespread about uneven bargaining powers, and risks and benefits, negotiations are often difficult, such that the plan to create free trade areas (such as [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]) has not yet been successful. In 2005, offshoring of skilled work, also referred to as knowledge work, dramatically increased from the US, which fed the growing worries about threats of job loss.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">'''Sky Horse''' ({{zh|c=天馬飛彈|p=Tiānmǎ Fēidàn}}) is a ballistic missile developed secretly by [[Taiwan]] in the late 1970s, with a considerable number being produced.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/12/09/0000014179/1 |title=Lien says Taiwan needs new long-range missile |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2017-02-11 |accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Sky Horse was developed by the [[National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology]] (CSIST), and was associated with the country's then-secret nuclear weapons program.

The Sky Horse project was cancelled partly due to pressure from the USA, and partly so that the CSIST could concentrate on the [[Sky Bow]] missile.&lt;ref name="Mistry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dinshaw Mistry|title=Containing Missile Proliferation: Strategic Technology, Security Regimes, and International Cooperation in Arms Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9gTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|date=20 June 2013|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80252-7|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were calls to revive the program in response to China's missile threats during 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref name="EdmondsTsai2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Edmonds|author2=Michael Tsai|title=Taiwan's Security and Air Power: Taiwan's Defense Against the Air Threat from Mainland China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69t_AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|date=23 November 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-35053-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Taiwanese official admitted that Taiwan was 'taken aback by China's moves', and there were fears that these could lead to an arms race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-21/news/mn-49672_1_theater-missile-defense/2 |title=China's Missile Launches Threaten to Trigger an Arms Race in Asia - Page 2 - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1996-03-21 |accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Malawi, Historical and Scientific''' is a not-for-profit organisation established in 1947, as the Nyasaland Society. It changed its name after [[Malawi]] gained independence in 1964. The Society aims to promote interest in literary, historical and scientific matters, discover and record facts and information about Malawi which might otherwise be lost. It also acquires books relating to Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.societyofmalawi.org|title = Society of Malawi, Historical and Scientific - Home|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The patron of the library is always the president of Malawi, the current one being [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]]

==Programmes==
The Society publishes a journal twice yearly. The journal is edited by [[David Stuart-Mogg]] and [[Professor Colin Baker]].&amp;nbsp; Stuart-Mogg is a keen amateur historian who also published a best selling Guide to Malawi and numerous papers and articles mainly on Malawi’s rich cultural heritage, maintaining a special interest in the [[John Chilembwe]] phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.davidstuartmogg.com/?page_id=213|title = David Stuart-Mogg|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baker has published extensively on Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 29779046|title = Colin Baker at 70: an appreciation|date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has a reference library and archives located at the historic [[Mandala House]], Malawi's oldest standing building in&amp;nbsp; [[Blantyre]] built in 1882. The library is open to both the public and Society members.

== The Transport Museum at the Heritage Centre, Blantyre ==
The Society also runs a Transport Museum, located in the Heritage Centre in [[Limbe, Blantyre, Malawi|Limbe]] on land granted by the Malawi Railways with the proviso that the history of transport in Malawi be preserved with emphasis on the Railways role in opening up Nyasaland, a land-locked country, to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.societyofmalawi.org/tptmuseum.php|title = Society of Malawi - Transport Museum|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits at the museum cover the period from 1867 to 1996 and include fully captioned photographs, artefacts, and other items of interest.[[File:Locomotive Number 9 at Limbe, May 1924.jpg|thumb|Locomotive Number 9 at Limbe, May 1924]]

==Purpose==
The data center is alleged to be able to process "all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Internet searches, as well as all types of personal data trails&amp;nbsp;— parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital 'pocket litter'."&lt;ref name="bamford1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)|first=James|last=Bamford|authorlink=James Bamford|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1|newspaper=Wired|date=15 March 2012|access-date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to claims that the data center would be used to illegally monitor email of U.S. citizens, in April 2013 an NSA spokesperson said, "Many unfounded allegations have been made about the planned activities of the Utah Data Center, ...&amp;nbsp;one of the biggest misconceptions about NSA is that we are unlawfully listening in on, or reading emails of, U.S. citizens. This is simply not the case."&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt; This statement was made two months prior to the document leak that revealed the existence of the PRISM program (below).  Some members of the public question the credibility of official statements like Bamford's, above, in light of the revelations made in the following two paragraphs herein, and in light of the revelations made in the following two months after his statement was made.

In April 2009, officials at the [[United States Department of Justice]] acknowledged that the NSA had engaged in large-scale overcollection of domestic communications in excess of the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]'s authority, but claimed that the acts were unintentional and had since been rectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/us/16nsa.html |title=Officials Say U.S. Wiretaps Exceeded Law |author=[[Eric Lichtblau]] and [[James Risen]] |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 15, 2009 |access-date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published short documentaries by independent filmmakers titled ''The Program'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Poitras |first=Laura |date=August 22, 2012 |title=The Program |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/the-national-security-agencys-domestic-spying-program.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interviews with former NSA technical director and [[whistleblower]] [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]]. The project had been designed for foreign [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) collection but, Binney alleged, after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], controls that limited unintentional collection of data pertaining to U.S. citizens were removed, prompting concerns by him and others that the actions were illegal and unconstitutional. Binney alleged that the Bluffdale facility was designed to store a broad range of domestic communications for [[data mining]] without warrants.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Kent, [http://www.privatewifi.com/what-does-the-nsa-know-about-you/ "What Does the NSA Know About You?"], Private WiFi, August 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents leaked to the media in June 2013 described [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], a national security [[computer and network surveillance]] program operated by the NSA, as enabling in-depth surveillance on live Internet communications and stored information.&lt;ref name="WaPo1"&gt;{{cite news|author1-link=Barton Gellman|last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |author2-link=Laura Poitras|last2=Poitras |first2=Laura |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html |title=US Intelligence Mining Data from Nine U.S. Internet Companies in Broad Secret Program |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-snowden-reveal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance?CMP=twt_gu |title=Edward Snowden: The Whistleblower Behind Revelations of NSA Surveillance|author=[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]; MacAskill, Ewen |date=June 9, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 9, 2013|location=[[Hong Kong]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports linked the data center to the NSA's controversial expansion of activities, which store extremely large amounts of data.

But, he added, "most of it sits and is never looked at by anyone."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Shane and David E. Sanger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/us/job-title-key-to-inner-access-held-by-snowden.html?hp "Job Title Key to Inner Access Held by Snowden"], ''New York Times'', June 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDC was expected to store Internet data, as well as telephone records from the controversial NSA telephone call database, [[MAINWAY]], when it opened in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phone records could end up at NSA’s Utah Data Center|author=Thomas Burr|work=Salt Lake Tribune|date=June 6, 2013|access-date=June 11, 2013|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56422716-90/americans-amyspencer-center-court.html.csp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the controversy over the NSA's involvement in the practice of [[mass surveillance in the United States]], and prompted by the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]], the Utah Data Center was hailed by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess".&lt;ref name=wsj-7oct13&gt;{{cite news|last=Siobhan Gorman|title=Meltdowns Hobble NSA Data Center|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304441404579119490744478398|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=19 October 2013|quote=The Utah facility, one of the Pentagon's biggest U.S. construction projects, has become a symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess, which gained broad attention in the wake of leaks from NSA contractor Edward Snowden. |date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binney has said that the facility was built to store recordings and other content of communications, not only for [[metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/government_programs-july-dec13-whistleblowers_08-01/ |title=NSA Collects 'Word for Word' Every Domestic Communication, Says Former Analyst |work=PBS NewsHour |date=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an interview with Snowden, the project was initially known as the Massive Data Repository within NSA, but was renamed to Mission Data Repository due to the former sounding too "creepy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[James Bamford]] |date=August 2014 |title=Edward Snowden: The Untold Story |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During 1997, even before the launch of their first satellites ([[Yamal 101]] and [[Yamal 102]]), [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazkom]] was planning the second generation. At that time they planned a 24 satellites of the second generation. This extremely aggressive plan was scaled back by 2001 with a plan to launch four 200 series satellites. The first two, [[Yamal 201]] and '''Yamal 202''' would be launched by 2001 and the second pair, [[Yamal 203]] and [[Yamal 204]] by 2004. Yamal 201 and Yamal 203 would be identical and be positioned at the 90°E slot and Yamal 202 and Yamal 204 would also be twins and be positioned at the 49°E slot.

Yamal 202 was launched along Yamal 201 November 24, 2003 at 16:2 UTC from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81|Site 81/23]] by a [[Proton-K]]/[[Blok D|Blok-DM-2M]] directly to [[geostationary orbit|GEO]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal201launch /&gt; The launch and satellite deployment was successful and Yamal 201 was commissioned into service.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal202 /&gt; As of July 22, 2016 it is still in service and at 12 years and 8 months it has surpassed its design life of 12.5&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=gazprom-yamal202 /&gt;&lt;ref name=energia-usp /&gt;
