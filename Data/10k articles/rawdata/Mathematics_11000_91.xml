In mathematics '''Antoine's necklace''' is a topological embedding of the [[Cantor set]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, whose complement is not [[simply connected]]. It also serves as a counterexample to the claim that all [[Cantor space]]s are ambiently homeomorphic to each other. It was discovered by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink= Louis Antoine|last=Antoine|first=Louis|year=1921}}.

==Construction==

Antoine's necklace is constructed iteratively like so: Begin with a [[solid torus]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 0). Next, construct a "necklace" of smaller, linked tori that lie inside ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. This necklace is ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 1). Each torus composing ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be replaced with another smaller necklace as was done for ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing this yields ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 2).

This process can be repeated a countably infinite number of times to create an ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''n''. Antoine's necklace ''A'' is defined as the intersection of all the iterations.

==Properties==

Since the solid tori are chosen to become arbitrarily small as the iteration number increases, the connected components of ''A'' must be single points.  It is then easy to verify that ''A'' is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]], [[dense-in-itself]], and [[totally disconnected]], having the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. This is sufficient to conclude that as an abstract metric space ''A'' is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

However, as a subset of Euclidean space ''A'' is not ambiently homeomorphic to the standard Cantor set ''C'', embedded in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on a [[line segment]]. That is, there is no bi-continuous map from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that carries ''C'' onto ''A''. To show this, suppose there was such a map ''h'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and consider a loop ''k'' that is interlocked with the necklace. ''k'' cannot be continuously shrunk to a point without touching ''A'' because two loops cannot be continuously unlinked. Now consider any loop ''j'' disjoint from ''C''. ''j'' can be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'' because we can simply move it through the gap intervals. However, the loop ''g'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') is a loop that ''cannot'' be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'', which contradicts the previous statement. Therefore, ''h'' cannot exist.

Antoine's necklace was used by {{harvs|txt|last=Alexander|first=James Waddell|authorlink=James Waddell Alexander II|year=1924}} to construct '''Antoine's horned sphere''' (similar to but not the same as [[Alexander's horned sphere]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">[[Image:Sector central angle arc.svg|thumb|right|Angle AOB is a central angle]]

Central angles are [[subtend]]ed by an [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] between those two points, and the [[arc length]] is the central angle of a circle of radius one (measured in [[radian]]s).&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics, Central Angle| first1=C.|last1=Clapham|first2=J.|last2=Nicholson | publisher =Addison-Wesley | year =2009|page=122|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central angle is also known as the arc's [[angular distance]].

The size of a central angle {{math|&amp;Theta;}} is  {{math|0&amp;deg; &amp;lt; &amp;Theta; &amp;lt; 360&amp;deg;}}  or   {{math|0 &amp;lt; &amp;Theta; &amp;lt; 2&amp;pi;}} (radians). When defining or drawing a central angle, in addition to specifying the points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, one must specify whether the angle being defined is the convex angle (&amp;lt;180&amp;deg;) or the reflex angle (&amp;gt;180&amp;deg;). Equivalently, one must specify whether the movement from point {{mvar|A}} to point {{mvar|B}} is clockwise or counterclockwise.

==Formulas==
If the intersection points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} of the legs of the angle with the circle form a [[diameter]], then {{math|1=&amp;Theta; = 180&amp;deg;}} is a [[straight angle]]. (In radians,  {{math|1=&amp;Theta; = &amp;pi;}}.)

Let {{math|''L''}} be the '''minor arc''' of the circle between points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, and let {{mvar|R}} be the [[radius]] of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathopenref.com/circlecentral.html|title=Central angle (of a circle)| publisher =Math Open Reference|year=2009|accessdate=December 30, 2013}} interactive&lt;/ref&gt;

|- style="font-size:86%; "
|  style="text-align:center; width:130px;"|Central angle. Convex. Is subtended by minor arc {{math|''L''}}{{math|}}
|}
If the central angle {{math|&amp;Theta;}} is subtended by {{math|''L''}}, then 
:&lt;math&gt; 0^{\circ} &lt; \Theta &lt; 180^{\circ} \, , \,\, \Theta = \left( {\frac{180L}{\pi R}} \right) ^{\circ}=\frac{L}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:15px"&gt;
:Proof (for degrees): The [[circumference]] of a circle with radius {{mvar|R}} is {{math|2&amp;pi;''R''}}, and the minor arc {{math|''L''}} is the ({{sfrac|&amp;Theta;|360&amp;deg;}}) proportional part of the whole circumference (see [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]). So: 
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\Theta}{360^{\circ}} \cdot 2 \pi R \, \Rightarrow  \, \Theta = \left( {\frac{180L}{\pi R}} \right) ^{\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

|  style="text-align:center; width:130px;"|Central angle. Reflex. Is ''not'' subtended by {{math|''L''}}
|}
:Proof (for radians): The [[circumference]] of a circle with radius {{mvar|R}} is {{math|2&amp;pi;''R''}}, and the minor arc {{math|''L''}} is the ({{sfrac|&amp;Theta;|2&amp;pi;}}) proportional part of the whole circumference (see [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]). So
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\Theta}{2 \pi} \cdot 2 \pi R \, \Rightarrow  \, \Theta = \frac{L}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If the central angle {{math|&amp;Theta;}} is '''not''' subtended by the minor arc {{math|''L''}}, then {{math|&amp;Theta;}} is a reflex angle and
:&lt;math&gt; 180^{\circ} &lt; \Theta &lt; 360^{\circ} \, , \,\, \Theta = \left( 360 - \frac{180L}{\pi R} \right) ^{\circ}=2\pi-\frac{L}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

If a tangent at {{math|''A''}} and a tangent at {{math|''B''}} intersect at the exterior point {{math|''P''}}, then denoting the center as {{math|''O''}}, the angles {{math|∠''BOA''}} (convex) and {{math|∠''BPA''}} are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]] (sum to 180°).

==Central angle of a regular polygon==

A [[regular polygon]] with {{math|''n''}} sides has a [[circumscribed circle]] upon which all its vertices lie, and the center of the circle is also the center of the polygon. The central angle of the regular polygon is formed at the center by the radii to two adjacent vertices. The measure of this angle is &lt;math&gt;2\pi/n.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12224">In mathematics, '''coherent duality''' is any of a number of generalisations of [[Serre duality]], applying to [[coherent sheaves]], in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[complex manifold]] theory, as well as some aspects of [[commutative algebra]] that are part of the 'local' theory.

The historical roots of the theory lie in the idea of the [[adjoint linear system]] of a [[linear system of divisors]] in classical algebraic geometry. This was re-expressed, with the advent of [[sheaf theory]], in a way that made an analogy with [[Poincaré duality]] more apparent. Then according to a general principle, [[Grothendieck's relative point of view]], the theory of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] was extended to a [[proper morphism]]; Serre duality was recovered as the case of the morphism of a [[non-singular]] [[projective variety]] (or [[complete variety]]) to a point. The resulting theory is now sometimes called '''Serre–Grothendieck–Verdier duality''', and is a basic tool in algebraic geometry. A treatment of this theory, ''Residues and Duality'' (1966) by [[Robin Hartshorne]], became an accessible reference. One concrete spin-off was the [[Grothendieck residue]].

To go beyond proper morphisms, as for the versions of Poincaré duality that are not for [[closed manifold]]s, requires some version of the ''[[compact support]]'' concept. This was addressed in [[SGA2]] in terms of [[local cohomology]], and [[Grothendieck local duality]]; and subsequently. The [[Greenlees–May duality]], first formulated in 1976 by [[Ralf Strebel]] and in 1978 by [[Eben Matlis]], is part of the continuing consideration of this area.

==Adjoint functor point of view==
{{Images of sheaves}}

While Serre duality uses a [[line bundle]] or [[invertible sheaf]] as a '''[[dualizing sheaf]]''', the general theory (it turns out) cannot be quite so simple. (More precisely, it can, but at the cost of the [[Gorenstein ring]] condition.) In a characteristic turn, Grothendieck reformulated general coherent duality as the existence of a [[right adjoint]] functor ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sup&gt;, called ''twisted'' or ''[[exceptional inverse image functor]]'', to a higher [[direct image with compact support]] functor ''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Higher direct images'' are a sheafified form of [[sheaf cohomology]] in this case with proper (compact) support; they are bundled up into a single functor by means of the [[derived category]] formulation of [[homological algebra]] (introduced with this case in mind). In case f is proper ''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sub&gt; is itself a right adjoint, to the ''inverse image'' functor ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. The ''existence theorem'' for the twisted inverse image is the name given to the proof of the existence for what would be the [[counit]] for the [[comonad]] of the sought-for adjunction, namely a [[natural transformation]]

:''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sup&gt; → ''id'',

which is denoted by ''Tr''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; (Hartshorne) or ''∫''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; (Verdier). It is the aspect of the theory closest to the classical meaning, as the notation suggests, that duality is defined by integration.

To be more precise, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sup&gt; exists as an [[exact functor]] from a derived category of [[quasi-coherent sheaves]] on ''Y'', to the analogous category on ''X'', whenever

:''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''

is a proper or quasi projective morphism of noetherian schemes, of finite [[Krull dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Verdier|year = 1969|nb = yes}}, an elegant and more general approach was found by Amnon Neeman, by using methods from algebraic topology notably [[Brown representability]], see {{Harvard citations|last=Neeman|year=1996|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this the rest of the theory can be derived: dualizing complexes pull back via ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;!&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[Grothendieck residue symbol]], the dualizing sheaf in the [[Cohen–Macaulay]] case.

In order to get a statement in more classical language, but still wider than Serre duality, Hartshorne (''Algebraic Geometry'') uses the [[Ext functor of sheaves]]; this is a kind of stepping stone to the derived category.

The classical statement of Grothendieck duality for a projective or proper morphism &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; of noetherian schemes of finite dimension, found in Hartshorne (''Residues and duality'') is the following quasi-isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;Rf_*RHom_X(F^\cdot,f^! G^\cdot)\to RHom_Y(Rf_*F^\cdot ,G^\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''F''&lt;sup&gt;⋅&lt;/sup&gt; a bounded above complex of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules with quasi-coherent cohomology and ''G''&lt;sup&gt;⋅&lt;/sup&gt; a bounded below complex of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules with coherent cohomology.  Here the ''Hom'''s are the sheaf of homomorphisms.

==Construction of the &lt;math&gt;f^{!}&lt;/math&gt; pseudofunctor using rigid dualizing complexes==

Over the years, several approaches for constructing the &lt;math&gt;f^{!}&lt;/math&gt; pseudofunctor emerged. One quite recent successful approach is based on the notion of a rigid dualizing complex. This notion was first defined by Van den Bergh in a noncommutative context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van den Bergh|first1=Michel|title=Existence Theorems for Dualizing Complexes over Non-commutative Graded and Filtered Rings|journal=Journal of Algebra|date=September 1997|volume=195|issue=2|pages=662–679|doi=10.1006/jabr.1997.7052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is based on a variant of derived [[Hochschild cohomology]] (Shukla cohomology): Let ''k'' be a commutative ring, and let ''A'' be a commutative ''k-''algebra. There is a functor &lt;math&gt;RHom_{A\otimes^L_k A}(A,M\otimes^L_k M)&lt;/math&gt; which takes a cochain complex ''M'' to an object &lt;math&gt;RHom_{A\otimes^L_k A}(A,M\otimes^L_k M)&lt;/math&gt; in the derived category over ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Yekutieli|first1=Amnon|title=The Squaring Operation for Commutative DG Rings|date=2014|arxiv=1412.4229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avramov|first1=Luchezar L.|last2=Iyengar|first2=Srikanth B.|last3=Lipman|first3=Joseph|last4=Nayak|first4=Suresh|title=Reduction of derived Hochschild functors over commutative algebras and schemes|journal=Advances in Mathematics|date=January 2010|volume=223|issue=2|pages=735–772|doi=10.1016/j.aim.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asumming ''A'' is noetherian, a rigid dualizing complex over ''A'' relative to ''k'' is by definition a pair &lt;math&gt;(R,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; where ''R'' is a dualizing complex over ''A'' which has finite flat dimension over ''k'', and where
&lt;math&gt;\rho: R\to RHom_{A\otimes^L_k A}(A,R\otimes^L_k R)&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism in the derived category ''D(A)''. If such a rigid dualizing complex exists, then it is unique in a strong sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yekutieli|first1=Amnon|last2=Zhang|first2=James J.|title=Rigid Dualizing Complexes Over Commutative Rings|journal=Algebras and Representation Theory|date=31 May 2008|volume=12|issue=1|pages=19–52|doi=10.1007/s10468-008-9102-9|arxiv=math/0601654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming ''A'' is a [[Localization of a ring|localization]] of a finite type ''k''-algebra, existence of a rigid dualizing complex over ''A'' relative to ''k'' was first proved by [[Amnon Yekutieli|Yekutieli]] and Zhang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yekutieli|first1=Amnon|last2=Zhang|first2=James J.|title=Rigid Dualizing Complexes Over Commutative Rings|journal=Algebras and Representation Theory|date=31 May 2008|volume=12|issue=1|pages=19–52|doi=10.1007/s10468-008-9102-9|arxiv=math/0601654}}&lt;/ref&gt; assuming ''k'' is a regular noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension, and by Avramov, Iyengar and [[Joseph Lipman|Lipman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avramov|first1=Luchezar|last2=Iyengar|first2=Srikanth|last3=Lipman|first3=Joseph|title=Reflexivity and rigidity for complexes, I: Commutative rings|journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory|date=14 January 2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–86|doi=10.2140/ant.2010.4.47|arxiv=0904.4695}}&lt;/ref&gt; assuming ''k'' is a [[Gorenstein ring]] of finite Krull dimension and ''A'' is of finite flat dimension over ''A''.

If ''X'' is a scheme of finite type over ''k'', one can glue the rigid dualizing complexes that its affine pieces have,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Yekutieli|first1=Amnon|last2=Zhang|first2=James J.|title=Rigid dualizing complexes on schemes|date=2004|arxiv=math/0405570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avramov|first1=Luchezar|last2=Iyengar|first2=Srikanth|last3=Lipman|first3=Joseph|title=Reflexivity and rigidity for complexes, II: Schemes|journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory|date=10 September 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=379–429|doi=10.2140/ant.2011.5.379|arxiv=1001.3450}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtain a rigid dualizing complex &lt;math&gt;R_X&lt;/math&gt;. Once one establishes a global existence of a rigid dualizing complex, given a map &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; of schemes over ''k'', one can define &lt;math&gt;f^{!} := D_X \circ Lf^* \circ D_Y&lt;/math&gt;, where for a scheme ''X'', we set &lt;math&gt;D_X:= RHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(-,R_X)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Dualizing Complex Examples ==

=== Dualizing Complex for a Projective Variety ===
The dualizing complex for a projective variety &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_X^\bullet = \mathrm{RHom}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(\mathcal{O}_X,\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n}[+n])&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovacs|first1=Sandor|title=Singularities of stable varieties|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822172544/https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/2013/papers/Kovacs__Singularities_of_stable_varieties.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plane Intersecting a Line ===
Consider the projective variety
:&lt;math&gt;X = \text{Proj}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]}{(x)(y,z)} \right) = \text{Proj}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]}{(xy,xz)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
We can compute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RHom}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(\mathcal{O}_X,\omega_{\mathbb{P}^3}[+3])&lt;/math&gt; using a resolution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^\bullet \to \mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; by locally free sheaves. This is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;
0 \to \mathcal{O}(-3) \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}z \\ -y \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O}(-2) \oplus \mathcal{O}(-2) \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}xy &amp; xz \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}_X \to 0
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathbb{P}^3} \cong \mathcal{O}(-4)&lt;/math&gt; we have that
:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_X^\bullet = \mathrm{RHom}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(\mathcal{L}^\bullet, \mathcal{O}(-4)[+3]) = \mathrm{RHom}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(\mathcal{L}^\bullet\otimes \mathcal{O}(4)[-3], \mathcal{O})
&lt;/math&gt;
This is the complex
:&lt;math&gt;
[\mathcal{O}(-4) \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}xy \\ xz \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O}(-2) \oplus \mathcal{O}(-2) 
\xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}z &amp; -y \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O}(-1)][-3]&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Common Algebraic Specification Language''' ('''CASL''') is a general-purpose [[specification language]] based on [[first-order logic]] with [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. [[Partial function]]s and [[subtype|subsorting]] are also supported.

CASL has been designed by CoFI, the [[Common Framework Initiative]], with the aim to [[Subsumption architecture|subsume]] many existing specification languages.

CASL comprises four levels:
* basic specifications, for the specification of single software modules,
* structured specifications, for the modular specification of modules,
* architectural specifications, for the prescription of the structure of [[implementation]]s,
* specification libraries, for storing specifications distributed over the [[Internet]].

The four levels are orthogonal to each other. In particular, it is possible to use CASL structured and [[Software architecture|architectural]] [[algebraic specification|specifications]] and libraries with logics other than CASL. For this purpose, the logic has to be formalized as an [[Institution (computer science)|institution]]. This feature is also used by the CASL extensions.

==Extensions==
Several extensions of CASL have been designed: 
*HasCASL, a [[Higher-order logic|higher-order]] extension
*CoCASL, a [[F-Coalgebra|coalgebraic]] extension
*CspCASL, a [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] extension based on [[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]]
*ModalCASL, a [[modal logic]] extension
*CASL-LTL, a [[temporal logic]] extension
*HetCASL, an extension for [[heterogeneous]] specification

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6764">In mathematics and [[signal processing]], the '''constant-Q transform''' transforms a data series to the frequency domain. It is related to the [[Fourier transform]]&lt;ref name="b91"&gt;[[Judy Brown|Judith C. Brown]], [http://www.wellesley.edu/Physics/brown/pubs/cq1stPaper.pdf Calculation of a constant Q spectral transform], ''J. Acoust. Soc. Am.'', 89(1):425–434, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and very closely related to the complex [[Morlet wavelet]] transform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Continuous_Wavelet_Transform.html Continuous Wavelet Transform] "When the mother wavelet can be interpreted as a windowed sinusoid (such as the Morlet wavelet), the wavelet transform can be interpreted as a constant-Q Fourier transform. Before the theory of wavelets, constant-Q Fourier transforms (such as obtained from a classic third-octave filter bank) were not easy to invert, because the basis signals were not orthogonal."&lt;/ref&gt;

The transform can be thought of as a series of logarithmically spaced filters ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the ''k''-th filter having a [[spectral width]] ''δf''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to a multiple of the previous filter's width:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta f_k &amp;= 2^{1/n} \cdot \delta f_{k-1} \\
 &amp;= \left( 2^{1/n} \right)^k \cdot \delta f_\text{min},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δf''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the bandwidth of the ''k''-th filter, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; is the central frequency of the lowest filter, and ''n'' is the number of filters per [[octave (electronics)|octave]].

== Calculation ==

The short-time Fourier transform of ''x''[''n''] for a frame shifted to sample ''m'' is calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;X[k,m] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} W[n-m] x[n] e^{-j 2 \pi k n/N}. &lt;/math&gt;

Given a data series sampled at ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''T'', ''T'' being the sampling period of our data, for each frequency bin we can define the following:
* Filter width, ''δf''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''Q'', the "quality factor":
:: &lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{f_k}{\delta f_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
: This is shown below to be the integer number of cycles processed at a center frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.  As such, this somewhat defines the time complexity of the transform.
* Window length for the ''k''-th bin:
::&lt;math&gt; N[k] = \frac{f_\text{s}}{\delta f_k} = \frac{f_\text{s}}{f_k} Q. &lt;/math&gt;
:Since ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of samples processed per cycle at frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q'' is the number of integer cycles processed at this central frequency.

The equivalent transform kernel can be found by using the following substitutions:
* The window length of each bin is now a function of the bin number:
::&lt;math&gt;N = N[k] = Q \frac{f_\text{s}}{f_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The relative power of each bin will decrease at higher frequencies, as these sum over fewer terms.  To compensate for this, we normalize by ''N''[''k''].
* Any windowing function will be a function of window length, and likewise a function of window number.  For example, the equivalent Hamming window would be
::&lt;math&gt; W[k,n] = \alpha - (1 - \alpha) \cos \frac{2 \pi n}{N[k] - 1}, \quad  \alpha = 25/46, \quad 0 \leqslant n \leqslant N[k] - 1.&lt;/math&gt;
* Our digital frequency, &lt;math&gt; \frac{2 \pi k}{N} &lt;/math&gt;, becomes &lt;math&gt; \frac{2 \pi Q}{N[k]} &lt;/math&gt;.

After these modifications, we are left with
:&lt;math&gt;X[k] = \frac{1}{N[k]} \sum_{n=0}^{N[k]-1} W[k,n] x[n] e^{\frac{-j2 \pi Qn}{N[k]}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Fast calculation using FFT==

The direct calculation of the constant-Q transform is slow when compared against the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT). However, the FFT can itself be employed, in conjunction with the use of a [[Kernel (statistics)|kernel]], to perform the equivalent calculation but much faster.&lt;ref name="pb92"&gt;[[Judy Brown|Judith C. Brown]] and Miller S. Puckette, [http://academics.wellesley.edu/Physics/brown/pubs/effalgV92P2698-P2701.pdf An efficient algorithm for the calculation of a constant Q transform], ''J. Acoust. Soc. Am.'', 92(5):2698–2701, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with the Fourier transform ==

In general, the transform is well suited to musical data, and this can be seen in some of its advantages compared to the fast Fourier transform.  As the output of the transform is effectively amplitude/phase against log frequency, fewer frequency bins are required to cover a given range effectively, and this proves useful where frequencies span several octaves.  As the range of human hearing covers approximately ten octaves from 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to around 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, this reduction in output data is significant.

The transform exhibits a reduction in frequency resolution with higher frequency bins, which is desirable for auditory applications. The transform mirrors the human auditory system, whereby at lower-frequencies spectral resolution is better, whereas temporal resolution improves at higher frequencies. At the bottom of the piano scale (about 30&amp;nbsp;Hz), a difference of 1 semitone is a difference of approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, whereas at the top of the musical scale (about 5&amp;nbsp;kHz), a difference of 1 semitone is a difference of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/graphics/notes.GIF&lt;/ref&gt; So for musical data the exponential frequency resolution of constant-Q transform is ideal.

In addition, the harmonics of musical notes form a pattern characteristic of the timbre of the instrument in this transform.  Assuming the same relative strengths of each harmonic, as the fundamental frequency changes, the relative position of these harmonics remains constant.  This can make identification of instruments much easier. The constant Q transform can also be used for automatic recognition of musical keys based on accumulated chroma content.&lt;ref name="pbo01"&gt; Hendrik Purwins, Benjamin Blankertz and Klaus Obermayer, [http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f671/2e765320de050afd8305401b74a489d92c28.pdf A New Method for Tracking Modulations in Tonal Music in Audio Data Format], ''International Joint Conference on Neural Network (IJCNN’00).'', 6:270-275, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative to the Fourier transform, implementation of this transform is more tricky.  This is due to the varying number of samples used in the calculation of each frequency bin, which also affects the length of any windowing function implemented.&lt;ref name="gb1999"&gt;Benjamin Blankertz, [http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/Personen/blankertz/constQ/constQ.html The Constant Q Transform], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note that because the frequency scale is logarithmic, there is no true zero-frequency / DC term present, perhaps limiting possible utility of the transform.

The "'''Cool S'''", also known as '''Superman S''', '''Stüssy S''', '''Super S''', '''Pointy S'''&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web |title=That 'S' Thing Everyone Drew in School, WHAT IS IT? |url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/article/that-s-thing-everyone-drew-in-school-what-is-it |website=Vice |date=23 July 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2017 |first=Julian |last=Morgans |quote=people have been drawing this S long before Stussy was established}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Graffiti S'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drawingnow.com/drawings/100332/how-to-make-one-graffiti-s/|title=how to make one graffiti S|website=DrawingNow DrawingNow|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as many other names, is a [[graffiti]] signature of [[popular culture]] that is typically [[doodle]]d on children's notebooks or graffitied on walls.

==Shape==
[[File:"Cool S" Drawing Instructions.svg|thumb|right|A guide to drawing the "Cool S"]]

The Cool S consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed [[S (letter)|S]]-shape. The tails of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the [[infinity symbol]] does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Investigates: The Mysterious S Symbol |url=https://nyulocal.com/local-investigates-the-mysterious-s-symbol-9254626b8225#.9jqdl0p67 |website=NYU Local |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cool S has no [[reflection symmetry]], but has 2-fold [[rotational symmetry]] and [[tessellation|tessellates]] with squares. As illustrated, a common way to draw the shape begins with two sets of three parallel, vertical lines, one above the other.

==Origin==
The origin of the Cool S is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neelson |first1=Caleb |title=Solve the Mystery of the Pointy S |url=http://www.printmag.com/imprint/solve-the-mystery-of-the-pointy-s/ |website=Print Magazine |accessdate=29 January 2017 |date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Superman S' comes from a belief that it was a symbol for [[Superman]], whose costume features a stylised S in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Similarly, the name 'Stussy S' is from a theory that it might be a symbol of the American surfwear company [[Stüssy]].&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

'''Core-Plus Mathematics''' is a high school mathematics program consisting of a four-year series of print and digital student textbooks and supporting materials for teachers, developed by the Core-Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP) at [[Western Michigan University]], with funding from the [[National Science Foundation]]. Development of the program started in 1992. The first edition, entitled ''Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach'', was completed in 1995. The third edition, entitled ''Core-Plus Mathematics: Contemporary Mathematics in Context'', was published by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] in 2015.

== Key Features ==
The first edition of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' was designed to meet the curriculum, teaching, and assessment standards from the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1989). Curriculum and evaluation standards for school mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1991). Mathematics professional standards for teaching mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1995). Assessment standards for school mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (2000). Principles and standards for school mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; and the broad goals outlined in the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] report, ''Everybody Counts: A Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education''.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council; Mathematical Sciences Education Board; Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications. (1989). Everybody counts: A report to the nation on the future of mathematics education. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions were designed to also meet the [[American Statistical Association]] ''Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education'' (GAISE)&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, C., Kader, G., Mewborn, D., Moreno, J., Peck, R., Perry, M., &amp; Scheaffer, R. (2007). Guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education. Alexandria, VA: American Statistical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently the standards for mathematical content and practice in the [[Common Core State Standards|''Common Core State Standards for Mathematics'']] (CCSSM).&lt;ref&gt;Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI). (2010). Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Washington, DC: National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program puts an emphasis on teaching and learning mathematics through mathematical modeling and mathematical inquiry. Each year, students learn mathematics in four interconnected strands: algebra and functions, geometry and trigonometry, statistics and probability, and discrete mathematical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Fey, J., &amp; Hirsch, C.

===First Edition (1994-2003)===
The program originally comprised three courses, intended to be taught in grades 9 through 11. Later, authors added a fourth course intended for college-bound students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Schoen | first1 = Harold L. | last2 = Hirsch | first2 = Christian R. | year = 2003 | title = The Core-Plus Mathematics Project: Perspectives and Student Achievement | url = http://www.cpmponline.org/pdfs/CPMP_Chapter_in_Senk_03.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCSS Edition (2015)===
The course was aligned with the [[Common Core State Standards]] (CCSS) mathematical practices and content expectations. Expanded and enhanced Teacher's Guides include a CCSS pathway and a CPMP pathway through each unit. Course 4 was split into two versions: one called ''Preparation for Calculus'', for STEM-oriented students, and an alternative course, ''Transition to College Mathematics and Statistics'' (TCMS), for college-bound students whose intended program of study does not require calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Core-Plus Mathematics CCSS Edition: Key Features | url = http://www.cpmponline.org/ccss/CCSSEdfeatures.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Core-Plus Mathematics CCSS Edition: Unit descriptions and topics | url = http://www.cpmponline.org/pdfs/CCSSEdDesc&amp;Topics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Transition to College Mathematics and Statistics | url = http://tcmsproject.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluations, Research, and Reviews ==
Project and independent evaluations and many research studies have been conducted on ''Core-Plus Mathematics'', including content analyses, case studies, surveys, small- and large-scale comparison studies, research reviews, and a longitudinal study.

===Positive reviews===

There are multiple research studies and evaluations in which students using ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' performed significantly better than comparison students on assessments of conceptual understanding, problem solving, and applications, and results were mixed for performance on assessments of by-hand calculation skills.&lt;ref name="Grouws"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grouws | first1 = D.

====Large-scale comparison studies====
A three-part study of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' and more conventional curricula were reported by researchers at the [[University of Missouri–Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Grouws" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tarr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chavez" /&gt; The research was conducted as part of the ''Comparing Options in Secondary Mathematics: Investigating Curricula'' project, supported by the National Science Foundation under REC-0532214. The research was reported in the March and July 2013 issues of the ''[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]]'' and in the December 2013 issue of the ''[[International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education]]''. The three studies examined student achievement in schools in 5 geographically dispersed states. The first study involved 2,161 students in 10 schools in first-year high school mathematics courses, the second study involved 3,258 students in 11 schools in second-year mathematics courses, and the third study involved 2,242 students in 10 schools in third-year mathematics courses. Results in the first study showed that ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students scored significantly higher on all three end-of-year outcome measures: a test of common objectives, a problem solving and reasoning test, and a standardized achievement test. Results in the second study showed that ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students scored significantly higher on a standardized achievement test, with no differences on the other measures. Results in the third study showed that ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students scored significantly higher on a test of common objectives, with no differences on the other measure.

====Other comparison studies====
A study conducted by Schoen and Hirsch, two authors of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'', reported that students using early versions of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' did as well as or better than those in traditional single-subject curricula on all measures except paper-and-pencil algebra skills.&lt;ref name="Schoen" /&gt;

A study on field-test versions of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'', supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (Award MDR 9255257) and published in 2000 in the ''[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]]'', reported that students using the first field-test versions of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' scored significantly better on tests of conceptual understanding and problem solving, while Algebra II students in conventional programs scored significantly better on a test of paper-and-pencil procedures.&lt;ref name="Huntley" /&gt;

Other studies reported that  ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students displayed qualities such as engagement, eagerness, communication, flexibility, and curiosity to a much higher degree than did students who studied from more conventional programs.&lt;ref name="Latterell" /&gt; A review of research in 2008 concluded that there were modest effects for ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' on mostly standardized tests of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Slavin" /&gt;

With regard to achievement of students in minority groups, an early peer-reviewed paper documenting the performance of students from under-represented groups using ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' reported that at the end of each of Course 1, Course 2, and Course 3, the posttest means on standardized mathematics achievement tests of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students in all minority groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, and Native/Alaskan Americans) were greater than those of the national norm group at the same pretest levels. Hispanics made the greatest pretest to posttest gains at the end of each course.&lt;ref name="Schoen2" /&gt; A later comparative study reported that Hispanic high school students using ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' made modest gains compared to the performance of students with other demographic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Capraro" /&gt;

Regarding preparation for college, studies of [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] test results reported that ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students performed significantly better than comparison students on the SAT and performed as well on the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;Schoen, H. L., Ziebarth, S. W., Hirsch, C. R., &amp; BrckaLorenz, A. (2010). A five-year study of the first edition of the Core-Plus Mathematics curriculum. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies examined the subsequent college mathematics performance of students who used different high school textbook series. These studies did not detect any differential effect of high school curriculum on placement in college mathematics courses, in subsequent performance, or in course-taking patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Schoen, H.

====Reviews of instructional materials and programs====
EdReports, an independent nonprofit, recently completed evidenced-based reviews of K-12 instructional materials. In their analysis of Core-Plus Mathematics Courses 1-3, the three-year core program was found to meet expectations for alignment to the high school Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in terms of content, focus, and coherence, and in terms of rigor and mathematical practices. The Core-Plus Mathematics instructional materials also met EdReports criteria that the materials are well designed and reflect effective lesson structure and pacing.&lt;ref&gt;"Educator-led, evidence-based reviews of K-12 instructional materials." EdReports.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In an in-depth analysis by The Center for Research on Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University, Core-Plus Mathematics was given a "moderate" evidence rating, and is the only comprehensive three-year high school mathematics program to be rated at any level (strong, moderate, or promising) for meeting federal ESSA Standards for Evidence in terms of promoting student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;"Evidence for ESSA - Math Programs." evidenceforessa.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other research studies====
In terms of core content development, a study comparing the development of quadratic equations in the Korean national curriculum and ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' found that some quadratic equation topics are developed earlier in Korean textbooks, while ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' includes more problems requiring explanations, various representations, and higher cognitive demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = D.

Several studies have analyzed the teacher’s role in ''Core-Plus Mathematics''.&lt;ref name="Schoen3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbel-Eisenmann | first1 = B. | last2 = Lubienski | first2 = S. | last3 = Id-Deen | first3 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Reconsidering the study of mathematics instructional practices: The importance of curricular context in understanding local and global teacher change | url = | journal = Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 313–345 | doi=10.1007/s10857-006-9012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziebarth, S.

Herbel-Eisenmann (Eds.), Mathematics teachers at work. (pp. 171–189). New York: Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reviews===
In November 1999, David Klein, professor of mathematics at California State University, Northridge, sent an open letter to the U.S. Department of Education, in response to the U.S. Department of Education Expert Panel in Mathematics and Science designation of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' as "exemplary." Klein's open letter urged the Department of Education to withdraw its recommendations of the several [[reform mathematics]] programs including ''Core-Plus Mathematics''. The letter was co-signed by more than 200 American scientists and mathematicians.&lt;ref name="open-letter-1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/riley.html |title=An open letter to United States secretary of Education, Richard Riley |last1=Klein |first1=David|year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mathematicians were critical of the letter and were concerned that the letter gives the false impression that the mathematical community agrees with the letter’s conclusions. “In fact, there is no such clear-cut consensus on the issues the letter raises.”&lt;ref&gt;"Open Letter on Mathematics Curricula Ignites Debate." For Your Information, Notices of the AMS, Volume 47, Number 2, page 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Klein asserts that the mathematics programs criticized by the open letter had common features: they overemphasized data analysis and statistics, while de-emphasizing far more important areas of arithmetic and algebra. Many of the "higher-order thinking projects" turned out to be just aimless activities. The programs were obsessed with electronic calculators, and basic skills were disparaged.&lt;ref name="david-klein-2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/usnoadd.html |title=Math problems: Why the U.S. Department of Education's recommended math programs don't add up |last1=Klein |first1=David|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' was criticized for exhibiting "too shallow a coverage of traditional algebra, and a focus on highly contextualized work".

R. James Milgram, Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University, analyzed the program's effect on students in a top-performing high school. According to Milgram, "...there was no measure represented in the survey, such as ACT scores, SAT Math scores, grades in college math courses, level of college math courses attempted, where the students even met, let alone surpassed the comparison group [which used a more traditional program]."&lt;ref name="david-klein-2000"/&gt;

====Andover High School Survey====
One of the first schools to pilot Core-Plus was [[Andover High School (Bloomfield Hills, Michigan)|Andover High School]] in [[Bloomfield Hills]], [[Michigan]], which was ranked one of America's "100 best" high schools. Andover stopped traditional mathematics in 1994 and began using Core-Plus Mathematics.

A survey conducted in 1997 of Andover graduates found that 96 percent of students who returned the survey said they were placed into “remedial math” in college. In a neighboring school, 62 percent of the students who returned the survey took remedial math in college.&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/sections/learning/mathmelt/p-2story052300.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030219122859/http://www.csmonitor.com/sections/learning/mathmelt/p-2story052300.html|archivedate=2003-02-19|title= Christian Science Monitor|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activism by a group of parents caused Andover to return to offering a traditional math option. By 2000, half of students at Andover were taking Core-Plus and the other half were taking traditional math.

Students commented on the survey that Core Plus was one of the worst math programs and a waste of their time. They lamented never being taught "any of the basics and most are suffering in college math courses". They found themselves "completely unprepared" for understanding college math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wayne.edu/~greg/original.htm|title= Preliminary Report on a Survey of the Graduating Classes of 1997 of Andover High School and Lahser High School, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Gregory F.

The survey study has been criticized for involving a self-selected sample, self-reported data, and biased survey methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/cpmp/cpmpfaq.html#questionBM|title= Frequently Asked Questions About the Core-Plus Mathematics Project|publisher=Wmich.edu|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data provided by the University of Michigan registrar at this same time indicated that in collegiate mathematics courses at the University of Michigan graduates of Core-Plus did as well as or better than graduates of a traditional mathematics curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wmich.edu/cpmp/cpmpfaq.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608135600/http://www.wmich.edu/cpmp/cpmpfaq.html#questioncollege |archive-date=2007-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study (see below) found that graduates of the Core-Plus curriculum entering Michigan State University have placed into increasingly lower level mathematics courses as the implementation of the curriculum has progressed.&lt;ref name="Hill-Parker-2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.math.msu.edu/users/hill/HillParker5.pdf |title=A study of Core-Plus students attending Michigan State University |last1=Hill |first1=Richard O. |last2=Parker |first2=Thomas H. |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study and the published report have been criticized for design flaws and for drawing conclusions that are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/cpmp/cpmpfaq.html#hillparker |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Core-Plus Mathematics Project|publisher=Wmich.edu|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A study of Core-Plus students attending Michigan State University====

In 2006, Richard O. Hill and Thomas H. Parker from Michigan State University (MSU) evaluated the effectiveness of the Core-Plus Mathematics Project in preparing the students for subsequent university mathematics. R. Hill and T. Parker analyzed the college mathematics records of students arriving at MSU from four high schools that implemented the Core-Plus Mathematics program between 1996 and 1999. They found a "disconnect" between the mathematics expectations that students encounter in K-12 education and those that they encounter in college. The effectiveness of Core-Plus and the other NSF-funded high school curricula programs became a significant issue for college mathematics faculty.&lt;ref name="Hill-Parker-2006"/&gt;

Core-Plus students placed into, and enrolled in, increasingly lower level courses. The percentages of students who eventually passed a technical calculus course showed a statistically significant decline averaging 27 percent a year; this trend was accompanied by an obvious and statistically significant increase in percentages of students who placed into low-level and remedial algebra courses. Except for some top students, graduates of Core-Plus mathematics were struggling in college mathematics, earning below average grades. They were less well prepared than either graduates in the Control group (who came from a broad mix of curricula) or graduates of their own high schools before the implementation of Core-Plus mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hill-Parker-2006"/&gt;

====Review by Prof. Harel====
In 2009 professor of mathematics at the University of California in San Diego, Guershon Harel reviewed four  high-school mathematics programs. The examined programs included Core-Plus Courses 1, 2, and 3. The examination focused on two topics in algebra and one topic in geometry, deemed by Prof. Harel central to the high school curriculum. The examination was intended "to ensure these topics are coherently developed, completely covered, mathematically correct, and provide students a solid foundation for further study in mathematics".&lt;ref name="Harel-2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/harelhsreview2.pdf |title=A Review of Four High-School Mathematics Programs |last=Harel |first=Guershon |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, Prof. Harel noted that the content presentation in Core-Plus program is unusual in that its instructional units, from the start to the end, are made of word problems involving "real-life" situations. This structure is reflected in the subtitle of the Core-Plus series: ''Contemporary Mathematics in Context''. To review the program, it was necessary to go through all the problems in the core units and their corresponding materials in the Teacher’s Edition. Despite the unconventional textbook structure, the language used by the Core-Plus program was found mathematically sound.

In the algebra section, fundamental theorems on linear functions and quadratic functions were found not justified, except for the quadratic formula.  Theorems are often presented without proof.

Like in the algebra texts, the geometry text does not lead to a clear logical structure of the material taught. Because theoretical material is concealed within the text of the problems, "a teacher must identify all the critical problems and know in advance the intended structure to establish the essential mathematical progression. This task is further complicated by the fact that many critical problems appear in the homework sections. Important theorems in geometry are not justified. Moreover, with the way the material is sequenced, some of these theorems cannot be justified".&lt;ref name="Harel-2009"/&gt;

According to Prof. Harel, the Core-Plus program "excels in providing ample experience in solving application problems and in ensuring that students understand the meanings of the different parts of the modeling functions. The program also excels in its mission to contextualize the mathematics taught". However, it fails "to convey critical mathematical concepts and ideas that should and can be within reach for high school students".&lt;ref name="Harel-2009"/&gt;

====Review by Prof. Wilson====
Professor W. Stephen Wilson from Johns Hopkins University evaluated the mathematical  development  and  coherence  of  the Core-Plus program in 2009. In particular, he examined "the  algebraic  concepts  and  skills  associated with linear functions because they are a critical foundation for the further study of algebra", and evaluated how the program presents the theorem that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, "which is a fundamental theorem of Euclidean geometry and it connects many of  the  basics in  geometry  to  each  other".&lt;ref name="Wilson-2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/wahighschoolwsw.pdf |title=Washington State high school math text review |last=Wilson |first=W. Stephen |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Wilson noted that the major theme of the algebra portion of the program seems to involve creating a table from data, graphing the points from the table; given the table students are asked to find a corresponding function. In case of linear function, "at no point is there an attempt to show that the equation's graph really is a line. Likewise, there is never an attempt to show that a line graph comes from the usual form of a linear equation". Prof. Wilson considered this approach to be "a significant flaw in the mathematical foundation".&lt;ref name="Wilson-2009"/&gt;

Quoting the textbook, "Linear functions relating two variables x and y can be represented using tables, graphs, symbolic rules, or verbal descriptions", Prof. Wilson laments that although this statement is true, "the essence of algebra involves abstraction using symbols".&lt;ref name="Wilson-2009"/&gt;

Prof. Wilson says that the Core-Plus program "has a multitude of good problems, but never develops the core of the mathematics of linear functions. The problems are set in contexts and mathematics itself is rarely considered as a legitimate enterprise to investigate". The program lacks attention to algebraic manipulation" to the point that "symbolic algebra is minimized".&lt;ref name="Wilson-2009"/&gt;

In regards to geometry portion, Prof. Wilson concludes that the program fails to build geometry up from foundations in a mathematically sound and coherent way". He stresses out that "one significant goal of a geometry course is to teach logic, and this program fails on that account".&lt;ref name="Wilson-2009"/&gt;

Overall, the "unacceptable nature of geometry" and the fashion in which the program downplays "algebraic structure and skills" make the Core-Plus program unacceptable.

== Historical Controversy ==
Mathematics programs initially developed in the 1990s that were based on the NCTM’s Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, like ''Core-Plus Mathematics'', have been the subject of controversy due to their differences from more conventional mathematics programs. In the case of ''Core-Plus Mathematics'', there has been debate about (a) the international-like [[Integrated mathematics|integrated nature]] of the curriculum, whereby each year students learn algebra, geometry, statistics, probability, and discrete mathematical modeling, as opposed to conventional U.S. curricula in which just a single subject is studied each year, (b) a concern that students may not adequately develop conventional algebraic skills, (c) a concern that students may not be adequately prepared for college, and (d) a mode of instruction that relies less on teacher lecture and demonstration and more on inquiry, problem solving in contextualized settings, and collaborative work by students.

For example, this debate led to some schools in Minnesota abandoning ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' in the early 2000s and returning to traditional mathematics curricula. In a master's degree research paper at the time, interviews with teachers at four schools that had dropped ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' suggested that many teachers "did not feel that Core-Plus emphasized mastering skills enough", while parents "felt that it did not prepare students for college" and some parents commented that the text was difficult to read. The author of the paper made suggestions for successful adoption of any new materials, including "don't rush the adoption process," have "continued professional development for all," and "school districts need to be proactive regarding parent questions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.bemidjistate.edu/grichgels/MastersPapers/AmberRichgels.pdf |title=Why are school districts abandoning the Core-Plus Mathematics curriculum? |last1=Richgels |first1=Amber R. |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While discussion of these issues continues, a growing body of research (referenced above) has provided reassuring results about learning algebraic skills and college preparation and also suggests that ''Core-Plus Mathematics'' students are advantaged in terms of conceptual understanding, problem solving, and reasoning; an integrated high school mathematics curriculum is now increasingly recognized as the most common curriculum organization outside the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and also acknowledged as a valid curriculum organizational structure in the ''Common Core State Standards for Mathematics'' in the U.S. (e.g., [http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/note-on-courses-transitions/courses-transitions/ CCSSI-Courses and Transitions]); and classroom instruction that is more inquiry- and problem-solving-oriented is recognized as a viable instructional methodology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7299">'''Counterfactual Quantum Computation''' is a method of inferring the result of a computation without actually running a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]] otherwise capable of actively performing that computation.

==Conceptual origin==
Physicists Graeme Mitchison and Richard Jozsa introduced the notion of counterfactual computing&lt;ref name=MitchinsonJozsa&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchison|first1=Graeme|last2=Jozsa|first2=Richard|title=Counterfactual computation|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A|date=May 8, 2001|volume=457|pages=1175–1193|doi=10.1098/rspa.2000.0714|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/457/2009/1175|arxiv=quant-ph/9907007|bibcode=2001RSPSA.457.1175M}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an application of quantum computing, founded on the concepts of [[counterfactual definiteness]], on a re-interpretation of the [[Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester]] thought experiment, and making theoretical use of the phenomenon of [[interaction-free measurement]].

As an example of this idea, in 1997, after seeing a talk on Counterfactual Computation by Richard Jozsa at the Isaac Newton Institute, Keith Bowden (based in the Theoretical Physics Research Unit at Birkbeck College, University of London) published a paper&lt;ref name=Bowden1&gt; Bowden, Keith G, "Classical Computation can be Counterfactual", in Aspects I, Proc ANPA19, Cambridge 1997 (published May 1999), {{ISBN|0-9526215-3-3}} &lt;/ref&gt; describing a digital computer that could be counterfactually interrogated to calculate whether a light beam would fail to pass through a maze.&lt;ref name="Bowden2"&gt;{{Cite web

More recently the idea of counterfactual quantum communication has been proposed and demonstrated. &lt;ref&gt; Liu Y, et al. (2012) "Experimental demonstration of counterfactual quantum communication". Phys Rev Lett 109:030501 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the method==
The quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosten|first1=Onur|last2=Rakher|first2=Matthew T.|last3=Barreiro|first3=Julio T.|last4=Peters|first4=Nicholas A.|last5=Kwiat|first5=Paul G.|title=Counterfactual quantum computation through quantum interrogation|journal=Nature|date=December 14, 2005|volume=439|pages=949–952|doi=10.1038/nature04523|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7079/full/nature04523.html|pmid=16495993|bibcode=2006Natur.439..949H}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the common apparatus considered to date features a [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]]. The quantum computer is set in a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of "not running" and "running" states by means such as the [[Quantum Zeno Effect]]. Those state histories are [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|quantum interfered]]. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the "not running" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measuring]] that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Mitchison|first1=Graeme|last2=Jozsa|first2=Richard|title=The limits of counterfactual computation|date=February 1, 2008|arxiv=quant-ph/0606092}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Grover's algorithm]] even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.

==Definition==
The original formulation&lt;ref name="MitchinsonJozsa"/&gt; of Counterfactual Quantum Computation stated that a set ''m'' of measurement outcomes is a counterfactual outcome if (1) there is only one history associated to ''m'' and that history contains only "off" (non-running) states, and (2) there is only a single possible computational output associated to ''m''.

A refined definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Hosten|first1=Onur|last2=Rakher|first2=Matthew T.|last3=Barreiro|first3=Julio T.|last4=Peters|first4=Nicholas A.|last5=Kwiat|first5=Paul|title=Counterfactual computation revisited|date=Jun 26, 2006|arxiv=quant-ph/0607101}}&lt;/ref&gt; of counterfactual computation expressed in procedures and conditions is:  
(i) Identify and label all histories (quantum paths), with as many labels as needed, which lead to the same set ''m'' of measurement outcomes, and (ii) coherently superpose all possible histories. (iii) After cancelling the terms (if any) whose complex amplitudes together add to zero, the set ''m'' of measurement outcomes is a counterfactual outcome if (iv) there are no terms left with the computer-running label in their history labels, and (v) there is only a single possible computer output associated to ''m''.

==Mirror array==
In 1997, after discussions with [[Abner Shimony]] and [[Richard Jozsa]], and inspired by the idea of the (1993) Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester, Keith Bowden published a paper&lt;ref name="Bowden1"/&gt; describing a digital computer that could be counterfactually interrogated to calculate whether a photon would fail to pass through a maze of mirrors.&lt;ref name="Bowden2"/&gt; This so called Mirror-Array replaces the tentative Bomb in Elitzur and Vaidman’s device (actually a [[Mach-Zender interferometer]]). One time in four a photon will exit the device in such a way as to indicate that the maze is not navigable, even though the photon never passed through the Mirror Array. The Mirror Array itself is set up in such a way that it is defined by an n by n matrix of bits. The output (fail or otherwise) is itself defined by a single bit. Thus the Mirror Array itself is an n-squared bit in, 1 bit out digital computer which calculates mazes and can be run counterfactually. Although the overall device is clearly a quantum computer, the part which is counterfactually tested is semi classical.

==Experimental demonstration==

In 2015, Counterfactual Quantum Computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of "spins of a negatively charged Nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=Fei|last2=Ju|first2=Chenyong|last3=Huang|first3=Pu|last4=Wang|first4=Pengfei|last5=Kong|first5=Xi|last6=Shi|first6=Fazhan|last7=Jiang|first7=Liang|last8=Du|first8=Jiangfeng|title=Experimental Realization of High-Efficiency Counterfactual Computation|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=August 21, 2015|volume=115|issue=8|page=080501|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.080501|url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.080501|pmid=26340170|bibcode=2015PhRvL.115h0501K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]] of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zyga|first1=Lisa|title=Quantum computer that 'computes without running' sets efficiency record|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-08-quantum-efficiency.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Omicron Technology Limited|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calculus |Vector}}

In [[vector calculus]], the '''curl''' is a [[vector operator]] that describes the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimal]] [[rotation]] of a [[vector field]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]. The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.

The direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, as determined by the [[right-hand rule]], and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the [[flow velocity]] of a moving [[fluid]], then the curl is the '''[[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] density''' of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called [[irrotational]]. The curl is a form of [[derivative|differentiation]] for vector fields. The corresponding form of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] is [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem|Stokes' theorem]], which relates the [[surface integral]] of the curl of a vector field to the [[line integral]] of the vector field around the boundary curve.

The alternative terminology ''rotor'', ''rotation'' or ''rotational'' and alternative notations {{math|'''rot F'''}} and {{math|∇ × '''F'''}} are often used (the former especially in many European countries, the latter, using the [[del operator|del]] (or [[nabla operator|nabla]]) operator and the [[cross product]], is more used in other countries) for {{math|curl '''F'''}}. In a context where the cross product is denoted with the [[wedge (symbol)|wedge]] symbol, {{math|∇ ∧ '''F'''}} would be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/ngb23/FD/vecCalculus.pdf Summary of Vector Calculus] lecture notes&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]], curl does not generalize as simply to other dimensions; some [[#Generalizations|generalizations]] are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This is a similar phenomenon as in the 3 dimensional [[cross product]], and the connection is reflected in the notation {{math|∇ ×}} for the curl.

The name "curl" was first suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1871&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/MathematicalClassificationofPhysicalQuantities_Maxwell.pdf Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, March 9th, 1871]&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept was apparently first used in the construction of an optical field theory by [[James MacCullagh]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/collectedworks00maccuoft Collected works of James MacCullagh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Curl.svg|thumb|300px|The components of {{math|'''F'''}} at position {{math|ℝ}}, normal and tangent to a closed curve {{math|''C''}} in a plane, enclosing a planar [[vector area]] {{math|'''A''' {{=}} ''A'''''n̂'''}}.]]

&lt;!---DEL CROSS F IS NOT A DEFINITION, IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE NOTATION. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING SO YOU CAN'T BASE A DEFINITION ON IT-----&gt;The curl of a vector field {{math|'''F'''}}, denoted by {{math|curl '''F'''}}, or {{math|∇ × '''F'''}}, or {{math|rot '''F'''}}, at a point is defined in terms of its projection onto various lines through the point. If {{math|'''n̂'''}} is any unit vector, the projection of the curl of {{math|'''F'''}} onto {{math|'''n̂'''}} is defined to be the limiting value of a closed [[line integral]] in a plane orthogonal to {{math|'''n̂'''}} divided by the area enclosed, as the path of integration is contracted around the point.

The curl operator maps continuously differentiable functions {{math|''f'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to continuous functions {{math|''g'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and more generally, it maps [[Smooth function|{{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}]] functions in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. [[Image:Curlorient.svg|200px|right|thumb|Convention for vector orientation of the line integral]]

Implicitly, curl is defined by:&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical methods for physics and engineering, K.F. Riley, M.P. Hobson, S.J. Bence, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vector Analysis (2nd Edition), M.R. Spiegel, S. Lipschutz, D. Spellman, Schaum’s Outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \lim_{A \to 0}\left( \frac{1}{|A|}\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∮&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; '''F''' ⋅ ''d'''''r'''}} is a [[line integral]] along the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[area]] in question, and {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}} is the magnitude of the area. If {{math|'''n̂'''}} is the [[unit vector]] perpendicular to the plane, whereas {{math|'''ν̂'''}} is an outward-pointing in-plane normal (see caption at right), then the [[Orientability|orientation]] of {{mvar|C}} is chosen so that a [[tangent vector]] {{math|'''ω̂'''}} to {{mvar|C}} is [[orientation (mathematics)|positively oriented]] if and only if {{math|{'''n̂''','''ν̂''','''ω̂'''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} forms a positively oriented basis for {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} ([[right-hand rule]]).

The above formula means that the curl of a vector field is defined as the infinitesimal [[area density]] of the ''circulation'' of that field. To this definition fit naturally 
* the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]], as a global formula corresponding to the definition, and 
* the following "easy to memorize" definition of the curl in curvilinear [[orthogonal coordinates]], e.g. in [[Cartesian coordinates]], [[spherical coordinates|spherical]], [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical]], or even [[Elliptic coordinate system|elliptical]] or [[parabolic coordinates]]:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\operatorname{curl}\mathbf F)_1=\frac{1}{h_2h_3}\left (\frac{\partial (h_3F_3)}{\partial u_2}-\frac{\partial (h_2F_2)}{\partial u_3}\right ), \\[5pt]
&amp; (\operatorname{curl}\mathbf F)_2=\frac{1}{h_3h_1}\left (\frac{\partial (h_1F_1)}{\partial u_3}-\frac{\partial (h_3F_3)}{\partial u_1}\right ), \\[5pt]
&amp; (\operatorname{curl}\mathbf F)_3=\frac{1}{h_1h_2}\left (\frac{\partial (h_2F_2)}{\partial u_1}-\frac{\partial (h_1F_1)}{\partial u_2}\right ).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation for each component {{math|(curl '''F''')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be obtained by exchanging each occurrence of a subscript 1, 2, 3 in cyclic permutation: 1&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2, 2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;3, and&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;1 (where the subscripts represent the relevant indices).

If {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] and {{math|(''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the orthogonal coordinates, then 
:&lt;math&gt;h_i = \sqrt{\left (\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial u_i} \right )^2 + \left (\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial u_i} \right )^2 + \left (\frac{\partial x_3}{\partial u_i} \right )^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
is the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The remaining two components of curl result from [[cyclic permutation]] of [[index notation|indices]]: 3,1,2&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;1,2,3&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2,3,1.

===Intuitive interpretation===
Suppose the vector field describes the [[velocity field]] of a [[fluid flow]] (such as a large tank of [[liquid]] or [[gas]]) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Josiah Willard |last1=Gibbs|authorlink1=Josiah Willard Gibbs|first2=Edwin Bidwell|last2=Wilson|authorlink2=Edwin Bidwell Wilson|title=Vector analysis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=179|year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curl of the vector at any point is given  by the rotation of a infinitesimal area in the ''xy''-plane (for ''z''-axis component of the curl), ''zx''-plane (for ''y''-axis component of the curl) and ''yz''-plane (for ''x''-axis component of the curl vector). This can be clearly seen in the examples below.

== Usage ==
In practice, the above definition is rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] can be applied using some set of [[curvilinear coordinates]], for which simpler representations have been derived.

The notation {{math|∇ × '''F'''}} has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional [[cross product]], and it is useful as a [[mnemonic]] in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] if {{math|∇}} is taken as a vector [[differential operator]] [[del]]. Such notation involving [[operator (physics)|operators]] is common in [[physics]] and [[algebra]].

Expanded in 3-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (see ''[[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]'' for [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]] coordinate representations), {{math|∇ × '''F'''}} is, for {{math|'''F'''}} composed of {{math|[''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\[5pt]
{\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}} &amp; {\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}} &amp; {\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}} \\[10pt]
F_x &amp; F_y &amp; F_z \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, and {{math|'''k'''}} are the [[unit vector]]s for the {{math|''x''}}-, {{math|''y''}}-, and {{math|''z''}}-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Arfken, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i} + \left(\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) \mathbf{j} + \left(\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \\ \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.

In a general coordinate system, the curl is given by&lt;ref name="Mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Curl |urlname=Curl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} )^k = \varepsilon^{k\ell m} \nabla_\ell F_m&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ε}} denotes the [[Levi-Civita symbol#Levi-Civita tensors|Levi-Civita tensor]] and {{math|∇}} the [[covariant derivative]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to [[raising and lowering indices|lower the index]] on {{math|'''F'''}}, and the [[Einstein summation convention]] implies that repeated indices are summed over. Equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} ) = \mathbf{e}_k\varepsilon^{k\ell m} \nabla_l F_m&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the coordinate vector fields. Equivalently, using the [[exterior derivative]], the curl can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \star \big( {\mathrm d} F^\flat \big) \right)^\sharp &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{music|flat}} and {{music|sharp}} are the [[musical isomorphism]]s, and {{math|&lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;}} is the [[Hodge star operator]]. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of {{math|'''F'''}} in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] three-dimensional [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]] manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.

==Examples==

===Example 1===
Take the [[vector field]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=y\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}-x\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its corresponding plot:

[[Image:Uniform curl.svg|center|250px]]

Upon visual inspection, the field can be described as "rotating". If a stationary object were to be placed in the field with the vectors representing a linear [[force]], the object would rotate clockwise.

Calculating the curl:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F} =0\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}+0\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}+ \left({\frac{\partial}{\partial x}}(-x) -{\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} y\right)\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}=-2\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting vector field describing the curl would be uniformly going in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction. It should be noted that the results of this equation align with what could have been predicted using the [[right-hand rule]] using a [[Cartesian coordinate system#In three dimensions|right-handed coordinate system]]. Being a uniform vector field, the object described before would have the same rotational intensity regardless of where it was placed.

The plot describing the curl of {{math|'''F'''}}:

[[Image:Curl of uniform curl.png|center|250px]]

===Example 2===
Take the vector field:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=-x^2\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its corresponding plot:

[[Image:Nonuniform curl.svg|250px|center]]

Upon initial inspection, curl existing in this graph would not be obvious. However, taking the object in the previous example, and placing it anywhere on the line {{Math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, the force exerted on the right side would be slightly greater than the force exerted on the left, causing it to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, it can be predicted that the resulting curl would be straight in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction. Inversely, if placed on {{Math|''x'' {{=}} −3}}, the object would rotate counterclockwise and the right-hand rule would result in a positive {{Math|''z''}} direction.

Calculating the curl:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla} \times \mathbf{F} =0\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}+0\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}+ {\frac{\partial}{\partial x}}(-x^2) \boldsymbol{\hat{z}}=-2x\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As predicted, the curl points in the negative {{Math|''z''}} direction when {{Math|''x''}} is positive and vice versa. In this field, the intensity of rotation would be greater as the object moves away from the plane {{Math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.

[[Image:Curl of nonuniform curl.png|center|250px]]

===Identities===
{{Main article|Vector calculus identities}}
In general [[curvilinear coordinates]] (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}} can be shown to be

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left( \mathbf{v \times F} \right) = \Big( \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \cdot F } \right) + \mathbf{F \cdot \nabla} \Big) \mathbf{v}- \Big( \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \cdot v } \right) + \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla} \Big) \mathbf{F} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Interchanging the vector field {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|∇}} operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v \ \times } \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \times F} \right) =\nabla_\mathbf{F} \left( \mathbf{v \cdot F } \right) - \left( \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla } \right) \mathbf{ F} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;'''F'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} (i.e., in this case, {{math|'''v'''}} is treated as being constant in space).

Another example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left( \mathbf{\nabla \times F} \right) = \mathbf{\nabla} (\mathbf{\nabla \cdot F}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{F} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and this identity defines the [[vector Laplacian]] of {{math|'''F'''}}, symbolized as {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''F'''}}.

The curl of the [[gradient]] of ''any'' [[scalar field]] {{mvar|φ}} is always the [[zero vector]] field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times ( \nabla \varphi ) = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from the [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetry]] in the definition of the curl, and the [[symmetry of second derivatives]].

If {{mvar|φ}} is a scalar valued function and {{math|'''F'''}} is a vector field, then

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times ( \varphi \mathbf{F}) = \nabla \varphi \times \mathbf{F} + \varphi \nabla \times \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt;

===Descriptive examples===
* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk, the curl has the same value at all points.
* Of the four [[Maxwell's equations]], two—[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]—can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and rate of change of the electric field.

== Generalizations ==
The vector calculus operations of [[gradient|grad]], curl, and [[divergence|div]] are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying [[bivector]]s (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] {{math|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}&lt;/math&gt;(3)}} of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and {{math|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}&lt;/math&gt;(3)}}, these all being 3-dimensional spaces.

=== Differential forms ===
{{main article|Differential form}}
In 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}; a differential 1-form is the following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;a_1\,dx + a_2\,dy + a_3\,dz;&lt;/math&gt;
a differential 2-form is the formal sum:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{12}\,dx\wedge dy + a_{13}\,dx\wedge dz + a_{23}\,dy\wedge dz;&lt;/math&gt;
and a differential 3-form is defined by a single term:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{123}\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt;
(Here the {{mvar|a}}-coefficients are real functions; the "wedge products", e.g. {{math|''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}}, can be interpreted as some kind of oriented area elements, {{math|''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' {{=}} −''dy'' ∧ ''dx''}}, etc.)

The [[exterior derivative]] of a {{math|''k''}}-form in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is defined as the {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form from above—and in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{(k)}=\sum_{\scriptstyle{i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k} \atop \forall \scriptstyle{i_\nu\in 1,\ldots,n}} a_{i_1,\ldots,i_k}\,dx_{i_1}\wedge \cdots\wedge dx_{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;

then the exterior derivative {{math|''d''}} leads to

:&lt;math&gt; d\omega^{(k)}=\sum_{\scriptstyle{j=1} \atop \scriptstyle{i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k}}^n\frac{\partial a_{i_1,\ldots,i_k}}{\partial x_j}\,dx_j \wedge dx_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, e.g. because of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\,\partial y}=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y\,\partial x},&lt;/math&gt;

the twofold application of the exterior derivative leads to 0.

Thus, denoting the space of {{math|''k''}}-forms by {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and the exterior derivative by {{math|''d''}} one gets a sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \, \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \, \Omega^0(\mathbf{R}^3) \, \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \, \Omega^1(\mathbf{R}^3) \, \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \, \Omega^2(\mathbf{R}^3) \, \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \, \Omega^3(\mathbf{R}^3) \, \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \, 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is the space of sections of the [[exterior algebra]] {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} [[vector bundle]] over ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, whose dimension is the [[binomial coefficient]] {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''k''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}; note that {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''k'' &gt; 3}} or {{math|''k'' &lt; 0}}. Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of [[Pascal's triangle]]:

:0 → 1 → 3 → 3 → 1 → 0;

the 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.

Differential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], {{math|''k''}}-forms can be identified with [[p-vector|{{math|''k''}}-vector]] fields ({{math|''k''}}-forms are {{math|''k''}}-covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an ''oriented'' vector space with a [[nondegenerate form]] (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between {{math|''k''}}-vectors and {{math|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange {{math|''k''}}-forms, {{math|''k''}}-vector fields, {{math|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-forms, and {{math|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-vector fields; this is known as [[Hodge duality]]. Concretely, on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} this is given by:
* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dx'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; dy'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; dz''}} corresponds to the vector field {{math|(''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}.
* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces {{math|''dx''}} by the dual quantity {{math|''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} (i.e., omit {{math|''dx''}}), and likewise, taking care of orientation: {{math|''dy''}} corresponds to {{math|''dz'' ∧ ''dx'' {{=}} −''dx'' ∧ ''dz''}}, and {{math|''dz''}} corresponds to {{math|''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}}. Thus the form {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dx'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; dy'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; dz''}} corresponds to the "dual form" {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; dx'' ∧ ''dy'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; dz'' ∧ ''dx'' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dy'' ∧ ''dz''}}.

Thus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:
* grad takes a function (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);
* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a vector field (2-form);
* div takes a vector field (2-form) to a function (3-form)

On the other hand, the fact that {{math|''d''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}} corresponds to the identities
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\nabla f) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for any function {{mvar|f}}, and
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times\mathbf v)=0&lt;/math&gt;
for any vector field {{math|'''v'''}}.

Grad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and {{math|''n''}}-forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-forms are always fiberwise {{math|''n''}}-dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.

Curl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are

:0 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 0;

so the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a ''2-vector field'', which is fiberwise 6-dimensional, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{(2)}=\sum_{i&lt;k=1,2,3,4}a_{i,k}\,dx_i\wedge dx_k,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero ({{math|''d''{{isup|2}} {{=}} 0}}). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.

However, one can define a curl of a vector field as a ''2-vector field'' in general, as described below.

=== Curl geometrically ===
2-vectors correspond to the exterior power {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}}; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] {{math|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}&lt;/math&gt;(''V'')}} of infinitesimal rotations. This has {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=2}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' − 1)}} dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) does {{math|''n'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' − 1)}}, which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar – an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra {{math|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}&lt;/math&gt;(4)}}.

Note also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}) is simply a vertical vector field (in the {{math|''z''}} direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.

Considering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609260 Generalizing Cross Products and Maxwell's Equations to Universal Extra Dimensions], A.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''Deligne–Mumford stack''' is a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] ''F'' such that
*(i) the diagonal morphism &lt;math&gt;F \to F \times F&lt;/math&gt; is [[representable morphism of stacks|representable]], quasi-compact and separated.
*(ii) There is a scheme ''U'' and [[étale morphism|étale]] surjective map &lt;math&gt;U\to F&lt;/math&gt; (called an [[atlas of an algebraic stack|atlas]]).

[[Pierre Deligne]] and [[David Mumford]] introduced this notion in 1969 when they proved that [[moduli space of algebraic curves|moduli spaces]] of [[stable curve]]s of fixed [[arithmetic genus]] are [[proper morphism|proper]] [[smooth stack|smooth]] Deligne–Mumford stacks.

If the "étale" is weakened to "[[smooth morphism|smooth]]", then such a stack is called an [[algebraic stack]] (also called an Artin stack, after [[Michael Artin]]). An [[algebraic space]] is Deligne–Mumford.

A key fact about a Deligne–Mumford stack ''F'' is that any ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;F(B)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''B'' is quasi-compact, has only finitely many automorphisms.&lt;!-- need a ref: Sometime a Deligne–Mumford stack is called "quasi-projective" if it has the [[resolution property]]; i.e., a [[coherent sheaf]] is a quotient of a locally free coherent sheaf.--&gt;
A Deligne–Mumford stack admits a presentation by a [[groupoid]]; see [[groupoid scheme]].

== Examples ==
=== Affine Stacks ===
Deligne–Mumford stacks are typically constructed by taking the [[stack quotient]] of some variety where the stabilizers are finite groups. For example, consider the action of the cyclic group &lt;math&gt;C_n = \langle a \mid a^n =1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;a\cdot\colon(x,y) \mapsto (\zeta_n x, \zeta_n y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the stack quotient &lt;math&gt;[\mathbb{C}^2/C_n]&lt;/math&gt; is an affine smooth Deligne–Mumford stack with a non-trivial stabilizer at the origin. If we wish to think about this as a category fibered in groupoids over &lt;math&gt;(\text{Sch}/\mathbb{C})_{fppf}&lt;/math&gt; then given a scheme &lt;math&gt;S \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; the over category is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[s]/(s^n-1))\times \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x,y])(S) \rightrightarrows \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x,y])(S).
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we could be slightly more general if we consider the group action on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^2 \in \text{Sch}/\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n])&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Weighted Projective Line ===
Non-affine examples come up when taking the stack quotient for weighted projective space/varieties. For example, the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(2,3)&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by the stack quotient &lt;math&gt;[\mathbb{C}^2-\{ 0\}/\mathbb{C}^*]&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^*&lt;/math&gt;-action is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda \cdot (x,y) = (\lambda^2x,\lambda^3y).
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that since this quotient is not from a finite group we have to look for points with stabilizers and their respective stabilizer groups. Then &lt;math&gt;(x,y) = (\lambda^2x,\lambda^3y)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \zeta_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \zeta_3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, showing that the only stabilizers are finite, hence the stack is Deligne–Mumford.

=== Non-Example ===
One simple non-example of a Deligne–Mumford stack is &lt;math&gt;[pt/\mathbb{C}^*]&lt;/math&gt; since this has an infinite stabilizer. Stacks of this form are examples of Artin stacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11202">In [[mathematics]], the '''discrete sine transform (DST)''' is a [[List of Fourier-related transforms|Fourier-related transform]] similar to the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT), but using a purely [[real number|real]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  It is equivalent to the imaginary parts of a DFT of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with [[even and odd functions|odd]] [[symmetry]] (since the Fourier transform of a real and odd function is imaginary and odd), where in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample.

A related transform is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT), which is equivalent to a DFT of real and ''even'' functions.  See the DCT article for a general discussion of how the boundary conditions relate the various DCT and DST types.

== Applications ==

DSTs are widely employed in solving [[partial differential equation]]s by [[spectral methods]], where the different variants of the DST correspond to slightly different odd/even boundary conditions at the two ends of the array.

==Informal overview==
[[Image:DST-symmetries.svg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of the implicit even/odd extensions of DST input data, for ''N''=9 data points (red dots), for the four most common types of DST (types I–IV).]]

Like any Fourier-related transform, discrete sine transforms (DSTs) express a function or a signal in terms of a sum of [[trigonometric function|sinusoids]] with different [[frequencies]] and [[amplitude]]s.  Like the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT), a DST operates on a function at a finite number of discrete data points.  The obvious distinction between a DST and a DFT is that the former uses only [[sine function]]s, while the latter uses both cosines and sines (in the form of [[complex exponential]]s).  However, this visible difference is merely a consequence of a deeper distinction: a DST implies different [[boundary condition]]s than the DFT or other related transforms.

The Fourier-related transforms that operate on a function over a finite [[domain (mathematics)|domain]], such as the DFT or DST or a [[Fourier series]], can be thought of as implicitly defining an ''extension'' of that function outside the domain.  That is, once you write a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as a sum of sinusoids, you can evaluate that sum at any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, even for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where the original &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; was not specified.  The DFT, like the Fourier series, implies a [[periodic function|periodic]] extension of the original function.  A DST, like a [[Sine and cosine transforms|sine transform]], implies an [[even and odd functions|odd]] extension of the original function.

However, because DSTs operate on ''finite'', ''discrete'' sequences, two issues arise that do not apply for the continuous sine transform.  First, one has to specify whether the function is even or odd at ''both'' the left and right boundaries of the domain (i.e. the min-''n'' and max-''n'' boundaries in the definitions below, respectively).  Second, one has to specify around ''what point'' the function is even or odd.  In particular, consider a sequence (''a'',''b'',''c'') of three equally spaced data points, and say that we specify an odd ''left'' boundary.  There are two sensible possibilities: either the data is odd about the point ''prior'' to ''a'', in which case the odd extension is (&amp;minus;''c'',&amp;minus;''b'',&amp;minus;''a'',0,''a'',''b'',''c''), or the data is odd about the point ''halfway'' between ''a'' and the previous point, in which case the odd extension is (&amp;minus;''c'',&amp;minus;''b'',&amp;minus;''a'',''a'',''b'',''c'')

These choices lead to all the standard variations of DSTs and also [[discrete cosine transform]]s (DCTs).  
Each boundary can be either even or odd (2 choices per boundary) and can be symmetric about a data point or the point halfway between two data points (2 choices per boundary), for a total of &lt;math&gt;2\times2\times2\times2=16&lt;/math&gt; possibilities.  Half of these possibilities, those where the ''left'' boundary is odd, correspond to the 8 types of DST; the other half are the 8 types of DCT.

These different boundary conditions strongly affect the applications of the transform, and lead to uniquely useful properties for the various DCT types.  Most directly, when using Fourier-related transforms to solve [[partial differential equation]]s by [[spectral method]]s, the boundary conditions are directly specified as a part of the problem being solved.

== Definition ==

Formally, the discrete sine transform is a [[linear]], invertible [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''F'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (where '''R''' denotes the set of [[real number]]s), or equivalently an ''N'' &amp;times; ''N'' [[square matrix]].  There are several variants of the DST with slightly modified definitions.  The ''N'' real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; are transformed into the ''N'' real numbers ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; according to one of the formulas:

=== DST-I ===

:&lt;math&gt;X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin \left[\frac \pi {N+1} (n+1) (k+1) \right] \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1&lt;/math&gt;

The DST-I matrix is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (up to a scale factor).

A DST-I is exactly equivalent to a DFT of a real sequence that is odd around the zero-th and middle points, scaled by 1/2.  For example, a DST-I of ''N''=3 real numbers (''a'',''b'',''c'') is exactly equivalent to a DFT of eight real numbers (0,''a'',''b'',''c'',0,&amp;minus;''c'',&amp;minus;''b'',&amp;minus;''a'') (odd symmetry), scaled by 1/2.  (In contrast, DST types II–IV involve a half-sample shift in the equivalent DFT.)  This is the reason for the ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 in the denominator of the sine function: the equivalent DFT has 2(''N''+1) points and has 2π/2(''N''+1) in its sinusoid frequency, so the DST-I has π/(''N''+1) in its frequency.

Thus, the DST-I corresponds to the boundary conditions: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 and odd around ''n''=''N''; similarly for ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== DST-II ===

:&lt;math&gt;X_k =
   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin \left[\frac \pi N \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) (k+1)\right] \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors further multiply the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; term by 1/{{radic|2}} (see below for the corresponding change in DST-III).  This makes the DST-II matrix [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (up to a scale factor), but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-odd DFT of half-shifted input.

The DST-II implies the boundary conditions: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 and odd around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/2; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 and even around ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

=== DST-III ===

:&lt;math&gt;X_k = \frac{(-1)^k}{2} x_{N-1} + \sum_{n=0}^{N-2} x_n \sin \left[\frac{\pi}{N} (n+1) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right] \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors further multiply the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; term by {{radic|2}} (see above for the corresponding change in DST-II). This makes the DST-III matrix [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (up to a scale factor), but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-odd DFT of half-shifted output.

The DST-III implies the boundary conditions: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 and even around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 and odd around ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/2.

=== DST-IV ===

:&lt;math&gt;X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin \left[\frac \pi N  \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right] \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1&lt;/math&gt;

The DST-IV matrix is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (up to a scale factor).

The DST-IV implies the boundary conditions: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is odd around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 and even around ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/2; similarly for ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== DST V–VIII ===

DST types I–IV are equivalent to real-odd DFTs of even order.  In principle, there are actually four additional types of discrete sine transform (Martucci, 1994), corresponding to real-odd DFTs of logically odd order, which have factors of ''N''+1/2 in the denominators of the sine arguments.  However, these variants seem to be rarely used in practice.

=== Inverse transforms ===

The inverse of DST-I is DST-I multiplied by 2/(''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).  The inverse of DST-IV is DST-IV multiplied by 2/''N''.  The inverse of DST-II is DST-III multiplied by 2/''N'' (and vice versa).

As for the [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]], the normalization factor in front of these transform definitions is merely a convention and differs between treatments.  For example, some authors multiply the transforms by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2/N}&lt;/math&gt; so that the inverse does not require any additional multiplicative factor.

=== Computation ===

Although the direct application of these formulas would require O(''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) operations, it is possible to compute the same thing with only O(''N'' log ''N'') complexity by factorizing the computation similar to the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT).  (One can also compute DSTs via FFTs combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing steps.)

A DST-III or DST-IV can be computed from a DCT-III or DCT-IV (see [[discrete cosine transform]]), respectively, by reversing the order of the inputs and flipping the sign of every other output, and vice versa for DST-II from DCT-II. In this way it follows that types II–IV of the DST require exactly the same number of arithmetic operations (additions and multiplications) as the corresponding DCT types.

In [[tensor calculus]], the '''divergence theorem''', also known as '''Gauss's theorem''' or '''Ostrogradsky's theorem''',&lt;ref&gt;or less correctly as '''[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' theorem'''&lt;!--apostrophe is correct.--&gt; (see history for reason)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Katz  | first = Victor J.  | title = The history of Stokes's theorem  | journal = Mathematics Magazine  | volume = 52  | issue = | pages = 146–156 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | year = 1979 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.2307/2690275| id =}} reprinted in {{cite book| last = Anderson | first = Marlow | title = Who Gave You the Epsilon?: And Other Tales of Mathematical History | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 78–79  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WwFMjsym9JwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22ostrogradsky's+theorem | doi = | id = | isbn = 0883855690}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a result that relates the flow (that is, [[flux]]) of a [[tensor field]] through a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] to the behavior of the tensor field inside the surface.

More precisely, the divergence theorem states that the outward [[flux]] of a tensor field through a  closed surface is equal to the [[volume integral]] of the [[divergence]] over the region inside the surface. Intuitively, it states that ''the sum of all sources (with sinks regarded as negative sources) gives the net flux out of a region''.

The divergence theorem is an important result for the mathematics of [[physics]] and [[engineering]], in particular in [[electrostatics]] and [[fluid dynamics]].

In physics and engineering, the divergence theorem is usually applied in three dimensions. However, it generalizes to any number of dimensions. In one dimension, it is equivalent to the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. In two dimensions, it is equivalent to [[Green's theorem]].

The theorem is a special case of the more general [[Stokes' theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Stewart|first = James|author-link = James Stewart (mathematician)|title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2008 | edition = 6 | chapter = Vector Calculus | isbn = 978-0-495-01166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intuition ==
If a fluid is flowing in some area, then the rate at which fluid flows out of a certain region within that area can be calculated by adding up the sources inside the region and subtracting the sinks. The fluid flow is represented by a first order (or a vector) field, and the vector field's divergence at a given point describes the strength of the source or sink there. So, integrating the field's divergence over the interior of the region should equal the integral of the vector field over the region's boundary. The divergence theorem says that this is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=R. G. Lerner |author2=G. L. Trigg |edition = 2nd | title = Encyclopaedia of Physics | publisher = VHC | year = 1994 | isbn = 3-527-26954-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence theorem is employed in any [[conservation law]] which states that the volume total of all sinks and sources, that is the volume integral of the divergence, is equal to the net flow across the volume's boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Byron | first1 = Frederick | last2 = Fuller | first2 =  Robert | author2-link = Robert W. Fuller | title = Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1992 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-486-67164-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical statement==
[[File:Divergence theorem.svg|thumb|right|250px|A region {{mvar|V}} bounded by the surface {{math|''S'' {{=}} ∂''V''}} with the surface normal {{mvar|n}}]]
[[File:SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg|right|thumb|200px|The divergence theorem can be used to calculate a flux through a [[closed surface]] that fully encloses a volume, like any of the surfaces on the left. It can ''not'' directly be used to calculate the flux through surfaces with boundaries, like those on the right. (Surfaces are blue, boundaries are red.)]]

Suppose {{mvar|V}} is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (in the case of {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3, ''V''}} represents a volume in [[three-dimensional space]]) which is [[compact space|compact]] and has a [[piecewise]] [[smooth surface|smooth boundary]] {{mvar|S}} (also indicated with {{math|∂''V'' {{=}} ''S''&amp;thinsp;}}). If {{math|'''F'''}} is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of {{mvar|V}}, then we have:&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipschutz |author3=D. Spellman | title = Vector Analysis | edition = 2nd | series = Schaum’s Outlines | publisher = McGraw Hill | location = USA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-07-161545-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V\left(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)\,dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n})\,dS .&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The left side is a [[volume integral]] over the volume {{mvar|V}}, the right side is the [[surface integral]] over the boundary of the volume {{mvar|V}}. The closed manifold {{math|∂''V''}} is quite generally the boundary of {{mvar|V}} oriented by outward-pointing [[normal (geometry)|normals]], and {{math|'''n'''}} is the outward pointing unit normal field of the boundary {{math|∂''V''}}. ({{math|''d'''''S'''}} may be used as a shorthand for {{math|'''n'''''dS''}}.) The symbol within the two integrals stresses once more that {{math|∂''V''}} is a ''closed'' surface. In terms of the intuitive description above, the left-hand side of the equation represents the total of the sources in the volume {{mvar|V}}, and the right-hand side represents the total flow across the boundary {{mvar|S}}.

===Corollaries===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; in the divergence theorem with specific forms, other useful identities can be derived (cf. [[vector identities]]).&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf F\times\mathbf{G}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

::{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V \mathbf{c} \cdot \nabla f \, dV =&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{c} f) \cdot d\mathbf{S} - \iiint_V f (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{c})\, dV.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
:The last term on the right vanishes for constant &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; or any divergence free (solenoidal) vector field,  e.g. Incompressible flows without sources or sinks such as phase change or chemical reactions etc. In particular, taking &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; to be constant:

::{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V \nabla f \, dV =&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;f d\mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

* With &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\rightarrow \mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; for vector field {{math|'''F'''}} and constant vector '''c''':&lt;ref name=mathworld/&gt;

| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V\mathbf{c} \cdot (\nabla\times\mathbf{F}) \, dV =&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{c}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

: By reordering the [[triple product]] on the right hand side and taking out the constant vector of the integral, 

::{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt; \iiint_V (\nabla \times\mathbf{F}) \, dV \cdot \mathbf{c} = &lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt; (d\mathbf{S} \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{c}. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

: Hence,

::{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt; \iiint_V (\nabla \times\mathbf{F}) \, dV = &lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{F} dS. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Example ==
[[File:Vector Field on a Sphere.png|thumb|The vector field corresponding to the example shown. Note, vectors may point into or out of the sphere.]]

Suppose we wish to evaluate

:{{oiint
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n} \, dS,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where {{mvar|S}} is the [[unit sphere]] defined by

:&lt;math&gt;S = \left \{ (x,y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \ : \ x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|'''F'''}} is the [[vector field]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = 2 x\mathbf{i}+y^2\mathbf{j}+z^2\mathbf{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The direct computation of this integral is quite difficult, but we can simplify the derivation of the result using the divergence theorem, because the divergence theorem says that the integral is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_W (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})\,dV = 2\iiint_W (1 + y + z)\,dV = 2\iiint_W dV + 2\iiint_W y\,dV + 2\iiint_W z\,dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|W}} is the unit ball:

:&lt;math&gt;W = \left \{ (x,y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \ : \ x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 1 \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the function {{mvar|y}} is positive in one hemisphere of {{mvar|W}} and negative in the other, in an equal and opposite way, its total integral over {{mvar|W}} is zero. The same is true for {{mvar|z}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_W y\, dV = \iiint_W z\, dV = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:{{oiint
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,{d}S = 2\iiint_W\, dV = \frac{8\pi}{3},&lt;/math&gt;
}}

because the unit ball {{mvar|W}} has [[volume]] {{math|{{sfrac|4''π''|3}}}}.

==Applications==

===''Differential form'' and ''integral form'' of physical laws===

As a result of the divergence theorem, a host of physical laws can be written in both a differential form (where one quantity is the divergence of another) and an integral form (where the flux of one quantity through a closed surface is equal to another quantity). Three examples are [[Gauss's law]] (in [[electrostatics]]), [[Gauss's law for magnetism]], and [[Gauss's law for gravity]].

====Continuity equations====
{{main|continuity equation}}

[[Continuity equation]]s offer more examples of laws with both differential and integral forms, related to each other by the divergence theorem. In [[fluid dynamics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativity theory]], and a number of other fields, there are [[continuity equation]]s that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, probability, or other quantities. Generically, these equations state that the divergence of the flow of the conserved quantity is equal to the distribution of ''sources'' or ''sinks'' of that quantity. The divergence theorem states that any such continuity equation can be written in a differential form (in terms of a divergence) and an integral form (in terms of a flux).&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author=C.B. Parker|edition=2nd|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics| publisher=McGraw Hill| year=1994 | isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverse-square laws===
Any ''[[inverse-square law]]'' can instead be written in a ''Gauss's law''-type form (with a differential and integral form, as described above). Two examples are [[Gauss' law|Gauss's law]] (in electrostatics), which follows from the inverse-square [[Coulomb's law]], and [[Gauss' law for gravity|Gauss's law for gravity]], which follows from the inverse-square [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The derivation of the Gauss's law-type equation from the inverse-square formulation or vice versa is exactly the same in both cases; see either of those articles for details.&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994"/&gt;

== History ==
The [[theorem]] was first discovered by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in 1762,&lt;ref&gt;In his 1762 paper on sound, Lagrange treats a special case of the divergence theorem: Lagrange (1762) "Nouvelles recherches sur la nature et la propagation du son" (New researches on the nature and propagation of sound), ''Miscellanea Taurinensia'' (also known as: ''Mélanges de Turin'' ), '''2''': 11 - 172.  This article is reprinted as: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TA4DeQw1NoC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Nouvelles recherches sur la nature et la propagation du son"]  in: J.A. Serret, ed., ''Oeuvres de Lagrange'', (Paris, France: Gauthier-Villars, 1867), vol. 1, pages 151-316; [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TA4DeQw1NoC&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false on pages 263-265], Lagrange transforms triple integrals into double integrals using integration by parts.&lt;/ref&gt; then later independently rediscovered by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1813,&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Gauss (1813) [https://books.google.com.sv/books?id=ASwoAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Theoria attractionis corporum sphaeroidicorum ellipticorum homogeneorum methodo nova tractata,"] ''Commentationes societatis regiae scientiarium Gottingensis recentiores'', '''2''': 355-378; Gauss considered a special case of the theorem; see the 4th, 5th, and 6th pages of his article.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], who also gave the first proof of the general theorem,  in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Ostragradsky presented his proof of the divergence theorem to the Paris Academy in 1826; however, his work was not published by the Academy.  He returned to St. Petersburg, Russia, where in 1828-1829 he read the work that he'd done in France, to the St. Petersburg Academy, which published his work in abbreviated form in 1831.
*  His proof of the divergence theorem -- "Démonstration d'un théorème du calcul intégral" (Proof of a theorem in integral calculus) -- which he had read to the Paris Academy on February 13, 1826, was translated, in 1965, into Russian together with another article by him.

Wheelhouse, 1838).  A form of the "divergence theorem" appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=GwYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 10–12].&lt;/ref&gt; etc.&lt;ref&gt;Other early investigators who used some form of the divergence theorem include:
*[[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (presented: February 2, 1824 ; published: 1826) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3220m/f255.image "Mémoire sur la théorie du magnétisme"] (Memoir on the theory of magnetism), ''Mémoires de l'Académie des sciences de l'Institut de France'', '''5''': 247–338; on pages 294–296, Poisson transforms a volume integral (which is used to evaluate a quantity Q) into a surface integral.  To make this transformation, Poisson follows the same procedure that is used to prove the divergence theorem.
*  [[Pierre Frédéric Sarrus|Frédéric Sarrus]] (1828) "Mémoire sur les oscillations des corps flottans" (Memoir on the oscillations of floating bodies), ''Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées'' (Nismes), '''19''': 185–211.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, variations on the divergence theorem are correctly called Ostrogradsky's theorem, but also commonly Gauss's theorem, or [[Green's theorem]].

== Examples ==
To verify the planar variant of the divergence theorem for a region {{mvar|R}}:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \left \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ : \ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

and the vector field:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}(x,y)= 2 y\mathbf{i} + 5x \mathbf{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary of {{mvar|R}} is the unit circle, {{mvar|C}}, that can be represented parametrically by:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \cos(s), \quad  y = \sin(s)&lt;/math&gt;

such that {{math|0 ≤ ''s'' ≤ 2''π''}} where {{mvar|s}} units is the length arc from the point {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} to the point {{mvar|P}} on {{mvar|C}}. Then a vector equation of {{mvar|C}} is

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \cos(s)\mathbf{i} + \sin(s)\mathbf{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

At a point {{mvar|P}} on {{mvar|C}}:

:&lt;math&gt; P = (\cos(s),\, \sin(s)) \, \Rightarrow \, \mathbf{F} = 2\sin(s)\mathbf{i} + 5\cos(s)\mathbf{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, ds &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} (2 \sin(s) \mathbf{i} + 5 \cos(s) \mathbf{j}) \cdot (\cos(s) \mathbf{i} + \sin(s) \mathbf{j})\, ds\\
&amp;= \int_{0}^{2\pi} (2 \sin(s) \cos(s) + 5 \sin(s) \cos(s))\, ds\\
&amp;= 7\int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin(s) \cos(s)\, ds\\
&amp;= 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''M'' {{=}} 2''y'', {{sfrac|∂''M''|∂''x''}} {{=}} 0}}, and because {{math|''N'' {{=}} 5''x'', {{sfrac|∂''N''|∂''y''}} {{=}} 0}}. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_R \, \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F} \,dA = \iint_R \left (\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial N}{\partial y} \right) \, dA = 0.  &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Multiple dimensions===
One can use the general [[Stokes' Theorem]] to equate the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional volume integral of the divergence of a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} over a region {{mvar|U}} to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional surface integral of {{math|'''F'''}} over the boundary of {{mvar|U}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \underbrace{ \int \cdots \int_U }_{n} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV = \underbrace{ \oint \cdots \oint_{\partial U} }_{n-1} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is also known as the Divergence theorem.

When {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, this is equivalent to [[Green's theorem]].

When {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}, it reduces to the [[Fundamental theorem of calculus]].

===Tensor fields===
{{main|Tensor field}}

Writing the theorem in [[Einstein notation]]:

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{F}_i}{\partial x_i}dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_i n_i\,dS &lt;/math&gt;
}}

suggestively, replacing the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} with a rank-{{mvar|n}} tensor field {{mvar|T}}, this can be generalized to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.F. Riley |author2=M.P. Hobson |author3=S.J. Bence | title=Mathematical methods for physics and engineering| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2010 | isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V \dfrac{\partial T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_q\cdots i_n}}{\partial x_{i_q}}dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_q\cdots i_n}n_{i_q}\,dS .&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where on each side, [[tensor contraction]] occurs for at least one index. This form of the theorem is still in 3d, each index takes values 1, 2, and 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7370">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''dual object''' is an analogue of a [[dual vector space]] from [[linear algebra]] for [[object (category theory)|objects]] in arbitrary [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]. It's only a partial generalization, based upon the categorical properties of [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] for [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s. An object admitting a dual is called a '''dualizable object'''. In this formalism, infinite-dimensional vector spaces are not dualizable, since the dual vector space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't satisfy the axioms.&lt;ref name="traces"&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = Kate | last1 = Ponto | first2 = Michael | last2 = Shulman|title = Traces in symmetric monoidal categories | journal = Expositiones Mathematicae | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | year = 2014 | pages = 248-273 | arxiv = 1107.6032| bibcode = 2011arXiv1107.6032P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, an object is dualizable only when it satisfies some finiteness or compactness property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Becker | first1 = James C. | last2 = Gottlieb | first2 = Daniel Henry | editor-last=James | editor-first = I.M. | title = History of topology | publisher= North Holland | date = 1999 | pages = 725–745 | chapter=A history of duality in algebraic topology | isbn=9780444823755 | chapter-url =http://www.math.purdue.edu/~gottlieb/Bibliography/53.pdf}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A category in which each object has a dual is called '''autonomous''' or '''rigid'''. A category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with a standard [[tensor product]] is rigid, while the category of all vector spaces is not. 

==Motivation==
Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''. A standard notion of a [[dual vector space]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; has the following property. For any vector spaces ''U'' and ''W'' there is an [[adjoint functors|adjunction]] Hom&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'' ⊗ ''V'',''W'') = Hom&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'', ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ ''W''), and this characterizes ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; up to a unique isomorphism. This expression makes sense in any category with an appropriate replacement for the [[tensor product]] of vector spaces. For any [[monoidal category]] (''C'', ⊗) one may attempt to define a dual of an object ''V'' to be an object ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''C'' with a [[natural isomorphism]] of [[bifunctor]]s
:Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;((–)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''V'', (–)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;((–)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ (–)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
For a well-behaved notion of duality, this map should be not only natural in the sense of category theory, but also respect the monoidal structure in some way.&lt;ref name="traces" /&gt; An actual definition of a dual object is thus more complicated.

In a [[closed monoidal category]] ''C'', i.e. a monoidal category with an [[internal Hom]] functor, an alternative approach is to simulate the standard definition of a dual vector space as a space of [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]]. For an object ''V'' ∈ ''C'' define ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_C(V, \mathbb{1}_C)&lt;/math&gt;, where 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; is the monoidal identity. In some cases, this object will be a dual object to ''V'' in a sense above, but in general it leads to a different theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dual object in a closed category in nLab|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dual+object+in+a+closed+category|website=ncatlab.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Consider an object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in a [[monoidal category]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{C},\otimes, I, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)&lt;/math&gt;. The object &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''left dual''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exist two morphsims
:&lt;math&gt;\eta:I\to X\otimes X^*&lt;/math&gt;,  called the '''coevaluation''', and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon:X^*\otimes X\to I&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''evaluation''', 
such that the following two diagrams commute
{|
| [[File:Dual-one.png|350px]]
| width="100pt" style="text-align: center;" | and 
| [[File:Dual-two.png|350px]]
|}

The object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''right dual''' of &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;. Left duals are canonically isomorphic when they exist, as are right duals.  When ''C'' is [[braided monoidal category|braided]] (or [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]), every left dual is also a right dual, and vice versa.

If we consider a monoidal category as a [[bicategory]] with one object, a dual pair is exactly an [[adjoint pair]].

==Examples==
* Consider a monoidal category (Vect&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of [[vector space]]s over a field ''k'' with a standard tensor product. A space ''V'' is dualizable if and only if it's a finite-dimensional vector space. In that case the dual object ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; coincides with the standard notion of a [[dual vector space]].
* Consider a monoidal category (Mod&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' with a standard [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]]. A module ''M'' is dualizable if and only if it's a [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module]]. In that case the dual object ''R''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is also given by the module of homomorphisms Hom&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', ''R'').
* Consider a [[homotopy category]] of [[pointed space|pointed]] [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] Ho(Sp) with a [[smash product]] as a monoidal structure. If ''M'' is a [[compact space|compact]] [[deformation retract|neighborhood retract]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (for example, a compact smooth [[manifold]]), then the corresponding pointed spectrum Σ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is dualizable. This is a consequence of [[Spanier–Whitehead duality]], which implies in particular [[Poincaré duality]] for compact manifolds.&lt;ref name="traces"/&gt;
* The category &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt; of endofunctors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a monoidal category under functor composition. It is true that a functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a left dual of a functor &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;F \dashv G&lt;/math&gt;, that is if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is left adjoint to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See for example exercise 2.10.4 in [[Pavel Etingof]] "Tensor Categories" &lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories with duals ==

A monoidal category where every object has a left (respectively right) dual is sometimes called a '''left''' (respectively  right) '''autonomous''' category.   Algebraic geometers call it a '''left''' (respectively  right) '''[[rigid category]]'''.  A monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual is called an '''[[autonomous category]]'''.  An autonomous category that is also [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] is called a '''[[compact closed category]]'''.

'''Exponential growth''' is exhibited when the [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]]—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an [[exponential function]] of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent.
[[Exponential decay]] occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative.  In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''', the function values forming a [[geometric progression]].  In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of ''x'' at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication.  For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 5% = 0.05}} per interval, the passage of one interval would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05}}; two intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05}}; and three intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05}}.  In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent.  (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the [[associative property]] of multiplication.)

Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an [[exponential function]].  This contrasts with growth based on a [[power function]], where the time variable is the base value raised to a fixed exponent, such as cubic growth (or in general terms denoted as [[Growth_rate_(group_theory)|polynomial growth]]).

*'''[[Biology]]'''
** The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism  and gene expression.&lt;ref name="SlavovBudnik2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705–714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
** A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.
** [[World population|Human population]], if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see [[logistic growth]]). For example, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the [[doubling time]] of the American population (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Census Data, "U.S. Census Bureau", 20 Dec 2012, Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121220035511/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Physics]]'''
** [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.
** [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. "Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequencies]] of the signal over others.
* '''[[Economics]]'''
** [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.
* '''[[Finance]]'''
** [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also [[rule of 72]].
** [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.
* [[Computer|'''Computer technology''']]
** [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)
** In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

==Basic formula==
A quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=a\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''τ'' is the [[time constant]]—the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\tau)=a \cdot b^{\frac{t+\tau}{\tau}} = a \cdot b^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \cdot b^{\frac{\tau}{\tau}} = x(t)\cdot b\, .&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''τ'' &lt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, or {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}}  and 0 &lt; {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].

Example: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min.

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}=1\cdot 2^{(60\text{ min})/(10\text{ min})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(1\text{ hr})= 1 \cdot 2^6 =64.&lt;/math&gt;

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''τ'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''τ'' proportional to log&amp;nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''τ''. For any non-zero time ''τ'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\cdot e^{t/\tau} = x_0 \cdot 2^{t/T}
= x_0\cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^{t/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].
* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''τ'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.
The quantities ''k'', ''τ'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{\ln 2}{T} = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''τ'' and ''T'' being infinite.

If ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],
i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \simeq 70 / r&lt;/math&gt;.

{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations. In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg SVG version], hover over a graph to highlight it and its complement.}}

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable ''x'' exhibits exponential growth according to &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, then the log (to any base) of ''x'' [[linear function|grows linearly]] over time, as can be seen by taking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the exponential growth equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log x(t) = \log x_0 + t \cdot \log (1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a [[Nonlinear regression#Linearization|log-linear model]]. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.

==Differential equation==
The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\, \frac{dx}{dt} = kx&lt;/math&gt;

saying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]
:&lt;math&gt;x(0).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = kx \\[5pt]
\frac{dx} x &amp; = k\, dt \\[5pt]
\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{dx}{x} &amp; = k \int_0^t  \, dt \\[5pt]
\ln \frac{x(t)}{x(0)} &amp; =  kt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].

For a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].

==Difference equation==
The [[difference equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = a \cdot x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0 \cdot a^t,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, i.e., for all α:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} {t^\alpha \over ae^t} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See [[Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values]].

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and &lt;math&gt;A(n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored [[negative feedback]] factors become significant (leading to a [[logistic growth]] model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential stories==

===Rice on a chessboard===
{{see also|Wheat and chessboard problem}}
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made [[chessboard]]. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; grains on the ''n''th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ({{aka}} [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Jonathan|title=Capitalism: as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=1-84407-192-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[second half of the chessboard]] is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and, if left unchecked, it will smother the pond in thirty days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant's growth is small and so it is decided that it shall be cut down when the water lilies cover half of the pond. The children are then asked on what day will half of the pond be covered in water lilies.  The solution is simple when one considers that the water lilies must double to completely cover the pond on the thirtieth day.  Therefore, the water lilies will cover half of the pond on the twenty-ninth day. There is only one day to save the pond. (From Meadows ''et al''. 1972)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005/&gt;

In the fields of [[dynamical system]]s and [[control theory]], a '''fractional-order system''' is a dynamical system that can be modeled by a [[fractional differential equation]] containing [[fractional derivative|derivatives of non-integer order]].&lt;ref name=Monje2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Monje|first=Concepción A.|title=Fractional-Order Systems and Controls: Fundamentals and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781849963350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are said to have ''fractional dynamics''. [[Differintegral|Derivatives and integrals of fractional orders]] are used to describe objects that can be characterized by [[Power law|power-law]] nonlocality&lt;ref name="Cattani2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cattani|first1=Carlo|last2=Srivastava|first2=Hari M.|last3=Yang|first3=Xiao-Jun|title=Fractional Dynamics|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110472097|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iNhaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=power+law+nonlocality#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20law%20nonlocality&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Power law|power-law]] [[long-range dependence]] or [[fractal]] properties. Fractional-order systems are useful in studying the anomalous behavior of dynamical systems in physics, [[electrochemistry]], biology, [[viscoelasticity]] and [[chaotic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Monje2010 /&gt;

== Definition ==

A general dynamical system of fractional order can be written in the form&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002&gt;{{cite web|author1=Blas M. Vinagre |author2=C. A. Monje |author3=Antonio J. Calderon |title=Fractional Order Systems and Fractional Order Control Actions|url=http://mechatronics.ece.usu.edu/foc/cdc02tw/cdrom/Lectures/Lecture3/l3.pdf|publisher=41st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H(D^{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m})(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_l) = G(D^{\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n})(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the [[fractional derivative]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time. A common special case of this is the [[linear time-invariant]] (LTI) system in one variable:

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\sum_{k=0}^m a_k D^{\alpha_k}\right) y(t) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^n b_k D^{\beta_k}\right) u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; are in general complex quantities, but two interesting cases are when the orders are ''commensurate''

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta \in R^+&lt;/math&gt;

and when they are also ''rational'':

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta = \frac{1}{q}, q \in Z^+&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;, the derivatives are of integer order and the system becomes an [[ordinary differential equation]]. Thus by increasing specialization, LTI systems can be of general order, commensurate order, rational order or integer order.

=== Transfer function ===

By applying a [[Laplace transform]] to the LTI system above, the [[transfer function]] becomes

: &lt;math&gt; G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^n b_k s^{\beta_k}}{\sum_{k=0}^m a_k s^{\alpha_k}}&lt;/math&gt;

For general orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; this is a non-rational transfer function. Non-rational transfer functions cannot be written as an expansion in a finite number of terms (e.g., a [[binomial expansion]] would have an infinite number of terms) and in this sense fractional orders systems can be said to have the potential for unlimited memory.&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002 /&gt;

==Motivation to study fractional-order systems==

Exponential laws are classical approach to study dynamics of population densities, but there are many systems where dynamics undergo faster or slower-than-exponential laws. In such case the anomalous changes in dynamics may be best described by [[Mittag-Leffler function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Fractional dynamics of populations

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anomalous diffusion]] is one more dynamic system where fractional-order systems play significant role to describe the anomalous flow in the diffusion process.

[[Viscoelasticity]]  is the property of material in which the material exhibits its nature between purely elastic and pure fluid. In case of real materials the relationship between stress and strain given by [[Hooke's law]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]] both have obvious disadvances. So [[G. W. Scott Blair]] introduced a new relationship between stress and strain given by

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma (t)=E{D_t^\alpha} \varepsilon(t), \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In [[chaos theory]], it has been observed that chaos occurs in [[dynamical system]]s of order 3 or more. With the introduction of fractional-order systems, some researchers study chaos in the system of total order less than 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347112|chapter = Fractional - order chaotic systems|title = 2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies &amp; Factory Automation|pages = 1–8|year = 2009|last1 = Petras|first1 = Ivo|last2 = Bednarova|first2 = Dagmar|isbn = 978-1-4244-2727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of fractional differential equations==
Consider a fractional-order [[initial value problem]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {_0^C D_t^\alpha} x(t)=f(t,x(t)) , \quad t\in [0,T], \quad  x(0)=x_0, \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;

===Existence and uniqueness===
Here, under the continuity condition on function f, one can convert the above equation into corresponding integral equation.

:&lt;math&gt; x(t)=x_0 + {_0^C D_t^{-\alpha}}f(t,x(t)) = x_0 + \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{f(s,x(s))\,ds}{(t-s)^{1-\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

One can construct a solution space and define, by that equation, a continuous self-map on the solution space, then apply a [[fixed-point theorem]], to get a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]], which is the solution of above equation.

===Numerical simulation===
For numerical simulation of solution of the above equations, Kai Diethelm has suggested fractional linear multistep [[Linear_multistep_method#Families_of_multistep_methods|Adams–Bashforth method]] or [[Numerical integration#Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions|quadrature methods]].&lt;ref name="Diethelm2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diethelm|first1=Kai|title=A Survey of Numerical Methods in Fractional Calculus|url=http://www.lmssc.cnam.fr/sites/default/files/pdf/Colloque_Derivation_Fractionnaire_Cnam_2006_Diethelm.pdf|publisher=CNAM|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">A '''frugal number''' is a [[natural number]] that has more [[numerical digit|digits]] than the number of digits in its [[prime factorization]] (including exponents).&lt;ref name="Darling102"&gt;{{cite book |title=The universal book of mathematics: from Abracadabra to Zeno's paradoxes |last=Darling |first=David J. |year=2004 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-27047-8 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnpChqstvg0C&amp;pg=PA102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using base-10 arithmetic, the first few frugal numbers are 125 (5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 128 (2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;), 243 (3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), and 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;). Frugal numbers also exist in other bases; for instance, in [[binary arithmetic]] thirty-two is a frugal number, since 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100000.

The base-10 frugal numbers up to 2000 are:
:125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250, 1280, 1331, 1369, 1458, 1536, 1681, 1701, 1715, 1792, 1849, 1875 {{OEIS|id=A046759}}

The term '''economical number''' has been used about a frugal number, but also about a number which is either frugal or [[Equidigital number|equidigital]].

&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[GNU]] portable [[C (programming language)|C]] [[Library (computing)|library]] for [[bignum|arbitrary-precision]] binary [[floating-point]] computation with [[rounding#The table-maker's dilemma|correct rounding]], based on [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]]. The computation is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics: the functions are completely specified on all the possible operands and the results do not depend on the platform. This is done by copying the ideas from the [[IEEE floating-point standard|ANSI/IEEE-754]] standard for fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic (correct rounding and exceptions, in particular). More precisely, its main features are:
* Support for special numbers: signed zeros ([[−0]]), infinities and [[NaN|not-a-number]] (a single NaN is currently supported).
* Each number has its own [[Precision (arithmetic)|precision]] (in bits since MPFR uses [[radix]] 2). The floating-point results are correctly rounded to the precision of the target variable, in any of the four [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE-754]] rounding modes.
* Supported functions: MPFR implements all mathematical functions from [[C99]] and other usual mathematical functions: the [[logarithm]] and [[Exponential function|exponential]] in natural base, base 2 and base 10, the log(1+x) and exp(x)−1 functions (&lt;code&gt;log1p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;expm1&lt;/code&gt;), the six [[Trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] functions and their inverses, the [[Gamma function|gamma]], [[Riemann zeta function|zeta]] and [[error function]]s, the [[arithmetic geometric mean]], the [[Exponentiation|power]] (x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;) function. All those functions are correctly rounded over their complete range.
* [[Denormal number|Subnormals]] are not supported, but can be emulated with the &lt;code&gt;mpfr_subnormalize&lt;/code&gt; function.

MPFR is not able to track the [[accuracy]] of numbers in a whole program or expression; this is not its goal. [[Interval arithmetic]] packages like [http://arblib.org/ Arb], [http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/ MPFI], or [[Real RAM]] implementations like [http://irram.uni-trier.de/ iRRAM], which may be based on MPFR, can do that for the user.

MPFR is needed to build the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5364">[[File:Graph toughness.svg|thumb|240px|In this graph, removing the four red vertices would produce four connected components (depicted in four different colours). However, there is no set of ''k'' vertices whose removal leaves more than ''k'' components. Therefore, its toughness is exactly&amp;nbsp;1.]]
In [[graph theory]], '''toughness''' is a measure of the [[Connectivity_(graph_theory)|connectivity]] of a graph.  A graph {{math|''G''}} is said to be {{math|''t''}}-tough for a given [[real number]] {{mvar|t}} if, for every [[integer]] {{math|''k'' &gt; 1}}, {{math|''G''}} cannot be split into {{math|''k''}} different [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] by the removal of fewer than {{math|''tk''}} vertices. For instance, a graph is {{math|1}}-tough if the number of components formed by removing a set of vertices is always at most as large as the number of removed vertices. The toughness of a graph is the maximum {{math|''t''}} for which it is {{math|''t''}}-tough; this is a finite number for all finite graphs except the [[complete graph]]s, which by convention have infinite toughness.

Graph toughness was first introduced by {{harvs|first=Václav|last=Chvátal|authorlink=Václav Chvátal|year=1973|txt}}. Since then there has been extensive work by other mathematicians on toughness; the recent survey by {{harvtxt|Bauer|Broersma|Schmeichel|2006}} lists 99 theorems and 162 papers on the subject.

==Examples==
Removing {{mvar|k}} vertices from a [[path graph]] can split the remaining graph into as many as {{math|''k'' + 1}} connected components. The maximum ratio of components to removed vertices is achieved by removing one vertex (from the interior of the path) and splitting it into two components. Therefore, paths are {{sfrac|1|2}}-tough. In contrast, removing {{mvar|k}} vertices from a [[cycle graph]] leaves at most {{mvar|k}} remaining connected components, and sometimes leaves exactly {{mvar|k}} connected components, so a cycle is {{math|1}}-tough.

==Connection to vertex connectivity==
If a graph is {{mvar|t}}-tough, then one consequence (obtained by setting {{math|1=''k'' = 2}}) is that any set of {{math|2''t'' &amp;minus; 1}} nodes can be removed without splitting the graph in two. That is, every {{mvar|t}}-tough graph is also [[k-vertex-connected graph|{{math|2''t''}}-vertex-connected]].

==Connection to Hamiltonicity==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Is there a number &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that every &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-tough graph is Hamiltonian?}}
{{harvtxt|Chvátal|1973}} observed that every [[cycle graph|cycle]], and therefore every [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian graph]], is {{math|1}}-tough; that is, being {{math|1}}-tough is a [[necessary condition]] for a graph to be Hamiltonian. He conjectured that the connection between toughness and Hamiltonicity goes in both directions: that there exists a threshold {{mvar|t}} such that every {{mvar|t}}-tough graph is Hamiltonian. Chvátal's original conjecture that {{math|1=''t'' = 2}} would have proven [[Fleischner's theorem]] but was disproved by {{harvtxt|Bauer|Broersma|Veldman|2000}}. The existence of a larger toughness threshold for Hamiltonicity remains open, and is sometimes called '''Chvátal's toughness conjecture'''.

==Computational complexity==
Testing whether a graph is {{math|1}}-tough is [[co-NP]]-complete. That is, the [[decision problem]] whose answer is "yes" for a graph that is not 1-tough, and "no" for a graph that is 1-tough, is [[NP-complete]]. The same is true for any fixed positive [[rational number]] {{mvar|q}}: testing whether a graph is {{mvar|q}}-tough is co-NP-complete {{harv|Bauer|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1990}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hall–Littlewood polynomials''' are [[symmetric function]]s depending on a parameter ''t'' and a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &amp;lambda;.  They are [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]] when ''t'' is 0 and monomial symmetric functions when ''t'' is 1 and are special cases of [[Macdonald polynomial]]s.
They were first defined indirectly by  [[Philip Hall]] using the [[Hall algebra]], and later defined directly by {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1961}}.

==Definition==
The Hall–Littlewood polynomial ''P'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n;t) = \left( \prod_{i\geq 0} \prod_{j=1}^{m(i)} \frac{1-t}{1-t^{j}} \right)
{\sum_{w\in S_n}w\left(x_1^{\lambda_1}\cdots x_n^{\lambda_n}\prod_{i&lt;j}\frac{x_i-tx_j}{x_i-x_j}\right)},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;lambda; is a partition of at most ''n'' with elements &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''m''(''i'') elements equal to ''i'',  and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[symmetric group]] of order ''n''!.


As an example,
:&lt;math&gt; P_{42}(x_1,x_2;t) = x_1^4 x_2^2 + x_1^2 x_2^4 + (1-t) x_1^3 x_2^3 &lt;/math&gt;

===Specializations===

We have that &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(x;1) = m_\lambda(x)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(x;0) = s_\lambda(x)&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(x;-1) = P_\lambda(x)&lt;/math&gt; where the latter is the Schur ''P'' polynomials.

==Properties==

Expanding the [[Schur polynomials]] in terms of the Hall–Littlewood polynomials, one has
:&lt;math&gt; s_\lambda(x) = \sum_\mu K_{\lambda\mu}(t) P_\mu(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K_{\lambda\mu}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Kostka polynomial|Kostka–Foulkes polynomials]].
Note that as &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;, these reduce to the ordinary Kostka coefficients.

A combinatorial description for the Kostka–Foulkes polynomials was given by Lascoux and Schützenberger,
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\lambda\mu}(t) = \sum_{T \in SSYT(\lambda,\mu)} t^{\mathrm{charge}(T)}&lt;/math&gt;
where "charge" is a certain combinatorial statistic on semistandard Young tableaux,
and the sum is taken over all semi-standard Young tableaux with shape ''λ'' and type&amp;nbsp;''μ''.

'''Hermann Günther Grassmann''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Graßmann}}; April 15, 1809 – September 26, 1877) was a German [[polymath]], known in his day as a [[linguistics|linguist]] and now also as a [[mathematics|mathematician]]. He was also a [[physics|physicist]],  [[Humanism|neohumanist]], general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties.

==Biography==
Grassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus Günter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the [[Stettin]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], where Hermann was educated.

Grassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to [[Prussia]]n universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the [[University of Berlin]], also taking classes in [[classics|classical languages]], philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or [[physics]].

Although lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper referred to  as '''A1''' (see [[Hermann Grassmann#Citations and references|references]]).

In 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[mineralogy]] at all secondary school levels.

In 1847, he was made an "Oberlehrer" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained "... commendably good material expressed in a deficient form." Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics.

Starting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848–49, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, ''[[Deutsche Wochenschrift für Staat, Kirche und Volksleben]]'', calling for [[German unification]] under a [[constitutional monarchy]]. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on [[constitutional law]], Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction.

Grassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Giessen]].

==Mathematician==
One of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from [[Laplace]]'s ''Mécanique céleste'' and from [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s ''Mécanique analytique'', but expositing this theory making use of the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the ''Collected Works'' of 1894–1911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called [[linear algebra]] and the notion of a [[vector space]]. He went on to develop those methods in his '''A1''' and '''A2''' (see [[Hermann Grassmann#Bibliography|bibliography]]).

In 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece, his ''Die Lineale&lt;!--sic--&gt; Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics], hereinafter denoted '''A1''' and commonly referred to as the ''Ausdehnungslehre,''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. Expansion plan teachings&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "theory of extension" or "theory of extensive magnitudes." Since '''A1''' proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once [[geometry]] is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial [[dimension]]s; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded.

[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/DesmondFearnleySander.pdf Fearnley-Sander (1979)] describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:

{{cquote|The definition of a [[linear space]] ([[vector space]])... became widely known around 1920, when [[Hermann Weyl]] and others published formal definitions. In fact, such a definition had been given thirty years previously by [[Peano]], who was thoroughly acquainted with Grassmann's mathematical work. Grassmann did not put down a formal definition --- the language was not available --- but there is no doubt that he had the concept.

Beginning with a collection of 'units' ''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...'', he effectively defines the free linear space which they generate; that is to say, he considers formal linear combinations ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ...'' where the ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are real numbers, defines addition and multiplication by real numbers [in what is now the usual way] and formally proves the linear space properties for these operations. ... He then develops the theory of [[linear independence]] in a way which is astonishingly similar to the presentation one finds in modern linear algebra texts. He defines the notions of [[linear subspace|subspace]], [[linear independence]], [[Linear span|span]], [[dimension]], [[join and meet]] of subspaces, and [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]]s of elements onto subspaces.

...few have come closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single-handedly, a new subject.}}

Following an idea of Grassmann's father, '''A1''' also defined the [[exterior product]], also called "combinatorial product" (in German: ''äußeres Produkt''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. outer product&lt;/ref&gt; or ''kombinatorisches Produkt''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. combinatorial product&lt;/ref&gt;), the key operation of an algebra now called [[exterior algebra]]. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only [[axiom]]atic theory was [[Euclidean geometry]], and the general notion of an [[Algebra over a field|abstract algebra]] had yet to be defined.) In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] joined this exterior algebra to [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[quaternions]] by replacing Grassmann's rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 by the rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. (For [[quaternions]], we have the rule ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''j''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1.) For more details, see [[exterior algebra]].

'''A1''' was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked [[Ernst Kummer]] for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 ''Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. New theory of electrodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.

In 1846, [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed ''analysis situs''). Grassmann's ''Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik'',&lt;ref&gt;''Tr.'' Geometric analysis linked to the geometric characteristics invented by Leibniz&lt;/ref&gt; was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.

In 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's law]]. Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of [[Helmholtz]]. Grassmann also wrote on [[crystallography]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[mechanics]].

Grassmann (1861) set out the first axiomatic presentation of arithmetic, making free use of the principle of induction. [[Peano]] and his followers cited this work freely starting around 1890. Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works in 1995 ({{ISBN|0-8126-9275-6}}. -- {{ISBN|0-8126-9276-4}}).

In 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of '''A1''', hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his [[linear algebra]]. The result, ''Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet'' [The Theory of Extension, Thoroughly and Rigorously Treated], hereinafter denoted '''A2''', fared no better than '''A1''', even though '''A2''''s manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century.

==Response==
In 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}} In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}}

One of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was [[Hermann Hankel]], whose 1867 ''Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme''
:... developed some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s. Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings ...&lt;ref&gt;Hankel entry in the ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. New York: 1970–1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 [[Victor Schlegel]] published the first part of his ''System der Raumlehre'' which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. [[Felix Klein]] wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his ''System'' according to Grassmann, this time developing higher geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his [[Erlangen Program]] which also expanded the scope of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of [[vector space]]s which then could express the [[multilinear algebra]] of his extension theory.  To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynde Wheeler]] (1951), ''Josiah Willard Gibbs:  The History of a Great Mind'', 1998 reprint, Woodbridge, CT:  Ox Bow, pp. 113-116.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s first monograph, the ''Universal Algebra'' (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the [[exterior algebra]]. With the rise of [[differential geometry]] the exterior algebra was applied to [[differential form]]s.

For an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary [[mathematical physics]] see ''[[The Road to Reality]]''&lt;ref&gt;Penrose ''The Road to Reality'', chapters 11 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Roger Penrose]].

[[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]] developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.

==Linguist==
Grassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. 30 years after the publication of '''A1''' the publisher wrote to Grassmann: “Your book ''Die Ausdehnungslehre'' has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library”.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=45}} Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical [[linguistics]] and the study of [[Sanskrit]]. He wrote books on [[German grammar]], collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the [[Rigveda]] (more than 1,000 pages) which earned him a membership of the [[American Orientalists' Society]]. In modern
Rigvedic studies Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 the third edition of his dictionary to Rigveda was issued.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}}

Grassmann also discovered a sound law of [[Indo-European languages]], which was named ''[[Grassmann's law|Grassmann's Law]]'' in his honor.

These philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime; he was elected to the [[American Oriental Society]] and in 1876, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Tübingen]].

{{Calculus|Integral}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''integral''' assigns numbers to functions in a way that can describe displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining [[infinitesimal]] data. Integration is one of the two main operations of [[calculus]], with its inverse operation, [[derivative|differentiation]], being the other. Given a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} of a [[Real number|real]] [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] {{mvar|x}} and an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the [[real line]], the '''definite integral'''

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

is defined informally as the signed [[area (geometry)|area]] of the region in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane that is bounded by the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}}, the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vertical lines {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}. The area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis adds to the total and that below the {{mvar|x}}-axis subtracts from the total.

The operation of integration, up to an additive constant, is the inverse of the operation of differentiation. For this reason, the term ''integral'' may also refer to the related notion of the [[antiderivative]], a function {{mvar|F}} whose derivative is the given function {{mvar|f}}. In this case, it is called an indefinite integral and is written:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals discussed in this article are those termed ''definite integrals''. It is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if {{mvar|f}} is a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then, once an antiderivative {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|f}} is known, the definite integral of {{mvar|f}} over that interval is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \, f(x) dx = \left[ F(x) \right]_{a}^{b} = F(b) - F(a) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The principles of integration were formulated independently by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of [[infinitesimal]] width. [[Bernhard Riemann]] gave a rigorous mathematical definition of integrals. It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]] region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the [[Domain of a function|domain]] over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A [[line integral]] is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is replaced by a [[curve]] connecting the two endpoints. In a [[surface integral]], the curve is replaced by a piece of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] in [[three-dimensional space]].

==History==
{{See also|History of calculus}}

===Pre-calculus integration===
The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the [[method of exhaustion]] of the [[ancient Greek]] astronomer [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (''ca.'' 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for [[parabola]]s and an approximation to the [[area of a circle]].

A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by [[Liu Hui]], who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians [[Zu Chongzhi]] and [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng]] to find the volume of a sphere ({{harvnb|Shea | 2007}}; {{harvnb|Katz|2004|pp=125–126}}).

The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] with his [[method of Indivisibles]], and work by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} up to degree {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} in [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by [[Isaac Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and [[Differential calculus|differentiation]]. Barrow provided the first proof of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. [[John Wallis|Wallis]] generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of {{mvar|x}} to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.

===Newton and Leibniz===
The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern [[calculus]], whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.
&lt;!--- Please, do not remove: helpful for verification
The last sentence originally said 'work of Newton and Leibniz', but for integrals, only Leibniz's notation is used. ---&gt;

===Formalization===
While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of [[Rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigour]]. [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them "[[The Analyst#Content|ghosts of departed quantities]]". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of [[Fourier analysis]]—to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] formulated a [[#Lebesgue integral|different definition of integral]], founded in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] (a subfield of [[real analysis]]). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the [[standard part]] of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the [[hyperreal number]] system.

===Historical notation===
[[Isaac Newton]] used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with {{math|{{overset|'''.'''|''x''}}}} or {{math|''x''′}}, which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.

The modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 ({{Harvnb|Burton|1988|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;359}}; {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1899|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;154}}). He adapted the [[integral symbol]], '''∫''', from the letter ''ſ'' ([[long s]]), standing for ''summa'' (written as ''ſumma''; Latin for "sum" or "total"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by [[Joseph Fourier]] in ''Mémoires'' of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 ({{Harvnb|Cajori|1929|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;249–250}}; {{Harvnb|Fourier|1822|loc=§231}}).

==Applications==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}

Integrals are used extensively in many areas of mathematics as well as in many other areas that rely on mathematics.

For example, in [[probability theory]], integrals are used to determine the probability of some [[random variable]] falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire [[probability density function]] must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with no negative values could be a density function or not.

Integrals can be used for computing the [[area]] of a two-dimensional region that has a curved boundary, as well as [[Volume integral|computing the volume]] of a three-dimensional object that has a curved boundary.

Integrals are also used in physics, in areas like [[kinematics]] to find quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[time]], and [[velocity]]. For example, in rectilinear motion, the displacement of an object over the time interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is given by: 

:&lt;math&gt;x(b)-x(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity expressed as a function of time. The work done by a force &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; (given as a function of position) from an initial position &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to a final position &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;W_{A\rightarrow B} = \int_A^B F(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Integrals are also used in [[thermodynamics]], where [[thermodynamic integration]] is used to calculate the difference in free energy between two given states.

==Terminology and notation==

===Standard===
The integral with respect to {{mvar|x}} of a [[real-valued function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} of a real variable {{mvar|x}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

The integral sign {{math|∫}} represents integration. The symbol {{mvar|dx}}, called the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] of the variable {{mvar|x}}, indicates that the variable of integration is {{mvar|x}}. The function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} to be integrated is called the integrand. The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b|}} are called the limits of the integral. An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral. The integral is said to be over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.

If the integral goes from a finite value ''a'' to the upper limit infinity, the integral expresses the limit of the integral from ''a'' to a value ''b'' as ''b'' goes to infinity. If the value of the integral gets closer and closer to a finite value, the integral is said to [[convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to that value. If not, the integral is said to diverge.

When the limits are omitted, as in
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) \,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the [[antiderivative]]) whose derivative is the integrand. The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Occasionally, limits of integration are omitted for definite integrals when the same limits occur repeatedly in a particular context. Usually, the author will make this convention clear at the beginning of the relevant text.

There are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article).

=== Meaning of the symbol ''dx'' ===
Historically, the symbol ''dx'' was taken to represent an infinitesimally "small piece" of the independent variable ''x'' to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable from the standpoint of the real number system.&lt;ref&gt;In the 20th century, [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]] was developed as a new approach to calculus that incorporates a rigorous concept of infinitesimals by using an expanded number system called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreal numbers]]. Though placed on a sound axiomatic footing and of interest in its own right as a new area of investigation, nonstandard analysis remains somewhat controversial from a pedagogical standpoint, with proponents pointing out the intuitive nature of infinitesimals for beginning students of calculus and opponents criticizing the logical complexity of the system as a whole.&lt;/ref&gt; In introductory calculus, the expression ''dx'' is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its delimiter on the right side of the expression being integrated. 

In more sophisticated contexts, ''dx'' can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics being discussed. When used in one of these ways, the original Leibnitz notation is co-opted to apply to a generalization of the original definition of the integral. Some common interpretations of ''dx'' include: an integrator function in [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral|Riemann-Stieltjes integration]] (indicated by ''dα''(''x'') in general), a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] in Lebesgue theory (indicated by ''dμ'' in general), or a [[differential form]] in exterior calculus (indicated by &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; in general). In the last case, even the letter ''d'' has an independent meaning — as the [[exterior derivative]] operator on differential forms.

Conversely, in advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out ''dx'' when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_a^b (c_1f+c_2g) = c_1\int_a^b f + c_2\int_a^b g &lt;/math&gt; to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof.

===Variants===
In [[modern Arabic mathematical notation]], a reflected integral symbol [[File:ArabicIntegralSign.svg|16px]] is used instead of the symbol {{math|∫}}, since the Arabic script and mathematical expressions go right to left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|W3C|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, particularly of European origin, use an upright "d" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e., {{math|d''x''}} instead of {{math|''dx''}}), since properly speaking, "d" is not a variable. 

The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is not always placed after {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as for instance in
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_0^1 \frac{3\ dx}{x^2+1}\quad&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\quad\int_{0}^{1} dx \int_{0}^{1} dy\ e^{-(x^2+y^2)} &lt;/math&gt;.
In the first expression, the differential is treated as an infinitesimal "multiplicative" factor, formally following a "commutative property" when "multiplied" by the expression 3/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1). In the second expression, showing the differentials first highlights and clarifies the variables that are being integrated with respect to, a practice particularly popular with physicists.

==Interpretations of the integral==
Integrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but [[precision engineering]] (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.

[[File:Integral approximations.svg|thumb|right|Approximations to integral of {{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} from 0 to 1, with 5 &lt;span style="color:#fec200"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; (yellow) right endpoint partitions and 12 &lt;span style="color:#009246"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; (green) left endpoint partitions|alt=Integral approximation example]]
To start off, consider the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} between {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} with {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} (see figure). We ask:
:What is the area under the function {{mvar|f}}, in the interval from 0 to 1?
and call this (yet unknown) area the (definite) '''integral''' of {{mvar|f}}. The notation for this integral will be
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \sqrt{x}\ dx.&lt;/math&gt;

As a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} to {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(0) {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(1) {{=}} 1}}. Its area is exactly 1. Actually, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles gives a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus {{math|{{sqrt|1/5}}}}, {{math|{{sqrt|2/5}}}}, and so on to {{math|{{sqrt|1}} {{=}} 1}}. Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sqrt{\frac{1}{5}}\left(\frac{1}{5}-0\right)+\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\left(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{1}{5}\right)+\cdots+\sqrt{\frac{5}{5}}\left(\frac{5}{5}-\frac{4}{5}\right)\approx 0.7497.&lt;/math&gt;

We are taking a sum of finitely many function values of {{mvar|f}}, multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will always be too high and will never be exact. Alternatively, replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximation that is too low: for example, with twelve such subintervals we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203. 

The key idea is the transition from adding ''finitely many'' differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or ''[[infinitesimal]]'' steps. When this transition is completed in the above example, it turns out that the area under the curve within the stated bounds is 2/3.

The notation
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
conceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated {{mvar|s}}, of function values, {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called ''differentials'', denoted by {{mvar|dx}}.

&lt;!-- Note: Today's limits of integration were not part of the notation until much later, due to Fourier. --&gt;Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of weighted sums, so that the {{mvar|dx}} suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann's dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]], which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of "measure" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation
:&lt;math&gt;\int_A f(x)\ d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
refers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with {{mvar|μ}} measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here {{mvar|A}} denotes the region of integration.

There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.

===Riemann integral===
{{Main|Riemann integral}}

The Riemann integral is defined in terms of [[Riemann sum]]s of functions with respect to ''tagged partitions'' of an interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Riemann Sum |id=RiemannSum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] of the real line; then a ''tagged partition'' of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a finite sequence

:&lt;math&gt; a = x_0 \le t_1 \le x_1 \le t_2 \le x_2 \le \cdots \le x_{n-1} \le t_n \le x_n = b . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This partitions the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into {{mvar|n}} sub-intervals {{math|[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} indexed by {{mvar|i}}, each of which is "tagged" with a distinguished point {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}. A ''Riemann sum'' of a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i) \Delta_i ; &lt;/math&gt;
thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;−''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the width of sub-interval {{mvar|i}}; then the ''mesh'' of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, {{math|max&lt;sub&gt;''i''{{=}}1...''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The ''Riemann integral'' of a function {{mvar|f}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is equal to {{mvar|S}} if:
:For all {{math|''ε'' &amp;gt; 0}} there exists {{math|''δ'' &amp;gt; 0}} such that, for any tagged partition {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} with mesh less than {{mvar|δ}}, we have
::&lt;math&gt;\left| S - \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)\Delta_i \right| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) [[Darboux integral|Darboux sum]], suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the [[Darboux integral]].

===Lebesgue integral===
{{Main|Lebesgue integration}}
[[Image:RandLintegrals.svg|thumb|250px|Riemann–Darboux's integration (top) and Lebesgue integration (bottom)|alt=Comparison of Riemann and Lebesgue integrals]]

It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated {{Harv|Rudin|1987}}.

Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus [[Henri Lebesgue]] introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to [[Paul Montel]]:
{{quote|I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.|{{harvtxt|Siegmund-Schultze|2008}}}}

As {{Harvtxt|Folland|1984|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;56}} puts it, "To compute the Riemann integral of {{mvar|f}}, one partitions the domain {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into subintervals", while in the Lebesgue integral, "one is in effect partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} ". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], μ. In the simplest case, the [[Lebesgue measure]] {{math|''μ''(''A'')}} of an interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b'']}} is its width, {{math|''b'' − ''a''}}, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.

Using the "partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} " philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function {{math|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} should be the sum over {{mvar|t}} of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between {{math|1=''y'' = ''t''}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''t'' + ''dt''}}. This area is just {{math|''μ''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''t''} ''dt''}}. Let {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''t'') = ''μ''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''t''}}}. The Lebesgue integral of {{mvar|f}} is then defined by {{harv|Lieb|Loss|2001}}
:&lt;math&gt;\int f = \int_0^\infty f^*(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral ({{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a [[well-defined]] improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the [[measurable function]]s) this defines the Lebesgue integral.

A general measurable function {{mvar|f}} is Lebesgue-integrable if the sum of the absolute values of the areas of the regions between the graph of {{mvar|f}} and the {{mvar|x}}-axis is finite:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_E |f|\,d\mu &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the area below the {{mvar|x}}-axis:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_E f \,d\mu = \int_E f^+ \,d\mu - \int_E f^- \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{3}
 &amp; f^+(x) &amp;&amp;{}={} \max \{f(x),0\} &amp;&amp;{}={} \begin{cases}
               f(x), &amp; \text{if } f(x) &gt; 0, \\
               0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
             \end{cases}\\
 &amp; f^-(x) &amp;&amp;{}={} \max \{-f(x),0\} &amp;&amp;{}={} \begin{cases}
               -f(x), &amp; \text{if } f(x) &lt; 0, \\
               0, &amp; \text{otherwise.}
             \end{cases}
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

===Other integrals===
Although the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including:
* The [[Darboux integral]], which is constructed using Darboux sums and is equivalent to a [[Riemann integral]], meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being simpler to define than Riemann integrals.
* The [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]], an extension of the Riemann integral.
* The [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]], further developed by [[Johann Radon]], which generalizes the [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral|Riemann–Stieltjes]] and [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrals]].
* The [[Daniell integral]], which subsumes the Lebesgue integral and [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] without the dependence on [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s.
* The [[Haar integral]], used for integration on locally compact topological groups, introduced by [[Alfréd Haar]] in 1933.
* The [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]], variously defined by [[Arnaud Denjoy]], [[Oskar Perron]], and (most elegantly, as the gauge integral) [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]], and developed by [[Ralph Henstock]].
* The [[Itô integral]] and [[Stratonovich integral]], which define integration with respect to [[semimartingale]]s such as [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]].
&lt;!--* The [[Darboux integral]], equivalent to the Riemann integral.--&gt;
&lt;!--* The [[Haar integral]], which is the Lebesgue integral with [[Haar measure]].--&gt;
* The [[Young integral]], which is a kind of Riemann–Stieltjes integral with respect to certain functions of [[Bounded variation|unbounded variation]].
* The [[rough path]] integral, which is defined for functions equipped with some additional "rough path" structure and generalizes stochastic integration against both [[semimartingale]]s and processes such as the [[fractional Brownian motion]].

==Properties==

===Linearity===
The collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} forms a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration
:&lt;math&gt; f \mapsto \int_a^b f(x) \; dx&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--- redundant
for an integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}
---&gt;
is a [[linear functional]] on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking [[linear combination]]s; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals,

&lt;!--- leftover from the past text; redundant
For example, in Riemann integration, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are [[real number|real-valued]] integrable functions on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} are real numbers, then the function {{math|''αf'' + ''βg''}} defined by {{math|(''αf'' + ''βg'')(''x'') {{=}} ''αf''(''x'') + ''βg''(''x'')}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is integrable, with
---&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b (\alpha f + \beta g)(x) \, dx = \alpha \int_a^b f(x) \,dx + \beta \int_a^b g(x) \, dx. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the set of [[real number|real]]-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given [[Measure (mathematics)|measure space]] {{mvar|E}} with measure {{mvar|μ}} is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral

: &lt;math&gt; f\mapsto \int_E f \, d\mu &lt;/math&gt;

is a linear functional on this vector space, so that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_E (\alpha f + \beta g) \, d\mu = \alpha \int_E f \, d\mu + \beta \int_E g \, d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, consider the vector space of all [[measurable function]]s on a measure space {{math|(''E'',''μ'')}}, taking values in a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[complete metric space|complete]] [[topological vector space]] {{mvar|V}} over a locally compact [[Topological ring|topological field]] {{math|''K'', ''f'' : ''E'' → ''V''}}. Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function {{mvar|f}} an element of {{mvar|V}} or the symbol {{math|''∞''}},
:&lt;math&gt; f\mapsto\int_E f \,d\mu, \,&lt;/math&gt;
that is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of {{mvar|V}} (i.e. "finite"). The most important special cases arise when {{mvar|K}} is {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, or a finite extension of the field {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of [[p-adic number]]s, and {{mvar|V}} is a finite-dimensional vector space over {{mvar|K}}, and when {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}} and {{mvar|V}} is a complex [[Hilbert space]].

Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of "simple" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of [[Daniell integral|Daniell]] for the case of real-valued functions on a set {{mvar|X}}, generalized by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See {{Harv|Hildebrandt|1953}} for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral.

===Inequalities===
A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).

* ''Upper and lower bounds.'' An integrable function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is necessarily [[bounded function|bounded]] on that interval. Thus there are [[real number]]s {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|M}} so that {{math|''m'' ≤ ''f'' (''x'') ≤ ''M''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Since the lower and upper sums of {{mvar|f}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} are therefore bounded by, respectively, {{math|''m''(''b'' − ''a'')}} and {{math|''M''(''b'' − ''a'')}}, it follows that
:: &lt;math&gt; m(b - a) \leq \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \leq M(b - a). &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Inequalities between functions.'' If {{math|''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then each of the upper and lower sums of {{mvar|f}} is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of {{mvar|g}}. Thus
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \leq \int_a^b g(x) \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;
:This is a generalization of the above inequalities, as {{math|''M''(''b'' − ''a'')}} is the integral of the constant function with value {{mvar|M}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.
:In addition, if the inequality between functions is strict, then the inequality between integrals is also strict. That is, if {{math|''f''(''x'') &lt; ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) \, dx &lt; \int_a^b g(x) \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Subintervals.'' If {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}} is a subinterval of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is non-negative for all {{mvar|x}}, then
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_c^d f(x) \, dx \leq \int_a^b f(x) \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Products and absolute values of functions.'' If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two functions, then we may consider their [[pointwise product]]s and powers, and [[absolute value]]s:
:: &lt;math&gt;
 (fg)(x)= f(x) g(x), \; f^2 (x) = (f(x))^2, \; |f| (x) = |f(x)|.\,&lt;/math&gt;
:If {{mvar|f}} is Riemann-integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then the same is true for {{math|{{abs|''f''}}}}, and
:: &lt;math&gt;\left| \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \right| \leq \int_a^b | f(x) | \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;
:Moreover, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are both Riemann-integrable then {{math|''fg''}} is also Riemann-integrable, and
:: &lt;math&gt;\left( \int_a^b (fg)(x) \, dx \right)^2 \leq \left( \int_a^b f(x)^2 \, dx \right) \left( \int_a^b g(x)^2 \, dx \right). &lt;/math&gt;
:This inequality, known as the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], plays a prominent role in [[Hilbert space]] theory, where the left hand side is interpreted as the [[Inner product space|inner product]] of two [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.

* ''Hölder's inequality''. Suppose that {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are two real numbers, {{math|1 ≤ ''p'', ''q'' ≤ ∞}} with {{math|{{sfrac|1|''p''}} + {{sfrac|1|''q''}} {{=}} 1}}, and  {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two Riemann-integrable functions. Then the functions  {{math|{{abs|''f''}}&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|{{abs|''g''}}&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are also integrable and the following [[Hölder's inequality]] holds:
::&lt;math&gt;\left|\int f(x)g(x)\,dx\right| \leq
\left(\int \left|f(x)\right|^p\,dx \right)^{1/p} \left(\int\left|g(x)\right|^q\,dx\right)^{1/q}.&lt;/math&gt;
:For {{mvar|p}} = {{mvar|q}} = 2, Hölder's inequality becomes the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

* ''Minkowski inequality''. Suppose that {{math|''p'' ≥ 1}} is a real number and {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are Riemann-integrable functions. Then {{math|{{abs| ''f'' }}&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, {{abs| ''g'' }}&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|{{abs| ''f'' + ''g'' }}&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are also Riemann-integrable and the following [[Minkowski inequality]] holds:
::&lt;math&gt;\left(\int \left|f(x)+g(x)\right|^p\,dx \right)^{1/p} \leq
\left(\int \left|f(x)\right|^p\,dx \right)^{1/p} +
\left(\int \left|g(x)\right|^p\,dx \right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;
: An analogue of this inequality for Lebesgue integral is used in construction of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]].

===Conventions===
In this section, {{mvar|f}} is a [[real number|real-]]valued Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The integral
:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;
over an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is defined if {{math|''a'' &amp;lt; ''b''}}. This means that the upper and lower sums of the function {{mvar|f}} are evaluated on a partition {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ . . . ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''b''}} whose values {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place "left to right", evaluating {{mvar|f}} within intervals {{math|[''x''&lt;sub&gt; ''i''&lt;/sub&gt; , ''x''&lt;sub&gt; ''i'' +1&lt;/sub&gt;]}} where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, the end-points of the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], are called the [[limits of integration]] of {{mvar|f}}. Integrals can also be defined if {{math|''a'' &amp;gt; ''b''}}:

* ''Reversing limits of integration.'' If {{math|''a'' &amp;gt; ''b''}} then define
:: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = - \int_b^a f(x) \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;
This, with {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}, implies:
* ''Integrals over intervals of length zero.'' If {{mvar|a}} is a [[real number]] then
:: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^a f(x) \, dx = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a [[Point (geometry)|point]], should be [[0 (number)|zero]]. One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of {{mvar|f}} on an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} implies that {{mvar|f}} is integrable on any subinterval {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}}, but in particular integrals have the property that:

* ''Additivity of integration on intervals.'' If {{mvar|c}} is any [[element (mathematics)|element]] of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \int_a^c f(x) \, dx + \int_c^b f(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;
With the first convention, the resulting relation
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int_a^c f(x) \, dx &amp;{}= \int_a^b f(x) \, dx - \int_c^b f(x) \, dx \\
 &amp;{} = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx + \int_b^c f(x) \, dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}.

==Fundamental theorem of calculus==
{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}

The ''fundamental theorem of calculus'' is the statement that [[derivative|differentiation]] and integration are inverse operations: if a [[continuous function]] is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the ''second fundamental theorem of calculus'', allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated.

===Statements of theorems===

====Fundamental theorem of calculus====

Let {{mvar|f}} be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Let {{mvar|F}} be the function defined, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, {{mvar|F}} is continuous on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, differentiable on the open interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, and

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}.

====Second fundamental theorem of calculus====

Let {{mvar|f}} be a real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] [{{math|''a'', ''b''}}] that admits an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. That is, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|F}} are functions such that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}},

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = F'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

===Calculating integrals===
The second fundamental theorem allows many integrals to be calculated explicitly. For example, to calculate the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1x^{1/2}\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
of the square root function {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} between 0 and 1, it is sufficient to find an antiderivative, that is, a function {{math|''F''(''x'')}} whose derivative equals  {{math|''f''(''x'')}}:
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
One such function is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|2|3}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Then the value of the integral in question is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1x^{1/2}\,dx = F(1) - F(0) = \frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} - \frac{2}{3} (0)^{3/2}=\frac{2}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a case of a general rule, that for {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with {{math|''q'' ≠ −1}}, the related function, the so-called antiderivative is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;/(''q'' + 1).}} Tables of this and similar antiderivatives can be used to calculate integrals explicitly, in much the same way that tables of derivatives can be used.

==Extensions==

===Improper integrals===
{{Main|Improper integral}}
[[File:Improper integral.svg|right|thumb|The [[improper integral]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; has unbounded intervals for both domain and range.]]
A "proper" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of proper [[Riemann integral]]s on progressively larger intervals.

If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a'', ''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, then again a limit may provide a finite result.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{a+\epsilon}^{b} f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the improper integral is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified [[real number]], or {{math|∞}}, or {{math|−∞}}. In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.

===Multiple integration===
{{Main|Multiple integral}}
[[File:Volume under surface.png|right|thumb|Double integral as volume under a surface]]
Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the [[area]] of the region between the graph of the function and the ''x''-axis, the ''double integral'' of a positive function of two variables represents the [[volume]] of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]. For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables, ''x'' and ''y'', and the integral of a function ''f'' over the rectangle ''R'' given as the [[Cartesian product]] of two intervals &lt;math&gt;R=[a,b]\times [c,d]&lt;/math&gt; can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\int_R f(x,y)\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

where the differential {{math|''dA''}} indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This [[double integral]] can be defined using [[Riemann sum]]s, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'',''y'')}} over the domain ''R''. Under suitable conditions (e.g., if ''f'' is continuous), then [[Fubini's theorem]] guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b\left[\int_c^d f(x,y)\,dy\right]\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over ''R'' uses a double integral sign:
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_R f(x,y) dA.&lt;/math&gt;

Integration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function ''f'', with respect to volume, over a subset ''D'' of  ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is denoted by notation such as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_D f(\mathbf x)d^n\mathbf x,\quad \int_D f\,dV&lt;/math&gt;

or similar. See [[volume integral]].

===Line integrals===
{{Main|Line integral}}
[[File:Line-Integral.gif|right|thumb|A line integral sums together elements along a curve.]]
The concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with [[vector field]]s.

A ''line integral'' (sometimes called a ''path integral'') is an integral where the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be integrated is evaluated along a [[curve]]. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a ''contour integral''.

The function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly [[arc length]] or, for a vector field, the [[Inner product space|scalar product]] of the vector field with a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that [[Mechanical work|work]] is equal to [[force]], {{math|'''F'''}}, multiplied by displacement, {{math|'''s'''}}, may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:
:&lt;math&gt;W=\mathbf F\cdot\mathbf s.&lt;/math&gt;
For an object moving along a path {{mvar|''C''}} in a [[vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}} such as an [[electric field]] or [[gravitational field]], the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from {{math|'''s'''}} to {{math|'''s''' + ''d'''''s'''}}. This gives the line integral
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_C \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf s.&lt;/math&gt;

===Surface integrals===
{{Main|Surface integral}}
[[File:Surface integral illustration.svg|right|thumb|The definition of surface integral relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements.]]
A ''surface integral'' is a definite integral taken over a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (which may be a curved set in [[space]]); it can be thought of as the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] analog of the [[line integral]]. The function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.

For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field {{math|'''v'''}} on a surface {{math|''S''}}; that is, for each point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''S''}}, {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}}, such that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} determines the velocity of the fluid at {{mvar|x}}. The [[flux]] is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}} in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the [[dot product]] of {{math|'''v'''}} with the unit [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] to {{math|''S''}} at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S {\mathbf v}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the [[classical theory]] of [[electromagnetism]].

===Contour integrals===

In [[complex analysis]], the integrand is a [[complex-valued function]] of a complex variable {{mvar|z}} instead of a real function of a real variable {{mvar|x}}. When a complex function is integrated along a curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z)\,dz&lt;/math&gt;.

This is known as a [[contour integral]].

===Integrals of differential forms===
{{Main|differential form}}
A [[differential form]] is a mathematical concept in the fields of [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential topology]], and [[tensor]]s. Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;E(x,y,z)\,dx + F(x,y,z)\,dy + G(x,y,z)\, dz&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'' measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.

A differential two-form is a sum of the form
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,y,z)dx\wedge dy + E(x,y,z)dy\wedge dz + F(x,y,z)dz\wedge dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the basic two-forms &lt;math&gt;dx\wedge dy, dz\wedge dx, dy\wedge dz&lt;/math&gt; measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[wedge product]], which is similar to the [[cross product]] in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of &lt;math&gt;E\mathbf i+F\mathbf j+G\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;.

Unlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The [[exterior derivative]] plays the role of the [[gradient]] and [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of vector calculus, and [[Stokes' theorem]] simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem]].

===Summations===
The discrete equivalent of integration is [[summation]]. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of [[Lebesgue integral]]s or [[time scale calculus]].

==Computation==

===Analytical===
The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be the function of {{mvar|x}} to be integrated over a given interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Then, find an antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}; that is, a function {{mvar|F}} such that {{math|''F''′ {{=}} ''f''}} on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals.

The most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}. It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include:
* [[Integration by substitution]]
* [[Integration by parts]]
* [[Inverse function integration]]
* [[Order of integration (calculus)|Changing the order of integration]]
* [[trigonometric substitution|Integration by trigonometric substitution]]
* [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]
* [[Partial fractions in integration|Integration by partial fractions]]
* [[Integration by reduction formulae]]
* [[Integration using parametric derivatives]]
* [[Integration using Euler's formula]]
* [[Euler substitution]]
* [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]
* [[Methods of contour integration|Contour integration]]
Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many [[nonelementary integral]]s can be expanded in a [[Taylor series]] and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using [[Meijer G-function]]s can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, [[Parseval's identity]] can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see [[Gaussian integral]].

Computations of volumes of [[solid of revolution|solids of revolution]] can usually be done with [[disk integration]] or [[shell integration]].

Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the [[Lists of integrals|list of integrals]].

===Symbolic===
{{Main|Symbolic integration}}

Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive [[Lists of integrals|tables of integrals]] have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to [[computer algebra system]]s that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like [[Macsyma]].

A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions {{math|exp(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|(sin ''x'')/''x''}} cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only [[rational function|rational]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] functions, [[logarithm]], [[trigonometric functions]] and [[inverse trigonometric functions]], and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in [[elementary function]]s, which are the functions which may be built from  rational functions, [[Root of a function|roots of a polynomial]], logarithm, and exponential functions. The [[Risch algorithm]] provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The [[Risch algorithm]], implemented in [[Mathematica]] and other [[computer algebra system]]s, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from  rational functions, [[Nth root|radicals]], logarithm, and exponential functions.

Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the [[special functions]] (like the [[Legendre function]]s, the [[hypergeometric function]], the [[gamma function]], the [[incomplete gamma function]] and so on&amp;nbsp;— see [[Symbolic integration]] for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.

More recently a new approach has emerged, using [[D-finite function|''D''-finite functions]], which are the solutions of [[linear differential equation]]s with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are ''D''-finite, and the integral of a ''D''-finite function is also a ''D''-finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a ''D''-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.

This theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a ''D''-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://algo.inria.fr/chyzak/mgfun.html Frédéric Chyzak's Mgfun Project: Introduction to the Package Mgfun and Related Packages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical===
{{Main|Numerical integration}}

Some integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called ''numerical integration'' or ''numerical quadrature'', arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ({{Harvnb|Dahlquist|Björck|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989}}; {{Harvnb|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002}}).

Consider, for example, the integral
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-2}^{2} \tfrac{1}{5} \left( \tfrac{1}{100}(322 + 3 x (98 + x (37 + x))) - 24 \frac{x}{1+x^2} \right) dx &lt;/math&gt;
which has the exact answer {{nowrap|94/25 {{=}} 3.76}}. (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task&amp;nbsp;— not explored here&amp;nbsp;— is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.

Using the left end of each piece, the [[rectangle method]] sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, {{mvar|h}}, here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.

A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The [[trapezoid rule]] is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. [[Simpson's rule]] approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called [[Newton–Cotes formulas]]. The degree {{math|''n''}} Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree {{math|''n''}} polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to [[Runge's phenomenon]]. One solution to this problem is [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]], in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of [[Chebyshev polynomials]]. This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.

[[Romberg's method]] builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by {{math|''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and so on, where {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is half of {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to [[Interpolation|interpolate]] a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to {{math|''T''(0)}}. With this method a numerically ''exact'' answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The [[Lagrange polynomial]] interpolating {{math|{''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;''k'' {{=}} 0...2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}}}} {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148{{math|''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.

[[Gaussian quadrature]] often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two {{mvar|x}} positions, {{math|±2 ⁄ {{sqrt|3}}}}, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. An {{mvar|n}}-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to {{math|2''n'' − 1}}. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)

In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula]]e. More broadly, [[adaptive quadrature]] partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most.

The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as [[Monte Carlo integration]].

A calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage. For example, the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} e^{-x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt; is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. However, the substitution {{math|1=''u'' = {{radic|''x''}}}} transforms the integral into &lt;math&gt;2\int_0^1 e^{-u^2}\,du&lt;/math&gt;, which has no singularities at all.

===Mechanical===
The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called [[planimeter]]. The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid [[displacement (fluid)|displaced]] as the object is submerged.

===Geometrical===
{{main|Quadrature (mathematics)}}
Area can sometimes be found via [[geometrical]] [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s of an equivalent [[square]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">In [[mathematics]], '''Kaplansky's theorem on quadratic forms''' is a result on simultaneous representation of [[Prime number|primes]] by [[quadratic forms]]. It was proved in 2003 by [[Irving Kaplansky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 131

==Statement of the theorem==
Kaplansky's theorem states that a prime ''p'' [[Modular arithmetic|congruent to 1 modulo 16]] is representable by both or none of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas a prime ''p'' congruent to 9 modulo 16 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms.

This is remarkable since the primes represented by each of these forms individually are ''not'' describable by congruence conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Kaplansky's proof uses the facts that 2 is a 4th power modulo ''p'' if and only if ''p'' is representable by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and that &amp;minus;4 is an 8th power modulo&amp;nbsp;''p'' if and only if ''p'' is representable by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Examples==
*The prime ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;17 is congruent to 1 modulo 16 and is representable by neither ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; nor ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The prime ''p''=113 is congruent to 1 modulo 16 and is representable by both ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (since 113&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32&amp;times;1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 113&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64&amp;times;1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
*The prime ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;41 is congruent to 9 modulo 16 and is representable by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (since 41&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32&amp;times;1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but not by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The prime ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;73 is congruent to 9 modulo 16 and is representable by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (since 73&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;64&amp;times;1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but not by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

It is conjectured that there are no other similar results involving definite forms.

{{Nihongo|'''Kosaburo Hashiguchi'''|橋口 攻三郎|Hashiguchi Kōsaburō}} is a Japanese mathematician and computer scientist at the [[Toyohashi University of Technology]] and [[Okayama University]], known for his research in [[formal language]] theory.

In 1988, he found the first [[algorithm]] to determine the [[star height]] of a [[regular language]], a problem that had been open since 1963 when Lawrence Eggan solved the related [[star height problem]] of showing that there is no finite bound on the star height.
Hashiguchi's algorithm for star height is extremely complex, and impractical on all but the smallest examples.{{r|ls|pin}}{{ran|H88}} A simpler method, showing also that the problem is [[PSPACE-complete]], was provided in 2005 by Kirsten.{{r|ls|kirsten}}

Earlier, in 1979, Hashiguchi had also solved another open problem on regular languages, of deciding whether, for a given language &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a finite number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A^n=A^*&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|brz}}{{ran|H79}}

Hashiguchi is the uncle of Japanese-born American pianist [[Grace Nikae]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">In [[mathematics]],  the '''Lickorish–Wallace theorem''' in the theory of [[3-manifold]]s states that any [[closed manifold|closed]], [[orientable]], connected 3-manifold may be obtained by performing [[Dehn surgery]] on a [[framed link]] in the [[3-sphere]] with ±1 surgery coefficients.  Furthermore, each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted.

The theorem was proved in the early 1960s by [[W. B. R. Lickorish]] and [[Andrew H. Wallace]], independently and by different methods.  Lickorish's proof rested on the [[Lickorish twist theorem]], which states that any orientable [[automorphism]] of a closed orientable [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is generated by [[Dehn twist]]s along 3''g'' &amp;minus; 1 specific simple closed curves in the surface, where ''g'' denotes the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the surface.  Wallace's proof was more general and involved adding handles to the boundary of a higher-dimensional ball.

A corollary of the theorem is that every closed, orientable 3-manifold bounds a [[simply-connected]] compact [[4-manifold]].

By using his work on automorphisms of non-orientable surfaces, Lickorish also showed that every closed, non-orientable, connected 3-manifold is obtained by Dehn surgery on a link in the non-orientable 2-sphere bundle over the circle.  Similar to the orientable case, the surgery can be done in a special way which allows the conclusion that every closed, non-orientable 3-manifold bounds a compact 4-manifold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5385">'''Linear dynamical systems''' are [[dynamical systems]] whose [[evaluation functions]] are [[linear]].  While dynamical systems in general do not have [[closed-form expression|closed-form solutions]], linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, and they have a rich set of mathematical properties.  Linear systems can also be used to understand the qualitative behavior of general dynamical systems, by calculating the [[equilibrium points]] of the system and approximating it as a linear system around each such point.

==Introduction==

In a linear dynamical system, the variation of a state vector 
(an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[vector space|vector]] denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;) equals a constant matrix
(denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;) multiplied by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  This variation can take two forms: either 
as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], in which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; varies 
continuously with time

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{x}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

or as a mapping, in which 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; varies in [[discrete time|discrete]] steps

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x}_{m+1} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are linear in the following sense: if 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; 
are two valid solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] 
of the two solutions, e.g., 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}(t) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \alpha \mathbf{x}(t) + \beta \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;
are any two [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]].  The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; 
need not be [[Symmetry in mathematics#Symmetry in linear algebra|symmetric]].

Linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, in contrast to most nonlinear ones.  Occasionally, a nonlinear system can be  solved exactly by a change of variables to a linear system.  Moreover, the solutions of (almost) any nonlinear system can be well-approximated by an equivalent linear system near its [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].  Hence, understanding linear systems and their solutions is a crucial first step to understanding the more complex nonlinear systems.

==Solution of linear dynamical systems==

If the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf{x}(t=0)&lt;/math&gt;
is aligned with a [[right eigenvector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; of 
the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the dynamics are simple

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x}(t) = 
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{k} = \lambda_{k} \mathbf{r}_{k}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding [[eigenvalue]];
the solution of this equation is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x}(t) = 
\mathbf{r}_{k} e^{\lambda_{k} t}
&lt;/math&gt;
as may be confirmed by substitution.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]], then any vector in an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space can be represented by a linear combination of the right  and [[left eigenvector]]s (denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{l}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;) of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x}_{0} = 
\sum_{k=1}^{N} 
\left( \mathbf{l}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{0} \right)
\mathbf{r}_{k}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the general solution for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is 
a linear combination of the individual solutions for the right
eigenvectors
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x}(t) = 
\sum_{k=1}^{n} 
\left( \mathbf{l}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{0} \right)
\mathbf{r}_{k} e^{\lambda_{k} t}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similar considerations apply to the discrete mappings.

== Classification in two dimensions ==
[[Image:LinDynSysTraceDet.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Linear approximation of a nonlinear system: classification of 2D fixed point according to the trace and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix (the linearization of the system near an equilibrium point).]]
The roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]] det('''A''' - &amp;lambda;'''I''') are the eigenvalues of '''A'''.  The sign and relation of these roots, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, to each other may be used to determine the stability of the dynamical system 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}(t).
&lt;/math&gt;
For a 2-dimensional system, the characteristic polynomial is of the form &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2-\tau\lambda+\Delta=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] of '''A'''.  Thus the two roots are in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=\frac{\tau+\sqrt{\tau^2-4\Delta}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_2=\frac{\tau-\sqrt{\tau^2-4\Delta}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Note also that &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\lambda_1\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau=\lambda_1+\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus if &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then the eigenvalues are of opposite sign, and the fixed point is a saddle.  If &lt;math&gt;\Delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then the eigenvalues are of the same sign.  Therefore, if &lt;math&gt;\tau&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; both are positive and the point is unstable, and if &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then both are negative and the point is stable.  The [[discriminant]] will tell you if the point is nodal or spiral (i.e. if the eigenvalues are real or complex).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14219">In [[mathematics]], the '''Mellin transform''' is an [[integral transform]] that may be regarded as the [[multiplicative group|multiplicative]] version of the [[two-sided Laplace transform]]. This integral transform is closely connected to the theory of [[Dirichlet series]], and is
often used in [[number theory]], [[mathematical statistics]], and the theory of [[asymptotic expansion]]s; it is closely related to the [[Laplace transform]] and the [[Fourier transform]], and the theory of the [[gamma function]] and allied [[special function]]s.

The Mellin transform of a function ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{M}f\right\}(s) = \varphi(s)=\int_0^\infty x^{s-1} f(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse transform is

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{M}^{-1}\varphi\right\}(x) = f(x)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c-i \infty}^{c+i \infty} x^{-s} \varphi(s)\, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

The notation implies this is a [[line integral]] taken over a vertical line in the complex plane. Conditions under which this inversion is valid are given in the [[Mellin inversion theorem]].

The transform is named after the [[Finland|Finnish]] mathematician [[Hjalmar Mellin]].

==Relationship to other transforms==
The [[two-sided Laplace transform]] may be defined in terms of the Mellin
transform by

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\mathcal{B} f\right\}(s) = \left\{\mathcal{M} f(-\ln x) \right\}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

and conversely we can get the Mellin transform from the two-sided Laplace transform by

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{M} f\right\}(s) = \left\{\mathcal{B} f(e^{-x})\right\}(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The Mellin transform may be thought of as integrating using a kernel ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to the multiplicative [[Haar measure]], 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is invariant
under dilation &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax&lt;/math&gt;, so that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(ax)}{ax} = \frac{dx}{x};&lt;/math&gt; the two-sided Laplace transform integrates with respect to the additive Haar measure &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt;, which is translation invariant, so that &lt;math&gt;d(x+a) = dx&lt;/math&gt;.

We also may define the [[Fourier transform]] in terms of the Mellin transform and vice versa; in terms of the Mellin transform and of the two-sided Laplace transform defined above

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{F} f\right\}(-s) = \left\{\mathcal{B} f\right\}(-is) 
= \left\{\mathcal{M} f(-\ln x)\right\}(-is)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

We may also reverse the process and obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{M} f\right\}(s) = \left\{\mathcal{B} f(e^{-x}) \right\}(s) = \left\{\mathcal{F} f(e^{-x})\right\}(-is)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The Mellin transform also connects the [[Newton series]] or [[binomial transform]] together with the [[Poisson generating function]], by means of the [[Poisson&amp;ndash;Mellin&amp;ndash;Newton cycle]].

The Mellin transform may also be viewed as the [[Gelfand transform]] for the [[convolution algebra]] of the [[locally compact abelian group]] of positive real numbers with multiplication.

==Examples==

===Cahen–Mellin integral===
For &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Re(y)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^{-s}&lt;/math&gt; on the [[principal branch]], one has

: &lt;math&gt; e^{-y}= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} \Gamma(s) y^{-s} \; ds &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]]. This integral is known as the Cahen–Mellin integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. H. |last=Hardy |first2=J. E. |last2=Littlewood |title=Contributions to the Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function and the Theory of the Distribution of Primes |journal=[[Acta Mathematica]] |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1916 |pages=119–196 |doi=10.1007/BF02422942 }} ''(See notes therein for further references to Cahen's and Mellin's work, including Cahen's thesis.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number theory===
An important application in number theory includes the simple function 

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\begin{cases} 0  &amp; x &lt; 1, \\ x^a &amp; x &gt; 1, \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

for which 

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal M f (s)= - \frac 1 {s+a}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

assuming 

: &lt;math&gt;\Re (s+a)&lt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

== As an isometry on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; spaces ==
In the study of [[Hilbert space]]s, the Mellin transform is often posed in a slightly different way.  For functions in &lt;math&gt;L^2(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Lp space]]) the fundamental strip always includes &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}+i\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, so we may define a [[linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathcal{M}}\colon L^2(0,\infty)\to L^2(-\infty,\infty), 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}f\}(s) := \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_0^{\infty} x^{-\frac{1}{2} + is} f(x)\,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, we have set

: &lt;math&gt;\{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}f\}(s):=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\{\mathcal{M}f\}(\tfrac{1}{2} + is).&lt;/math&gt;

This operator is usually denoted by just plain &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and called the "Mellin transform", but &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; is used here to distinguish from the definition used elsewhere in this article.  The [[Mellin inversion theorem]] then shows that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible with inverse

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{\mathcal{M}}^{-1}\colon L^2(-\infty,\infty) \to L^2(0,\infty), 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}^{-1}\varphi\}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^{-\frac{1}{2}-is} \varphi(s)\,ds. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, this operator is an [[isometry]], that is to say &lt;math&gt;\|\tilde{\mathcal{M}} f\|_{L^2(-\infty,\infty)}=\|f\|_{L^2(0,\infty)}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; (this explains why the factor of &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; was used).

==In probability theory==
In probability theory, the Mellin transform is an essential tool in studying the distributions of products of random variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Galambos|Simonelli|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a random variable, and {{nowrap|''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} max{''X'',0}}} denotes its positive part, while {{nowrap|''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} max{&amp;minus;''X'',0}}} is its negative part, then the ''Mellin transform'' of ''X'' is defined as &lt;ref name="GalSim16"&gt;{{harvtxt|Galambos|Simonelli|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathcal{M}_X(s) = \int_0^\infty  x^s dF_{X^+}(x) + \gamma\int_0^\infty x^s dF_{X^-}(x),
  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''γ'' is a formal indeterminate with {{nowrap|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}. This transform exists for all ''s'' in some complex strip {{nowrap|''D'' {{=}} {''s''&amp;nbsp;: ''a'' ≤ Re(''s'') ≤ ''b''} }}, where {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ 0 ≤ ''b''}}.&lt;ref name="GalSim16"/&gt;

The Mellin transform &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{M}_X(it)&lt;/math&gt; of a random variable ''X'' uniquely determines its distribution function ''F&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="GalSim16"/&gt; The importance of the Mellin transform in probability theory lies in the fact that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are two independent random variables, then the Mellin transform of their products is equal to the product of the Mellin transforms of ''X'' and ''Y'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Galambos|Simonelli|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathcal{M}_{XY}(s) = \mathcal{M}_X(s)\mathcal{M}_Y(s)
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Problems with Laplacian in cylindrical coordinate system==

In the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates in a generic dimension (orthogonal coordinates with one angle and one radius, and the remaining lengths) there is always a term:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) = f_{rr} + \frac{f_r}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, in 2-D polar coordinates the laplacian is:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and in 3-D cylindrical coordinates the laplacian is,

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \varphi^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This term can be easily treated{{Clarify|date=February 2015}} with the Mellin transform,&lt;ref&gt;Bhimsen, Shivamoggi, Chapter 6: The Mellin Transform, par. 4.3: Distribution of a Potential in a Wedge, pp. 267–8&lt;/ref&gt; since:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M \left(r^2 f_{rr} + r f_r,  r \to s \right) = s^2 \mathcal M \left(f,  r \to s \right) = s^2 F&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the 2-D [[Laplace equation]] in polar coordinates is the PDE in two variables:

:&lt;math&gt; r^2 f_{rr} +  r f_r + f_{\theta \theta} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and by multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with a Mellin transform on radius becomes the simple [[harmonic oscillator]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{\theta \theta} + s^2 F = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with general solution:

:&lt;math&gt; F (s, \theta) = C_1(s) \cos (s\theta) + C_2(s) \sin (s \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Now let's impose for example some simple wedge [[boundary conditions]] to the original Laplace equation:

:&lt;math&gt; f(r,-\theta_0) = a(r), \quad  f(r,\theta_0) = b(r) &lt;/math&gt;

these are particularly simple for Mellin transform, becoming:

:&lt;math&gt; F(s,-\theta_0) = A(s), \quad  F(s,\theta_0) = B(s) &lt;/math&gt;

These conditions imposed to the solution particularise it to:

:&lt;math&gt; F (s, \theta) = A(s) \frac {\sin(s (\theta_0 - \theta))}{\sin (2 \theta_0 s)}+ B(s) \frac {\sin(s (\theta_0 + \theta))}{\sin (2 \theta_0 s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now by the convolution theorem for Mellin transform, the solution in the Mellin domain can be inverted:

:&lt;math&gt; f(r, \theta) = \frac{r^m \cos (m \theta)}{2 \theta_0} \int_0^\infty \left \{ \frac{a(x)}{x^{2m} + 2r^m x^m \sin(m \theta) + r^{2m}} + \frac{b(x)}{x^{2m} - 2r^m x^m \sin(m \theta) + r^{2m}} \right \} x^{m-1} \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

where the following inverse transform relation was employed:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M^{-1} \left( \frac {\sin (s \varphi)}{\sin (2 \theta_0 s)}; s \to r \right) = \frac 1 {2 \theta_0} \frac{r^m \sin (m \varphi)}{1+2r^m \cos(m \varphi) + r^{2m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m= \frac \pi {2 \theta_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The Mellin Transform is widely used in computer science for the analysis of algorithms{{clarify|date=March 2014}} because of its scale invariance property.  The magnitude of the Mellin Transform of a scaled function is identical to the magnitude of the original function for purely imaginary inputs.  This scale invariance property is analogous to the Fourier Transform's shift invariance property.  The magnitude of a Fourier transform of a time-shifted function is identical to the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the original function.

This property is useful in image recognition.  An image of an object is easily scaled when the object is moved towards or away from the camera.

In [[quantum mechanics]] and especially [[quantum field theory]],  [[Fourier space]] is enormously useful and used extensively because momentum and position are [[Fourier transform]]s of each other (for instance, [[Feynman diagrams]] are much more easily computed in momentum space).  In 2011, [[A. Liam Fitzpatrick]], [[Jared Kaplan]], [[João Penedones]], [[Suvrat Raju]], and [[Balt C. van Rees]] showed that Mellin space serves an analogous role in the context of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Jared Kaplan, Joao Penedones, Suvrat Raju, Balt C. van Rees. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1499 "A Natural Language for AdS/CFT Correlators"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Jared Kaplan. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4845 "Unitarity and the Holographic S-Matrix"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Liam Fitzpatrick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5744">'''Nominal terms''' are a [[metalanguage]] for embedding object languages with binding constructs into.  Intuitively, they may be seen as an extension of first-order terms with support for name binding.  Consequently, the native notion of equality between two nominal terms is [[Lambda calculus|alpha-equivalence]] (equivalence up to a permutative renaming of bound names).  Nominal terms came out of a programme of research into [[Nominal techniques|nominal sets]], and have a concrete semantics in those sets.

Nominal unification is efficiently decidable.  This fact led to the development of [[alphaProlog]], a [[Prolog]]-like [[logic programming]] language with facilities for binding names in terms, where Prolog's standard [[Unification (computing)|first-order unification algorithm]] is replaced with nominal unification.

Nominal term embeddings may be seen as alternatives to [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn encodings]] and [[higher-order abstract syntax]], where the latter uses the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] as a metalanguage.

==Motivation==

Many interesting calculi, [[logics]] and [[programming languages]] that are commonly seen in computer science feature name binding constructs.  For instance, the universal quantifier from [[first-order logic]], the lambda-binder from the [[lambda-calculus]], and the pi-binder from the [[pi-calculus]] are all examples of name-binding constructs.

[[Computer scientists]] often need to manipulate [[abstract syntax trees]].  For instance, [[compiler]] writers perform many manipulations of abstract syntax trees during the various optimisation and elaboration phases of compiler execution.  In particular, when working with abstract syntax trees with name binding constructs, we often want to work on alpha-equivalence classes, implement capture-avoiding substitutions, and make it easy to generate fresh names.  How best to do this, in a bug free and reliable manner, motivates a large amount of research.

Prior attempts at solving this problem include 'nameless approaches' such as de Bruijn indices and levels, and higher-order approaches such as higher-order abstract syntax.  Nominal terms are another, relatively new, approach that retain explicit names for bound variables like higher-order abstract syntax, whilst retaining the first-order flavour (and first-order computational properties) of de Bruijn encodings.

==Relation with higher-order patterns==

Higher-order unification is known to be [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].  This motivates the search for subsets of lambda-terms that enjoy a computationally well-behaved unification procedure.  Higher-order patterns, proposed by Miller, are one such set.

Higher-order patterns are [[Lambda calculus|lambda-terms]] where the arguments of a free variable are all distinct bound variables.  They possess an efficiently decidable unification procedure, and as a result, have been widely implemented, notably in the logic programming language [[lambdaProlog]].

A recent body of work has investigated the connections between nominal terms and higher-order patterns, and consequently between nominal unification and higher-order pattern unification.  Cheney proposed an extension of nominal terms called nominal patterns.  He then provided a translation between nominal patterns and higher-order patterns which preserved [[Unification (computer science)|unifiers]].  Later, Levy and Villaret demonstrated a translation between nominal terms and higher-order patterns that preserves the notion of unifiability.  That is, if two nominal terms are unifiable, then their translated pattern counterparts are also unifiable.

Dowek and Gabbay later sharpened Levy and Villaret's translation, proving that in some sense their translation is the best that there can be, and proved that the improved translation preserves unifiers.  That is, if two nominal terms are unifiable by some substitution, then the corresponding higher-order pattern unification problem under the translation is solved by the translated substitution.  For their proof, Dowek and Gabbay used a variation of nominal terms called permissive nominal terms.  However, a translation from permissive nominal terms and back again also exists, completing the translation between nominal terms and higher-order patterns.

In mathematics, '''Pappus's hexagon theorem''' (attributed to [[Pappus of Alexandria]]) states that given one set of [[Collinearity|collinear]] points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and another set of collinear points ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', then the intersection points ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' of [[line (mathematics)|line]] pairs ''Ab'' and ''aB'', ''Ac'' and ''aC'', ''Bc'' and ''bC'' are [[collinear]], lying on the ''Pappus line''. These three points are the points of intersection of the "opposite" sides of the hexagon ''AbCaBc''. It holds in a [[projective plane]] over any field, but fails for projective planes over any noncommutative [[division ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, pp. 236–7&lt;/ref&gt; Projective planes in which the "theorem" is valid are called '''pappian planes'''.

The [[duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of this [[intersection theorem|incidence theorem]] states that given one set of [[concurrent lines]] ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and another set of concurrent lines ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', then the lines ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' defined by pairs of points resulting from pairs of intersections ''A''∩''b'' and ''a''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B'', ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''c'' and ''a''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''C'', ''B''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''c'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''C'' are concurrent. (''Concurrent'' means that the lines pass through one point.)

Pappus's theorem is a [[special case]] of [[Pascal's theorem]] for a conic—the [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] when the conic [[degenerate conic|degenerates]] into 2 straight lines. Pascal's theorem is in turn a special case of the [[Cayley–Bacharach theorem]].

The [[Pappus configuration]] is the [[projective configuration|configuration]] of 9 lines and 9 points that occurs in Pappus's theorem, with each line meeting 3 of the points and each point meeting 3 lines. In general, the Pappus line does not pass through the point of intersection of ''ABC'' and ''abc''.&lt;ref&gt;However, this does occur when ''ABC'' and ''abc'' are in [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]], that is, ''Aa'', ''Bb'' and ''Cc'' are concurrent.&lt;/ref&gt;  This configuration is [[Duality (projective geometry)|self dual]]. Since, in particular, the lines ''Bc'', ''bC'', ''XY'' have the properties of the lines ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' of the dual theorem, and collinearity of ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' is equivalent to concurrence of ''Bc'', ''bC'', ''XY'', the dual theorem is therefore just the same as the theorem itself. The [[Levi graph]] of the Pappus configuration is the [[Pappus graph]], a [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] [[Distance-regular graph|distance-regular]] graph with 18 vertices and 27 edges.

==Proof==

Choose projective coordinates with 
:{{nowrap|1=''C'' = (1, 0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|1=''c'' = (0, 1, 0)}}, {{nowrap|1=''X'' = (0, 0, 1)}}, {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (1, 1, 1)}}.
On the lines ''AC'', ''Ac'', ''AX'', given by {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, take the points ''B'', ''Y'', ''b'' to be 
:{{nowrap|1=''B'' = (''p'', 1, 1)}}, {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = (1, ''q'', 1)}}, {{nowrap|1=''b'' = (1, 1, ''r'')}}
for some ''p'', ''q'', ''r''. The three lines ''XB'', ''CY'', ''cb'' are {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''p''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''q''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''}}, so they pass through the same point ''a'' if and only if {{nowrap|1=''rqp'' = 1}}. The  condition for the three lines ''Cb'', ''cB'' and ''XY'' {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''p''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''}} to pass through the same point ''Z'' is {{nowrap|1=''rpq'' = 1}}. So this last set of three lines is concurrent if all the other eight sets are because multiplication is commutative, so {{nowrap|1=''pq'' = ''qp''}}. Equivalently, ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' are collinear.

The proof above also shows that for Pappus's theorem to hold for a projective space over a division ring it is both sufficient and necessary that the division ring is a (commutative) field. German mathematician [[Gerhard Hessenberg]] proved that Pappus's theorem implies [[Desargues's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Coxeter"&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=p. 238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harv|Dembowski|1968|loc= pg. 159, footnote 1}}, Hessenberg's original proof {{harvtxt|Hessenberg|1905}} is not complete; he disregarded the possibility that some additional incidences could occur in the Desargues configuration. A complete proof is provided by {{harvnb|Cronheim|1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Pappus's theorem holds for some projective plane if and only if it is a projective plane over a commutative field. The projective planes in which Pappus's theorem does not hold are [[Desarguesian]] projective planes over noncommutative division rings, and [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s.

The proof is invalid if ''C'', ''c'', ''X'' happen to be collinear. In that case an alternative proof can be provided, for example, using a different projective reference.

==Origins==

In its earliest known form, Pappus's Theorem is Propositions 138, 139, 141, and 143 of Book VII of [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus's]] ''Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (Vol. II, p. 421) cites these propositions.  The latter two can be understood as converses of the former two.  Kline (p. 128) cites only Proposition 139.  The numbering of the propositions is as assigned by Hultsch.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are Lemmas XII, XIII, XV, and XVII in the part of Book VII consisting of lemmas to the first of the three books of [[Euclid]]'s ''Porisms.''

The lemmas are proved in terms of what today is known as the cross ratio of four collinear points. Three earlier lemmas are used. The first of these, Lemma III, has the diagram below (which uses Pappus's lettering, with G for Γ, D for Δ, J for Θ, and L for Λ). 
:[[File:Pappus-collection-7-129.svg|Pappus-collection-7-129]]
Here three concurrent straight lines, AB, AG, and AD, are crossed by two lines, JB and JE, which concur at J. 
Also KL is drawn parallel to AZ.
Then
:KJ : JL :: (KJ : AG &amp; AG : JL) :: (JD : GD &amp; BG : JB).
These proportions might be written today as equations:&lt;ref&gt;A reason for using the notation above is that, for the ancient Greeks, a ratio is not a number or a geometrical object.  We may think of ratio today as an equivalence class of pairs of geometrical objects. Also, equality for the Greeks is what we might today call congruence. In particular, distinct line segments may be equal.  Ratios are not ''equal'' in this sense; but they may be the ''same.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:KJ/JL = (KJ/AG)(AG/JL) = (JD/GD)(BG/JB).
The last compound ratio (namely JD : GD &amp; BG : JB) is what is known today as the [[cross ratio]] of the collinear points J, G, D, and B in that order; it is denoted today by (J, G; D, B). So we have shown that this is independent of the choice of the particular straight line JD that crosses the three straight lines that concur at A. In particular
:(J, G; D, B) = (J, Z; H, E).
It does not matter on which side of A the straight line JE falls. In particular, the situation may be as in the next diagram, which is the diagram for Lemma X. 
:[[File:Pappus-collection-7-136.svg|Pappus-collection-7-136]]
Just as before, we have (J, G; D, B) = (J, Z; H, E). Pappus does not explicitly prove this; but Lemma X is a converse, namely that if these two cross ratios are the same, and the straight lines BE and DH cross at A, then the points G, A, and Z must be collinear.

What we showed originally can be written as (J, ∞; K, L) = (J, G; D, B), with ∞ taking the place of the (nonexistent) intersection of JK and AG. Pappus shows this, in effect, in Lemma XI, whose diagram, however, has different lettering: 
:[[File:Pappus-collection-7-137.svg|Pappus-collection-7-137]]
What Pappus shows is DE.ZH : EZ.HD :: GB : BE, which we may write as
:(D, Z; E, H) = (∞, B; E, G).
The diagram for Lemma XII is:
:[[File:Pappus-collection-7-138.svg|Pappus-collection-7-138]]
The diagram for Lemma XIII is the same, but BA and DG, extended, meet at N. In any case, considering straight lines through G as cut by the three straight lines through A, (and accepting that equations of cross ratios remain valid after permutation of the entries,) we have by Lemma III or XI
:(G, J; E, H) = (G, D; ∞ Z).
Considering straight lines through D as cut by the three straight lines through B, we have
:(L, D; E, K) = (G, D; ∞ Z).
Thus (E, H; J, G) = (E, K; D, L), so by Lemma X, the points H, M, and K are collinear.  That is, the points of intersection of the pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon ADEGBZ are collinear.

Lemmas XV and XVII are that, if the point M is determined as the intersection of HK and BG, then the points A, M, and D are collinear.  That is, the points of intersection of the pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon BEKHZG are collinear.

==Other statements of the theorem==
[[Image:Pappus hexagon.svg|300px|thumb| Triangles ''XcC'' and ''BbY'' are perspective from ''A'' and ''a'', and so, also from ''Z''.]]
In addition to the above characterizations of Pappus's theorem and its dual, the following are equivalent statements:
* If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, then the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arranged in a matrix of nine points (as in the figure and description above) and thought of as evaluating a [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]], if the first two rows and the six "diagonal" triads are collinear, then the third row is collinear.  
::&lt;math&gt;\left|\begin{matrix}
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
a &amp; b &amp; c \\
X &amp; Y &amp; Z \end{matrix}
\right|&lt;/math&gt;

In [[geometry]], the '''parallel postulate''', also called '''[[Euclid]]'s fifth postulate''' because it is the fifth postulate in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], is a distinctive [[axiom]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. It states that, in two-dimensional geometry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''If a [[line segment]] intersects two straight [[line (mathematics)|lines]] forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two [[right angle]]s, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This postulate does not specifically talk about parallel lines;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170202075326/http://people.cst.cmich.edu/piate1kl/mth_553_f07/non-euclidean_geometries_small.pdf non-Euclidean geometries], by [http://people.cst.cmich.edu/piate1kl/ Dr. Katrina Piatek-Jimenez]{{incomplete citation|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete citation|date=September 2018}} {{cn span|it is only a postulate related to parallelism.|date=September 2018}}{{Improper synthesis|date=September 2018}} Euclid gave the definition of parallel lines in Book I, Definition 23&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/defI23.html Euclid's Elements, Book I, Definition 23]&lt;/ref&gt; just before the five postulates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/bookI.html Euclid's Elements, Book I]&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

''Euclidean geometry'' is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms, ''including'' the parallel postulate.  A geometry where the parallel postulate does not hold is known as a [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Geometry that is [[Logically independent|independent]] of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the modern equivalent of the first four postulates) is known as [[absolute geometry]] (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

==Equivalent properties==
Probably the best known equivalent of Euclid's parallel postulate, contingent on his other postulates, is [[Playfair's axiom]], named after the Scottish [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In a plane, given a line and a point not on it, at most one line parallel to the given line can be drawn through the point.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI30.html Euclid's Parallel Postulate and Playfair's Axiom]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This axiom by itself is not [[logically equivalent]] to the Euclidean parallel postulate since there are geometries in which one is true and the other is not. However, in the presence of the remaining axioms which give Euclidean geometry, each of these can be used to prove the other, so they are equivalent in the context of [[absolute geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|Taimiņa|2005|loc=pg. 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other statements equivalent to the parallel postulate have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so [[self-evidence|self-evident]] that they were [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates. These equivalent statements include:

# There is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point. ([[Playfair's axiom]])
# The sum of the [[angle]]s in every [[triangle]] is 180° ([[triangle postulate]]).
# There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180°.
# The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.
# There exists a pair of [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]], but not [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]], triangles.
# Every triangle can be [[circumscribe]]d.
# If three angles of a [[quadrilateral]] are [[right angle]]s, then the fourth angle is also a right angle.
# There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles, that is, a [[rectangle]].
# There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant [[distance]] from each other.
# Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.
# In a [[right-angled triangle]], the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ([[Pythagoras' Theorem]]).&lt;ref name=Parallel&gt;{{Citation

However, the alternatives which employ the word "parallel" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the four common definitions of "parallel" is meant&amp;nbsp;– constant separation, never meeting, same angles where crossed by ''some'' third line, or same angles where crossed by ''any'' third line&amp;nbsp;– since the equivalence of these four is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate. In the list above, it is always taken to refer to non-intersecting lines. For example, if the word "parallel" in Playfair's axiom is taken to mean 'constant separation' or 'same angles where crossed by any third line', then it is no longer equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate, and is provable from the first four (the axiom says 'There is at most one line...', which is consistent with there being no such lines). However, if the definition is taken so that parallel lines are lines that do not intersect, or that have some line intersecting them in the same angles, Playfair's axiom is contextually equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate and is thus logically independent of the first four postulates. Note that the latter two definitions are not equivalent, because in hyperbolic geometry the second definition holds only for [[Hyperbolic geometry#Non-intersecting lines|ultraparallel]] lines.

==History==
For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, the parallel postulate is not self-evident. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16–23|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods until the mistake was found. Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate ([[#Equivalent properties|Playfair's axiom]]). Although known from the time of Proclus, this became known as Playfair's Axiom after John Playfair wrote a famous commentary on Euclid in 1795 in which he proposed replacing Euclid's fifth postulate by his own axiom.

[[Proclus]] (410-485) wrote a commentary on ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]'' where he comments on attempted proofs to deduce the fifth postulate from the other four, in particular he notes that [[Ptolemy]] had produced a false 'proof'. Proclus then goes on to give a false proof of his own. However he did give a postulate which is equivalent to the fifth postulate.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) (965-1039), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]], made an attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|loc=pg. 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the course of which he introduced the concept of [[Motion (geometry)|motion]] and [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] into geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|1998|p=269}}: {{quote|In effect, this method characterized parallel lines as lines always equidistant from one another and also introduced the concept of motion into geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the [[Lambert quadrilateral]], which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral",&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld&gt;{{Harvnb|Rozenfeld|1988|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attempted proof contains elements similar to those found in [[Lambert quadrilateral]]s and [[Playfair's axiom]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and poet [[Omar Khayyám]] (1050–1123), attempted to prove the fifth postulate from another explicitly given postulate (based on the fourth of the five ''principles due to the Philosopher'' ([[Aristotle]]), namely, "Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."&lt;ref&gt;Boris A Rosenfeld and Adolf P Youschkevitch (1996), ''Geometry'', p.467 in Roshdi Rashed, Régis Morelon (1996), ''Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science'', Routledge, {{isbn|0-415-12411-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He derived some of the earlier results belonging to [[elliptical geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], though his postulate excluded the latter possibility.&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld&gt;Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [469], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Khayyam's postulate had excluded the case of the hyperbolic geometry whereas al-Tusi's postulate ruled out both the hyperbolic and elliptic geometries."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] was also first considered by Omar Khayyám in the late 11th century in Book I of ''Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid''.&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld /&gt; Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]]), Khayyám was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from his equivalent postulate. He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's fifth postulate; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line).  If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's fifth postulate, otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse.  He showed that the acute and obtuse cases led to contradictions using his postulate, but his postulate is now known to be equivalent to the fifth postulate.

[[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274), in his ''Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya'' (''Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines'') (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayyám's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt; He also considered the cases of what are now known as elliptical and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them.&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld/&gt;

[[Image:Euclidian and non euclidian geometry.png|thumb|right|350px|Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.]]

Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as "[[Pseudo-Tusi]]"), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on his father's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. "He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the ''Elements''."&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [469], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"In ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'', [...] another statement is used instead of a postulate. It was independent of the Euclidean postulate V and easy to prove. [...] He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the ''Elements''."}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was published in [[Rome]] in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|loc=pg.271}}: {{quote|"But in a manuscript probably written by his son Sadr al-Din in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts on the subject, there is a new argument based on another hypothesis, also equivalent to Euclid's, [...] The importance of this latter work is that it was published in Rome in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. In particular, it became the starting point for the work of Saccheri and ultimately for the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened with a criticism of Sadr al-Din's work and the work of Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Saccheri.html MacTutor's Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giordano Vitale]] (1633-1711), in his book ''Euclide restituo'' (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant. [[Girolamo Saccheri]] (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to refute the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).

In 1766 [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Johann Lambert]] wrote, but did not publish, ''Theorie der Parallellinien'' in which he attempted, as Saccheri did, to prove the fifth postulate. He worked with a figure that today we call a ''Lambert quadrilateral'', a quadrilateral with three right angles (can be considered half of a Saccheri quadrilateral). He quickly eliminated the possibility that the fourth angle is obtuse, as had Saccheri and Khayyám, and then proceeded to prove many theorems under the assumption of an acute angle. Unlike Saccheri, he never felt that he had reached a contradiction with this assumption. He had proved the non-Euclidean result that the sum of the angles in a triangle increases as the area of the triangle decreases, and this led him to speculate on the possibility of a model of the acute case on a sphere of imaginary radius. He did not carry this idea any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=J.J.| last2=Robertson |first2=E.F|title=Johann Heinrich Lambert|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lambert.html|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Khayyám and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the [[logically consistent]] geometries which result. In 1829, [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831, [[János Bolyai]] included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had also studied the problem, but he did not publish any of his results. Upon hearing of Bolyai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father, [[Farkas Bolyai]], Gauss stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment.  But I cannot say otherwise.  To praise it would be to praise myself.  Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The resulting geometries were later developed by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[Jules-Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] into [[hyperbolic geometry]] (the acute case) and [[elliptic geometry]] (the obtuse case). The [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868.

==Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate==
[[Image:Parallel Postulate.svg|thumb|right|350px|The converse of the parallel postulate: If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180°, then the lines are parallel and will never intersect.]]
Euclid did not postulate the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from [[elliptic geometry]].  The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 27): ''If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.''  As [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Heath, T.L., ''The thirteen books of Euclid's Elements'', Vol.1, Dover, 1956, pg.309.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out, this is logically equivalent to (Book I, Proposition 16). These results do not depend upon the fifth postulate, but they do require the second postulate&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, H.S.M., ''Non-Euclidean Geometry'', 6th Ed., MAA 1998, pg.3&lt;/ref&gt; which is violated in elliptic geometry.

==Criticism==
Attempts to logically prove the parallel postulate, rather than the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer is referring to Euclid's Common Notion 4: Figures coinciding with one another are equal to one another.&lt;/ref&gt; were criticized by [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Mathematics|Arthur Schopenhauer]]. However, the argument used by Schopenhauer was that the postulate is evident by perception, not that it was not a logical consequence of the other axioms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7491">In [[mathematics]], the (linear) '''Peetre theorem,''' named after [[Jaak Peetre]], is a result of [[functional analysis]] that gives a characterisation of [[Differential operator|differential operator]]s in terms of their effect on generalized [[function space]]s, and without mentioning [[derivative|differentiation]] in explicit terms.  The Peetre theorem is an example of a [[finite order theorem]] in which a function or a [[functor]], defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it.

This article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem.  The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications.

== The original Peetre theorem ==
Let ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and let ''E'' and ''F'' be two [[vector bundles]] on ''M''.  Let
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\infty (E),\ \hbox{and}\ \Gamma^\infty (F)&lt;/math&gt;
be the spaces of [[smooth section]]s of ''E'' and ''F''.  An ''operator''
:&lt;math&gt;D:\Gamma^\infty (E)\rightarrow \Gamma^\infty(F)&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[sheaf (mathematics)|morphism of sheaves]] which is linear on sections such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of ''D'' is [[non-increasing]]: ''supp Ds'' &amp;sube; ''supp s'' for every smooth section ''s'' of ''E''.   The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and an integer ''k'' (depending on ''U'') such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k'' over ''U''.  This means that ''D'' factors through a linear mapping ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; from the ''k''-[[jet (mathematics)|jet of sections]] of ''E'' into the space of smooth sections of ''F'':
:&lt;math&gt;D=i_D\circ j^k&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;j^k:\Gamma^\infty E\rightarrow J^kE&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''k''-jet operator and
:&lt;math&gt;i_D:J^kE\rightarrow F&lt;/math&gt;
is a linear mapping of vector bundles.

=== Proof ===
The problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when ''M'' is an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''E'' and ''F'' are trivial bundles.  At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas:
*'''Lemma 1.'''  If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every ''x''&amp;isin;''M'' and ''C'' &gt; 0, there exists a neighborhood ''V'' of ''x'' and a positive integer ''k'' such that for any ''y''&amp;isin;''V''\{''x''} and for any section ''s'' of ''E'' whose ''k''-jet  vanishes at ''y'' (''j&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;s''(''y'')=0), we have |''Ds''(''y'')|&lt;C.
*'''Lemma 2.'''  The first lemma is sufficient to prove the theorem.

We begin with the proof of Lemma 1.

:Suppose the lemma is false.  Then there is a sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; tending to ''x'', and a sequence of very disjoint balls ''B''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; around the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections ''s''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of ''E'' over each ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''j''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)=0 but |''Ds''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)|&amp;ge;C&gt;0.

:Let &amp;rho;(''x'') denote a standard [[bump function]] for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;(0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball.

:Consider every other section ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''2k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  At ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2k''&lt;/sub&gt;, these satisfy 
::''j''&lt;sup&gt;''2k''&lt;/sup&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2k''&lt;/sub&gt;)=0.
:Suppose that ''2k'' is given.  Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy ''j''&lt;sup&gt;2k&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;)=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball ''B&amp;prime;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2k''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate:
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{|\alpha|\le k}\ \sup_{y\in B'_\delta(x_{2k})} |\nabla^\alpha s_k(y)|\le \frac{1}{M_k}\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)^k&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;M_k=\sum_{|\alpha|\le k}\sup |\nabla^\alpha\rho|.&lt;/math&gt;

:Now
::&lt;math&gt;\rho_{2k}(y):=\rho\left(\frac{y-x_{2k}}{\delta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:is a standard bump function supported in ''B&amp;prime;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2k''&lt;/sub&gt;), and the derivative of the product ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded in such a way that
::&lt;math&gt;\max_{|\alpha|\le k}\ \sup_{y\in B'_\delta(x_{2k})}|\nabla^\alpha (\rho_{2k}s_{2k})|\le 2^{-k}.&lt;/math&gt;
:As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly
::&lt;math&gt;q(y)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\rho_{2k}(y)s_{2k}(y),&lt;/math&gt; 
:''q''(''y'') is a smooth function on all of ''V''.

:We now observe that since ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt; are equal in a neighborhood of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}|Dq(x_{2k})|\ge C&lt;/math&gt;
:So by continuity |''Dq''(''x'')|&amp;ge; C&gt;0.  On the other hand, 
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}Dq(x_{2k+1})=0&lt;/math&gt;
:since ''Dq''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2k+1&lt;/sub&gt;)=0 because ''q'' is identically zero in ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2k+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D'' is support non-increasing.  So ''Dq''(''x'')=0.  This is a contradiction.

We now prove Lemma 2.

:First, let us dispense with the constant ''C'' from the first lemma.  We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0.  Pick a ''y'' in ''V''\{''x''} so that ''j''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''s''(y)=0 but |''Ds''(''y'')|=''g''&gt;0.  Rescale ''s'' by a factor of 2''C''/g.  Then if ''g'' is non-zero, by the linearity of ''D'', |''Ds''(''y'')|=2''C''&gt;''C'', which is impossible by Lemma 1.  This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood ''V''\{''x''}.

:Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point ''x'' in the punctured neighborhood.  ''D'' is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients.  Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at ''x'' as well.  Thus the coefficients of ''D'' are also smooth at ''x''.

== A specialized application ==
Let ''M'' be a [[compact (topology)|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] (possibly with [[manifold|boundary]]), and ''E'' and ''F'' be finite dimensional [[vector bundle]]s on ''M''.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\infty (E)&lt;/math&gt;be the collection of [[smooth section]]s of ''E''.  An ''operator''

:&lt;math&gt;D:\Gamma^\infty (E)\rightarrow \Gamma^\infty (F)&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function (of [[Fréchet manifold]]s) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\circ D_p=p.&lt;/math&gt;

The Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator ''D'', there exists an integer ''k'' such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k''.   Specifically, we can decompose

:&lt;math&gt;D=i_D\circ j^k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i_D&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping from the [[jet (mathematics)|jet]]s of sections of ''E'' to the bundle ''F''.  See also [[differential operator#coordinate-independendent description|intrinsic differential operators]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">In [[mathematics]], the '''Pompeiu problem''' is a conjecture in [[integral geometry]], named for [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]], who posed the problem in 1929, 
as follows.  Suppose ''f'' is a nonzero [[continuous function]] defined on a Euclidean space, and  ''K'' is a [[simply connected]] [[Lipschitz domain]], so that the [[integral]] of ''f'' vanishes on every [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] copy of ''K''.  Then the domain is a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]].

A special case is '''Schiffer's conjecture'''.

'''Prime95''' is the freeware [[application software|application]] written by [[George Woltman]] that is used by [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|GIMPS]], a [[distributed computing]] project dedicated to finding new [[Mersenne prime]] numbers. More specifically, Prime95 refers to the Windows and macOS versions of the software.

'''MPrime''' is the [[Linux]] [[command-line interface]] version of Prime95, to be run in a [[text terminal]] or in a [[terminal emulator]] window as a remote shell client. It is identical to Prime95 in functionality, except it lacks a [[graphical user interface]].

Although most of the GIMPS software's [[source code]] is publicly available, it is technically not [[free software]] as users must abide by the project's distribution [https://www.mersenne.org/legal/ terms] if the software is used to discover a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits and wins the $150,000 bounty offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/awards/coop Cooperative Computing Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a user who uses Prime95 to discover a qualifying prime number would not be able to claim the prize directly ($50,000 will go to the person who finds the prime number, $50,000 will go to a mathematics-related charity, $50,000 will be kept as reserve by GIMPS). A free software package would not have this restriction.

The code that is used to generate [[checksum]]s is not publicly available for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=47191&amp;postcount=16&lt;/ref&gt; The rewritten FFT [[Assembly language|assembly]] code in the current stable version 28 (since June 1, 2014) uses [[FMA instruction set]] (FMA3) instructions of [[Haswell (microarchitecture)]] CPUs (Core i3/i5/i7-4xxx models), resulting in a huge performance increase.&lt;ref name="Mersenne Research, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime95 version 28 released! Faster on Intel's latest CPUs!|url=https://www.mersenne.org/|publisher=Mersenne Research, Inc.|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime95 currently does not have GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) support, although Woltman has indicated that it is under development. However, there are third-party programs, such as CUDALucas, that make use of the processing power of GPUs.

==Finding Mersenne primes by distributed computing==
{{As of|2014|url=https://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=42}}, 16 new [[Mersenne prime]] numbers have been found by the network of participants, and a new Mersenne prime was discovered approximately every year until 2009; the one after that was 4 years after. [[Scott Kurowski]] wrote the [https://www.mersenne.org/primenet/ Internet PrimeNet] [[Server (computing)|Server]] that supports the Prime95/MPrime software on [[GIMPS]], one of the earliest [[grid computing]] projects, researching Mersenne prime numbers, to demonstrate [[Entropia, Inc. (company)|Entropia]]-distributed computing software, a company he founded in 1997.

To perform the Mersenne prime search, the program implements two algorithms:
* [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test|Lucas–Lehmer]] (LL) test – proves any specific number is either a Mersenne prime, or a composite (in practice it has reliability of about 96%)
* [[Probable prime]] (PRP) test – proves a number to be composite (but in practice has very low chance of reporting a false positive); this method is preferred for large numbers because of better error correction

It also implements a few algorithms which try to factor the numbers:
* [[Trial division|Trial factoring]] – this method is primarily used before applying the aforementioned algorithms
* [[Pollard's p − 1 algorithm|Pollard's factorization algorithm]] (P-1)
* [[Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization|Elliptic-curve factorization method]] (ECM)

== Use for stress testing ==

Over the years, Prime95 has become extremely popular among [[Personal computer|PC]] enthusiasts and [[Overclocking|overclockers]] as a stability testing utility. It includes a "Torture Test" mode designed specifically for testing PC subsystems for errors in order to help ensure the correct operation of Prime95 on that system. This is important because each iteration of the Lucas-Lehmer depends on the previous one; if one iteration is incorrect, so will be the entire primality test.

The stress-test feature in Prime95 can be configured to better test various components of the computer by changing the [[fast fourier transform]] (FFT) size. Three pre-set configurations are available: Small FFTs and In-place FFTs, and Blend. Small and In-place modes primarily test the FPU and the caches of the CPU, whereas the Blend mode tests everything, including the memory.

By selecting Custom, the user can gain further control of the configuration. For example, by selecting 8-8 kB as the FFT size, the program stresses primarily the CPU. By selecting 2048-4096 kB and unchecking the "Run FFTs in-place" checkbox, providing the maximum amount of RAM free in the system, the program tests the memory and the chipset. If the amount of memory to use option is set too high, then the system will start using the paging file and the test will not stress the memory.

On an absolutely stable system, Prime95 would run indefinitely. If an error occurs, at which point the stress test would terminate, this would indicate that the system may be unstable. There is an ongoing debate about terms "stable" and "Prime-stable", as Prime95 often fails before the system becomes unstable or crashes in any other application. This is because Prime95 is ''designed'' to subject the CPU to an incredibly intense workload, and to halt when it encounters even one minor error, whereas most normal applications do not stress the CPU anywhere near as much, and will continue to operate unless they encounter a fatal error.

In the overclocking community, a [[rule of thumb]] is often used to determine how long to run Prime95: test the CPU (8 kB FFT) for 10 hours and the memory (4096 kB FFT) for 10 hours, and if the system passes, there is a high chance that it is stable.  Twenty-four hours of testing is recommended to be sure, as errors may show up after 16 or more hours of testing (compared to, say, just four hours of testing).&lt;!-- The ref source page recommends 24 hours testing non-stop --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.overclockers.com/forums/showthread.php/335813-Guidelines-for-Thorough-Stability-Testing |title=Guidelines for Thorough Stability Testing - Overclockers Forums |publisher=Ocforums.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a large proportion of system [[overclockers]] and enthusiasts favor Prime95 over other benchmarking suites because Prime95 pushes the CPU's floating point units extremely hard, causing the CPU to become extremely hot. In addition, Prime95 stresses a computer far more than the majority of software-based torture suites. The nature of this is because the operating system usually shuts down the floating-point unit when unused by other programs, whereas Prime95 is well-optimized to continuously and effectively thread the FPU, causing it to be deeply [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], thereby generating significantly more heat because of elevated power consumption under the massive workload conditions. In CPUs which are not adequately cooled, errors are likely to occur. Prime95 also constantly accesses main memory at up to 60 MB per second. This constant activity will detect memory problems that other programs will not.

Lastly, power supply units of any machine running Prime95 are subject to the consistent ramifications of such harsh conditions. Power must be maintained clean, while providing adequate voltage, particularly to the CPU, RAM, and chipsets (mainboard chipsets such as the Northbridge where the memory controller may or may not reside; see [[Athlon 64]] or [[Intel Core i7]] for on-die memory controllers) to provide peak performance while maintaining stability. Cray Research used programs similar to Prime95 for over a decade for the purpose of stability testing.&lt;ref&gt;https://mfvl.home.xs4all.nl/prime/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==

Version 24 and older of Prime95 cannot test Mersenne numbers beyond &lt;math&gt; 2^{79,300,000} -1&lt;/math&gt;, which means that it cannot test exponents above 79,300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starqwest.org/page4.html |title=Team StarQwest |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606075920/http://www.starqwest.org/page4.html |archivedate=June 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is slightly shorter than a 24 million digit number. As of August 14, 2018, all of the numbers up to this threshold have been tested. There is a countdown at https://www.mersenne.org/report_milestones/. Newer versions of Prime95 (version 25, 26, 27 and 28) can handle Mersenne numbers up to the limit &lt;math&gt; 2^{596,000,000} -1&lt;/math&gt;, meaning we can handle exponents up to 596,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=258001&amp;highlight=596000000#post258001 |title=P-1 factoring anyone? - Page 22 |publisher=mersenneforum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can perform Trial Factoring on Mersenne numbers up to &lt;math&gt; 2^{2,147,483,647}-1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Prime95 does not fully stress all processor threads when the threads number is more than 64 in Windows, or 32 for the 32-bit version. Windows will manage the processors in groups when the number is beyond 64. Each group will only have a maximum of 64. Prime95 will only load into one processor group.

[[File:Apollonius problem typical solution.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: A solution (in pink) to Apollonius' problem. The given circles are shown in black.]]

[[File:Apollonius8ColorMultiplyV2.svg|thumb|right|Figure 2: Four complementary pairs of solutions to Apollonius' problem; the given circles are black.]]

In [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean plane geometry]], '''Apollonius's problem''' is to construct [[circle]]s that are [[tangent]] to three given circles in a plane (Figure&amp;nbsp;1). [[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 {{nowrap|BC – c.}} 190 BC) posed and solved this famous problem in his work {{lang|el| Ἐπαφαί}} (''{{lang|el-Latn|Epaphaí}}'', "Tangencies"); this work has been lost, but a 4th-century AD report of his results by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] has survived. Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them (Figure&amp;nbsp;2), a pair of solutions for each way to divide the three given circles in two subsets (there are 4 ways to divide a set of cardinality 3 in 2 parts).

In the 16th century, [[Adriaan van Roomen]] solved the problem using intersecting [[hyperbola]]s, but this solution does not use only [[straightedge and compass]] constructions. [[François Viète]] found such a solution by exploiting [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]s: any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero [[radius]] (a [[point (geometry)|point]]) or expanded to infinite radius (a [[line (geometry)|line]]). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by [[Isaac Newton]], who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as [[LORAN]].

Later mathematicians introduced [[algebra|algebraic methods]], which transform a geometric problem into [[algebraic equation]]s. These methods were simplified by exploiting [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] inherent in the problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used [[transformation (geometry)|geometrical transformations]] such as [[inversive geometry|reflection in a circle]] to simplify the configuration of the given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using [[Lie sphere geometry]]) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.

Apollonius' problem has stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a [[sphere]] tangent to four given spheres—and [[higher dimension|beyond]] have been studied. The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. [[René Descartes]] gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles, now known as [[Descartes' theorem]]. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the [[Apollonian gasket]], which is one of the earliest [[fractal]]s to be described in print, and is important in [[number theory]] via [[Ford circles]] and the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method]].

== Statement of the problem ==

The general statement of Apollonius' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane, where an object may be a line, a point or a circle of any size.&lt;ref name="Dörrie 1965"&gt;{{cite book| author = Dörrie H| year = 1965| chapter = The Tangency Problem of Apollonius| title = 100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics: Their History and Solutions| publisher = Dover| location = New York| pages = 154–160 (§32)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coxeter_1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coolidge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coxeter greitzer"/&gt; These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning that they do not coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called ''Apollonius circles'', although the term is also used for [[circles of Apollonius|other types of circles]] associated with Apollonius.

The property of tangency is defined as follows. First, a point, line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to ''intersect'' if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be ''tangent''; the intersection point is called a ''tangent point'' or a ''point of tangency''. (The word "tangent" derives from the [[Latin]] [[participle|present participle]], ''tangens'', meaning "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines can be considered as tangent at a [[point at infinity]] in [[inversive geometry]] (see [[#Inversive methods|below]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coxeter, HSM|title=Introduction to Geometry|isbn=978-0-471-50458-0|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1969|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Needham, T|title=Visual Complex Analysis|isbn=978-0-19-853446-4|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2007|pages = 140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution circle may be either internally or externally tangent to each of the given circles. An ''external'' tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie on opposite sides of the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent line]] at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an ''internal'' tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure&amp;nbsp;1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.

Apollonius' problem can also be formulated as the problem of locating one or more points such that the ''differences'' of its distances to three given points equal three known values. Consider a solution circle of radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and three given circles of radii ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles, the distances between the center of the solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively. Therefore, differences in these distances are constants, such as {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; they depend only on the known radii of the given circles and not on the radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; of the solution circle, which cancels out. This second formulation of Apollonius' problem can be generalized to internally tangent solution circles (for which the center-center distance equals the difference of radii), by changing the corresponding differences of distances to sums of distances, so that the solution-circle radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; again cancels out. The re-formulation in terms of center-center distances is useful in the [[#Intersecting hyperbolas|solutions below]] of [[Adriaan van Roomen]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and also in [[hyperbolic positioning]] or trilateration, which is the task of locating a position from differences in distances to three known points. For example, navigation systems such as [[LORAN]] identify a receiver's position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three fixed positions, which correspond to the differences in distances to those transmitters.&lt;ref name="Hofmann-Wellenhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972"/&gt;

A rich repertoire of geometrical and algebraic methods have been developed to solve Apollonius' problem,&lt;ref name="altshiller-court_1961" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Althiller-Court N| year = 1961| title = The problem of Apollonius| journal = The Mathematics Teacher| volume = 54| pages = 444–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel-marie_1912" &gt;{{cite book| author = Gabriel-Marie F| year = 1912| title = Exercices de géométrie, comprenant l'exposé des méthodes géométriques et 2000 questions résolues| publisher = [[Maison A.

Although successful in solving Apollonius' problem, van Roomen's method has a drawback. A prized property in classical [[Euclidean geometry]] is the ability to solve problems using only a [[compass and straightedge construction|compass and a straightedge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Courant R, Robbins H | year = 1943| title = What is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = London| pages = 125–127, 161–162| isbn = 0-19-510519-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many constructions are impossible using only these tools, such as [[angle trisection|dividing an angle in three equal parts]]. However, many such "impossible" problems can be solved by intersecting curves such as hyperbolas, [[ellipse]]s and [[parabola]]s ([[conic section]]s). For example, [[doubling the cube]] (the problem of constructing a cube of twice the volume of a given cube) cannot be done using only a straightedge and compass, but [[Menaechmus]] showed that the problem can be solved by using the intersections of two [[parabola]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bold B| title = Famous problems of geometry and how to solve them| publisher = Dover Publications| year = 1982| pages = 29–30| isbn = 0-486-24297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, van Roomen's solution—which uses the intersection of two hyperbolas—did not determine if the problem satisfied the straightedge-and-compass property.

Van Roomen's friend [[François Viète]], who had urged van Roomen to work on Apollonius' problem in the first place, developed a method that used only compass and straightedge.&lt;ref name="viete_1970"&gt;{{cite book| author = Viète F. |author-link = François Viète| title = Francisci Vietae Opera mathematica | chapter = Apollonius Gallus.

Several other geometrical solutions to Apollonius' problem were developed in the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] (1811)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|Poncelet J-V]]|date=January 1811| title = Solutions de plusieurs problêmes de géométrie et de mécanique| journal = Correspondance sur l'École Impériale Polytechnique| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages = 271–273|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] (1814).&lt;ref name="gergonne_1814" &gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|Gergonne J]]| date = 1813–1814|title = Recherche du cercle qui en touche trois autres sur une sphère| journal = Ann.

== Solution methods ==

=== Intersecting hyperbolas ===

[[File:Apollonius hyperbolic no eqs black.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3: Two given circles (black) and a circle tangent to both (pink). The center-to-center distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equal {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively, so their difference is independent of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

The solution of [[Adriaan van Roomen]] (1596) is based on the intersection of two [[hyperbola]]s.&lt;ref name="van_roomen_1596"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van roomen by newton"/&gt; Let the given circles be denoted as ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Van Roomen solved the general problem by solving a simpler problem, that of finding the circles that are tangent to ''two'' given circles, such as ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. He noted that the center of a circle tangent to both given circles must lie on a [[hyperbola]] whose foci are the centers of the given circles. To understand this, let the radii of the solution circle and the two given circles be denoted as ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively (Figure&amp;nbsp;3). The distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; between the centers of the solution circle and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is either {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, depending on whether these circles are chosen to be externally or internally tangent, respectively. Similarly, the distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between the centers of the solution circle and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is either {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, again depending on their chosen tangency. Thus, the difference {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} between these distances is always a constant that is independent of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;. This property, of having a fixed difference between the distances to the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]], characterizes hyperbolas, so the possible centers of the solution circle lie on a hyperbola. A second hyperbola can be drawn for the pair of given circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the internal or external tangency of the solution and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; should be chosen consistently with that of the first hyperbola. An intersection of these two hyperbolas (if any) gives the center of a solution circle that has the chosen internal and external tangencies to the three given circles. The full set of solutions to Apollonius' problem can be found by considering all possible combinations of internal and external tangency of the solution circle to the three given circles.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1687) refined van Roomen's solution, so that the solution-circle centers were located at the intersections of a line with a circle.&lt;ref name="Newton_1687"/&gt; Newton formulates Apollonius' problem as a problem in [[trilateration]]: to locate a point '''Z''' from three given points '''A''', '''B''' and '''C''', such that the differences in distances from '''Z''' to the three given points have known values.&lt;ref name="Hoshen 1996"/&gt; These four points correspond to the center of the solution circle ('''Z''') and the centers of the three given circles ('''A''', '''B''' and '''C''').

[[File:Apollonius circle definition labels.svg|thumb|left|The set of points with a constant ratio of distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to two fixed points is a circle.]]

Instead of solving for the two hyperbolas, Newton constructs their [[conic section|directrix lines]] instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point '''Z''' to a focus '''A''' and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]. The two directrices intersect at a point '''T''', and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through '''T''' on which '''Z''' must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, '''Z''' also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a [[circle]] can be [[Circle#Apollonius circle|defined]] as the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of [[bipolar coordinates]].) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.

=== Viète's reconstruction ===

As described [[#Special cases|below]], Apollonius' problem has ten special cases, depending on the nature of the three given objects, which may be a circle ('''C'''), line ('''L''') or point ('''P'''). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as '''CCP'''.&lt;ref name="special cases" /&gt; Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and straightedge constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.&lt;ref name="Dörrie 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="viete_1970"/&gt;

[[File:Apollonius solution breathing nolabels.gif|thumb|right|Figure 4: Tangency between circles is preserved if their radii are changed by equal amounts. A pink solution circle must shrink or swell with an internally tangent circle (black circle on the right), while externally tangent circles (two black circles on left) do the opposite.]]

Viète began by solving the '''PPP''' case (three points) following the method of [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. From this, he derived a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] corresponding to the [[power of a point]] theorem, which he used to solve the '''LPP''' case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the '''LLL''' case (three lines) using the [[angle bisector theorem|angle bisectors]]. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, which he used to solve the '''LLP''' problem (two lines and a point). This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.

To solve the remaining problems, Viète exploited the fact that the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure&amp;nbsp;4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δ''r'', the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δ''r'', whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δ''r''. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.

Viète used this approach to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the '''CLL''' case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a '''LLP''' case. He then solved the '''CLP''' case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the '''CCL''' case into a '''CLP''' case. He then solved the '''CPP''' case (a circle and two points) and the '''CCP''' case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general '''CCC''' case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a '''CCP''' case.

=== Algebraic solutions ===

Apollonius' problem can be framed as a system of three equations for the center and radius of the solution circle.&lt;ref name="coaklay_1860"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Coaklay GW| year = 1860| title = Analytical Solutions of the Ten Problems in the Tangencies of Circles; and also of the Fifteen Problems in the Tangencies of Spheres| journal = The Mathematical Monthly| volume = 2| pages = 116–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the three given circles and any solution circle must lie in the same plane, their positions can be specified in terms of the (''x'', ''y'') [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of their centers. For example, the center positions of the three given circles may be written as (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas that of a solution circle can be written as (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;). Similarly, the radii of the given circles and a solution circle can be written as ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The requirement that a solution circle must exactly touch each of the three given circles can be expressed as three [[simultaneous equation|coupled]] [[quadratic equation]]s for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( x_{s} - x_{1} \right)^{2} +
\left( y_{s} - y_{1} \right)^{2} =
\left( r_{s} - s_{1} r_{1} \right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( x_{s} - x_{2} \right)^{2} +
\left( y_{s} - y_{2} \right)^{2} =
\left( r_{s} - s_{2} r_{2} \right)^{{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( x_{s} - x_{3} \right)^{2} +
\left( y_{s} - y_{3} \right)^{2} =
\left( r_{s} - s_{3} r_{3} \right)^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The three numbers ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the [[sides of an equation|right-hand side]], called signs, may equal ±1, and specify whether the desired solution circle should touch the corresponding given circle internally (''s'' = 1) or externally (''s'' = −1). For example, in Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 4, the pink solution is internally tangent to the medium-sized given circle on the right and externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left; if the given circles are ordered by radius, the signs for this solution are {{nowrap|"− + −"}}. Since the three signs may be chosen independently, there are eight possible sets of equations {{nowrap|(2 × 2 × 2 {{=}} 8)}}, each set corresponding to one of the eight types of solution circles.

The general system of three equations may be solved by the method of [[resultant]]s. When multiplied out, all three equations have {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the left-hand side, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the right-hand side. Subtracting one equation from another eliminates these quadratic terms; the remaining linear terms may be re-arranged to yield formulae for the coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;

x_{s} = M + N r_{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;

y_{s} = P + Q r_{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'' are known functions of the given circles and the choice of signs. Substitution of these formulae into one of the initial three equations gives a quadratic equation for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be solved by the [[quadratic formula]]. Substitution of the numerical value of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; into the linear formulae yields the corresponding values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The signs ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the right-hand sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[quadratic equation|quadratic]]. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a solution, with signs ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then so is (−''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;), with opposite signs −''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure&amp;nbsp;2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.

The two roots of any quadratic equation may be of three possible types: two different [[real number]]s, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of [[complex conjugate]] roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds to a pair of solutions that are related by [[Circle inversion#Circle inversion|circle inversion]], as described below (Figure&amp;nbsp;6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.&lt;ref name="bruen_1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pedoe_1970" &gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Daniel Pedoe|Pedoe D]]| year = 1970| title = The missing seventh circle| journal = Elemente der Mathematik| volume = 25| pages = 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lie sphere geometry ===

The same algebraic equations can be derived in the context of [[Lie sphere geometry]].&lt;ref name="zlobec_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zlobec BJ, Kosta NM | year = 2001| title = Configurations of Cycles and the Apollonius Problem| journal = [[Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics]]| volume = 31| pages = 725–744| doi = 10.1216/rmjm/1020171586| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector ''X'' = (''v'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w'', ''sr''), where '''c''' = (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the center of the circle, and ''r'' is its (non-negative) radius. If ''r'' is not zero, the sign ''s'' may be positive or negative; for visualization, ''s'' represents the [[curve orientation|orientation]] of the circle, with counterclockwise circles having a positive ''s'' and clockwise circles having a negative ''s''. The parameter ''w'' is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.

In this five-dimensional world, there is a [[bilinear form|bilinear]] product similar to the [[dot product]]:

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( X_{1}| X_{2} \right) :=
v_{1} w_{2} + v_{2} w_{1} + \mathbf{c}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{c}_{2} - s_{1} s_{2} r_{1} r_{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Lie quadric]] is defined as those vectors whose product with themselves (their [[quadratic form|square norm]]) is zero, (''X''|''X'') = 0. Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two vectors belonging to this quadric; the norm of their difference equals

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( X_{1} - X_{2}| X_{1} - X_{2} \right) =
2 \left( v_{1} - v_{2} \right) \left( w_{1} - w_{2} \right) +
\left( \mathbf{c}_{1} - \mathbf{c}_{2} \right) \cdot \left( \mathbf{c}_{1} - \mathbf{c}_{2} \right)
- \left( s_{1} r_{1} - s_{2} r_{2} \right)^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The product [[distributivity|distributes]] over addition and subtraction (more precisely, it is [[bilinear form|bilinear]]):

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( X_{1} - X_{2}| X_{1} - X_{2} \right) = \left( X_{1}| X_{1} \right) - 2 \left( X_{1}| X_{2} \right) + \left( X_{2}| X_{2} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Since (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 (both belong to the Lie quadric) and since ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for circles, the product of any two such vectors on the quadric equals

: &lt;math&gt;

- 2 \left( X_{1}| X_{2} \right) =
\left| \mathbf{c}_{1} - \mathbf{c}_{2} \right|^{2}
- \left( s_{1} r_{1} - s_{2} r_{2} \right)^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical bars sandwiching {{nowrap|'''c'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − '''c'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} represent the length of that difference vector, i.e., the [[Euclidean norm]]. This formula shows that if two quadric vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are orthogonal (perpendicular) to one another—that is, if (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;){{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}0—then their corresponding circles are tangent. For if the two signs ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the same (i.e. the circles have the same "orientation"), the circles are internally tangent; the distance between their centers equals the ''difference'' in the radii

: &lt;math&gt;

\left| \mathbf{c}_{1} - \mathbf{c}_{2} \right|^{2} =
\left( r_{1} - r_{2} \right)^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if the two signs ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are different (i.e. the circles have opposite "orientations"), the circles are externally tangent; the distance between their centers equals the ''sum'' of the radii

: &lt;math&gt;

\left| \mathbf{c}_{1} - \mathbf{c}_{2} \right|^{2}
= \left( r_{1} + r_{2} \right)^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, Apollonius' problem can be re-stated in Lie geometry as a problem of finding perpendicular vectors on the Lie quadric; specifically, the goal is to identify solution vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; that belong to the Lie quadric and are also orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the given circles.

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( X_{\mathrm{sol}}| X_{\mathrm{sol}} \right) = \left( X_{\mathrm{sol}}| X_{1} \right) = \left( X_{\mathrm{sol}}| X_{2} \right) = \left( X_{\mathrm{sol}}| X_{3} \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from [[linear algebra]] on the maximum number of [[linearly independent]], simultaneously perpendicular vectors. This gives another way to calculate the maximum number of solutions and extend the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.&lt;ref name="zlobec_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knight_2005" /&gt;

=== Inversive methods ===

[[File:Inversion illustration1.svg|right|thumb|Figure 5: Inversion in a circle. The point ''P''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the inverse of point ''P'' with respect to the circle.]]

A natural setting for problem of Apollonius is [[inversive geometry]].&lt;ref name="coxeter greitzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bruen_1983"/&gt; The basic strategy of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius problem that is simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. [[inversive geometry|Circle inversion]] has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the [[Euclidean plane isometry|Euclidean plane isometries]]; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely [[Translation (mathematics)|shift]], [[Coordinate rotation|rotate]], and [[Reflection (mathematics)|mirror]] the original problem.

Inversion in a circle with center '''O''' and radius ''R'' consists of the following operation (Figure&amp;nbsp;5): every point '''P''' is mapped into a new point '''P'''' such that '''O''', '''P''', and '''P'''' are collinear, and the product of the distances of '''P''' and '''P'''' to the center '''O''' equal the radius ''R'' squared

: &lt;math&gt;

\overline{\mathbf{OP}} \cdot \overline{\mathbf{OP^{\prime}}} = R^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if '''P''' lies outside the circle, then '''P'''' lies within, and vice versa. When '''P''' is the same as '''O''', the inversion is said to send '''P''' to infinity. (In [[complex analysis]], "infinity" is defined in terms of the [[Riemann sphere]].) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles are always transformed into lines and circles, and points are always transformed into points. Circles are generally transformed into other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes through the center of the inversion circle, it is transformed into a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it is transformed into itself.

Circle inversions correspond to a subset of [[Möbius transformation]]s on the [[Riemann sphere]]. The planar Apollonius problem can be transferred to the sphere by an [[stereographic projection|inverse stereographic projection]]; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones described below.&lt;ref name="salmon_1879"&gt;{{cite book| author = Salmon G| year = 1879| title = A Treatise on Conic Sections, Containing an Account of Some of the Most Important Modern Algebraic and Geometric Methods| publisher = Longmans, Green and Co.| location = London| pages = 110–115, 291–292| isbn = 0-8284-0098-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairs of solutions by inversion ===

[[File:Apollonius problem radical center.svg|thumb|right|Figure 6: A conjugate pair of solutions to Apollonius' problem (pink circles), with given circles in black.]]

Solutions to Apollonius' problem generally occur in pairs; for each solution circle, there is a conjugate solution circle (Figure&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name="Dörrie 1965"/&gt; One solution circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa. For example, in Figure&amp;nbsp;6, one solution circle (pink, upper left) encloses two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate solution (also pink, lower right) encloses that third given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate solution circles are related by [[inversive geometry|inversion]], by the following argument.

In general, any three distinct circles have a unique circle—the [[Power center (geometry)|radical circle]]—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; the center of that circle is the [[power center (geometry)|radical center]] of the three circles.&lt;ref name="coxeter greitzer"&gt;{{cite book| title = Geometry Revisited| author = [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter HSM]], [[S. L. Greitzer|Greitzer SL]]| year = 1967| publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA]]| location = [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]| isbn = 978-0-88385-619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For illustration, the orange circle in Figure&amp;nbsp;6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. [[inversive geometry|Inversion]] in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure&amp;nbsp;6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).

==== Inversion to an annulus ====

If two of the three given circles do not intersect, a center of inversion can be chosen so that those two given circles become [[concentric]].&lt;ref name="coxeter_1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bruen_1983"/&gt; Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure&amp;nbsp;7), the solutions do ''not'' enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure&amp;nbsp;8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the [[#Algebraic solutions|algebraic solution]].

[[File:Apollonius annulus no eqs black.svg|thumb|left|Figure 7: A solution circle (pink) in the first family lies between concentric given circles (black). Twice the solution radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; equals the difference {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''outer''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''inner''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the inner and outer radii, while twice its center distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; equals their sum.]]

[[File:Apollonius annulus2 no eqs black.svg|thumb|left|Figure 8: A solution circle (pink) in the second family encloses the inner given circle (black). Twice the solution radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; equals the sum {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''outer''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''inner''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the inner and outer radii, while twice its center distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; equals their difference.]]

When two of the given circles are concentric, Apollonius' problem can be solved easily using a method of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]].&lt;ref name="gauss_1810" /&gt; The radii of the three given circles are known, as is the distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;non&lt;/sub&gt; from the common concentric center to the non-concentric circle (Figure&amp;nbsp;7). The solution circle can be determined from its radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, the angle θ, and the distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; from its center to the common concentric center and the center of the non-concentric circle, respectively. The radius and distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are known (Figure&amp;nbsp;7), and the distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ± ''r''&lt;sub&gt;non&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on whether the solution circle is internally or externally tangent to the non-concentric circle. Therefore, by the [[law of cosines]],

: &lt;math&gt;

\cos \theta = \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}^{2} + d_{\mathrm{non}}^{2} - d_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}{2 d_{\mathrm{s}} d_{\mathrm{non}}} \equiv C_{\pm}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, a new constant ''C'' has been defined for brevity, with the subscript indicating whether the solution is externally or internally tangent. A simple trigonometric rearrangement yields the four solutions

: &lt;math&gt;

\theta = \pm 2 \ \mathrm{atan}\left( \sqrt{\frac{1 - C}{1 + C}} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula represents four solutions, corresponding to the two choices of the sign of θ, and the two choices for ''C''. The remaining four solutions can be obtained by the same method, using the substitutions for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; indicated in Figure&amp;nbsp;8. Thus, all eight solutions of the general Apollonius problem can be found by this method.

Any initial two disjoint given circles can be rendered concentric as follows. The [[radical axis]] of the two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points '''P''' and '''Q''' on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on '''P''' and '''Q''' and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point '''F''' renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from '''F''' and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent to a set of [[Apollonian circles]], forming a [[bipolar coordinate system]].

==== Resizing and inversion ====

The usefulness of [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] can be increased significantly by resizing.&lt;ref name="johnson_1929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ogilvy_1969"/&gt; As noted in [[#Viète's reconstruction|Viète's reconstruction]], the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized so that they are tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the [[#Inversion to an annulus|method for inverting to an annulus]] can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.

===== Shrinking one given circle to a point =====

In the first approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk to a point '''P'''.&lt;ref name="johnson_1929"&gt;{{cite book| author = Johnson RA| year = 1960| title = Advanced Euclidean Geometry: An Elementary treatise on the geometry of the Triangle and the Circle| edition = reprint of 1929 edition by Houghton Mifflin| publisher = Dover Publications| location = New York| pages = 117–121 (Apollonius' problem), 121–128 (Casey's and Hart's theorems)| isbn = 978-0-486-46237-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the '''CCP''' [[Special cases of Apollonius' problem#Type 7: Two circles, one point|limiting case]], which is the problem of finding a solution circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point '''P'''. Inversion in a circle centered on '''P''' transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal [[homothetic center]]s of the two circles. Re-inversion in '''P''' and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.

===== Resizing two given circles to tangency =====

In the second approach, the radii of the given circles are modified appropriately by an amount Δ''r'' so that two of them are tangential (touching).&lt;ref name="ogilvy_1969" &gt;{{cite book| last = Ogilvy|first= C. S. | authorlink = C. Stanley Ogilvy |year = 1990| title = Excursions in Geometry| publisher = Dover| isbn = 0-486-26530-7| pages = 48–51 (Apollonius' problem), 60 (extension to tangent spheres)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of [[inversion in a circle]] that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δ''r'' produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.

=== Gergonne's solution ===

[[File:Apollonius problem Gergonne tangent lines.svg|thumb|right|Figure 9: The two tangent lines of the two tangent points of a given circle intersect on the [[radical axis]] ''R'' (red line) of the two solution circles (pink). The three points of intersection on ''R'' are the poles of the lines connecting the blue tangent points in each given circle (black).]]

Gergonne's approach is to consider the solution circles in pairs.&lt;ref name="Dörrie 1965"/&gt; Let a pair of solution circles be denoted as ''C''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; (the pink circles in Figure&amp;nbsp;6), and let their tangent points with the three given circles be denoted as '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Gergonne's solution aims to locate these six points, and thus solve for the two solution circles.

Gergonne's insight was that if a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could be constructed such that '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with the given circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (Figure&amp;nbsp;6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that contained '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. To construct a line such as ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points for each of the three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the [[power center (geometry)|radical center]] '''G''' lies on all three lines (Figure&amp;nbsp;6).

To locate a second point on the lines ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Gergonne noted a [[reciprocation (geometry)|reciprocal relationship]] between those lines and the [[radical axis]] ''R'' of the solution circles, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; drawn at its tangent points '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the [[pole (geometry)|pole]] point of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis ''R'' of the solution circles, by definition (Figure&amp;nbsp;9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; lies on ''R'', the pole of ''R'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must conversely lie on ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, if we can construct ''R'', we can find its pole '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, giving the needed second point on ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (Figure&amp;nbsp;10).

[[File:Apollonius problem Gergonne poles.svg|thumb|left|Figure 10: The poles (red points) of the radical axis ''R'' in the three given circles (black) lie on the green lines connecting the tangent points. These lines may be constructed from the poles and the [[power center (geometry)|radical center]] (orange).]]

Gergonne found the radical axis ''R'' of the unknown solution circles as follows. Any pair of circles has two [[homothetic center|centers of similarity]]; these two points are the two possible intersections of two tangent lines to the two circles. Therefore, the three given circles have six centers of similarity, two for each distinct pair of given circles. Remarkably, these six points lie on four lines, three points on each line; moreover, each line corresponds to the [[radical axis]] of a potential pair of solution circles. To show this, Gergonne considered lines through corresponding points of tangency on two of the given circles, e.g., the line defined by '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the line defined by '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/'''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be a center of similitude for the two circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; then, '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/'''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Homothetic center#Tangent circles and antihomologous points|are pairs of antihomologous points]], and their lines intersect at '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It follows, therefore, that the products of distances are equal

: &lt;math&gt;

\overline{X_{3}A_{1}} \cdot \overline{X_{3}A_{2}} = \overline{X_{3}B_{1}} \cdot \overline{X_{3}B_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lies on the radical axis of the two solution circles. The same argument can be applied to the other pairs of circles, so that three centers of similitude for the given three circles must lie on the radical axes of pairs of solution circles.

In summary, the desired line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by two points: the radical center '''G''' of the three given circles and the pole in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of one of the four lines connecting the homothetic centers. Finding the same pole in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which one pair of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; does not intersect its circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''k'', there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.

===Intersection theory===
The techniques of modern [[algebraic geometry]], and in particular [[intersection theory]], can be used to solve Apollonius's problem.  In this approach, the problem is reinterpreted as a statement about circles in the [[complex projective plane]].  Solutions involving complex numbers are allowed and degenerate situations are counted with multiplicity.  When this is done, there are always eight solutions to the problem.&lt;ref name="eisenbud_harris_2016"&gt;Eisenbud, David and Harris, Joe, ''3264 and All That: A Second Course in Algebraic Geometry''. Cambridge University Press, 2016. {{isbn|978-1107602724}}. pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every quadratic equation in {{math|''X''}}, {{math|''Y''}}, and {{math|''Z''}} determines a unique conic, its vanishing locus.  Conversely, every conic in the complex projective plane has an equation, and that equation is unique up to an overall scaling factor (because rescaling an equation does not change its vanishing locus).  Therefore, the set of all conics may be parametrized by five-dimensional projective space {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the correspondence is
:&lt;math&gt;\{[X:Y:Z] \in \mathbf{P}^2 \colon AX^2 + BXY + CY^2 + DXZ + EYZ + FZ^2 = 0\} \leftrightarrow [A:B:C:D:E:F] \in \mathbf{P}^5.&lt;/math&gt;
A ''circle'' in the complex projective plane is defined to be a conic that passes through the two points {{math|1=''O''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = [1 : ''i'' : 0]}} and {{math|1=''O''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; = [1 : &amp;minus;''i'' : 0]}}, where {{math|''i''}} denotes a square root of {{math|&amp;minus;1}}.  The points {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called the ''circular points''.  The [[projective variety]] of all circles is the subvariety of {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}} consisting of those points which correspond to conics passing through the circular points.  Substituting the circular points into the equation for a generic conic yields the two equations
:&lt;math&gt;A + Bi - C = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A - Bi - C = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the sum and difference of these equations shows that it is equivalent to impose the conditions
:&lt;math&gt;A = C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, the variety of all circles is a three-dimensional linear subspace of {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  After rescaling and [[completing the square]], these equations also demonstrate that every conic passing through the circular points has an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;(X - aZ)^2 + (Y - bZ)^2 = r^2Z^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the homogenization of the usual equation of a circle in the affine plane.  Therefore, studying circles in the above sense is nearly equivalent to studying circles in the conventional sense.  The only difference is that the above sense permits degenerate circles which are the union of two lines.  The non-degenerate circles are called ''smooth circles'', while the degenerate ones are called ''[[singular point of a curve|singular]] circles.''  There are two types of singular circles.  One is the union of the line at infinity {{math|1=''Z'' = 0}} with another line in the projective plane (possibly the line at infinity again), and the other is union of two lines in the projective plane, one through each of the two circular points.  These are the limits of smooth circles as the radius {{math|''r''}} tends to {{math|+∞}} and {{math|0}}, respectively.  In the latter case, no point on either of the two lines has real coordinates except for the origin {{math|[0 : 0 : 1]}}.

Let {{math|''D''}} be a fixed smooth circle.  If {{math|''C''}} is any other circle, then, by the definition of a circle, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} intersect at the circular points {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Because {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} are conics, [[Bézout's theorem]] implies {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} intersect in four points total, when those points are counted with the proper [[intersection multiplicity]].  That is, there are four points of intersection {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''P''}}, and {{math|''Q''}}, but some of these points might collide.  Appolonius' problem is concerned with the situation where {{math|1=''P'' = ''Q''}}, meaning that the intersection multiplicity at that point is {{math|2}}; if {{math|''P''}} is also equal to a circular point, this should be interpreted as the intersection multiplicity being {{math|3}}.

Let {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the variety of circles tangent to {{math|''D''}}.  This variety is a quadric cone in the {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} of all circles.  To see this, consider the [[incidence correspondence]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \{ (r, C) \in D \times \mathbf{P}^3 \colon C\ \text{is tangent to}\ D\ \text{at}\ r \}.&lt;/math&gt;
For a curve that is the vanishing locus of a single equation {{math|1=''f'' = 0}}, the condition that the curve meets {{math|''D''}} at {{math|''r''}} with multiplicity {{math|''m''}} means that the [[Taylor series]] expansion of {{math|''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} vanishes to order {{math|''m''}} at {{math|''r''}}; it is therefore {{math|''m''}} linear conditions on the coefficients of {{math|''f''}}.  This shows that, for each {{math|''r''}}, the fiber of {{math|&amp;Phi;}} over {{math|''r''}} is a {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} cut out by two linear equations in the space of circles.  Consequently, {{math|&amp;Phi;}} is irreducible of dimension {{math|2}}.  Since it is possible to exhibit a circle that is tangent to {{math|''D''}} at only a single point, a generic element of {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be tangent at only a single point.  Therefore, the projection {{math|&amp;Phi; &amp;rarr; '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} sending {{math|(''r'', ''C'')}} to {{math|''C''}} is a [[birational morphism]].  It follows that the image of {{math|&amp;Phi;}}, which is {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is also irreducible and two dimensional.

To determine the shape of {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, fix two distinct circles {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}, not necessarily tangent to {{math|''D''}}.  These two circles determine a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]], meaning a line {{math|''L''}} in the {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} of circles.  If the equations of {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}}, respectively, then the points on {{math|''L''}} correspond to the circles whose equations are {{math|''Sf'' + ''Tg''}}, where {{math|[''S'' : ''T'']}} is a point of {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The points where {{math|''L''}} meets {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are precisely the circles in the pencil that are tangent to {{math|''D''}}.

There are two possibilities for the number of points of intersections.  One is that either {{math|''f''}} or {{math|''g''}}, say {{math|''f''}}, is the equation for {{math|''D''}}.  In this case, {{math|''L''}} is a line through {{math|''D''}}.  If {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}} is tangent to {{math|''D''}}, then so is every circle in the pencil, and therefore {{math|''L''}} is contained in {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The other possibility is that neither {{math|''f''}} nor {{math|''g''}} is the equation for {{math|''D''}}.  In this case, the function {{math|(''f'' / ''g'')&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a quotient of quadratics, neither of which vanishes identically.  Therefore, it vanishes at two points and has [[pole and polar|poles]] at two points.  These are the points in {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''D''}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''D''}}, respectively, counted with multiplicity and with the circular points deducted.  The rational function determines a morphism {{math|''D'' &amp;rarr; '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} of degree two.  The fiber over {{math|[''S'' : ''T''] ∈ '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the set of points {{math|''P''}} for which {{math|1=''f''(''P'')''T'' = ''g''(''P'')''S''}}.  These are precisely the points at which the circle whose equation is {{math|''Tf'' − ''Sg''}} meets {{math|''D''}}.  The [[branch point]]s of this morphism are the circles tangent to {{math|''D''}}.  By the [[Riemann–Hurwitz formula]], there are precisely two branch points, and therefore {{math|''L''}} meets {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in two points.  Together, these two possibilities for the intersection of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} demonstrate that {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a quadric cone.  All such cones in {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the same up to a change of coordinates, so this completely determines the shape of {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

To conclude the argument, let {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} be three circles.  If the intersection {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is finite, then it has degree {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8}}, and therefore there are eight solutions to the problem of Apollonius, counted with multiplicity.  To prove that the intersection is generically finite, consider the incidence correspondence
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \{(D_1, D_2, D_3, C) \in (\mathbf{P}^3)^4 \colon C\ \text{is tangent to all}\ D_i\}.&lt;/math&gt;
There is a morphism which projects {{math|&amp;Psi;}} onto its final factor of {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The fiber over {{math|''C''}} is {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  This has dimension {{math|6}}, so {{math|&amp;Psi;}} has dimension {{math|9}}.  Because {{math|('''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} also has dimension {{math|9}}, the generic fiber of the projection from {{math|&amp;Psi;}} to the first three factors cannot have positive dimension.  This proves that generically, there are eight solutions counted with multiplicity.  Since it is possible to exhibit a configuration where the eight solutions are distinct, the generic configuration must have all eight solutions distinct.

==Radii==

In the generic problem with eight solution circles, The reciprocals of the radii of four of the solution circles sum to the same value as do the reciprocals of the radii of the other four solution circles.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad R. Stevanovic, Predrag B. Petrovic, and Marina M. Stevanovic, 
"Radii of circles in Apollonius' problem", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 17 (2017), 359--372:  Theorem 1.    http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2017volume17/FG201735.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special cases ==

=== Ten combinations of points, circles, and lines ===
{{main|Special cases of Apollonius' problem}}

Apollonius problem is to construct one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either '''C''', '''L''', or '''P''', to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively ([[#Apollonius problem types|Table 1]]).&lt;ref name="special cases" /&gt; As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as '''CLP'''.

Some of these [[special case]]s are much easier to solve than the general case of three given circles. The two simplest cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points ('''PPP''') or tangent to three lines ('''LLL'''), which were solved first by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. For example, the '''PPP''' problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the [[perpendicular bisector]] line of any two. Hence, the center is the point of intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the '''LLL''' case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general '''LLL''' problem.

Points and lines may be viewed as special cases of circles; a point can be considered as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines may be viewed as [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]s of the general problem.&lt;ref name="special cases"&gt;{{cite book| author = Altshiller-Court N| year = 1952| title = College Geometry: An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle| edition = 2nd edition, revised and enlarged| publisher = Barnes and Noble| location = New York| pages = 222–227| isbn = 978-0-486-45805-2}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Robin Hartshorne|Hartshorne, Robin]]| year = 2000| title = Geometry: Euclid and Beyond| publisher = Springer Verlag| location = New York|isbn= 978-0-387-98650-0|pages= 346–355, 496, 499}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author = Rouché, Eugène|author2=Ch de Comberousse|year = 1883| title = Traité de géométrie| edition = 5th edition, revised and augmented|publisher= Gauthier-Villars|location = Paris| pages = 252–256|oclc= 252013267|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bruen_1983"/&gt; These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.

=== Number of solutions ===

[[File:Apollonius no solutions black.svg|thumb|right|Figure 11: An Apollonius problem with no solutions. A solution circle (pink) must cross the dashed given circle (black) to touch both of the other given circles (also black).]]

The problem of counting the number of solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of [[enumerative geometry]].&lt;ref name="bruen_1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dreschler sterz"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Acta Mathematica Universitatis Comenianae|volume=68|issue=1|year=1999|pages=37–47|title=Apollonius' contact problem in ''n''-space in view of enumerative geometry|vauthors=Dreschler K, Sterz U |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/AMUC/_vol-68/_no_1/_drechsl/drechsle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table&amp;nbsp;1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure&amp;nbsp;11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then ''any'' circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a [[hyperbola]], as used in [[#Intersecting hyperbolas|one solution]] to Apollonius' problem.

An exhaustive enumeration of the number of solutions for all possible configurations of three given circles, points or lines was first undertaken by Muirhead in 1896,&lt;ref name="muirhead_1896" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Muirhead RF| year = 1896| title = On the Number and nature of the Solutions of the Apollonian Contact Problem| journal = Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society| volume = 14| pages = 135–147, attached figures 44–114| doi = 10.1017/S0013091500031898}}&lt;/ref&gt; although earlier work had been done by Stoll&lt;ref name="stoll_1876"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Stoll V| year = 1876| title = Zum Problem des Apollonius| journal = Mathematische Annalen| volume = 6| pages = 613–632| doi = 10.1007/BF01443201| issue = 4|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Study.&lt;ref name="study_1897"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Study E| year = 1897| title = Das Apollonische Problem| journal = Mathematische Annalen| volume = 49| pages = 497–542| doi = 10.1007/BF01444366| issue = 3–4|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muirhead's work was incomplete; it was extended in 1974&lt;ref name="fitzgerald_1974"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Fitz-Gerald JM| year = 1974| title = A Note on a Problem of Apollonius| journal = Journal of Geometry| volume = 5| pages = 15–26| doi = 10.1007/BF01954533}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a definitive enumeration, with 33 distinct cases, was published in 1983.&lt;ref name="bruen_1983"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bruen A, Fisher JC, Wilker JB | year = 1983| title = Apollonius by Inversion| journal = Mathematics Magazine| volume = 56| pages = 97–103| doi = 10.2307/2690380| jstor = 2690380| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although solutions to Apollonius' problem generally occur in pairs related by [[#Pairs of solutions by inversion|inversion]], an odd number of solutions is possible in some cases, e.g., the single solution for '''PPP''', or when one or three of the given circles are themselves solutions.

=== Mutually tangent given circles: Soddy's circles and Descartes' theorem ===

If the three given circles are mutually tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself and to the other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure&amp;nbsp;12) correspond to the [[incircle and excircles of a triangle|inscribed]] and [[circumscribed circle]]s, and are called ''Soddy's circles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[David Eppstein|Eppstein D]]| date=1 January 2001| title = Tangent Spheres and Triangle Centers| journal = The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 108| pages = 63–66| doi = 10.2307/2695679| issn = 0002-9890| issue = 1| jstor = 2695679| arxiv = math/9909152}}&lt;/ref&gt; This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the '''four coins problem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Oldknow A| date=1 April 1996| title = The Euler-Gergonne-Soddy Triangle of a Triangle| journal = The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 103| pages = 319–329| doi = 10.2307/2975188| issn = 0002-9890| issue = 4| jstor = 2975188}}&lt;br&gt;

Either Soddy circle, when taken together with the three given circles, produces a set of four circles that are mutually tangent at six points. The radii of these four circles are related by an equation known as [[Descartes' theorem]]. In a 1643 letter to Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[René Descartes|Descartes R]], ''Œuvres de Descartes, Correspondance IV'', (C. Adam and P. Tannery, Eds.), Paris: Leopold Cert 1901. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] showed that

: &lt;math&gt;

\left( k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{s} \right)^{2} = 2\, \left( k_{1}^{2} + k_{2}^{2} + k_{3}^{2} + k_{s}^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[curvature]] and radius of the solution circle, respectively, and similarly for the curvatures ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and radii ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the three given circles. For every set of four mutually tangent circles, there is a second set of four mutually tangent circles that are tangent at the same six points.&lt;ref name="coxeter_1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beecroft_1842" /&gt;

The first stanza describes Soddy's circles, whereas the second stanza gives Descartes' theorem. In Soddy's poem, two circles are said to "kiss" if they are tangent, whereas the term "bend" refers to the curvature ''k'' of the circle.

Sundry extensions of Descartes' theorem have been derived by [[Daniel Pedoe]].&lt;ref name="pedoe_1967"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Daniel Pedoe|Pedoe D]]| date=1 June 1967| title = On a theorem in geometry| journal = Amer.

== Generalizations ==

Apollonius' problem can be extended to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name="steiner_1826" /&gt; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special case in which the crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.&lt;ref name="zlobec_2001" /&gt;

[[File:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|left|Figure 13: A symmetrical Apollonian gasket, also called the Leibniz packing, after its inventor [[Gottfried Leibniz]].]]

Apollonius' problem can be extended from the plane to the [[sphere]] and other [[quadric surface|quadratic surfaces]]. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of [[spherical cap]]s) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere.&lt;ref name="gergonne_1814" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carnot_1803b" &gt;{{cite book| author = [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot L]]| year = 1803| title = Géométrie de position| publisher = Unknown publisher| location = Paris| pages = 415, §356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanson_1855" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Vannson| year = 1855| title = Contact des cercles sur la sphère, par la geométrie| journal = [[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]]| volume = XIV| pages = 55–71|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spherical problem can be rendered into a corresponding planar problem using [[stereographic projection]]. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by [[Charles Dupin]].&lt;ref name="altshiller-court_1961" /&gt;

By solving Apollonius' problem repeatedly to find the inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an [[Apollonian gasket]], also known as a ''Leibniz packing'' or an ''Apollonian packing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kasner E, Supnick F |date=December 1943| title = The Apollonian Packing of Circles| journal = Proc.

The configuration of a circle tangent to ''four'' circles in the plane has special properties, which have been elucidated by Larmor (1891)&lt;ref name="larmor_1891"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Larmor A| year = 1891| title = Contacts of Systems of Circles| journal = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society| volume = 23| pages = 136–157| doi = 10.1112/plms/s1-23.1.135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lachlan (1893).&lt;ref name="lachlan_1893"&gt;{{cite book| author = Lachlan R| year = 1893| title = An elementary treatise on modern pure geometry| publisher = Macmillan| location = London| pages = §383–396, pp. 244–251| isbn = 1-4297-0050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a configuration is also the basis for [[Casey's theorem]],&lt;ref name="casey_1881" /&gt; itself a generalization of [[Ptolemy's theorem]].&lt;ref name="johnson_1929" /&gt;

The extension of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, the problem of finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods.&lt;ref name="altshiller-court_1961" /&gt; For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency.&lt;ref name="ogilvy_1969" /&gt; Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by [[Pierre de Fermat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre de Fermat|de Fermat P]], ''Varia opera mathematica'', p. 74, Tolos, 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.&lt;ref name="fermat_problem_solutions" &gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Leonhard Euler|Euler L]]| year = 1810| title = Solutio facilis problematis, quo quaeritur sphaera, quae datas quatuor sphaeras utcunque dispositas contingat| journal = Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de St.-Pétersbourg| volume = 2| pages = 17–28| url = http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E733.pdf|format=PDF|language=la}} Reprinted in Euler's ''Opera Omnia'', series 1, volume 26, pp. 334–343.&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot L]]| year = 1803| title = Géométrie de position| publisher = Imprimerie de Crapelet, chez J.

Apollonius' problem can even be extended to ''d'' dimensions, to construct the [[hypersphere]]s tangent to a given set of {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}} hyperspheres.&lt;ref name="dreschler sterz"/&gt; Following the publication of [[Frederick Soddy]]'s re-derivation of the [[Descartes theorem]] in 1936, several people solved (independently) the mutually tangent case corresponding to Soddy's circles in ''d'' dimensions.&lt;ref name="gossett_1937" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Gossett T| year = 1937| title = The Kiss Precise| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 139| page = 62| doi = 10.1038/139062a0| issue=3506| bibcode = 1937Natur.139Q..62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The principal application of Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is [[hyperbolic positioning|hyperbolic trilateration]], which seeks to determine a position from the ''differences'' in distances to at least three points.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Schmidt, RO| year = 1972| title = A new approach to geometry of range difference location| journal = IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems| volume = AES-8| pages = 821–835| doi = 10.1109/TAES.1972.309614| issue = 6| bibcode = 1972ITAES...8..821S}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in [[World War I]] to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions,&lt;ref name="altshiller-court_1961" /&gt; and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the [[Decca Navigator System]] and [[LORAN]].&lt;ref name="Hofmann-Wellenhof"&gt;{{cite book|title=Navigation: Principles of Positioning and Guidance|vauthors=Hofmann-Wellenhof B, Legat K, Wieser M, Lichtenegger H |publisher= Springer|year= 2003|isbn=978-3-211-00828-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] signal at four receiving stations. This [[multilateration]] problem is equivalent to the three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to [[global navigation satellite systems]] (see [[GPS#Geometric interpretation]]).&lt;ref name="Hoshen 1996" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Hoshen J| year = 1996| title = The GPS Equations and the Problem of Apollonius| journal = IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems| volume = 32| pages = 1116–1124| doi = 10.1109/7.532270| issue = 3| bibcode = 1996ITAES..32.1116H}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the [[speed of sound]] varies with direction (i.e., the [[transmission medium]] not [[isotropic]]).&lt;ref name="spiesberger_2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Spiesberger, JL| year = 2004| title = Geometry of locating sounds from differences in travel time: Isodiachrons| journal = [[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] | volume = 116| pages =3168–3177| doi = 10.1121/1.1804625| issue = 5| bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.3168S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollonius' problem has other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] used his solution of Apollonius' problem to construct an orbit in [[celestial mechanics]] from the center of attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous [[velocity]].&lt;ref name="altshiller-court_1961" /&gt; The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method]] of [[analytic number theory]] to construct [[Hans Rademacher]]'s contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an [[infinite set]] of [[Ford circle]]s each of which touches several others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Tom M.

'''Proof School''' is a school in San Francisco for pupils who love mathematics. The school opened in the fall of 2015 with 45 students in grades 6–10.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Bizjournals.com_July_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2014/10/31/stem-education-math-skills-add-up-at-proof-school.html |title=Math skills add up at Proof School – San Francisco Business Times |newspaper=Bizjournals.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 94.4 students in grades 6–12 are enrolled in Proof School for the academic year (2018–2019).

==Academics==

Proof School is a full-curriculum day school that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and problem solving. The school is accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

The school year is divided into 5 'blocks', each of which consist of 6 normal academic weeks and a build week.

Each student has 5 courses: 4 'morning' courses that vary across grades, and a math class. The morning courses meet twice a week: once for 70 minutes, and once for 90 minutes. The math courses meet for two hours and ten minutes every day. 

The (non-post-calculus) math classes focus on a different subject each block: Block 1 is Combinatorics, Block 2 is Algebra, Block 3 is Geometry, Block 4 is Algebra and Pre-Calculus, and Block 5 is Number Theory.

'''Robert Finn''' (born August 8, 1922) is an American mathematician.

==Biography==
Finn was born in [[Buffalo, New York]]. He received in 1951 his PhD from [[Syracuse University]] under [[Abe Gelbart]] with the thesis ''On some properties of the solution of a class of non-linear partial differential equations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=25361}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a postdoc he was in 1953 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and in 1953/54 at the Institute for Hydrodynamics at the [[University of Maryland]]. He became in 1954 an assistant professor at the [[University of Southern California]] and in 1956 an associate professor at [[California Institute of Technology]]. Since 1959 he has been a professor at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;biographical information from ''American Men and Women of Science'', Thomson Gale 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his career Finn did research on [[minimal surface]]s and [[quasiconformal mapping]]s and later in his career on mathematical problems of hydrodynamics, such as mathematically rigorous treatments of capillary action. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Bonn]] and several other universities. He was an exchange scientist in 1978 at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] and in 1987 at the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR]]. In 1994 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]]. For the academic years 1958/58 und 1965/66 he held [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s. Since 1979 he has been an editor of the ''[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]]''.

Schönhage–Strassen improves on this by using negacyclic convolutions.]]
The '''Schönhage–Strassen algorithm''' is an asymptotically fast [[multiplication algorithm]] for large [[integer]]s. It was developed by [[Arnold Schönhage]] and [[Volker Strassen]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="schönhage"&gt;A. Schönhage and V. Strassen, "Schnelle Multiplikation großer Zahlen", ''Computing'' '''7''' (1971), pp. 281–292.&lt;/ref&gt; The run-time [[bit complexity]] is, in [[Big O notation]],&lt;math&gt;O(n \cdot \log n \cdot \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt;  for two ''n''-digit numbers. The algorithm uses recursive [[Fast Fourier transform]]s in [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] with 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;+1 elements, a specific type of [[Discrete Fourier transform (general)#Number-theoretic transform|number theoretic transform]].

The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm was the asymptotically fastest multiplication method known from 1971 until 2007, when a new method, [[Fürer's algorithm]], was announced with lower asymptotic complexity;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fürer, "[http://www.cse.psu.edu/~furer/Papers/mult.pdf Faster integer multiplication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425232048/http://www.cse.psu.edu/~furer/Papers/mult.pdf |date=2013-04-25 }}", STOC 2007 Proceedings, pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Fürer's algorithm currently only achieves an advantage for astronomically large values and is not used in practice.

In practice the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as [[Karatsuba multiplication|Karatsuba]] and [[Toom–Cook multiplication]] for numbers beyond 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (10,000 to 40,000 decimal digits).&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Van Meter and Kohei M.

Applications of the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm include [[mathematical empiricism]], such as the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] and computing [[Approximations of π|approximations of ''π'']], as well as practical applications such as [[Kronecker substitution]], in which multiplication of polynomials with integer coefficients can be efficiently reduced to large integer multiplication; this is used in practice by GMP-ECM for [[Lenstra elliptic curve factorization]].&lt;ref name="Gaudry"/&gt;

==Details==

This section explains in detail how Schönhage–Strassen is implemented. It is based primarily on an overview of the method by Crandall and Pomerance in their ''Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective''.&lt;ref name="crandall"&gt;R. Crandall &amp; C. Pomerance. ''Prime Numbers – A Computational Perspective''. Second Edition, Springer, 2005. Section 9.5.6: Schönhage method, p. 502. {{ISBN|0-387-94777-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variant differs somewhat from Schönhage's original method in that it exploits the [[discrete weighted transform]] to perform negacyclic convolutions more efficiently. Another source for detailed information is [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]]'s ''The Art of Computer Programming''.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Knuth, [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms (3rd Edition), 1997. Addison-Wesley Professional, {{ISBN|0-201-89684-2}}. Section 4.3.3.C: Discrete Fourier transforms, pg.305.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section begins by discussing the building blocks and concludes with a step-by-step description of the algorithm itself. 

===Convolutions===

Suppose we are multiplying two numbers like 123 and 456 using long multiplication with base ''B'' digits, but without performing any carrying. The result might look something like this:

{|width=300 style="text-align:right"
|   ||        || 1 || 2 || 3
|-
|   || &amp;times;|| 4 || 5 || 6
|-
|colspan=5|&lt;hr/&gt;
|-
|   ||        || 6  || 12 || 18
|-
|   ||      5 || 10 || 15 ||
|-
| 4 ||      8 || 12 ||    ||
|-
|colspan=5|&lt;hr/&gt;
|-
| 4 ||     13 || 28 || 27 || 18
|}

This sequence (4, 13, 28, 27, 18) is called the ''acyclic'' or [[convolution|''linear convolution'']] of the two original sequences (1,2,3) and (4,5,6). Once you have the acyclic convolution of two sequences, computing the product of the original numbers is easy: you just perform the carrying (for example, in the rightmost column, you'd keep the 8 and add the 1 to the column containing 27). In the example this yields the correct product 56088.

There are two other types of convolutions that will be useful. Suppose the input sequences have ''n'' elements (here 3). Then the acyclic convolution has ''n''+''n''−1 elements; if we take the rightmost ''n'' elements and add the leftmost ''n''−1 elements, this produces the [[cyclic convolution]]:

{|width=300 style="text-align:right"
|   || 28 || 27 || 18
|-
| + ||    ||  4 || 13
|-
|colspan=5|&lt;hr/&gt;
|-
|   || 28 || 31 || 31
|}

If we perform carrying on the cyclic convolution, the result is equivalent to the product of the inputs mod B&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In the example, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 999, performing carrying on (28, 31, 31) yields 3141, and 3141 ≡ 56088 (mod 999).

Conversely, if we take the rightmost ''n'' elements and ''subtract'' the leftmost ''n''−1 elements, this produces the [[negacyclic convolution]]:

{|width=300 style="text-align:right"
|         || 28 || 27 || 18
|-
| − ||    ||  4 || 13
|-
|colspan=5|&lt;hr/&gt;
|-
|         || 28 || 23 ||  5
|}

If we perform carrying on the negacyclic convolution, the result is equivalent to the product of the inputs mod B&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. In the example, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 = 1001, performing carrying on (28, 23, 5) yields 3035, and 3035 ≡ 56088 (mod 1001). The negacyclic convolution can contain negative numbers, which can be eliminated during carrying using borrowing, as is done in long subtraction.

===Convolution theorem===

Like other [[Multiplication algorithm#Fourier transform methods|multiplication methods based on the Fast Fourier transform]], Schönhage–Strassen depends fundamentally on the [[convolution theorem]], which provides an efficient way to compute the cyclic convolution of two sequences. It states that:

:The cyclic convolution of two vectors can be found by taking the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of each of them, multiplying the resulting vectors element by element, and then taking the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT).

Or in symbols:

:CyclicConvolution(''X, Y'') = IDFT(DFT(''X'') &amp;middot; DFT(''Y''))

If we compute the DFT and IDFT using a [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithm, and invoke our multiplication algorithm recursively to multiply the entries of the transformed vectors DFT(''X'') and DFT(''Y''), this yields an efficient algorithm for computing the cyclic convolution.

In this algorithm, it will be more useful to compute the ''negacyclic'' convolution; as it turns out, a slightly modified version of the convolution theorem (see [[Discrete Fourier transform (general)#Discrete weighted transform|discrete weighted transform]]) can enable this as well. Suppose the vectors X and Y have length ''n'', and ''a'' is a [[Root_of_unity|primitive root of unity]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2''n'' (that is, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 and ''a'' to all smaller powers is not 1). Then we can define a third vector ''A'', called the ''weight vector'', as:

:''A'' = (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;), 0 &amp;le; ''j'' &lt; ''n''
:''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−''j''&lt;/sup&gt;), 0 &amp;le; ''j'' &lt; ''n''

Now, we can state:

:NegacyclicConvolution(''X'', ''Y'') = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;middot; IDFT(DFT(''A'' &amp;middot; ''X'') &amp;middot; DFT(''A'' &amp;middot; ''Y''))

In other words, it's the same as before except that the inputs are first multiplied by ''A'', and the result is multiplied by ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Choice of ring===

The discrete Fourier transform is an abstract operation that can be performed in any [[Ring (mathematics)|algebraic ring]]; typically it's performed in the complex numbers, but actually performing complex arithmetic to sufficient precision to ensure accurate results for multiplication is slow and error-prone. Instead, we will use the approach of the [[Discrete Fourier transform (general)#Number-theoretic transform|number theoretic transform]], which is to perform the transform in the integers mod ''N'' for some integer ''N''.

Just like there are primitive roots of unity of every order in the complex plane, given any order ''n'' we can choose a suitable N such that ''b'' is a primitive root of unity of order ''n'' in the integers mod ''N'' (in other words, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''N''), and no smaller power of ''b'' is equivalent to 1 mod ''N'').

The algorithm will spend most of its time performing recursive multiplications of smaller numbers; with a naive algorithm, these occur in a number of places:

# Inside the fast Fourier transform algorithm, where the primitive root of unity ''b'' is repeatedly powered, squared, and multiplied by other values.
# When taking powers of the primitive root of unity ''a'' to form the weight vector A and when multiplying A or A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by other vectors.
# When performing element-by-element multiplication of the transformed vectors.

The key insight to Schönhage–Strassen is to choose N, the modulus, to be equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for some integer ''n'' that is a multiple of the number of pieces ''P''=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; being transformed. This has a number of benefits in standard systems that represent large integers in binary form:

* Any value can be rapidly reduced modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 using only shifts and adds, as explained in the [[#Shift optimizations|next section]].
* All roots of unity in this ring can be written in the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;; consequently we can multiply or divide any number by a root of unity using a shift, and power or square a root of unity by operating only on its exponent.
* The element-by-element recursive multiplications of the transformed vectors can be performed using a negacyclic convolution, which is faster than an acyclic convolution and already has "for free" the effect of reducing its result mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

To make the recursive multiplications convenient, we will frame Schönhage–Strassen as being a specialized multiplication algorithm for computing not just the product of two numbers, but the product of two numbers mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for some given ''n''. This is not a loss of generality, since one can always choose ''n'' large enough so that the product mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is simply the product.

===Shift optimizations===

In the course of the algorithm, there are many cases in which multiplication or division by a power of two (including all roots of unity) can be profitably replaced by a small number of shifts and adds. This makes use of the observation that:

:(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; (−1)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; mod (2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)

Note that a ''k''-digit number in base 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; written in [[positional notation]] can be expressed as (''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''-1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). It represents the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}d_{i}\cdot(2^{n})^{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Also note that for each ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; we have 0≤''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

This makes it simple to reduce a number represented in binary mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1: take the rightmost (least significant) ''n'' bits, subtract the next ''n'' bits, add the next ''n'' bits, and so on until the bits are exhausted. If the resulting value is still not between 0 and 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, normalize it by adding or subtracting a multiple of the modulus 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. For example, if ''n''=3 (and so the modulus is 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+1 = 9) and the number being reduced is 656, we have:

:656 = 1010010000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;equiv; 000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 − 2 + 2 − 1 = −1 &amp;equiv; 8 (mod 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1).

Moreover, it's possible to effect very large shifts without ever constructing the shifted result. Suppose we have a number A between 0 and 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and wish to multiply it by 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Dividing ''k'' by ''n'' we find  ''k'' = ''qn'' + ''r'' with ''r'' &lt; ''n''. It follows that:

:A(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) = A(2&lt;sup&gt;''qn'' + ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) = A[(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;)] &amp;equiv; (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;(A shift-left ''r'') (mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1).

Since A is ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r'' &lt; ''n'', A shift-left ''r'' has at most 2''n''−1 bits, and so only one shift and subtraction (followed by normalization) is needed.

Finally, to divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, observe that squaring the first equivalence above yields:

:2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)

Hence,

:A/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = A(2&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;equiv; A(2&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' − ''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) = A shift-left (2''n'' − ''k'') (mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1).

===Algorithm===

The algorithm follows a split, evaluate (forward FFT), pointwise multiply, interpolate (inverse FFT), and combine phases similar to Karatsuba and Toom-Cook methods.

Given input numbers ''x'' and ''y'', and an integer ''N'', the following algorithm computes the product ''xy'' mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Provided N is sufficiently large this is simply the product.

# Split each input number into vectors X and Y of 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; parts each, where 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''N''. (e.g. 12345678 &amp;rarr; (12, 34, 56, 78)).
# In order to make progress, it's necessary to use a smaller ''N'' for recursive multiplications. For this purpose choose ''n'' as the smallest integer at least 2''N''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k'' and divisible by 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.
# Compute the product of X and Y mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 using the negacyclic convolution:
## Multiply X and Y each by the weight vector A using shifts (shift the ''j''th entry left by ''jn''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).
## Compute the DFT of X and Y using the number-theoretic FFT (perform all multiplications using shifts; for the 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-th root of unity, use 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).
## Recursively apply this algorithm to multiply corresponding elements of the transformed X and Y.
## Compute the IDFT of the resulting vector to get the result vector C (perform all multiplications using shifts). This corresponds to interpolation phase.
## Multiply the result vector C by A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; using shifts.
## Adjust signs: some elements of the result may be negative. We compute the largest possible positive value for the ''j''th element of C, {{math|(''j'' + 1)2&lt;sup&gt;2''N''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and if it exceeds this we subtract the modulus 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
# Finally, perform carrying mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to get the final result.

The optimal number of pieces to divide the input into is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' is the number of input bits, and this setting achieves the running time of O(''N'' log ''N'' log log ''N''),&lt;ref name="schönhage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crandall"/&gt; so the parameter ''k'' should be set accordingly. In practice, it is set empirically based on the input sizes and the architecture, typically to a value between 4 and 16.&lt;ref name="Gaudry"/&gt;

In step 2, the observation is used that:
* Each element of the input vectors has at most ''n''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; bits;
* The product of any two input vector elements has at most 2''n''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; bits;
* Each element of the convolution is the sum of at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; such products, and so cannot exceed 2''n''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k'' bits.
* ''n'' must be divisible by 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ensure that in the recursive calls the condition "2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''N''" holds in step 1.

==Optimizations==

This section explains a number of important practical optimizations that have been considered when implementing Schönhage–Strassen in real systems. It is based primarily on a 2007 work by Gaudry, Kruppa, and Zimmermann describing enhancements to the [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]].&lt;ref name="Gaudry"&gt;Pierrick Gaudry, Alexander Kruppa, and Paul Zimmermann. [http://www.loria.fr/~gaudry/publis/issac07.pdf A GMP-based Implementation of Schönhage–Strassen’s Large Integer Multiplication Algorithm]. Proceedings of the 2007 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, pp.167–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below a certain cutoff point, it's more efficient to perform the recursive multiplications using other algorithms, such as [[Toom–Cook multiplication]]. The results must be reduced mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, which can be done efficiently as explained above in [[#Shift optimizations|Shift optimizations]] with shifts and adds/subtracts.

Computing the IDFT involves dividing each entry by the primitive root of unity 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, an operation that is frequently combined with multiplying the vector by A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; afterwards, since both involve division by a power of two.

In a system where a large number is represented as an array of 2&lt;sup&gt;''w''&lt;/sup&gt;-bit words, it's useful to ensure that the vector size 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is also a multiple of the bits per word by choosing ''k'' ≥ ''w'' (e.g. choose ''k'' ≥ 5 on a 32-bit computer and ''k'' ≥ 6 on a 64-bit computer); this allows the inputs to be broken up into pieces without bit shifts, and provides a uniform representation for values mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 where the high word can only be zero or one.

Normalization involves adding or subtracting the modulus 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; this value has only two bits set, which means this can be done in constant time on average with a specialized operation.

Iterative FFT algorithms such as the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]], although frequently used for FFTs on vectors of complex numbers, tend to exhibit very poor cache [[Locality of reference|locality]] with the large vector entries used in Schönhage–Strassen. The straightforward recursive, not in-place implementation of FFT is more successful, with all operations fitting in the cache beyond a certain point in the call depth, but still makes suboptimal use of the cache in higher call depths. Gaudry, Kruppa, and Zimmerman used a technique combining Bailey's 4-step algorithm with higher radix transforms that combine multiple recursive steps. They also mix phases, going as far into the algorithm as possible on each element of the vector before moving on to the next one.

The "square root of 2 trick", first described by Schönhage, is to note that, provided ''k'' ≥ 2, 2&lt;sup&gt;3''n''/4&lt;/sup&gt;−2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/4&lt;/sup&gt; is a square root of 2 mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;+1, and so a 4''n''-th root of unity (since 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1). This allows the transform length to be extended from 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Finally, the authors are careful to choose the right value of ''k'' for different ranges of input numbers, noting that the optimal value of ''k'' may go back and forth between the same values several times as the input size increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10449">In [[mathematics]], the '''support''' (sometimes '''topological support''' or '''spectrum''') of a [[Measure space|measure]] ''μ'' on a [[measurable space|measurable]] [[topological space]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Borel(''X'')) is a precise notion of where in the space ''X'' the measure "lives". It is defined to be the largest ([[closed set|closed]]) [[subset]] of ''X'' for which every [[open set|open]] [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of every point of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] has positive measure.

==Motivation==

A (non-negative) measure ''μ'' on a measurable space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) is really a function ''μ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞]. Therefore, in terms of the usual [[definition]] of [[Support (mathematics)|support]], the support of ''μ'' is a subset of the [[sigma algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]] Σ:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp} (\mu) := \overline{\{ A \in \Sigma \mid \mu (A) &gt; 0 \}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the overbar denotes [[Closure (topology)|set closure]]. However, this definition is somewhat unsatisfactory: we use the notion of closure, but we do not even have a topology on Σ. What we really want to know is where in the space ''X'' the measure ''μ'' is non-zero. Consider two examples:
# [[Lebesgue measure]] ''λ'' on the [[real line]] '''R'''. It seems clear that ''λ'' "lives on" the whole of the real line.
# A [[Dirac measure]] ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; at some point ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. Again, intuition suggests that the measure ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; "lives at" the point ''p'', and nowhere else.

In light of these two examples, we can reject the following candidate definitions in favour of the one in the next section:
# We could remove the points where ''μ'' is zero, and take the support to be the remainder ''X''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''μ''({''x''})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;}. This might work for the Dirac measure ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it would definitely not work for ''λ'': since the Lebesgue measure of any singleton is zero, this definition would give ''λ'' empty support.
# By comparison with the notion of [[Strictly positive measure|strict positivity]] of measures, we could take the support to be the set of all points with a neighbourhood of positive measure:

:::&lt;math&gt;\{ x \in X \mid \text{for some open } N_x \ni x, \mu(N_x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

:(or the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of this). It is also too simplistic: by taking ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X'' for all points ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'', this would make the support of every measure except the zero measure the whole of ''X''.

However, the idea of "local strict positivity" is not too far from a workable definition:

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''T'') be a [[topological space]]; let B(''T'') denote the [[Borel algebra|Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra]] on ''X'', i.e. the smallest sigma algebra on ''X'' that contains all open sets ''U''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''. Let ''μ'' be a measure on (''X'',&amp;nbsp;B(''T'')). Then the '''support''' (or '''spectrum''') of ''μ'' is defined as the set of all points ''x'' in ''X'' for which every [[Open set|open]] [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''x'' has [[positive number|positive]] measure:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp} (\mu) := \{ x \in X \mid x \in N_x \in T \implies \mu (N_x) &gt; 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors prefer to take the closure of the above set. However, this is not necessary: see "Properties" below.

An equivalent definition of support is as the largest ''C''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'' (with respect to inclusion) such that every open set which has non-empty intersection with ''C'' has positive measure, i.e. the largest C such that:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall U \in T)(U \cap C \neq \varnothing \implies \mu (U \cap C) &gt; 0).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp} (\mu_1 + \mu_2) = \operatorname{supp} (\mu_1) \cup \operatorname{supp} (\mu_2)&lt;/math&gt;
* A measure ''μ'' on ''X'' is strictly positive [[if and only if]] it has support supp(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''. If ''μ'' is strictly positive and ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' is arbitrary, then any open neighbourhood of ''x'', since it is an [[open set]], has positive measure; hence, ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;supp(''μ''), so supp(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''. Conversely, if supp(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X'', then every non-empty open set (being an open neighbourhood of some point in its interior, which is also a point of the support) has positive measure; hence, ''μ'' is strictly positive.
* The support of a measure is [[Closed set|closed]] in ''X'' as its complement is the union of the open sets of measure 0.
* In general the support of a nonzero measure may be empty: see the examples below. However, if ''X'' is a topological [[Hausdorff space]] and ''µ'' is a [[Radon measure]], a [[measurable set]] ''A'' outside the support has [[measure zero]]:
::&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X \setminus \operatorname{supp} (\mu) \implies \mu (A) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
: The converse is not true in general: it fails if there exists a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;supp(''&amp;mu;'') such that ''&amp;mu;''({''x''})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (e.g. Lebesgue measure).
: Thus, one does not need to "integrate outside the support": for any [[measurable function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' or '''C''',
::&lt;math&gt;\int_X f(x) \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) = \int_{\operatorname{supp} (\mu)} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x).&lt;/math&gt;
* The concept of ''support'' of a measure and that of [[spectrum]] of a [[Self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint linear operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] are closely related. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular Borel measure]] on the line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then the multiplication operator &lt;math&gt;(Af)(x)=xf(x)&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint on its natural domain

::&lt;math&gt;D(A)=\{f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}, d\mu) \mid xf(x)\in L^2(\mathbb{R}, d\mu)\}&lt;/math&gt;

:and its spectrum coincides with the [[essential range]] of the identity function &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;, which is precisely the support of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical methods in Quantum Mechanics with applications to Schrödinger Operators&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Lebesgue measure===

In the case of Lebesgue measure ''λ'' on the real line '''R''', consider an arbitrary point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. Then any open neighbourhood ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''x'' must contain some open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ε'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ε'') for some ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. This interval has Lebesgue measure 2''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, so ''λ''(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Since ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''' was arbitrary, supp(''λ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

===Dirac measure===

In the case of Dirac measure ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, let ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and consider two cases:
# if ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'', then every open neighbourhood ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''x'' contains ''p'', so ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0;
# on the other hand, if ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''p'', then there exists a sufficiently small open ball ''B'' around ''x'' that does not contain ''p'', so ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
We conclude that supp(''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the closure of the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set {''p''}, which is {''p''} itself.

In fact, a measure ''μ'' on the real line is a Dirac measure ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for some point ''p'' [[if and only if]] the support of ''μ'' is the singleton set {''p''}. Consequently, Dirac measure on the real line is the unique measure with zero [[variance]] [provided that the measure has variance at all].

===A uniform distribution===

Consider the measure ''μ'' on the real line '''R''' defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu (A) := \lambda (A \cap (0, 1))&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform measure]] on the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1). A similar argument to the Dirac measure example shows that supp(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Note that the boundary points 0 and 1 lie in the support: any open set containing 0 (or 1) contains an open interval about 0 (or 1), which must intersect (0,&amp;nbsp;1), and so must have positive ''μ''-measure.

===A nontrivial measure whose support is empty===

The space of all countable ordinals with the topology generated by "open intervals", is a locally compact Hausdorff space. The measure ("Dieudonné measure") that assigns measure 1 to Borel sets containing an unbounded closed subset  and assigns 0 to other Borel sets is a Borel probability measure whose support is empty.

===A nontrivial measure whose support has measure zero===

On a compact Hausdorff space the support of a non-zero measure is always non-empty, but may have measure 0. An example of this is given by adding the first uncountable ordinal Ω to the previous example: the support of the measure is the single point Ω, which has measure 0.

==Signed and complex measures==

Suppose that ''μ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[&amp;minus;∞,&amp;nbsp;+∞] is a [[signed measure]]. Use the [[Hahn decomposition theorem]] to write

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu^{+} - \mu^{-},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; are both non-negative measures. Then the '''support''' of ''μ'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp} (\mu) := \operatorname{supp} (\mu^{+}) \cup \operatorname{supp} (\mu^{-}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if ''μ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''C''' is a [[complex measure]], the '''support''' of ''μ'' is defined to be the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the supports of its real and imaginary parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10884">In mathematics, a '''tempered representation''' of a linear [[semisimple Lie group]] is a [[group representation|representation]] that has a basis whose [[matrix coefficient]]s lie in the [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]]

:''L''&lt;sup&gt;2+&amp;epsilon;&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'')

for any ε &amp;gt; 0.

==Formulation==

This condition, as just given, is slightly weaker than the condition that the matrix coefficients are [[square-integrable]], in other words lie in

:''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''),

which would be the definition of a [[discrete series representation]]. If ''G'' is a linear semisimple Lie group with a maximal compact subgroup ''K'', an [[admissible representation]] ρ of ''G''  is tempered if the above condition holds for the [[K-finite|''K''-finite]] matrix coefficients of ρ.

The definition above is also used for  more general groups, such as ''p''-adic Lie groups and finite central extensions of semisimple real algebraic groups. The definition of "tempered representation" makes sense for arbitrary unimodular [[locally compact group]]s, but on groups with infinite centers such as infinite central extensions of semisimple Lie groups it  does not behave  well and is usually replaced by a slightly different definition. More precisely, an irreducible representation is called tempered if it is unitary when restricted to the center ''Z'', and the absolute values of the matrix coefficients are in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2+ε&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''Z'').

Tempered representations on semisimple Lie groups were first defined and studied by [[Harish-Chandra]] (using a different but equivalent definition), who showed that they are exactly the representations needed for the [[Plancherel theorem]].  They were classified by Knapp and Zuckerman, and used by Langlands in the [[Langlands classification]] of [[irreducible representation]]s of a [[reductive Lie group]] ''G'' in terms of the tempered representations of smaller groups.

==History==
Irreducible tempered representations were identified by [[Harish-Chandra]] in his work on harmonic analysis on a [[semisimple Lie group]] as those representations that contribute to the [[Plancherel measure]]. The original definition of a tempered representation, which has certain technical advantages, is that its [[Harish-Chandra character]] should be a "tempered distribution" (see the section about this below). It follows from Harish-Chandra's results that it is equivalent to the more elementary definition given above. Tempered representations also seem to play a fundamental role in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s. This connection was probably first realized by Satake (in the context of the [[Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture]]) and [[Robert Langlands]] and served as a motivation for Langlands to develop his [[Langlands classification|classification scheme]] for irreducible admissible representations of real and ''p''-adic reductive algebraic groups in terms of the tempered representations of smaller groups. The precise conjectures identifying the place of tempered representations in the automorphic spectrum were formulated later by [[James Arthur (mathematician)|James Arthur]] and constitute one of the most actively developing parts of the modern theory of automorphic forms.

==Harmonic analysis==
Tempered representations play an important role in the harmonic analysis on [[semisimple Lie group]]s. An [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representation|unitary]] representation of a semisimple Lie group &lt;!-- probably OK for other local fields --&gt;''G'' is tempered if and only if it is in the support of the [[Plancherel measure]] of ''G''. In other words, tempered representations are precisely the class of representations of ''G'' appearing in the spectral decomposition of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions on the group (while discrete series representations have a stronger property that an individual representation has a positive spectral measure). This stands in contrast with the situation for abelian and more general solvable Lie groups, where a different class of representations is needed to fully account for the spectral decomposition. This can be seen already in the simplest example of the additive group '''R''' of the real numbers, for which the matrix elements of the irreducible representations do not fall off to 0 at infinity.

In the [[Langlands program]], tempered representations of real Lie groups are those coming from unitary characters of tori by Langlands functoriality.

==Examples==
*The [[Plancherel theorem]] for a semisimple Lie group involves representations that are not the [[discrete series]]. This becomes clear already in the case of the group [[SL2(R)|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')]]. The [[principal series representation]]s of  SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') are tempered and account for the spectral decomposition of functions supported on the hyperbolic elements of the group. However, they do not occur discretely in the regular representation of SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''').
*The two [[limit of discrete series representation]]s of  SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') are tempered but not discrete series (even though they occur "discretely" in the list of irreducible unitary representations).
*For ''non-semisimple'' Lie groups, representations with matrix coefficients in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2+ε&lt;/sup&gt; do not always suffice for the [[Plancherel theorem]], as shown by the example of the additive group '''R''' of real numbers and the [[Fourier integral]]; in fact, all irreducible unitary representations of '''R''' contribute to the Plancherel measure, but none of them have matrix coefficients in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2+ε&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The [[complementary series representation]]s of SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') are irreducible unitary representations that are not tempered.
*The [[trivial representation]] of a group ''G'' is an irreducible unitary representation that is not tempered unless ''G'' is [[compact space|compact]].

==Classification==
The irreducible tempered representations of a semisimple Lie group were classified by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Anthony Knapp|last1=Knapp|author2-link=Gregg Zuckerman|last2=Zuckerman|year1=1976|year2= 1982}}. 
In fact they classified a more general class of representations called '''basic representations'''. If ''P=MAN'' is the [[Langlands decomposition]] of a cuspidal parabolic subgroup, then a basic representation is defined to be 
the parabolically induced representation associated to a [[limit of discrete series representation]] of ''M'' and a unitary representation of the abelian group ''A''.  If the limit of discrete series representation is in fact a discrete series representation, then the basic representation is called an '''induced discrete series representation'''. Any irreducible tempered representation is a basic representation, and conversely any basic representation is the sum of a finite number of irreducible tempered representations. More precisely, it is a direct sum of 2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; irreducible tempered representations indexed by the characters of an elementary abelian group ''R'' of order 2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; (called the '''R-group'''). 
Any basic  representation, and consequently any irreducible tempered representation, is a summand of an induced discrete series representation. However it is not always possible to represent an irreducible tempered representation as an induced discrete series representation, which is why one considers the more general class of basic representations.

So the irreducible tempered representations are just the irreducible basic representations, and can be classified by listing all basic representations and picking out those that are irreducible, in other words those that have trivial R-group.

==Tempered distributions==
Fix a semisimple Lie group ''G'' with maximal compact subgroup ''K''. {{harvtxt|Harish-Chandra|1966|loc= section 9}} defined a distribution on ''G'' to be '''tempered''' if it is defined on the [[Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space|Schwartz space]] of ''G''. The Schwartz space is in turn defined to be the space of smooth functions ''f'' on ''G'' such that for any real ''r'' and any function ''g'' obtained from ''f'' by acting on the left or right by elements of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of ''G'', the function 
:&lt;math&gt;(1+\sigma)^rg/\Xi&lt;/math&gt;
is bounded. 
Here Ξ is a certain spherical function on ''G'', invariant under left and right multiplication by ''K'',
and σ is the norm of the log of ''p'', where an element ''g'' of ''G'' is written as : ''g''=''kp''
for ''k'' in ''K'' and ''p'' in ''P''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6073">[[File:Partitions of 6-set with 3 singletons.svg|thumb|In a [[hexagon]] vertex set there are 20 [[Partition of a set|partitions]] which have one three-element subset and three single-element subsets (uncolored) (top figure). Of these there are four partitions up to rotation, and three partitions up to rotation and reflection.]]

In [[mathematics]], the phrase '''''up to''''' appears in discussions about the elements of a set (say ''S''), and the conditions under which subsets of those elements may be considered equivalent. The statement "elements ''a'' and ''b'' of set S are equivalent up to ''X''" means that ''a'' and ''b'' are equivalent if criterion ''X'' (such as [[Rotation_(mathematics)|rotation]] or [[permutation]]) is ignored. That is, ''a'' and ''b'' can be transformed into one another if a transform corresponding to ''X'' (rotation, permutation etc.) is applied.

Looking at the entire set ''S'', when ''X'' is ignored the elements can be arranged in subsets whose elements are equivalent ("equivalent up to ''X''"). Such subsets are called [[Equivalence_class|"equivalence classes"]]. 

If X is some property or process, the phrase "up to X" means "disregarding a possible difference in X". For instance the statement "an integer's prime factorization is unique ''up to ordering''", means that the prime factorization is unique if we disregard the order of the factors. We might say "the solution to an [[indefinite integral]] is {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, ''up to addition [[constant of integration|by a constant]]''", meaning that the added constant is not the focus here, the solution {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is, and that the addition of a constant is to be regarded as a background, of secondary focus.  Further examples concerning ''up to isomorphism'', ''up to permutations'' and ''up to rotations'' are described below.

In informal contexts, mathematicians often use the word ''[[modulo (jargon)|modulo]]'' (or simply "mod") for similar purposes, as in "modulo isomorphism".

==Examples==
===Tetris===
[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|Tetris pieces I,J,L,O, S,T,Z]]
A simple example is "there are seven reflecting [[tetromino]]s, up to rotations", which makes reference to the seven possible contiguous arrangements of tetrominoes (collections of four unit squares arranged to connect on at least one side) which are frequently thought of as the seven [[Tetris]] pieces (O, I, L, J, T, S, Z.)  This could also be written "there are five tetrominos, up to reflections and rotations", which would take account of the perspective that L and J could be thought of as the same piece, reflected, as well as that S and Z could be seen as the same.  The Tetris game does not allow reflections, so the former notation is likely to seem more natural.

To add in the exhaustive count, there is no formal notation.  However, it is common to write "there are seven reflecting tetrominos (= 19 total) up to rotations".  In this, Tetris provides an excellent example, as a reader might simply count 7 pieces × 4 rotations as 28, where some pieces (the 2×2 O being the obvious example) have fewer than four rotation states.

===Eight queens===

[[File:Skak 8dronning.png|thumb|A solution of the eight queens problem]]
In the [[eight queens puzzle]], if the eight queens are considered to be distinct, there are 3&amp;nbsp;709&amp;nbsp;440 distinct solutions. Normally however, the queens are considered to be identical, and one says "there are 92 ({{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;=\tfrac{3 709 440}{8!}&lt;/math&gt;)}} unique solutions ''up to'' [[permutation]]s of the queens", or "there are 92 solutions ''mod'' the names of the queens", signifying that two different arrangements of the queens are considered equivalent if the queens have been permuted, but the same squares on the [[chessboard]] are occupied by them.

If, in addition to treating the queens as identical, [[rotation]]s and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s of the board were allowed, we would have only 12 distinct solutions ''up to [[symmetry]] and the naming of the queens'', signifying that two arrangements that are symmetrical to each other are considered equivalent.

===Polygons===

The [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gon]], for given ''n'', is unique up to [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. In other words, if all similar ''n''-gons are considered instances of the same ''n''-gon, then there is only one regular ''n''-gon.

===Group theory===

In [[group theory]], for example, we may have a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' [[group action|acting]] on a set ''X'', in which case we say that two elements of ''X'' are equivalent "up to the group action" if they lie in the same [[group action|orbit]].

Another typical example is the statement that "there are two different [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of order 4 ''up to'' [[isomorphism]]", or "''modulo'' isomorphism, there are two groups of order 4". This means that there are two equivalence classes of groups of order 4, assuming we consider groups to be equivalent if they are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

===Non-standard analysis===
A [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] ''x'' and its [[standard part function|standard part]] st(''x'') are equal up to an [[infinitesimal]] difference.

==Computer science==

In computer science, the term ''up-to techniques'' is a precisely defined notion that refers to certain [[proof techniques]] for [[Bisimulation#Variants_of_bisimulation|(weak)]] [[bisimulation]], to relate processes that only behave similarly up to unobservable steps.&lt;ref name="Pous"&gt;Damien Pous, ''Up-to techniques for weak bisimulation'', Proc. 32th ICALP, [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]], vol. 3580, Springer Verlag (2005), pp. 730–741&lt;/ref&gt;
