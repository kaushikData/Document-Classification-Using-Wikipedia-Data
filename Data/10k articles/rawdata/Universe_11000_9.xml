On 20 March 1969, a [[United Arab Airlines]] [[Ilyushin Il-18]] crashed while attempting to land at [[Aswan Airport]]. 100 of the 105 passengers and crew on board were killed in the crash.

==The crash==
The flight was a non-scheduled international passenger service from [[Jeddah|Jeddah, Saudi Arabia]] to [[Aswan|Aswan, Egypt]]. The aircraft was carrying home Muslim worshippers who had won a pilgrimage through a lottery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n909AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L0gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1884,3740031&amp;dq=pilgrim+aswan+crash&amp;hl=en Mecca pilgrims die in plane crash]&lt;/ref&gt; It was dark in the early morning when the flight attempted to land and blowing sand had reduced visibility to 2–3 kilometers. After two unsuccessful attempts to land, the aircraft was making a third try when it banked to the right and hit the left side of the runway. The starboard wing tore off and a fuel spillage followed which caused the crashed aircraft to burst into flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The probable cause was determined to be that the "Pilot descended below the minimum safe altitude without having the runway lights clearly in sight. A contributory factor was fatigue arising from continuous working hours without suitable rest periods."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19690320-0 Aircraft accident Ilyushin 18D SU-APC Aswan Airport]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 European blackout''' was a major blackout which occurred on Saturday, November 4, 2006. More than 15 million clients of the [[Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity]] (UCTE) did not have access to electricity during about two hours on this date. The continent was in total disarray, dozens of people were trapped in elevators, numerous trains were halted, and the emergency services were receiving an overwhelming amount of calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6121166.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Europe's power blackout|last=|first=|date=2006-11-06|work=BBC|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate action taken by the [[Transmission system operator|Transmission System Operator]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (TSO) prevented the disturbance from turning into a Europe-wide blackout.

== Cause ==
The cause of this major blackout was a planned [[Downtime|routine disconnection]] of the [[Ems powerline crossing]] in Northwest Germany to allow a ship to pass beneath the overhead cables. In September, the shipyard had requested the lines, called Conneforde–Diele red and white, to be shut off starting at 01:00 on 5 November. This change was communicated to the neighboring TSOs and they did simulations to ensure stability. As a result, the planned power flow between TSOs was decreased for 00:00 to 06:00 5 November. On 3 November, the shipyard requested the shut-off to be advanced to 2200 on 4 November. E.ON Netz thought that this would be more favorable and approved the request. However, this change was not communicated to the neighboring TSOs until very late so a full analysis was not done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-07-110_en.htm?locale=en Blackout of November 2006: important lessons to be drawn], European Commission press release&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the transfer capacity had already been sold and it was not possible to change it except for force majeure.

Once the second circuit was turned off, this caused alarms due to high power flow. Also the Landesbergen–Wehrendorf line was very close to its limit. Over the next half-hour, the power first went down but then it crept back up. E.ON Netz thought that closing a bus tie would decrease this a bit; in fact, it had the opposite effect and once this was performed the line tripped out.

[[File:UCTE area split at 4 11 2006.svg|thumb|235px|UCTE area split]]
Twenty eight seconds later, an [[Power outage|electrical blackout]] had cascaded across Europe extending from [[Poland]] in the north-east, to the [[Benelux]] countries and [[France]] in the west, through to [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]] in the south-west, and across to [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]] in the south-east.

== Timeline ==
* '''21:29''' - [[E.ON Netz]] made load flow calculations and there were no indications of any violation of limit values. Without any calculations, E.ON Netz staff assumed that the N-1 criterion would be met in the system once the Conneforde-Diele line was switched. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Chunyan|last2=Sun|first2=Yuanzhang|last3=Chen|first3=Xiangyi|date=December 2007|title=Analysis of the blackout in Europe on November 4, 2006|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4510160/?reload=true|journal=2007 International Power Engineering Conference (IPEC 2007)|pages=939–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''21:30''' - Before the Conneforde-Diele line was opened, RWE TSO’s calculations showed that, even though the RWE TSO grid would be highly loaded, it would still be secure. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''21:38''' - E. ON Netz switched off the first circuit of the 380 kV Conneforde-Diele line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''21:39''' - E.ON Netz switched off the second circuit of the 380 kV Conneforde-Diele line. E.ON Netz soon received several warning messaged of high power flow in the Elsen-Twistetal and Elsen-Bechterdissen lines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''21:41''' - RWE TSO informed E. ON Netz that the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line (an interconnection line between E. ON Netz and RWE TSO) was still under the given limit (1,795 A) and that the N-1 criterion was still met in the internal RWE TSO network. The protection settings on both sides of the line are different.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:00''' - Every full hour, the commercial schedule changes were set. Consumption in E. ON Netz was about 13,500 MW and the injected wind power accounted for 3,300 MW. Due to transits, the lines towards the West were already loaded; this situation was normal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:05''' - Suddenly the load flow situation changed unexpectedly and resulted in a fast increase of the load on the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line by 100 MW.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:06''' - The current in the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line increased to 1900 A within 2-3 minutes. The safety limit value of 1800 A (specified by RWE) was exceeded on the line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:10:11''' - Because of the rush, E.ON Netz made the coupling without any coordination with RWE. The switching measure was meant to reduce the load flow of the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:10:13''' - The Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line was first tripped automatically by the protective device. The 220 kV Bielefeld/Ost-Giitersloh line and the 280 kV Bechterdissen-Elsen line were also tripped.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:10:28''' - The UCTE	 SYSTEM was split shortly after the tripping of the interconnection lines between E. ON Netz and RWE TSO, internal E.ON Netz lines, internal lines in APG (AT), interconnection lines between HEP (HR) and MAVIR (HU), and the internal lines in HEP (HR) and MAVIR (HU).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''22:10:32''' - All interconnection lines between Morocco and Spain tripped due to the low frequency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Affected areas ==
In total, over a 10 million people in northern Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and Spain lost power or were affected by the blackout. In  northern Germany, more than 100 trains were delayed for more than two hours because of the blackout.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/world/europe/05iht-lights.3401291.html|title=Brief blackout affects 10 million across Europe - Europe - International Herald Tribune|date=2006-11-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of France was affected except the southeast of the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In affected areas in France, firefighters were asked to respond to approximately 40 people being stuck in elevators. In Belgium, only the area around Antwerp was seriously affected, as well as Ghent and Liège, leaving the rest of the country with power.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/06/germany.mainsection|title=Millions blacked out across Europe as cold snap triggers power surge|last=McMahon|first=Barbara|date=2006-11-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy, which had experienced a similar blackout in 2003 which left 95% of the country without power, was only affected in a few areas, mainly Piedmont, Liguria in northern Italy, and Puglia in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Spain, the news network Red Electrica was affected, as were the regions of Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza, and part of  Andalusia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The '''UCTE'''(Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity) and '''TSO'''(Transmission System Operator) acted swiftly, and were able to restore electricity shortly, however the event highlighted glaring problems. The UCTE and TSO were victims of enormous backlash from the media and the citizens, and there were threats that both corporations might undergo serious managerial overhauls. This forced both companies to go back to the drawing board, and determine what possible improvements could be made to prevent such a problem in the future. For starters, the UCTE strengthened its defense system by using blackout simulations with the help of numerical analysis, and sophisticated technology. Using these simulations, they were able to bring to life realistic scenarios that could impact these regions in the future, and how the TSO could possibly combat the problems. This initiated the tweaking of the N-1 criterion in Policy 3 of the UCTE Operation Handbook.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Final Report: System Disturbance on 4 November 2006|url=http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/blackout-nov-06-UCTE-report.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the interconnected power systems were decentralized, wherein different border lines were responsible for the power lines running through them, rather than one general body governing the entire system. This process was later known as '''Resynchronization''', and it was able to increase stability within the UCTE if any problems were to arise. Furthermore, ''joint-training'' workshops&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; were established that would assure that regional dispatchers would have the knowledge and skills to operate the power systems, and would have the ability to implement the solutions given by the TSO under any circumstances.

== Possible political influences ==

=== Centralised vs decentralised governments ===
Although it may seem an abstract concept, the political system may have played a role in this power outage happening. At the time, many EU policy makers pushed for a more centralised form of government. This would give the government as a whole a greater role in regulating Europe's power grids. When the Blackout of 2006 occurred, these policy makers said this event revealed the fragility of Europe's current power grid system and called on a formal centralised government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-04-01|title=Interpreting transnational infrastructure vulnerability: European blackout and the historical dynamics of transnational electricity governance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421509008799|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=2053–2062|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.11.030|issn=0301-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip-side, however, because the power disturbances were quickly contained and dealt with, the power sector spokesperson cited this event as a confirmation of the reliability of the current, transnational power grids and praised the decentralised governance model in place at the time.

=== Security ===
It comes as a surprise that, since the 2003 blackout, the security system had gone unchanged. The security system did not account for an increase of liberalization of electric supply which caused an increase in cross-border trades, which are not properly accounted for when reviewing the security of the system. Also, due to the decentralized form of government at the time, [[Transmission system operator|the transmission system operator, or TSO]], would each control their own area, and exchange little information with other TSOs.  This inevitably resulted in a slow response time to contingencies. To repair these fallacies so something like this would not occur in the future, a new mode of coordinated operation for real-time security would be needed. But in order to do so, those implementing this would need to overcome a series of psychology, organizational, and legal challenges. The alternative of this would be to risk yet another major blackout or run the current system very conservatively, which would cause an astronomical cost to the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialek|first=J.

'''ASTRID''' (''Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration'') is a 600 MW sodium-cooled [[fast breeder reactor]] ([[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV]]) project, proposed by the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] (CEA). It is proposed to be built on the [[Marcoule Nuclear Site]] in [[France]]. It is the successor of the three French fast reactors [[Rapsodie]], [[Phénix]] and [[Superphénix]]. A final decision on construction is to be made in 2019.

The main goals of ASTRID are the multi-recycling of [[plutonium]], aiming at preserving natural [[uranium]] resources, [[minor actinide]] transmutation, aiming at reducing [[nuclear waste]], and an enhanced safety comparable to [[Generation III reactor]]s, such as the [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]]. It is envisaged as a 600 MW industrial prototype connected to the [[electrical grid|grid]]. A commercial series of 1500 MW SFR reactors is planned to be deployed around 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors.aspx |title=Fast Neutron Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aluminium recycling''' is the process by which [[scrap]] [[aluminium]] can be reused in products after its initial production. The process involves simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the [[electrolysis]] of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{aluminium}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which must first be mined from [[bauxite]] ore and then refined using the [[Bayer process]]. [[Recycling]] scrap aluminium requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium from the raw ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9302727|work=The Economist|title=The price of virtue|date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, approximately 36% of all aluminium produced in the [[United States]] comes from old recycled scrap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/mcs-2018-alumi.pdf minerals.usgs.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Used beverage containers are the largest component of processed aluminum scrap, and most of it is manufactured back into aluminium cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Common Wastes &amp; Material|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/alum.htm#process|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A common practice since the early 1900s and extensively capitalized during [[World War II]], aluminium recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the exploding popularity of aluminium [[beverage can]]s finally placed recycling into the public consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Mark|title=Aluminum Recycling|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtX1nbel49kC|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-9662-5|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salvage demo.jpg|thumb|upright|Model promoting aluminium recycling at [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] in 1942]]
Sources for recycled aluminium include [[aircraft]], [[automobile]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[boat]]s, [[computer]]s, [[cookware]], [[Rain gutter|gutters]], [[siding]], [[wire]], and many other products that need a strong lightweight material, or a material with high [[thermal conductivity]]. As recycling does not transmute the element, aluminium can be recycled indefinitely and still be used to produce any product for which new aluminium could have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/metals.htm |title=WasteOnline: Metals aluminium and steel recycling |access-date=2006-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051136/http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/metals.htm |archive-date=2007-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:pressed-cans.jpg|Baled cans ready for transport|right|thumb|200px]]

==Advantages==
The recycling of aluminium generally produces significant cost savings over the production of new aluminium, even when the cost of collection, separation and recycling are taken into account.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;[http://www.world-aluminium.org/cache/fl0000181.pdf International Aluminum Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the long term, even larger national savings are made when the reduction in the capital costs associated with [[landfill]]s, mines, and international [[shipping]] of raw aluminium are considered.

===Energy savings===
Recycling aluminium uses about 5% of the energy required to create aluminium from [[bauxite]];&lt;ref name=AlumAssoc&gt;{{Cite report|date=September 2011|title=Aluminum: The Element of Sustainability A North American Aluminum Industry Sustainability Report|url=http://www.aluminum.org/sites/default/files/Aluminum_The_Element_of_Sustainability.pdf|publisher=The Aluminum Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of energy required to convert [[aluminium oxide]] into aluminium can be vividly seen when the process is reversed during the combustion of [[thermite]] or [[ammonium perchlorate composite propellant]]. 

Aluminium die extrusion is a specific way of getting reusable material from aluminium scraps but does not require a large energy output of a melting process. In 2003, half of the products manufactured with aluminium were sourced from recycled aluminium material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.diecastingdesign.org/blog/manufacturing-die-casting-eco-friendly-option/|title=Manufacturing with Die Casting: An Eco-Friendly Option|last=|first=|date=2017-01-21|work=NADCA Design|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental savings===
The benefit with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide depends on the type of energy used. [[Electrolysis]] can be done using electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources, such as nuclear, geothermal, hydroelectric, or solar. Aluminium production is attracted to sources of cheap electricity. Canada, Brazil, Norway, and Venezuela have 61 to 99% [[hydroelectric]] power and are major aluminium producers. The use of recycled aluminium also decreases the need for mining bauxite.

The vast amount of aluminium used means that even small percentage losses are large expenses, so the flow of material is well monitored and accounted for financial reasons. Efficient production and recycling benefits the environment as well.&lt;ref name="Environmental Issues"&gt;[http://world-aluminium.org/Sustainability/Environmental+Issues Aluminium organisation: Environmental issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process for beverage cans==
Aluminium beverage cans are usually recycled by the following method:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aluminum.org/Content/NavigationMenu/News_and_Stats/CansForHabitat_org/Aluminum_Recycling/How_Is_An_Aluminum_Can_Recycled_/How_Is_An_Aluminum_Can_Recycled_.htm aluminum.org: How Is An Aluminum Can Recycled?]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cans are first divided from [[municipal waste]], usually through an [[eddy current separator]], and cut into small, equally sized pieces to lessen the volume and make it easier for the machines that separate them.
#Pieces are cleaned chemically/mechanically and blocked to minimize [[oxidation]] losses when melted. (The surface of aluminium readily oxidizes back into aluminium oxide when exposed to [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalwebnews.com/howto/furnace2/melting.html www.metalwebnews.com: Melting Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;)
#Blocks are loaded into the furnace and heated to 750&amp;nbsp;°C ± 100&amp;nbsp;°C to produce molten aluminium.
#[[Dross]] is removed, and the dissolved [[hydrogen]] is [[Degasification|degassed]]. (Molten aluminium readily [[Dissociation (chemistry)|disassociates]] hydrogen from [[water vapor]] and hydrocarbon contaminants.) This is typically done with chlorine and nitrogen gas. [[Hexachloroethane]] tablets are normally used as the source for chlorine. [[Ammonium perchlorate]] can also be used, as it decomposes mainly into chlorine, nitrogen, and oxygen when heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.key-to-metals.com/Article83.htm|title=Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys Casting Problems|work=key-to-metals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Samples are taken for [[spectroscopic analysis]]. Depending on the final product desired, high-purity aluminium, [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[silicon]], and/or [[magnesium]] is added to alter the molten composition to the proper [[alloy]] specification. The top-five [[aluminium alloy]]s produced are [[6061 aluminium|6061]], [[7075 aluminium|7075]], 1100, [[6063 aluminium|6063]], and [[2024 aluminium|2024]].
#The furnace is tapped, the molten aluminium poured out, and the process is repeated again for the next batch. Depending on the end product, it may be cast into [[ingots]], [[billet (manufacturing)|billets]], or rods, formed into large slabs for [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], atomized into powder, sent to an [[extruder]], or transported in its molten state to manufacturing facilities for further processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcoa.com/primary_na/en/products/products.asp Alcoa Primary Aluminum - North America: Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingot production using reverberatory furnaces==
The scrap aluminium is separated into a range of categories ''e.g.'' irony aluminium (engine blocks etc.), clean aluminium (alloy wheels). Scraps are classified according to ISRI.

Depending on the specification of the required ingot casting, it will depend on the type of scrap used in the start melt. Generally, the scrap is charged to a [[reverberatory furnace]] (other methods appear to be either less economical and/or dangerous) and melted down to form a "bath". The molten metal is tested using [[spectroscopy]] on a sample taken from the melt to determine what refinements are needed to produce the final casts.

After the refinements have been added, the melt may be tested several times to be able to fine-tune the batch to the specific standard.

Once the correct "recipe" of metal is available, the furnace is tapped and poured into ingot moulds, usually via a casting machine. The melt is then left to cool, stacked and sold on as cast silicon–aluminium ingot to various industries for re-use. Mainly, cast alloys like ADC12, LM2, AlSi132, LM24 etc. are produced. These secondary alloys ingots are used in die cast companies.

Nowadays, tilting rotary furnaces are used for recycling of aluminum scrap, which give higher recovery compared to reverberatory furnaces (Skelner Furnace).

==Recycling rates==
[[Recycling in Brazil|Brazil recycles]] 98.2% of its aluminium can production, equivalent to 14.7 billion beverage cans per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/regional-reports/brazil.html|title=In 2009, Brazil was, once again, the leading country worldwide in the collection of aluminium beverage cans, with a recycling rate of 98.2%|publisher=Alu - Aluminium for future generations|year=2010|accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking first in the world, more than Japan's [[Recycling in Japan|82.5% recovery rate]]. Brazil has topped the aluminium can recycling charts eight years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brazil's+unemployed+catadores+keep+recycling+rates+high+while+earning...-a0221274010|title=Brazil's unemployed catadores keep recycling rates high while earning much-needed cash. - Free Online Library|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com|date=2010-03-22|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary aluminium recycling==
White dross, a residue from primary aluminium production and secondary recycling operations, usually classified as waste &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smartwaste.co.uk/filelibrary/Cement_aluminium_dross.pdf Residues from aluminium dross recycling in cement]&lt;/ref&gt;, still contains useful quantities of aluminium which can be extracted industrially.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, J.Y., Huang, X., Xu, Z. (2006), Recovery of Metals from Aluminum Dross and Salt cake, Journal of Minerals &amp; Materials Characterization &amp; Engineering. Vol. 5, No. 1, pp 47-62&lt;/ref&gt; The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, [[hydrogen]], [[acetylene]], and [[ammonia]]) which spontaneously ignites on contact with air;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiolandfills.org/faq/aluminum-dross-saltcake/ Why are dross &amp; saltcake a concern?]&lt;/ref&gt; contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, however, the waste has found use as a filler in [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunster, A.M., Moulinier, F., Abbott, B., Conroy, A., Adams, K., Widyatmoko, D.(2005). Added value of using new industrial waste streams as secondary aggregates in both concrete and asphalt. DTI/WRAP Aggregates Research Programme STBF 13/15C.

[[File:Wood ash.jpg|thumb|Wood ash]]
'''Ash''' or '''ashes''' are the solid remains of [[fire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ash|title=the definition of ash|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it refers to all non-[[aqueous]], non-[[gas]]eous residues that remain after something is [[combustion|burned]]. In [[analytical chemistry]], in order to analyse the mineral and metal content of [[chemical sample]]s,  [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] is the non-[[gas]]eous, non-[[liquid]] residue after a complete combustion.

Ashes as the end product of [[incomplete combustion]] will be mostly [[mineral]], but usually still contain an amount of [[combustible]] [[organic compound|organic]] or other [[Redox|oxidizable]] residues. The best-known type of ash is [[wood ash]], as a product of wood combustion in [[campfire]]s, [[fireplace]]s, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining [[charcoal]] will be due to incomplete combustion.

Like [[soap]], ash is also a [[disinfecting]] agent ([[alkaline]]).&lt;ref&gt;Howard et al. 2002: Healthy Villages A guide for communities and community health workers.

[[File:Paul Sandby 1759 cane chair weaver.jpg|thumb|''Cane chair weaver'', 1759, by [[Paul Sandby]]]]

In the context of [[furniture]], '''caning''' is a method of weaving [[chair]] seats and other furniture either while building new chairs or in the process of cane chair repair. In common use, "cane" may refer to any plant with a long, thin stem. However, the cane used for furniture is derived from the [[rattan]] vine native to [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=Perry-chap1&gt;{{Cite book |last=Perry |first=L. Day |date=1917 |title=Seat Weaving |publisher=Manual Arts Press |location=Peoria, IL |url=https://archive.org/details/seatweaving00perriala |via=Internet Archive |chapter=Caning: The Seven Steps |pages=6–14 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/seatweaving00perriala#page/6/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} The vines typically grow to 100–300&amp;nbsp;ft in length; most have a diameter less than 1&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;ref name=Perry-chap1/&gt;{{rp|7}} Before export, the rattan stems are cut to uniform lengths and the bark is removed in narrow strips of {{frac|1|16}} to {{frac|3|16}}&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;ref name=Perry-chap1/&gt;{{rp|7}}
[[Sugar cane]] and [[bamboo]] (sometimes called "cane" in the southern United States) should not be confused with rattan cane.&lt;ref name=Perry-chap1/&gt;{{rp|8}}
Rattan vine looks somewhat similar to bamboo but is quite different in that bamboo is hollow and holds itself upright while rattan is a solid flexible vine that needs the support of surrounding structure to elevate itself off the forest floor.  It climbs to the top of canopies of the forest to reach sunlight with the help of large rugged thorns that grab hold of surrounding trees.  Sometimes much of the length of these rugged vines are draped along the forest floor from tree to tree in search of a suitable structure to climb.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Mistakenly some people confuse furniture or chair caning with [[wicker]].  To clarify, chair caning is specifically the craft of applying rattan cane or rattan peel to a piece of furniture such as the backs or seats of chairs, whereas wicker or wicker work is a reference to the craft of weaving any number of materials such as willow or rattan reeds as well as man made paper based cords.

'''Carpentry''' is a [[skilled trade]] in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of [[building]]s, [[Shipbuilding|ships]], [[timber bridge]]s, [[concrete]] [[formwork]], etc.  Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did the rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used&lt;ref&gt;Roza, Greg. ''A career as a carpenter''. New York: Rosen Pub., 2011. 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry. In the United States, 98.5% of carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf |format=PDF|title= Evidence From Census 2000 About Earnings by Detailed Occupation for Men and Women.

''A career as a carpenter''. New York: Rosen Pub., 2011. 7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Floyd, and Gaspar J. Lewis. ''Carpentry''. 4th ed. Clifton Park, NY: Thomson Delmar Learning, 2006.xvi Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old fashioned carpentry is called [[timber framing]]. Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. It is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program, which may be the case in many places.

The word "carpenter" is the [[English language|English]] rendering of the [[French language|Old French]] word ''carpentier'' (later, ''charpentier'') which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''carpentarius [artifex]'', "(maker) of a [[carriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/C0123600.html The American heritage dictionary of the English language] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607144019/http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/C0123600.html |date=June 7, 2007 }} - Etymology of the word "carpenter"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English language|Middle English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word (in the sense of "builder") was ''wright'' (from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''wryhta'', cognate with ''work''), which could be used in compound forms such as ''wheelwright'' or ''boatwright''.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.  2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of terms in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], carpentry is more correctly used to describe the skill involved in ''first fixing'' of timber items, such as construction of roofs, floors and [[timber framed buildings]], i.e., those areas of construction that are normally hidden in a finished building. An easy way to envisage this is that first fix work is all that is done before plastering takes place. Second fix is done after plastering takes place. ''Second fix'' work, the construction of items such as skirting boards, architraves, and doors also comes under carpentry.  Carpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured during the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses. In the UK, the skill of making timber formwork for poured, or in situ, concrete, is referred to as ''shuttering''.

===Use of terms in the United States===
Carpentry in the United States is historically defined similarly to the United Kingdom as the "heavier and stronger"&lt;ref&gt;"Carpenter." Def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; work distinguished from a joiner "...who does lighter and more ornamental work than that of a carpenter..." although the "...work of a carpenter and joiner are often combined."&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William D., ed.. "Carpenter." Def, 1. ''The [[Century Dictionary]]: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language'' vol. 1. New York. The Century Co. 1895. 830. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Joiner is less common than the terms ''finish carpenter'' or ''cabinetmaker''. The terms ''housewright'' and ''barnwright'' were used historically, now occasionally used by carpenters who work using traditional methods and [[materials]]. Someone who builds custom concrete formwork is a ''form carpenter''.

==History==
[[File:Kizhi churches.jpg|thumb|right|Log church building in Russia reached spectacular heights such as this example from the 17th century]]
Wood is one of mankind's oldest building materials. The ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the [[stone age]] to the [[bronze age]] to the [[iron age]]. Some of the oldest archaeological evidence of carpentry are water well casings built using split oak timbers with [[mortise and tenon]] and notched corners excavated in eastern Germany dating from about 7,000 years ago in the early [[Neolithic|neolithic period]].&lt;ref&gt;
Prostak, Sergio. "German Archaeologists Discover World's Oldest Wooden Wells." Breaking Science News SciNewscom. Sci-News.com, 24 Dec. 2012. Web. 26 Feb. 2015. &lt;http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/article00788.html&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively little information about carpentry is available from pre-history (before written language) or even recent centuries because the knowledge and skills were passed down person to person, rarely in writing, until the printing press was invented in the 15th century and builders began regularly publishing guides and pattern books in the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest surviving complete architectural text is [[Vitruvius]]' ten books collectively titled [[De architectura]], which discuss some carpentry.

Some of the oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world are temples in [[China]] such as the [[Nanchan Temple (Wutai)|Nanchan Temple]] built in 782, the [[Greensted Church]], parts of which are from the 11th century, and the [[stave church]]es in Norway from the 12th and 13th centuries.

By the 16th century sawmills were coming into use in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Norman. ''A history of building materials''. London: Phoenix House, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of America was partly based on a desire to extract resources from the new continent including wood for use in ships and buildings in Europe. In the 18th century part of the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the invention of the steam engine and [[Nail (fastener)#Cut nails|cut nails]].&lt;ref&gt;Loveday, Amos John. ''The cut nail industry, 1776-1890: technology, cost accounting and the upper Ohio Valley''. Ann Arbor, Mich.: University Microfilms International, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies combined with the invention of the [[circular saw]] led to the development of [[balloon framing]] which was the beginning of the decline of traditional timber framing.
[[File:EB1911 Carpentry Fig. 36 - Balloon Frame.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Axonometric diagram of [[balloon framing]]]]
The 19th century saw the development of electrical engineering and distribution which allowed the development of hand-held power tools, wire nails and machines to mass-produce [[screw]]s. In the 20th century, [[portland cement]] came into common use and concrete foundations allowed carpenters to do away with heavy timber sills. Also, drywall (plasterboard) came into common use replacing lime plaster on wooden lath. Plywood, engineered lumber and chemically treated lumber also came into use.&lt;ref&gt;Jester, Thomas C.. ''Twentieth-century building materials: history and conservation''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
[[File:Centre Pompidou-Metz chantier.JPG|thumb|The [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]] museum under construction in [[Metz]], [[France]] in 2009. The building possesses one of the most complex examples of carpentry built to date and is composed of 16 kilometers of glued laminated timber for a surface area of 8,000 m².]]

Carpentry requires [[training]] which involves both acquiring knowledge and physical practice. In formal training a carpenter begins as an [[Apprenticeship|''apprentice'']], then becomes a ''journeyman'', and with enough experience and competency can eventually attain the status of a ''master'' carpenter. Today pre-apprenticeship training may be gained through non-union vocational programs such as high school shop classes and community colleges.

Informally a laborer may simply work alongside carpenters for years learning skills by observation and peripheral assistance. While such an individual may obtain journeyman status by paying the union entry fee and obtaining a journeyman's card (which provides the right to work on a union carpentry crew) the carpenter foreman will, by necessity, dismiss any worker who presents the card but does not demonstrate the expected skill level.

Carpenters may work for an employer or be self-employed. No matter what kind of training a carpenter has had, some U. S. states require contractors to be licensed which requires passing a written test and having minimum levels of insurance.

===Carpentry schools and programs===
Formal training in the carpentry trade is available in seminars, certificate programs, high-school programs, online classes, in the new construction, restoration, and preservation carpentry fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/faq/information-sheets/career-and-education.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428134522/http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/faq/information-sheets/career-and-education.html |date=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these programs are called pre-[[apprenticeship]] training.

In the modern British [[construction]] industry, carpenters are trained through [[apprenticeship]] schemes where [[GCSE|general certificates of secondary education]] (GCSE) in [[Mathematics]], English, and [[Technology]] help but are not essential. However, this is deemed the preferred route, as young people can earn and gain field experience whilst training towards a nationally recognized qualification.

There are two main divisions of training: construction-carpentry and cabinetmaking. During pre-apprenticeship, trainees in each of these divisions spend 30 hours a week for 12 weeks in classrooms and indoor workshops learning mathematics, trade terminology, and skill in the use of hand and power tools. Construction-carpentry trainees also participate in calisthenics to prepare for the physical aspect of the work.

Upon completion of pre-apprenticeship, trainees who have successfully passed the graded curriculum (taught by highly experienced journeyman carpenters) are assigned to a local union and to union carpentry crews at work on construction sites or in cabinet shops as First Year Apprentices. Over the next four years, as they progress in status to Second Year, Third Year, and Fourth Year Apprentice, apprentices periodically return to the training facility every three months for a week of more detailed training in specific aspects of the trade.

===Apprenticeships and Journeymen carpenters===
Tradesmen in countries such as Germany and Australia are required to fulfill a formal [[apprenticeship]] (usually three to four years) to work as a professional carpenter. Upon graduation from the apprenticeship, he or she is known as a [[journeyman]] carpenter.

Up through the 19th and even the early 20th century, the journeyman traveled to another region of the country to learn the building styles and techniques of that area before (usually) returning home. In modern times, journeymen are not required to travel, and the term now refers to a level of proficiency and skill. Union carpenters in the United States, that is, members of the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America]], are required to pass a skills test to be granted official journeyman status, but uncertified professional carpenters may also be known as journeymen based on their skill level, years of experience, or simply because they support themselves in the trade and not due to any certification or formal [[woodworking]] education.

Professional status as a journeyman carpenter in the United States may be obtained in a number of ways. Formal training is acquired in a four-year apprenticeship program administered by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, in which journeyman status is obtained after successful completion of twelve weeks of pre-apprenticeship training, followed by four years of on-the-job field training working alongside journeyman carpenters. The [[Timber Framers Guild]] also has a formal apprenticeship program for traditional [[timber framing]]. Training is also available in groups like the [[Kim Bồng woodworking village]] in Vietnam where apprentices live and work to learn woodworking and carpentry skills.

In Canada, each province sets its own standards for apprenticeship. The average length of time is four years and includes a minimum number of hours of both on-the-job training and technical instruction at a college or other institution. Depending on the number of hours of instruction an apprentice receives, he or she can earn a Certificate of Proficiency, making him or her a journeyman, or a Certificate of Qualification, which allows him or her to practice a more limited amount of carpentry. Canadian carpenters also have the option of acquiring an additional [[Interprovincial Standards|Interprovincial Red Seal]] that allows them to practice anywhere in Canada. The Red Seal requires the completion of an apprenticeship and an additional examination.

===Master carpenter===
After working as a journeyman for a while, a carpenter may go on to study or test as a [[master craftsman|master]] carpenter. In some countries, such as Germany and [[Japan]], this is an arduous and expensive process, requiring extensive knowledge (including economic and legal knowledge) and skill to achieve master certification; these countries generally require master status for anyone employing and teaching apprentices in the craft. In others, 'master carpenter' can be a loosely used term to describe any skilled carpenter.

Fully trained carpenters and [[joiner]]s will often move into related trades such as [[shop fitting]], [[scaffolding]], bench [[joiner]]y, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and system installation.

==Materials used==
Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood which has been prepared by [[Wood splitting|splitting]] (riving), [[hewning]], or sawing with a [[pit saw]] or [[sawmill]] called [[lumber]] (American English) or timber (British English). Today natural and [[engineered lumber]] and many other [[building material]]s carpenters may use are typically prepared by others and delivered to the job site. In 2013 the carpenters union in America used the term carpenter for a catch-all position. Tasks performed by union carpenters include installing "...flooring, windows, doors, interior trim, cabinetry, solid surface, roofing, framing, siding, flooring, insulation, ...acoustical ceilings, computer-access flooring, metal framing, wall partitions, office furniture systems, and both custom or factory-produced materials, ...trim and molding ,... ceiling treatments, ... exposed columns and beams, displays, mantels, staircases...metal studs, metal lath, and drywall..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carpenters.org/UBC_Crafts_top-nav/Our_Varied_Trade.aspx|title=United Brotherhood Of Carpenters|work=carpenters.org|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and safety==

===United States===
Carpentry is often hazardous work. Types of woodworking and carpentry hazards include Machine hazards, flying materials, tool projection, fire and explosion, electrocution, noise, vibration, dust and chemicals.
In the United States the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) tries to prevent illness, injury and fire through regulations. However, self-employed workers are not covered by the OSHA act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/workers.html|title=Workers' Rights|work=osha.gov|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA claims that "Since 1970, workplace fatalities have been reduced by more than 65 percent and occupational injury and illness rates have declined by 67 percent. At the same time, U.S. employment has almost doubled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html|title=Commonly Used Statistics|work=osha.gov|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading cause of overall fatalities, called the "fatal four", are falls, followed by struck by object, electrocution, and caught-in/between. In general construction "employers must provide working conditions that are free of known dangers. Keep floors in work areas in a clean and, so far as possible, a dry condition. Select and provide required personal protective equipment at no cost to workers. Train workers about job hazards in a language that they can understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/fallprotection/index.html|title=Safety and Health Topics - Fall Protection|work=osha.gov|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how to prevent falls includes placing railings and toe-boards at any floor opening which cannot be well covered and elevated platforms and safety harness and lines, safety nets, stair railings and hand rails.

Safety is not just about the workers on the job site. Carpenters work needs to meet the requirements in the [[Life Safety Code]] such as in [[Stairs|stair]] building and building codes to promote long term quality and safety for the building occupants.

==Types and occupations==
A '''finish carpenter''' (North America), also called a '''[[joiner]]''' (a traditional name now rare in North America), is one who does finish carpentry, that is, [[cabinetry]], furniture making, fine woodworking, model building, [[tool|instrument]] making, [[parquetry]], [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], or other carpentry where exact joints and minimal margins of error are important. Some large-scale construction may be of an exactitude and artistry that it is classed as finish carpentry.

A '''carpenter and joiner''' is one who has a much broader skill ranging from joinery, finishing carpentry, building construction and form work.

A '''trim carpenter''' specializes in molding and trim, such as [[door]] and [[window]] [[Neck molding|casings]], [[fireplace mantel|mantels]], baseboards, and other types of ornamental work. Cabinet installers may also be referred to as trim carpenters.

A '''[[cabinetmaker]]''' is a carpenter who does fine and detailed work specializing in the making of cabinets made from wood, [[wardrobe]]s, [[chest of drawers|dressers]], [[chest (furniture)|storage chests]], and other furniture designed for storage.

A '''ship's carpenter''' specializes in [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, repair techniques and carpentry specific to nautical needs in addition to many other on-board tasks; usually the term refers to a carpenter who has a post on a specific [[ship]]. Steel warships as well as wooden ones need ship's carpenters, especially for making emergency repairs in the case of battle or storm damage.

A '''shipwright''' builds wooden ships on land.

A '''[[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]''' is someone who makes [[barrel]]s: wooden staved vessels of a conical form, of greater length than breadth.

A '''[[Carpenter (theatre)|scenic carpenter]]''' builds and dismantles temporary [[theatrical scenery|scenery]] and [[set construction|sets]] in film-making, television, and the theater.

A '''[[framer]]''' is a carpenter who builds the skeletal structure or wooden framework of buildings, most often in the [[platform framing]] method. Historically, [[balloon framing]] was used until the 1950s when fire safety concerns made platform framing inherently better. A carpenter who specializes in building with timbers rather than studs is known as a [[timber framing|'''timber framer''']] and does traditional timber framing with wooden joints, including [[mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joinery, post and beam work with metal connectors, or [[pole building framing]].

A '''[[luthier]]''' is someone who makes or repairs stringed instruments. The word luthier comes from the French word for lute, "luth".

A [[Log building|'''log builder''']] builds structures of stacked, horizontal logs including [[house]]s, [[barn]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]], [[fortification]]s, and more.

A '''[[formwork]] carpenter''' creates the shuttering and [[falsework]] used in [[concrete]] construction.

In [[Japanese carpentry]], ''daiku'' is the simple term for carpenter, a ''miya-daiku'' (temple carpenter) performs the work of both architect and builder of shrines and temples, and a ''sukiya-daiku'' works on teahouse construction and houses. ''Sashimono-shi'' build furniture and ''tateguya'' do interior finishing work.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Butler, "Patronage and the Building Arts in Tokugawa Japan", Early Modern Japan. Fall-Winter 2004 [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/5820/V12N2Butler.pdf;jsessionid=6104A29BFC3D655AA6BCD1605C6DDE80?sequence=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''restoration carpenter''' is a carpenter who works in historic [[building restoration]], someone who restores a structure to a former state.

A '''conservation carpenter''' works in [[architectural conservation]], known in the U.S. as a "preservation carpenter" who works in [[historic preservation]], someone who keeps structures from changing.

'''Green carpentry''' is the specialization in the use of environmentally friendly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmullencarpentersandjoiners.co.uk/environmentally-friendly-building-materials/ |title=Environmentally Friendly Building Materials |publisher=McMullen Carpenters And Joiners |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; energy-efficient&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite web|title=A Green Home Begins with ENERGY STAR Blue |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/new_homes/Green_Begins_with_ENERGYSTAR_Blue.pdf|publisher=Energystar|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and sustainable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Basics.htm |title=Green Building Basics |publisher=Ciwmb.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; sources of building materials for use in construction projects. They also practice building methods that require using less material and material that has the same structural soundness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Defining Green-Collar Jobs
  |quote=There is no consensus on how to define green-collar jobs. A very broad interpretation of green jobs would include all existing and new jobs that contribute to environmental quality through improved efficiencies, better resource management, and other technologies that successfully address the environmental challenges facing society. Probably the most concise, general definition is “well-paid, career track jobs that contribute directly to preserving or enhancing environmental quality” (Apollo Alliance 2008, 3). This definition suggests that green-collar jobs directly contribute to improving environmental quality, but would not include low-wage jobs that provide little mobility. Most discussion of green-collar jobs does not refer to positions that require a college degree, but they typically do involve training beyond high school. Many of the positions are similar to skilled, blue-collar jobs, such as electricians, welders, '''carpenters''', etc.
  |url=http://www.uwex.edu/CES/cced/communities/documents/GreenCollar.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recycled''' ('''reclaimed''', '''repurposed''') '''carpentry''' is carpentry that uses scrap wood and parts of discarded or broken furniture to build new wood products.

'''EARP''', also known as Electricity Access Rollout Program is a [[Rwanda]]n Government Program initiated in 2009 to synergise efforts to realize the country's targets for [[Mains electricity|electricity]] access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newtimes|title=We are targeting 70% energy access by 2018 — EWSA DG|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/PDF_ads/EWSA_EARP_ADVERTORIAL.pdf|website=newtimes.co.rw|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EARP was initiated in 2009 when the Government of Rwanda wanted to bring together all Development partners contribution in the energy sector, especially to increase the access rate in the Rwandan community. At that time, only 6% of Rwandan households were accessing [[Electrical grid|on-grid]] electricity.

So far, remarkable strides have been made by this programme under which access to the grid has increased from 364,000 households in June 2012 to more than 850,000 households (35.13 % of the total households in Rwanda) in 2018.

EARP mission goes in line with the Rwandan Government rural electrification policy which has set 100% access target by the year 2024 in Rwanda households and 100% of centers expected to boost the economic development commonly named "Productive use areas" by 2022. &lt;ref&gt;Rwanda Rural Electrification Strategy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity Access in Rwanda==

As of September 2018, the cumulative connectivity rate was 48.6% of Rwandan households including 36.5% connected to the national grid and 12.2% accessing through off-grid systems (mainly solar). 

During the elaboration of the Economic Development targets, the Government of Rwanda took a decision to diversify the sources of electricity from traditional dominant grid to include even off-grid connections. Subsequently, Households far away from the planned national grid coverage have been encouraged to use alternatively cheaper connections such as Mini-grids and Solar Photovoltaics (PVs) to reduce the cost of access to electricity whilst relieving constraints on historical government subsidies.

'''Eicosapentaenoic acid''' ('''EPA'''; also '''icosapentaenoic acid''') is an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:5(n-3). It also has the [[trivial name]] '''timnodonic acid'''. In chemical structure, EPA is a [[carboxylic acid]] with a 20-[[carbon]] chain and five ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' [[Double bond|double bonds]]; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end.

EPA is a [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA) that acts as a precursor for [[prostaglandin-3]] (which inhibits [[platelet aggregation]]), [[thromboxane-3]], and [[leukotriene-5]] [[eicosanoid]]s. EPA is both a precursor and the [[Hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[Metabolism|breakdown]] product of eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA: [[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;[[Biological functions of nitric oxide|NO]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; 20:5,n-3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucanic M, Held JM, Vantipalli MC, Klang IM, Graham JB, Gibson BW, Lithgow GJ, Gill MS | title = N-acylethanolamine signalling mediates the effect of diet on lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7346 | pages = 226–9 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21562563 | pmc = 3093655 | doi = 10.1038/nature10007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of [[fish oil]] supplements, which contain EPA, have failed to support claims of preventing [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] or [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150917-cz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Inuit Study Adds Twist to Omega-3 Fatty Acids’ Health Story |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/science/inuit-study-adds-twist-to-omega-3-fatty-acids-health-story.html |date=September 17, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150330"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=Anahad | name-list-format = vanc |title=Fish Oil Claims Not Supported by Research |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/30/fish-oil-claims-not-supported-by-research/ |date=March 30, 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=October 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAMA-201403"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grey A, Bolland M | title = Clinical trial evidence and use of fish oil supplements | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 460–2 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24352849 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.12765 | url = http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1787690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA is obtained in the human diet by eating [[oily fish]] or [[fish oil]], e.g. [[cod]] liver, [[herring]], [[mackerel]], [[salmon]], [[menhaden]] and [[sardine]], and various types of edible [[algae]]. It is also found in human [[breast milk]].

However, fish can either synthesize EPA from fatty acids precursors found in their alimentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Nutrient Requirements of Fish and Shrimp; National Research Council|title=Nutrient requirements of fish and shrimp|date=2011|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-16338-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or obtain it from the [[algae]] they consume.&lt;ref name=vegan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetarian-dha-epa.co.uk/|title=Plant based sources of vegan &amp; vegetarian Docosahexaenoic acid – DHA and Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA &amp; Essential Fats| first = Yvonne | last = Bishop-Weston | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available to humans from some non-animal sources (e.g. commercially, from [[microalgae]] such as ''Monodus subterraneus'',  ''Chlorella minutissima'' and ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society | date = 1998 | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 393–397 | title = Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid production potential of microalgae and their heterotrophic growth | first1 = Rema | last1 = Vazhappilly | first2 = Feng | last2 = Chen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are being developed as a commercial source).&lt;ref name=water4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutraingredients.com/news/ng.asp?n=73324-water-omega-algae|title=Water 4 to introduce algae DHA/EPA as food ingredient| first = Jess | last = Halliday | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 January 2007 |access-date=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA is not usually found in higher plants, but it has been reported in trace amounts in [[Portulaca oleracea|purslane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/Volume11/vol11sup2/S163.pdf | last = Simopoulos | first = Artemis P | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Omega-3 fatty acids in wild plants, nuts and seeds | journal = Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 11 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = S163–73 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-6047.11.s.6.5.x | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217190429/http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/Volume11/vol11sup2/S163.pdf | archive-date = 2008-12-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was reported that a genetically modified form of the plant [[Camelina]] produced significant amounts of EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruiz-Lopez N, Haslam RP, Napier JA, Sayanova O | title = Successful high-level accumulation of fish oil omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in a transgenic oilseed crop | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–208 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24308505 | pmc = 4253037 | doi = 10.1111/tpj.12378 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.12378/full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coghlan | first = Andy | name-list-format = vanc | date = 4 January 2014 | title = Designed plant oozes vital fish oils | journal = New Scientist | volume = 221 | issue = 2950 | page = 12| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129503.000-designer-plants-have-vital-fish-oils-in-their-seeds.html#.Us3gItIUQUo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body converts [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA) to EPA. ALA is itself an essential fatty acid, an appropriate supply of which must be ensured. The efficiency of the conversion of ALA to EPA, however, is much lower than the absorption of EPA from food containing it. Because EPA is also a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), ensuring a sufficient level of EPA on a diet containing neither EPA nor DHA is harder both because of the extra metabolic work required to synthesize EPA and because of the use of EPA to metabolize into DHA. Medical conditions like [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or certain allergies may significantly limit the human body's capacity for metabolization of EPA from ALA.

[[File:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Salmon]] is a rich source of EPA.]]
The US [[National Institute of Health]]'s MedlinePlus lists medical conditions for which EPA (alone or in concert with other ω-3 sources) is known or thought to be an effective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-fishoil.html |title=MedlinePlus Herbs and Supplements: Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, alpha-linolenic acid |author=NIH Medline Plus |access-date=February 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208023339/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-fishoil.html |archive-date=February 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these involve its ability to lower [[inflammation]].

Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (&gt; 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).

It appears that both EPA and DHA lower triglycerides, however DHA appears to raise [[low-density lipoprotein]] (the variant which drives atherosclerosis; sometimes inaccurately called: "bad cholesterol") and [[LDL-C]] values (always only a calculated estimate; not measured by labs from person's blood sample for technical and cost reasons), while EPA does not.

The big difference between [[fish oil]] dietary supplement and prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids is that the prescription variants are concentrated to markedly increase the amount of these key fatty acids per capsule over the many other fats present in "fish oil" and the mercury, also present in "fish oil", has been removed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

EPA and DHA [[ethyl ester]]s (all forms) may be absorbed less well, thus work less well, when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal.&lt;ref name="NLApt2-2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacobson TA, Maki KC, Orringer CE, Jones PH, Kris-Etherton P, Sikand G, La Forge R, Daniels SR, Wilson DP, Morris PB, Wild RA, Grundy SM, Daviglus M, Ferdinand KC, Vijayaraghavan K, Deedwania PC, Aberg JA, Liao KP, McKenney JM, Ross JL, Braun LT, Ito MK, Bays HE, Brown WV, Underberg JA | title = National Lipid Association Recommendations for Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia: Part 2 | journal = Journal of Clinical Lipidology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = S1-122.e1 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26699442 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacl.2015.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA, have been studied for their effect on [[Autistic Spectrum Disorder|autistic spectrum disorder]] (ASD). Some have theorized that, since omega-3 fatty acid levels may be low in children with autism, supplementation might lead to an improvement in symptoms. While some uncontrolled studies have reported improvements, well-controlled studies have shown no statistically significant improvement in symptoms as a result of high-dose omega-3 supplementation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bent S, Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = Omega-3 fatty acids for autistic spectrum disorder: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 8 | pages = 1145–54 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19333748 | pmc = 2710498 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-009-0724-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mankad D, Dupuis A, Smile S, Roberts W, Brian J, Lui T, Genore L, Zaghloul D, Iaboni A, Marcon PM, Anagnostou E | title = A randomized, placebo controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of young children with autism | journal = Molecular Autism | volume = 6 | pages = 18 | date = 2015-03-21 | pmid = 25798215 | pmc = 4367852 | doi = 10.1186/s13229-015-0010-7 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-015-0010-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric power transmission''' is the bulk movement of [[electrical energy]] from a generating site, such as a [[power plant]], to an [[electrical substation]]. The interconnected  lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as [[electric power distribution]]. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the "[[power grid]]" in [[North America]], or just "the grid". In the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]] and [[New Zealand]], the network is known as the "[[National Grid (disambiguation)|National Grid]]".

A  [[wide area synchronous grid]], also known as an "interconnection" in North America, directly connects a large number of generators delivering AC power with the same relative ''frequency'' to a large number of consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America (the [[Western Interconnection]], the [[Eastern Interconnection]], the [[Quebec Interconnection]] and the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT) grid). In Europe [[Synchronous grid of Continental Europe|one large grid connects most of continental Europe]].

Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have [[Electricity liberalization|liberalized]] the regulation of the [[electricity market]] in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.&lt;ref name=femp01&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-13906.pdf|title=A Primer on Electric Utilities, Deregulation, and Restructuring of U.S. Electricity Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP)|date=May 2002|format=pdf|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== System ==
Most transmission lines are high-voltage [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current]] (AC), although [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] AC is sometimes used in [[railway electrification system]]s. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) technology is used for greater efficiency over very long distances (typically hundreds of miles). HVDC technology is also used in [[submarine power cable]]s (typically longer than 30 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km)), and in the interchange of power between grids that are not mutually synchronized. HVDC links are used to stabilize large power distribution networks where sudden new loads, or blackouts, in one part of a network can result in synchronization problems and [[cascading failure]]s.

[[File:Electricity grid simple- North America.svg|thumb|400px|left|Diagram of an electric power system; transmission system is in blue]]

Electricity is transmitted at [[high voltage]]s (115&amp;nbsp;kV or above) to reduce the energy loss which occurs  in long-distance transmission. Power is usually transmitted through [[overhead power line]]s. [[Undergrounding|Underground power transmission]] has a significantly higher installation cost and greater operational limitations, but reduced maintenance costs. Underground transmission is sometimes used in urban areas or environmentally sensitive locations.

A lack of electrical energy storage facilities in transmission systems leads to a key limitation. Electrical energy must be generated at the same rate at which it is consumed. A sophisticated control system is required to ensure that the [[power generation]] very closely matches the demand. If the demand for power exceeds supply, the imbalance can cause generation plant(s) and transmission equipment to automatically disconnect or shut down to prevent damage. In the worst case, this may lead to a cascading series of shut downs and a major regional [[power outage|blackout]]. Examples include the US Northeast blackouts of [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|1965]], [[New York City blackout of 1977|1977]], [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003]], and major blackouts in other US regions in [[1996 Western North America blackouts|1996]] and [[2011 Southwest blackout|2011]]. Electric transmission networks are interconnected into regional, national, and even continent wide networks to reduce the risk of such a failure by providing multiple [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]], alternative routes for power to flow should such shut downs occur. Transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network.

== Overhead transmission ==

}}

High-voltage overhead conductors are not covered by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an [[aluminum]] alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (#6 [[American wire gauge]]) to 750&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,590,000&amp;nbsp;circular mils area), with varying resistance and [[current-carrying capacity]]. For normal AC lines thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the [[skin effect]] (which causes most of the current to flow close to the surface of the wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called [[bundle conductor]]s) are used when higher capacity is needed. Bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by [[corona discharge]].

Today, transmission-level voltages are usually considered to be 110&amp;nbsp;kV and above. Lower voltages, such as 66&amp;nbsp;kV and 33&amp;nbsp;kV, are usually considered [[#Subtransmission|subtransmission]] voltages, but are occasionally used on long lines with light loads. Voltages less than 33&amp;nbsp;kV are usually used for [[electricity distribution|distribution]]. Voltages above 765&amp;nbsp;kV are considered [[high voltage#Power lines|extra high voltage]] and require different designs compared to equipment used at lower voltages.

Since overhead transmission wires depend on air for insulation, the design of these lines requires minimum clearances to be observed to maintain safety. Adverse weather conditions, such as high wind and low temperatures, can lead to power outages. Wind speeds as low as {{convert|23|kn|km/h}} can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances, resulting in a [[Electric arc|flashover]] and loss of supply.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Dieter Betz, Ulrich Schumann, Pierre Laroche (2009).

Oscillatory motion of the physical line can be termed [[conductor gallop|gallop]] or [[conductor gallop|flutter]] depending on the frequency and amplitude of oscillation.

== Underground transmission ==
{{Main article|Undergrounding}}

Electric power can also be transmitted by [[high-voltage cable|underground power cables]] instead of overhead power lines. Underground cables take up less right-of-way than overhead lines, have lower visibility, and are less affected by bad weather. However, costs of insulated cable and excavation are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair. 

In some metropolitan areas, underground transmission cables are enclosed by metal pipe and insulated with dielectric fluid (usually an oil) that is either static or circulated via pumps. If an electric fault damages the pipe and produces a dielectric leak into the surrounding soil, liquid nitrogen trucks are mobilized to freeze portions of the pipe to enable the draining and repair of the damaged pipe location. This type of underground transmission cable can prolong the repair period and increase repair costs. The temperature of the pipe and soil are usually monitored constantly throughout the repair period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/16/us/after-attacks-workers-con-edison-crews-improvise-they-rewire-truncated-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId={5B2369A6-97FC-4613-AD8B-91E23D41AC05}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NYSPSC case no. 13-E-0529&lt;/ref&gt; 

Underground lines are strictly limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating than overhead lines. Long underground AC cables have significant [[capacitance]], which may reduce their ability to provide useful power to loads beyond {{convert|50|mi|abbr=off}}. DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance, however, they do require [[HVDC converter station]]s at both ends of the line to convert from DC to AC before being interconnected with the transmission network.

[[File:New York utility lines in 1890.jpg|thumb|New York City streets in 1890. Besides telegraph lines, multiple electric lines were required for each class of device requiring different voltages]]

In the early days of commercial electric power, transmission of electric power at the same voltage as used by lighting and mechanical loads restricted the distance between generating plant and consumers. In 1882, generation was with [[direct current]] (DC), which could not easily be increased in voltage for long-distance transmission. Different classes of loads (for example, lighting, fixed motors, and traction/railway systems) required different voltages, and so used different generators and circuits.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=westinghouse+%22universal+system%22|pages=119–122|author=Thomas P.

Due to this specialization of lines and because transmission was inefficient for low-voltage high-current circuits, generators needed to be near their loads. It seemed, at the time, that the industry would develop into what is now known as a [[distributed generation]] system with large numbers of small generators located near their loads.&lt;ref name=ncep1&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf |title=Electricity Transmission: A primer|author= National Council on Electricity Policy|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmission of electric power with [[alternating current]] (AC) became possible after [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] built what they called the secondary generator, an early transformer provided with 1:1 turn ratio and open magnetic circuit, in 1881.

The first long distance AC line was {{convert|34|km|abbr=off}} long, built for the 1884 International Exhibition of [[Turin, Italy]]. It was powered by a 2 kV, 130&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] alternator and featured several Gaulard secondary generators with their primary windings connected in series, which fed incandescent lamps. The system proved the feasibility of AC electric power transmission on long distances.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;

A very first operative AC line was put into service in 1885 in via dei Cerchi, [[Rome, Italy]], for public lighting. It was powered by two Siemens &amp; Halske alternators rated 30&amp;nbsp;hp (22&amp;nbsp;kW), 2 kV at 120&amp;nbsp;Hz and used 19&amp;nbsp;km of cables and 200&amp;nbsp;parallel-connected 2 kV to 20&amp;nbsp;V step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit, one for each lamp. Few months later it was followed by the first British AC system, which was put into service at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], London. It also featured Siemens alternators and 2.4 kV to 100&amp;nbsp;V step-down transformers &amp;ndash; one per user &amp;ndash; with shunt-connected primaries.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Beginning of Electric Energy Transmission: Part Two|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=52–59|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2256297|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William-Stanley jr.jpg|thumbnail|left|Working for Westinghouse, William Stanley Jr. spent his time recovering from illness in Great Barrington installing what is considered the world's first practical AC transformer system.]]
Working from what he considered an impractical Gaulard-Gibbs design, electrical engineer [[William Stanley, Jr.]] developed what is considered the first practical series AC transformer in 1885.&lt;ref name="edisontechcenter.org"&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html Great Barrington 1886 - Inspiring an industry toward AC power]&lt;/ref&gt; Working with the support of [[George Westinghouse]], in 1886 he installed demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]. Powered by a steam engine driven 500&amp;nbsp;V Siemens generator, voltage was stepped down to 100&amp;nbsp;Volts using the new Stanley transformer to power incandescent lamps at 23&amp;nbsp;businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethw.org/William_Stanley ethw.org - William Stanley, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; This practical demonstration of a transformer and alternating current lighting system would lead Westinghouse to begin installing AC based systems later that year.&lt;ref name="edisontechcenter.org"/&gt;

1888 saw designs for a functional [[AC motor]], something these systems had lacked up till then. These were [[induction motor]]s running on [[polyphase system|polyphase]] current, independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] (with Tesla’s design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Arnold Heertje]], Mark Perlman [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQMOPjUgWHsC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=tesla+motors+sparked+induction+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0d_SjX8YX&amp;sig=sA8LhTkGdQtgByBPD_ZDalCBwQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XoVSUPnfJo7A9gSwiICYCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20motors%20sparked%20induction%20motor&amp;f=false Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics], page 138&lt;/ref&gt; Practical use of these types of motors would be delayed many years by development problems and the scarcity of poly-phase power systems needed to power them.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, W.

The late 1880s and early 1890s would see a financial merger of many smaller electric companies into a few larger corporations such as [[Ganz Works|Ganz]] and [[AEG]] in Europe and [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US. These companies continued to develop AC systems but the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems would follow a much longer technical merger.&lt;ref name="Thomas Parke Hughes 1930, pages 120-121"/&gt; Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In what was becoming a ''universal system'', these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of [[rotary converter]]s and [[motor-generator]]s that would allow the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid.&lt;ref name="Thomas Parke Hughes 1930, pages 120-121"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Parke Hughes|title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930|publisher=JHU Press|year=1993|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raghu Garud 2009, page 249"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Raghu|last1=Garud|first2=Arun|last2=Kumaraswamy|first3= Richard|last3= Langlois|title= Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009| page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stopgaps would slowly be replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.

Such polyphase innovations revolutionized transmission]]

The first transmission of single-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in Oregon in 1890 when power was delivered from a hydroelectric plant at Willamette Falls to the city of Portland 14 miles downriver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argersinger|first=R.E.|date=1915|title=Electric Transmission of Power|url=|journal=General Electric Review|volume=XVIII|pages=454|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition – 1891|international electricity exhibition]] in [[Frankfurt]]. A 15 kV transmission line, approximately 175&amp;nbsp;km long, connected [[Lauffen, Baden-Württemberg|Lauffen on the Neckar]] and Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiessling F, Nefzger P, Nolasco JF, Kaintzyk U. (2003). ''Overhead power lines''. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems each operating at more than 70 kV were in service. The highest voltage then used was 150 kV.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp.&amp;nbsp;282–283&lt;/ref&gt;
By allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area, electricity production cost was reduced. The most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced, since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area. Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to lower energy production cost.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-2"/&gt;

The rapid industrialization in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century made electrical transmission lines and grids a [[critical infrastructure]] item in most industrialized nations. The interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was greatly spurred by the requirements of [[World War I]], with large electrical generating plants built by governments to provide power to munitions factories. Later these generating plants were connected to supply civil loads through long-distance transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp.&amp;nbsp;293–295&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

== Bulk power transmission ==
[[File:Transmissionsubstation.jpg|thumb|A [[Electrical substation|transmission substation]] decreases the voltage of incoming electricity, allowing it to connect from long distance high voltage transmission, to local lower voltage distribution. It also reroutes power to other transmission lines that serve local markets. This is the [[PacifiCorp]] Hale Substation, [[Orem, Utah]], USA]]

Engineers design transmission networks to transport the energy as efficiently as feasible, while at the same time taking into account economic factors, network safety and redundancy. These networks use components such as power lines, cables, [[circuit breaker]]s, switches and [[transformer]]s. The transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a [[regional transmission organization]] or [[transmission system operator]].

Transmission efficiency is greatly improved by devices that increase the voltage (and thereby proportionately reduce the current), in the line conductors, thus allowing power to be transmitted with acceptable losses. The reduced current flowing through the line reduces the heating losses in the conductors. According to [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]], energy losses are directly proportional to the square of the current. Thus, reducing the current by a factor of two will lower the energy lost to conductor resistance by a factor of four for any given size of conductor.

The optimum size of a conductor for a given voltage and current can be estimated by [[Kelvin's law for conductor size]], which states that the size is at its optimum when the annual cost of energy wasted in the resistance is equal to the annual capital charges of providing the conductor. At times of lower interest rates, Kelvin's law indicates that thicker wires are optimal; while, when metals are expensive, thinner conductors are indicated: however, power lines are designed for long-term use, so Kelvin's law has to be used in conjunction with long-term estimates of the price of copper and aluminum as well as interest rates for capital.

The increase in voltage is achieved in AC circuits by using a ''step-up [[transformer]]''. [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] systems require relatively costly conversion equipment which may be economically justified for particular projects such as submarine cables and longer distance high capacity point-to-point transmission. HVDC is necessary for the import and export of energy between grid systems that are not synchronized with each other.

A transmission grid is a network of [[power station]]s, transmission lines, and [[Electrical substation|substations]]. Energy is usually transmitted within a grid with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current|AC]]. Single-phase AC is used only for distribution to end users since it is not usable for large polyphase [[induction motor]]s. In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, two-phase transmission was used but required either four wires or three wires with unequal currents. Higher order phase systems require more than three wires, but deliver little or no benefit.

[[File:ElectricityUCTE.svg|thumb|left|The [[wide area synchronous grid|synchronous grids]] of the [[European Union]]]]

The price of electric power station capacity is high, and electric demand is variable, so it is often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally. Because loads are often regionally correlated (hot weather in the Southwest portion of the US might cause many people to use air conditioners), electric power often comes from distant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions, [[wide area synchronous grid|wide area transmission grids]] now span countries and even continents. The web of interconnections between power producers and consumers should enable power to flow, even if some links are inoperative.

The unvarying (or slowly varying over many hours) portion of the electric demand is known as the ''[[base load power plant|base load]]'' and is generally served by large facilities (which are more efficient due to economies of scale) with fixed costs for fuel and operation. Such facilities are nuclear, coal-fired or hydroelectric, while other energy sources such as [[Solar thermal energy|concentrated solar thermal]] and [[geothermal power]] have the potential to provide base load power. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics, wind, wave, and tidal, are, due to their intermittency, not considered as supplying "base load" but will still add power to the grid. The remaining or 'peak' power demand, is supplied by [[peaking power plant]]s, which are typically smaller, faster-responding, and higher cost sources, such as combined cycle or combustion turbine plants fueled by natural gas.

Long-distance transmission of electricity (hundreds of kilometers) is cheap and efficient, with costs of US$0.005–0.02 per kWh (compared to annual averaged large producer costs of US$0.01–0.025 per kWh, retail rates upwards of US$0.10 per kWh, and multiples of retail for instantaneous suppliers at unpredicted highest demand moments).&lt;ref name="limits-of-very-long-distance"/&gt; Thus distant suppliers can be cheaper than local sources (e.g., New York often buys over 1000&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity from Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Zone Maps|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/maps/index.jsp|publisher=New York Independent System Operator|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple '''local sources''' (even if more expensive and infrequently used) can make the transmission grid more fault tolerant to weather and other disasters that can disconnect distant suppliers.

[[File:Electicaltransmissionlines3800ppx.JPG|thumb|A high-power electrical transmission tower, 230&amp;nbsp;kV, double-circuit, also double-bundled]]

Long-distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to be used to displace fossil fuel consumption. Hydro and wind sources cannot be moved closer to populous cities, and solar costs are lowest in remote areas where local power needs are minimal. Connection costs alone can determine whether any particular renewable alternative is economically sensible. Costs can be prohibitive for transmission lines, but various proposals for massive infrastructure investment in high capacity, very long distance [[super grid]] transmission networks could be recovered with modest usage fees.

=== Grid input ===
At the [[power station]]s, the power is produced at a relatively low voltage between about 2.3&amp;nbsp;kV and 30&amp;nbsp;kV, depending on the size of the unit. The generator terminal voltage is then stepped up by the power station [[transformer]] to a higher [[voltage]] (115&amp;nbsp;kV to 765&amp;nbsp;kV AC, varying by the transmission system and by the country) for transmission over long distances.

In the United States, power transmission is, variously, 230&amp;nbsp;kV to 500&amp;nbsp;kV, with less than 230&amp;nbsp;kV or more than 500&amp;nbsp;kV being local exceptions. For example, the Western System has two primary interchange voltages: 500&amp;nbsp;kV AC at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, and ±500&amp;nbsp;kV (1,000&amp;nbsp;kV net) DC from North to South (U.S.-Canada border to U.S.-Mexico border).

The 287.5&amp;nbsp;kV ([[Hoover Dam|Hoover]] to [[Los Angeles]] line, via [[Victorville]]) and 345&amp;nbsp;kV ([[Arizona Public Service|APS]] line) being local standards, both of which were implemented before 500&amp;nbsp;kV became practical, and thereafter the Western System standard.

=== Losses ===
Transmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to [[Joule heating|resistance]], which varies depending on the specific conductors, the current flowing, and the length of the transmission line. For example, a {{convert|100|mile|abbr=on}} span at 765&amp;nbsp;kV carrying 1000&amp;nbsp;MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345&amp;nbsp;kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%.&lt;ref&gt;American Electric Power, Transmission Facts, page&amp;nbsp;4: http://www.aep.com/about/transmission/docs/transmission-facts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For a given amount of power, a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the [[resistive loss]]es in the conductor. For example, raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the &lt;math&gt;I^2 R&lt;/math&gt; losses by a factor of 100, provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases. Even if the conductor size (cross-sectional area) is decreased ten-fold to match the lower current, the &lt;math&gt;I^2 R&lt;/math&gt; losses are still reduced ten-fold. Long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;kV. At extremely high voltages, more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;kV exists between conductor and ground, [[corona discharge]] losses are so large that they can offset the lower resistive losses in the line conductors. Measures to reduce corona losses include conductors having larger diameters; often hollow to save weight,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/deltasub/pea/16_corona_and_induced_currents.pdf California Public Utilities Commission] Corona and induced currents&lt;/ref&gt; or bundles of two or more conductors.

Factors that affect the resistance, and thus loss, of conductors used in transmission and distribution lines include temperature, spiraling, and the [[skin effect]]. The resistance of a conductor increases with its temperature. Temperature changes in electric power lines can have a significant effect on power losses in the line. Spiraling, which refers to the way stranded conductors spiral about the center, also contributes to increases in conductor resistance. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of a conductor to increase at higher alternating current frequencies.

Transmission and distribution losses in the USA were estimated at 6.6% in 1997&lt;ref name="tonto.eia.doe.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3 |title=Where can I find data on electricity transmission and distribution losses? |date=19 November 2009 |work=Frequently Asked Questions – Electricity |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6.5% in 2007.&lt;ref name="tonto.eia.doe.gov"/&gt; In general, losses are estimated from the discrepancy between power produced (as reported by power plants) and power sold to the end customers; the difference between what is produced and what is consumed constitute transmission and distribution losses, assuming no utility theft occurs.

As of 1980, the longest cost-effective distance for [[Direct current|direct-current]] transmission was determined to be {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=off}}. For [[alternating current]] it was {{convert|4000|km|mi|abbr=off}}, though all transmission lines in use today are substantially shorter than this.&lt;ref name="limits-of-very-long-distance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/technical-articles/transmission/cigre/present-limits-of-very-long-distance-transmission-systems/index.shtml |title=Present Limits of Very Long Distance Transmission Systems | first1 = L. | last1 = Paris | first2 = G. | last2 = Zini | first3 = M. | last3 = Valtorta | first4 = G. | last4 = Manzoni | first5 = A. | last5 = Invernizzi | first6 = N. | last6 = De Franco | first7 = A. | last7 = Vian |year=1984 |work=[[CIGRE]] International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems, 1984 Session, 29&amp;nbsp;August &amp;ndash; 6&amp;nbsp;September |publisher=[[Global Energy Network Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011 |format=pdf}} 4.98&amp;nbsp;MB&lt;/ref&gt;

In any alternating current transmission line, the [[inductance]] and capacitance of the conductors can be significant. Currents that flow solely in ‘reaction’ to these properties of the circuit, (which together with the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] define the [[electrical impedance|impedance]]) constitute [[reactive power]] flow, which transmits no ‘real’ power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause extra heating losses in the transmission circuit. The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the [[power factor]]. As reactive current increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as [[phase-shifting transformer]]s; [[static VAR compensator]]s; and [[flexible AC transmission system]]s, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.

=== Transposition ===
Current flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field that surrounds the lines of each phase and affects the [[inductance]] of the surrounding conductors of other phases. The mutual inductance of the conductors is partially dependent on the physical orientation of the lines with respect to each other. Three-phase power transmission lines are conventionally strung with phases separated on different vertical levels. The mutual inductance seen by a conductor of the phase in the middle of the other two phases will be different than the inductance seen by the conductors on the top or bottom. An imbalanced inductance among the three conductors is problematic because it may result in the middle line carrying a disproportionate amount of the total power transmitted. Similarly, an imbalanced load may occur if one line is consistently closest to the ground and operating at a lower impedance. Because of this phenomenon, conductors must be periodically transposed along the length of the transmission line so that each phase sees equal time in each relative position to balance out the mutual inductance seen by all three phases. To accomplish this, line position is swapped at specially designed [[transposition tower]]s at regular intervals along the length of the transmission line in various [[Transposition (telecommunications)|transposition schemes]].

=== Subtransmission ===
[[File:Cavite, Batangas jf0557 11.jpg|thumb|175px|A 115&amp;nbsp;kV subtransmission line in the [[Philippines]], along with 20&amp;nbsp;kV [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] lines and a [[street light]], all mounted in a wood [[Utility pole|subtransmission pole]]]]
[[File:Wood Pole Structure.JPG|thumb|173px|115 kV H-frame transmission tower]]

'''Subtransmission''' is part of an electric power transmission system that runs at relatively lower voltages. It is uneconomical to connect all [[electrical substation|distribution substation]]s to the high main transmission voltage, because the equipment is larger and more expensive. Typically, only larger substations connect with this high voltage. It is stepped down and sent to smaller substations in towns and neighborhoods. Subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not cut off service to a large number of customers for more than a short time. Loops can be "normally closed", where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption, or "normally open" where substations can switch to a backup supply. While subtransmission circuits are usually carried on [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]], in urban areas buried cable may be used. The lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures; it is much more feasible to put them underground where needed. Higher-voltage lines require more space and are usually above-ground since putting them underground is very expensive.

There is no fixed cutoff between subtransmission and transmission, or subtransmission and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]]. The voltage ranges overlap somewhat. Voltages of 69&amp;nbsp;kV, 115&amp;nbsp;kV, and 138&amp;nbsp;kV are often used for subtransmission in North America. As power systems evolved, voltages formerly used for transmission were used for subtransmission, and subtransmission voltages became distribution voltages. Like transmission, subtransmission moves relatively large amounts of power, and like distribution, subtransmission covers an area instead of just point-to-point.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty. (2007), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th&amp;nbsp;Edition)''. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-144146-9}} section&amp;nbsp;18.5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmission grid exit ===
At the [[electrical substation|substations]], transformers reduce the voltage to a lower level for [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] to commercial and residential users. This distribution is accomplished with a combination of sub-transmission (33 to 132&amp;nbsp;kV) and distribution (3.3 to 25&amp;nbsp;kV). Finally, at the point of use, the energy is transformed to low voltage (varying by country and customer requirements &amp;ndash; see [[Mains electricity by country]]).

== Advantage of high-voltage power transmission ==
{{See also|ideal transformer}}
High-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances in the wiring. This efficiency of high voltage transmission allows for the transmission of a larger proportion of the generated power to the substations and in turn to the loads, translating to operational cost savings.

[[File:Power split two resistances.svg|thumb|Electrical grid without a transformer.]]
[[File:Transformer power split.svg|thumb|Electrical grid with a transformer.]]
In a very simplified model, assume the [[electrical grid]] delivers electricity from a generator (modelled as an [[ideal voltage source]] with voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, delivering a power &lt;math&gt;P_V&lt;/math&gt;) to a single point of consumption, modelled by a pure resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, when the wires are long enough to have a significant resistance &lt;math&gt;R_C&lt;/math&gt;.

If the resistance are simply [[in series]] without any transformer between them, the circuit acts as a [[voltage divider]], because the same current &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{V}{R+R_C}&lt;/math&gt; runs through the wire resistance and the powered device. As a consequence, the useful power (used at the point of consumption) is:
:&lt;math&gt;P_R= V_2\times I = V\frac{R}{R+R_C}\times\frac{V}{R+R_C} = \frac{R}{R+R_C}\times\frac{V^2}{R+R_C} = \frac{R}{R+R_C} P_V&lt;/math&gt;
Assume now that a transformer converts high-voltage, low-current electricity transported by the wires into low-voltage, high-current electricity for use at the consumption point. If we suppose it is an [[ideal transformer]] with a voltage ratio of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the voltage is divided by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the current is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the secondary branch, compared to the primary branch), then the circuit is again equivalent to a voltage divider, but the transformer-consumption branch has an apparent resistance of &lt;math&gt;a^2 R&lt;/math&gt;. The useful power is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_R= V_2\times I_2 = \frac{a^2R\times V^2}{(a^2 R+R_C)^2} = \frac{a^2 R}{a^2 R+R_C} P_V&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. conversion of high voltage to low voltage near the consumption point), a larger fraction of the generator's power is transmitted to the consumption point and a lesser fraction is lost to [[Joule heating]].

== Modeling and the transmission matrix ==

[[File:Transmission Line Black Box.JPG|thumb|350px|"Black box" model for transmission line]]Oftentimes, we are only interested in the terminal characteristics of the transmission line, which are the voltage and current at the sending and receiving ends. The transmission line itself is then modeled as a "black box" and a 2&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;2 transmission matrix is used to model its behavior, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	V_\mathrm{S}\\
	I_\mathrm{S}\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	A &amp; B\\
	C &amp; D\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	V_\mathrm{R}\\
	I_\mathrm{R}\\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The line is assumed to be a reciprocal, symmetrical network, meaning that the receiving and sending labels can be switched with no consequence. The transmission matrix '''T''' also has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;\det(T) = AD - BC = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A = D&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' differ depending on how the desired model handles the line's [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] (''R''), [[inductance]] (''L''), [[capacitance]] (''C''), and shunt (parallel, leak) [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] ''G''. The four main models are the short line approximation, the medium line approximation, the long line approximation (with distributed parameters), and the lossless line. In all models described, a capital letter such as ''R'' refers to the total quantity summed over the line and a lowercase letter such as ''c'' refers to the per-unit-length quantity.

===Lossless line===
The '''lossless line''' approximation is the least accurate model; it is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line is much greater than its resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.
[[File:Losslessline.jpg|thumb|Voltage on sending and receiving ends for lossless line]]
The characteristic impedance  is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance, and it is often called '''surge impedance''' for a lossless line. When lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, there is no voltage drop. Though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant along the length of the line. For load&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;SIL, the voltage will drop from sending end and the line will “consume” VARs. For load&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;SIL, the voltage will increase from sending end, and the line will “generate” VARs.

===Short line===
The '''short line''' approximation is normally used for lines less than 50&amp;nbsp;miles long. For a short line, only a series impedance ''Z'' is considered, while ''C'' and ''G'' are ignored. The final result is that '''A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;D&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 per unit''', '''B&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Z&amp;nbsp;Ohms''', and '''C&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0'''. The associated transition matrix for this approximation is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	V_\mathrm{S}\\
	I_\mathrm{S}\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 &amp; Z\\
	0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	V_\mathrm{R}\\
	I_\mathrm{R}\\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Medium line===
The '''medium line''' approximation is used for lines between 50 and 150&amp;nbsp;miles long. In this model, the series impedance and the shunt (current leak) conductance are considered, with half of the shunt conductance being placed at each end of the line. This circuit is often referred to as a “nominal [[π|''π'' (pi)]]” circuit because of the shape (''π'') that is taken on when leak conductance is placed on both sides of the circuit diagram. The analysis of the medium line brings one to the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A &amp;= D = 1 + \frac{G Z}{2} \text{ per unit}\\
B &amp;= Z\Omega\\
C &amp;= G \Big( 1 + \frac{G Z}{4}\Big)S
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Counterintuitive behaviors of medium-length transmission lines:

* voltage rise at no load or small current
* receiving-end current can exceed sending-end current

===Long line===
The '''long line''' model is used when a higher degree of accuracy is needed or when the line under consideration is more than 150&amp;nbsp;miles long. Series resistance and shunt conductance are considered as distributed parameters, meaning each differential length of the line has a corresponding differential resistance and shunt admittance. The following result can be applied at any point along the transmission line, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[propagation constant]].

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A = D &amp;= \cosh(\gamma x) \text{ per unit}\\[3mm]
B &amp;= Z_c \sinh(\gamma x) \Omega\\[2mm]
C &amp;= \frac{1}{Z_c} \sinh(\gamma x) S
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To find the voltage and current at the end of the long line, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix.

(For the full development of this model, see the [[Telegrapher's equations]].)

== High-voltage direct current ==
{{Main article|High-voltage direct current}}

High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to transmit large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is to be transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use [[direct current]] instead of [[alternating current]]. For a very long transmission line, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the additional cost of the required converter stations at each end.

[[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] is also used for long [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] where AC cannot be used because of the cable capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}},  pages 15-57 and 15-58&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases special [[high-voltage cable]]s for DC are used. Submarine HVDC systems are often used to connect the electricity grids of islands, for example, between [[Great Britain]] and [[continental Europe]], between Great Britain and [[Ireland]], between [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australia]]n mainland, between the North and South Islands of [[New Zealand]], between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and between New Jersey and [[Long Island]]. Submarine connections up to {{convert|600|km}} in length are presently in use.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Alternating Evolution of DC Power Transmission|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60–63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2272238|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HVDC links can be used to control problems in the grid with AC electricity flow. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the [[phase angle]] between source end voltage and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle will allow the systems at either end of the line to fall out of step. Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks at either end of the link, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.

As an example, to adjust the flow of AC power on a hypothetical line between [[Seattle]] and [[Boston]] would require adjustment of the relative phase of the two regional electrical grids. This is an everyday occurrence in AC systems, but one that can become disrupted when AC system components fail and place unexpected loads on the remaining working grid system. With an HVDC line instead, such an interconnection would:
# Convert AC in Seattle into HVDC;
# Use HVDC for the 3,000&amp;nbsp;miles of cross-country transmission; and 
# Convert the HVDC to locally synchronized AC in Boston,
(and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route). Such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the [[Pacific DC Intertie]] located in the Western [[United States]].

== Capacity ==
&lt;!-- Linked from wind power. --&gt;
The amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line is limited. The origins of the limits vary depending on the length of the line. For a short line, the heating of conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conductors and equipment may be damaged by overheating. For intermediate-length lines on the order of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}}, the limit is set by the [[voltage drop]] in the line. For longer AC lines, [[utility frequency#Stability|system stability]] sets the limit to the power that can be transferred. Approximately, the power flowing over an AC line is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle of the voltage and current at the receiving and transmitting ends. This angle varies depending on system loading and generation. It is undesirable for the angle to approach 90 degrees, as the power flowing decreases but the resistive losses remain. Very approximately, the allowable product of line length and maximum load is proportional to the square of the system voltage. Series capacitors or phase-shifting transformers are used on long lines to improve stability. [[Electric power transmission#High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct current]] lines are restricted only by thermal and voltage drop limits, since the phase angle is not material to their operation.

Up to now, it has been almost impossible to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial [[distributed temperature sensing]] (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable is a first step in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage cable circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.

== Control ==
To ensure safe and predictable operation, the components of the transmission system are controlled with generators, switches, circuit breakers and loads. The voltage, power, frequency, load factor, and reliability capabilities of the transmission system are designed to provide cost effective performance for the customers.

=== Load balancing ===
The transmission system provides for base load and [[peaking power plant|peak load capability]], with safety and fault tolerance margins. The peak load times vary by region largely due to the industry mix. In very hot and very cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads have an effect on the overall load. They are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year. This makes the power requirements vary by the season and the time of day. Distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration.

The transmission system usually does not have a large buffering capability to match the loads with the generation. Thus generation has to be kept matched to the load, to prevent overloading failures of the generation equipment.

Multiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power. In centralized power generation, only local control of generation is necessary, and it involves [[alternator synchronization|synchronization of the generation units]], to prevent large transients and overload conditions.

In [[distributed generation|distributed power generation]] the generators are geographically distributed and the process to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled. The load control signals can either be sent on separate lines or on the power lines themselves. Voltage and frequency can be used as signalling mechanisms to balance the loads.

In voltage signaling, the variation of voltage is used to increase generation. The power added by any system increases as the line voltage decreases. This arrangement is stable in principle. Voltage-based regulation is complex to use in mesh networks, since the individual components and setpoints would need to be reconfigured every time a new generator is added to the mesh.

In frequency signaling, the generating units match the frequency of the power transmission system. In [[droop speed control]], if the frequency decreases, the power is increased. (The drop in line frequency is an indication that the increased load is causing the generators to slow down.)

[[Wind turbine]]s, [[vehicle-to-grid]] and other locally distributed storage and generation systems can be connected to the power grid, and interact with it to improve system operation. Internationally, the trend has been a slow move from a heavily centralized power system to a decentralized power system. The main draw of locally distributed generation systems which involve a number of new and innovative solutions is that they reduce transmission losses by leading to consumption of electricity closer to where it was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Failure protection ===
Under excess load conditions, the system can be designed to fail gracefully rather than all at once. [[Brownout (electricity)|Brownouts]] occur when the supply power drops below the demand. [[Power outage|Blackouts]] occur when the supply fails completely.

[[Rolling blackout]]s (also called load shedding) are intentionally engineered electrical power outages, used to distribute insufficient power when the demand for electricity exceeds the supply.

== Communications ==
Operators of long transmission lines require reliable communications for [[SCADA|control]] of the power grid and, often, associated generation and distribution facilities. Fault-sensing [[protective relay]]s at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power into and out of the protected line section so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the transmission line from [[short circuit]]s and other faults is usually so critical that [[common carrier]] telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, and in remote areas a common carrier may not be available. Communication systems associated with a transmission project may use:
* [[Microwave]]s
* [[Power-line communication]]
* [[Optical fiber]]s
Rarely, and for short distances, a utility will use pilot-wires strung along the transmission line path. Leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the electric power transmission organization.

Transmission lines can also be used to carry data: this is called power-line carrier, or [[power line communication|PLC]]. PLC signals can be easily received with a radio for the long wave range.

Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as [[optical ground wire]] (''OPGW''). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting (''ADSS'') cable, attached to the transmission line cross arms.

Some jurisdictions, such as [[Minnesota]], prohibit energy transmission companies from selling surplus communication bandwidth or acting as a telecommunications [[common carrier]]. Where the regulatory structure permits, the utility can sell capacity in extra [[dark fiber]]s to a common carrier, providing another revenue stream.

== Electricity market reform ==
{{Main article|Electricity market}}

Some regulators regard electric transmission to be a [[natural monopoly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are moves in many countries to separately regulate transmission (see [[electricity market]]).

[[Spain]] was the first country to establish a [[regional transmission organization]]. In that country, transmission operations and market operations are controlled by separate companies. The transmission system operator is [[Red Eléctrica de España]] (REE) and the wholesale electricity market operator is Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energía – Polo Español, S.A. (OMEL) [http://www.omel.es]. Spain's transmission system is interconnected with those of France, Portugal, and Morocco.

The establishment of RTOs in the United States was spurred by the [[FERC]]'s Order 888, ''Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities'', issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States and parts of Canada, several electric transmission companies operate independently of generation companies, but there are still regions - the Southern United States - where vertical integration of the electric system is intact. In regions of separation, transmission owners and generation owners continue to interact with each other as market participants with voting rights within their RTO. RTOs in the United States are regulated by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].

== Cost of electric power transmission ==
The cost of high voltage electricity transmission (as opposed to the costs of [[electric power distribution]]) is comparatively low, compared to all other costs arising in a consumer's electricity bill. In the UK, transmission costs are about 0.2&amp;nbsp;p per kWh compared to a delivered domestic price of around 10&amp;nbsp;p per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/what-is-the-cost-per-kwh-of-bulk-transmission-national-grid-in-the-uk-note-this-excludes-distribution-costs.html What is the cost per kWh of bulk transmission] / National Grid in the UK (note this excludes distribution costs)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Merchant transmission ==
Merchant transmission is an arrangement where a third party constructs and operates electric transmission lines through the franchise area of an unrelated incumbent utility.

Operating merchant transmission projects in the [[United States]] include the [[Cross Sound Cable]] from [[Shoreham, New York]] to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Neptune RTS Transmission Line from [[Sayreville, New Jersey]] to [[New Bridge, New York]], and [[Path 15]] in California. Additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the United States, including the Lake Erie Connector, an underwater transmission line proposed by ITC Holdings Corp., connecting Ontario to load serving entities in the PJM Interconnection region.&lt;ref&gt;How ITC Holdings plans to connect PJM demand with Ontario's rich renewables, Utility Dive, 8&amp;nbsp;Dec 2014, http://www.utilitydive.com/news/how-itc-holdings-plans-to-connect-pjm-demand-with-ontarios-rich-renewables/341524/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one unregulated or market interconnector in [[Australia]]: [[Basslink]] between [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Two DC links originally implemented as market interconnectors, [[Directlink]] and [[Murraylink]], have been converted to regulated interconnectors. [http://www.nemmco.com.au/psplanning/psplanning.html#interconnect NEMMCO]

A major barrier to wider adoption of merchant transmission is the difficulty in identifying who benefits from the facility so that the beneficiaries will pay the toll. Also, it is difficult for a merchant transmission line to compete when the alternative transmission lines are subsidized by incumbent utility businesses with a monopolized and regulated rate base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Health concerns ==
{{Main article|Electromagnetic radiation and health}}

Some large studies, including a large study in the United States, have failed to find any link between living near power lines and developing any sickness or diseases, such as cancer. A 1997 study found that it did not matter how close one was to a power line or a sub-station, there was no increased risk of cancer or illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s175.htm Power Lines and Cancer], The Health Report / ABC Science - Broadcast on 7&amp;nbsp;June 1997 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream scientific evidence suggests that low-power, low-frequency, electromagnetic radiation associated with household currents and high transmission power lines does not constitute a short or long term health hazard. Some studies, however, have found [[statistical correlation]]s between various diseases and living or working near power lines. No adverse health effects have been substantiated for people not living close to powerlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs322/en/ Electromagnetic fields and public health], [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York State Public Service Commission]] conducted a study, documented in ''Opinion No. 78-13'' (issued June 19, 1978), to evaluate potential health effects of electric fields. The study's case number is too old to be listed as a case number in the commission's online database, DMM, and so the original study can be difficult to find. The study chose to utilize the electric field strength that was measured at the edge of an existing (but newly built) right-of-way on a 765 kV transmission line from New York to Canada, 1.6 kV/m, as the interim standard maximum electric field at the edge of any new transmission line right-of-way built in New York State after issuance of the order. The opinion also limited the voltage of all new transmission lines built in New York to 345 kV. On September 11, 1990, after a similar study of magnetic field strengths, the NYSPSC issued their ''Interim Policy Statement on Magnetic Fields''. This study established established a magnetic field interim standard of 200 mG at the edge of the right-of-way using the winter-normal conductor rating. This later document can also be difficult to find on the NYSPSC's online database, since it predates the online database system. As a comparison with everyday items, a hair dryer or electric blanket produces a 100 mG - 500 mG magnetic field. An electric razor can produce 2.6 kV/m. Whereas electric fields can be shielded, magnetic fields cannot be shielded, but are usually minimized by optimizing the location of each phase of a circuit in cross-section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7BED95C2A2-2DEA-4FFC-A8DA-CD9C39F5D361%7D|title=EMF Report for the CHPE|pp=1-4|publisher=TRC|date=March 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/publications/resources/EMF-fact-sheet-3-2009.pdf|title=Electric and Magnetic Field Strengths|publisher=Transpower New Zealand Ltd|p=2|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a new transmission line is proposed, within the application to the applicable regulatory body (usually a public utility commission), there is often an analysis of electric and magnetic field levels at the edge of rights-of-way. These analyses are performed by a utility or by an electrical engineering consultant using modelling software. At least one state public utility commission has access to software developed by an engineer or engineers at the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] to analyze electric and magnetic fields at edge of rights-of-way for proposed transmission lines. Often, public utility commissions will not comment on any health impacts due to electric and magnetic fields and will refer information seekers to the state's affiliated department of health.

There are established biological effects for [[Acute toxicity|acute]] ''high'' level exposure to magnetic fields well above 100&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|µT]] (1&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]) (1,000 mG). In a residential setting, there is "limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals", in particular, childhood leukemia, ''associated with'' average exposure to residential power-frequency magnetic field above 0.3&amp;nbsp;µT (3&amp;nbsp;mG) to 0.4&amp;nbsp;µT (4&amp;nbsp;mG). These levels exceed average residential power-frequency magnetic fields in homes, which are about 0.07&amp;nbsp;µT (0.7&amp;nbsp;mG) in Europe and 0.11&amp;nbsp;µT (1.1&amp;nbsp;mG) in North America.&lt;ref name="WHOFactsheet322"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs322/en/index.html|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health|accessdate=23 January 2008 |date=June 2007|work= Fact sheet No.&amp;nbsp;322|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIEHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/docs/emf-02.pdf |title=Electric and Magnetic Fields Associated with the Use of Power |accessdate=29 January 2008 |date=June 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy by country ==
===United States===
The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) is the primary regulatory agency of electric power transmission and wholesale electricity sales within the United States. It was originally established by Congress in 1920 as the Federal Power Commission and has since undergone multiple name and responsibility modifications. That which is not regulated by FERC, primarily electric power distribution and the retail sale of power, is under the jurisdiction of state authority.

Two of the more notable U.S. energy policies impacting electricity transmission are [[Order No. 888]] and the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].

Order No.&amp;nbsp;888 adopted by FERC on 24&amp;nbsp;April 1996, was “designed to remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation’s electricity consumers. The legal and policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce.”&lt;ref name="Docket No. RM95-8-000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Order No. 888|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/rm95-8-00w.txt|publisher=United States of America Federal Energy Regulatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Order No.&amp;nbsp;888 required all public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities used for transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce, to have open access non-discriminatory transmission tariffs. These tariffs allow any electricity generator to utilize the already existing power lines for the transmission of the power that they generate.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) signed into law by congress on 8&amp;nbsp;August 2005, further expanded the federal authority of regulating power transmission. EPAct gave FERC significant new responsibilities including but not limited to the enforcement of electric transmission reliability standards and the establishment of rate incentives to encourage investment in electric transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy Policy Act of 2005 Fact Sheet|date=8 August 2006|publisher=FERC Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/fed-sta/epact-fact-sheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, local governments have exercised authority over the grid and have significant disincentives to encourage actions that would benefit states other than their own. Localities with cheap electricity have a disincentive to encourage making [[interstate commerce]] in electricity trading easier, since other regions will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates. For example, some regulators in Maine do not wish to address congestion problems because the congestion serves to keep Maine rates low.&lt;ref name=ncep2&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf |title=Electricity Transmission: A primer|author= National Council on Electricity Policy|page=32 (page&amp;nbsp;41 in .pdf)|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact, environmental, and perceived health concerns. In the US, generation is growing four times faster than transmission, but big transmission upgrades require the coordination of multiple states, a multitude of interlocking permits, and cooperation between a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid. From a policy perspective, the control of the grid is [[balkanized]], and even former [[United States Secretary of Energy|energy secretary]] [[Bill Richardson]] refers to it as a ''third world grid''. There have been efforts in the EU and US to confront the problem. The US national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity drove passage of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005|2005 energy act]] giving the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act. However, soon after the Department of Energy used its power to designate two [[National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor]]s, 14&amp;nbsp;senators signed a letter stating the DOE was being too aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Wald  | first = Matthew  | title = Wind Energy Bumps into Power Grid’s Limits  | date=27 August 2008  | page=A1  | accessdate=12 December 2008  | work=[[The New York Times]]  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?_r=2&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special transmission ==

=== Grids for railways ===
{{Main article|Traction power network}}

In some countries where [[electric locomotive]]s or [[electric multiple unit]]s run on low frequency AC power, there are separate single phase [[traction power network]]s operated by the railways. Prime examples are countries in Europe (including [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]) which utilize the older AC technology based on 16&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz (Norway and Sweden also use this frequency but use conversion from the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz public supply; Sweden has a 16&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz traction grid but only for part of the system).

=== Superconducting cables ===
[[High-temperature superconductor]]s (HTS) promise to revolutionize power distribution by providing lossless transmission of electrical power. The development of superconductors with transition temperatures higher than the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]] has made the concept of superconducting power lines commercially feasible, at least for high-load applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/77.920339 |author=Jacob Oestergaard |journal=IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity |title=Energy losses of superconducting power transmission cables in the grid |year=2001 |volume=11 |page=2375|display-authors=etal|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/4280307/%C3%B8stergaard.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that the waste would be halved using this method, since the necessary refrigeration equipment would consume about half the power saved by the elimination of the majority of resistive losses. Some companies such as [[Consolidated Edison]] and [[American Superconductor]] have already begun commercial production of such systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11907-superconducting-power-line-to-shore-up-new-york-grid.html 600m superconducting electricity line laid in New York]&lt;/ref&gt; In one hypothetical future system called a [[SuperGrid]], the cost of cooling would be eliminated by coupling the transmission line with a liquid hydrogen pipeline.

Superconducting cables are particularly suited to high load density areas such as the business district of large cities, where purchase of an [[easement]] for cables would be very costly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureenergies.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=237 Superconducting cables will be used to supply electricity to consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single wire earth return ===
{{Main article|Single-wire earth return}}

Single-wire earth return (SWER) or single wire ground return is a single-wire transmission line for supplying single-phase electrical power for an electrical grid to remote areas at low cost. It is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. Single wire earth return is also used for HVDC over submarine power cables.

=== Wireless power transmission ===
{{Main article|Wireless energy transfer}}

Both [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Hidetsugu Yagi]] attempted to devise systems for large scale wireless power transmission in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with no commercial success.

In November 2009, LaserMotive won the NASA 2009 Power Beaming Challenge by powering a cable climber 1&amp;nbsp;km vertically using a ground-based laser transmitter. The system produced up to 1&amp;nbsp;kW of power at the receiver end. In August 2010, NASA contracted with private companies to pursue the design of laser power beaming systems to power low earth orbit satellites and to launch rockets using laser power beams.

Wireless power transmission has been studied for transmission of power from [[solar power satellite]]s to the earth. A high power array of [[microwave]] or laser transmitters would beam power to a [[rectenna]]. Major engineering and economic challenges face any solar power satellite project.

[[File:Electrolytic Capacitor-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An assortment of electrolytic capacitors]]

An '''electrolytic capacitor''' (abbreviated '''e-cap''') is a polarized [[capacitor]] whose [[anode]] or positive plate is made of a metal that forms an insulating [[oxide]] layer through [[anodization]].  This oxide layer acts as the [[dielectric]] of the capacitor. A solid, liquid, or gel [[electrolyte]] covers the surface of this oxide layer, serving as the ([[cathode]]) or negative plate of the capacitor.  Due to their very thin dielectric oxide layer and enlarged anode surface, electrolytic capacitors have a much higher [[capacitance]]-[[voltage]] (CV) product per unit volume compared to [[ceramic capacitor]]s or [[film capacitor]]s, and so can have large capacitance values.  There are three families of electrolytic capacitor:  [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s, [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]], and [[Niobium capacitor|niobium electrolytic capacitors]].

The large capacitance of electrolytic capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals, and for storing large amounts of energy. They are widely used for decoupling or noise [[electronic filter|filtering]] in [[Power supply|power supplies]] and DC link circuits for [[variable-frequency drive]]s, for coupling signals between [[amplifier]] stages, and storing energy as in a [[flashlamp]].

Electrolytic capacitors are polarized components due to their asymmetrical construction, and must be operated with a higher voltage (ie, more positive) on the anode than on the cathode at all times.  For this reason the anode terminal is marked with a plus sign and the cathode with a minus sign. Applying a reverse polarity voltage, or a voltage exceeding the maximum rated working voltage of as little as 1 or 1.5 volts, can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor.  The failure of electrolytic capacitors can be hazardous, resulting in an explosion or fire.  Bipolar electrolytic capacitors which may be operated with either polarity are also made, using special constructions with two anodes connected in series.

==General Information==

===Electrolytic capacitors family tree===
As to the basic construction principles of electrolytic capacitors, there are three different types: aluminum, tantalum, and niobium capacitors. Each of these three capacitor families uses non-solid and solid manganese dioxide or solid polymer electrolytes, so a great spread of different combinations of anode material and solid or non-solid electrolytes is available.

[[File:E-cap-family-14-02-02.jpg|thumb|400px|center| Depending on the nature of the anode metal used and the electrolyte used, there is a wide variety of electrolytic capacitors]]

===Charge principle===
Like other conventional capacitors, electrolytic capacitors store the [[electric energy]] [[Static electricity|statically]] by [[Electric charge|charge]] separation in an [[electric field]] in the dielectric oxide layer between two [[electrode]]s. The non-solid or solid [[electrolyte]] in principle is the cathode, which thus forms the second electrode of the capacitor. This and the storage principle distinguish them from electrochemical capacitors or [[supercapacitor]]s, in which the electrolyte generally is the ionic conductive connection between two electrodes and the storage occurs with statically [[double-layer capacitance]] and electrochemical [[pseudocapacitance]].

===Basic materials and construction===
[[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of anodic oxidation (forming), in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]

Electrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, previously called “valve metals”, which on contact with a particular electrolyte form a very thin insulating oxide layer on their surface by [[anodizing|anodic]] [[oxidation]] which can function as a dielectric.  There are three different anode metals in use for electrolytic capacitors:
# [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s use a high-purity etched [[aluminium]] foil with [[aluminium oxide]] as dielectric
# [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] use a sintered pellet (“slug”) of high-purity [[tantalum]] powder with [[tantalum pentoxide]] as dielectric
# [[Niobium capacitor|Niobium electrolytic capacitors]] use a sintered "slug" of high-purity [[niobium]] or [[niobium oxide]] powder with [[niobium pentoxide]] as dielectric.

To increase their capacitance per unit volume, all anode materials are either etched or sintered and have a rough surface structure with a much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. By applying a positive voltage to the above-mentioned anode material in an electrolytic bath an oxide barrier layer with a thickness corresponding to the applied voltage will be formed (formation). This oxide layer acts as dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of this oxide layers are given in the following table:

&lt;/center&gt;

After forming a dielectric oxide on the rough anode structure, a counter electrode has to match the rough insulating oxide surface. This is accomplished by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally they are distinguished into two species, “non-solid” and “solid” electrolytes. As a liquid medium which has [[ion]] [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] caused by moving ions, non-solid electrolytes can easily fit the rough structures. Solid electrolytes which have electron conductivity can fit the rough structures with the help of special chemical processes like [[pyrolysis]] for [[manganese dioxide]] or [[polymerization]] for conducting [[polymer]]s.

Comparing the permittivities of the different oxide materials it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has a permittivity approximately three times higher than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value theoretically are therefore smaller than aluminium electrolytic capacitors. In practice different safety margins to reach reliable components makes a comparison difficult.

The anodically generated insulating oxide layer is destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage changes.

===Capacitance and volumetric efficiency===
[[Image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|right|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''' and with separation '''''d'''''.]]
Electrolytic capacitors are based on the principle of a "plate capacitor" whose capacitance increases with larger electrode area A, higher dielectric [[permittivity]] ε, and thinner dielectric (d).

:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very small, in the range of [[Meter|nanometers]] per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficiently high dielectric strength the electrolytic capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.

All etched or sintered anodes have a much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.&lt;ref name=Voltage&gt;A. Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, Keep your distance – Voltage Proof of Electrolytic Capacitors, [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/3-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Voltage-Proof-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdk.com/e/productinfo/specifications/c-03-02-03-e.pdf|title=KDK, Specifications for Etched Foil for Anode, Low Voltage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horacek"&gt;I.Horacek, T.Zednicek, S.Zednicek, T.Karnik, J.Petrzilek, P.Jacisko, P.Gregorova, AVX, High CV Tantalum Capacitors - Challenges and Limitations [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/highcvtant.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309021406/http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/highcvtant.pdf |date=2014-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large surface compared to a smooth one is the second reason for the relatively high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other capacitor families.

Because the forming voltage defines the oxide layer thickness, the desired voltage rating can be produced very simply. Electrolytic capacitors have high [[volumetric efficiency]], the so-called "CV product", defined as the product of capacitance and voltage divide by volume.

The non-solid or so-called "wet" aluminum electrolytic capacitors were and are the cheapest among all other conventional capacitors. They not only provide the cheapest solutions for high capacitance or voltage values for decoupling and buffering purposes but are also insensitive to low ohmic charging and discharging as well as to low-energy transients. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors can be found in nearly all areas of electronic devices, with the exception of military applications.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte as surface-mountable chip capacitors are mainly used in electronic devices in which little space is available or a low profile is required. They operate reliably over a wide temperature range without large parameter deviations. In military and space applications only tantalum electrolytic capacitors have the necessary approvals.

Niobium electrolytic capacitors are in direct competition with industrial tantalum electrolytic capacitors because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.

The electrical properties of aluminum, tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors have been greatly improved by the polymer electrolyte.

===Comparison of electrical parameters===
In order to compare the different characteristics of the different electrolytic capacitor types, capacitors with the same dimensions and of similar capacitance and voltage are compared in the following table. In such a comparison the values for ESR and ripple current load are the most important parameters for the use of electrolytic capacitors in modern electronic equipment. The lower the ESR, the higher the ripple current per volume and better functionality of the capacitor in the circuit. However, better electrical parameters come with higher prices.

===Styles of aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors===
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors form the bulk of the electrolytic capacitors used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors.

===Origin===
The phenomenon that in an electrochemical process, aluminum and such metals as [[tantalum]], [[niobium]], [[manganese]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], etc., can form an oxide layer which blocks an electric current from flowing in one direction but which allows current to flow in the opposite direction, was first observed in 1857 by the German physicist and chemist [[:de:Heinrich Buff|Johann Heinrich Buff]] (1805–1878).&lt;ref&gt;See:

Charles Pollak (born [[Karol Pollak]]), a producer of accumulators, found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte, even when the power was switched off. In 1896 he filed a patent for an "Electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes" (de: ''Elektrischer Flüssigkeitskondensator mit Aluminiumelektroden'') based on his idea of using the oxide layer in a polarized capacitor in combination with a neutral or slightly alkaline electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pollack: D.R.P. 92564, filed 14. January 1896, granted 19. May 1897 [http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000000092564A D.R.P. 92564]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

==="Wet" aluminum capacitor===
[[File:Historische Anodenformen.jpg|thumb|left|Various forms of historical anode structures for wet capacitors. For all of these anodes the outer metallic container served as the cathode]]
The first industrially realized electrolytic capacitors consisted of a metallic box used as the cathode. It was filled with a [[Sodium borate|borax]] electrolyte dissolved in water, in which a folded aluminum anode plate was inserted. Applying a DC voltage from outside, an oxide layer was formed on the surface of the anode. The advantage of these capacitors was that they were significantly smaller and cheaper than all other capacitors at this time relative to the realized capacitance value. This construction with different styles of anode construction but with a case as cathode and container for the electrolyte was used up to the 1930s and was called a "wet" electrolytic capacitor, in the sense of its having a high water content.

The first more common application of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce [[relay hash]] (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers in the late 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the [[valve amplifier]] technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk [[film capacitor]]s were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.

==="Dry" aluminum capacitor===
[[File:Dry Electrolytic capacitor, pic5.JPG|thumb|A "dry" electrolytic capacitor with 100&amp;nbsp;µF and 150&amp;nbsp;V]]
The [[ancestor]] of the modern electrolytic capacitor was patented by [[Samuel Ruben]] in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;US Patent Nr. 1774455, ''Electric condenser'', filed October 19, 1925, granted August 26, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ruben: Inventor, Scholar, and Benefactor by Kathryn R. Bullock [http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/fal/fal06/fall06_p16-17.pdf PDF www.electrochem.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who teamed with [[Philip Mallory]], the founder of the battery company that is now known as [[Duracell|Duracell International]]. Ruben's idea adopted the stacked construction of a [[silver mica capacitor]]. He introduced a separated second foil to contact the electrolyte adjacent to the anode foil instead of using the electrolyte-filled container as the capacitor's cathode. The stacked second foil got its own terminal additional to the anode terminal and the container no longer had an electrical function. This type of electrolytic capacitor combined with an liquid or gel-like electrolyte of a non-aqueous nature, which is therefore dry in the sense of having a very low water content, became known as the "dry" type of electrolytic capacitor.&lt;ref name=Deeley&gt;P. McK. Deeley, Electrolytic Capacitors, The Cornell-Dubilier Electric Corp. South Plainfield New Jersey, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

With Ruben's invention, together with the invention of wound foils separated with a paper spacer 1927 by A. Eckel of Hydra-Werke (Germany),&lt;ref&gt;''Elektrolytischer Kondensator mit aufgerollten Metallbändern als Belegungen'', Alfred Eckel Hydra-Werke, Berlin-Charlottenburg, DRP 498 794, filed May 12, 1927, granted May 8, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; the actual development of e-caps began.&lt;ref name=Deeley /&gt;

[[William Dubilier]], whose first patent for electrolytic capacitors was filed in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;William Dubilier, Electric Condenser, US Patent 468787&lt;/ref&gt; industrialized the new ideas for electrolytic capacitors and started the first large commercial production in 1931 in the Cornell-Dubilier (CD) factory in Plainfield, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Deeley /&gt; At the same time in Berlin, Germany, the "Hydra-Werke", an [[AEG]] company, started the production of e-caps in large quantities.

[[File:Alu-Elko-Miniaturisierung.jpg|thumb|Miniaturization of aluminum electrolytic capacitors from 1960 to 2005 in case 10x16mm up to factor ten]]
In his 1896 patent Pollak already recognized that the capacitance of the capacitor increases when roughening the surface of the anode foil. Today (2014), electrochemically etched low voltage foils can achieve an up to 200-fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface.&lt;ref name="Voltage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDK"/&gt; Advances in the etching process are the reason for the dimension reductions in aluminum electrolytic capacitors over recent decades.

For aluminum electrolytic capacitors the decades from 1970 to 1990 were marked by the development of various new professional series specifically suited to certain industrial applications, for example with very low leakage currents or with long life characteristics, or for higher temperatures up to 125&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Philips Data Handbook PA01, 1986, the first 125&amp;nbsp;°C series "118 AHT"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Both, The modern era of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, Electrical Insulation Magazine, IEEE, Volume:31, Issue: 4, July–August 2015, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7126071&amp;filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A7126063%29 ieeexplore.ieee.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tantalum capacitors===
One of the first tantalum electrolytic capacitors were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronic Inc. USA, for military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Tailor, Tantalum and Tantalum Compounds, Fansteel Inc., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 19, 2nd ed. 1969 John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic construction of a wound cell was adopted and a tantalum anode foil was used together with a tantalum cathode foil, separated with a paper spacer impregnated with a liquid electrolyte, mostly sulfuric acid, and encapsulated in a silver case.

The relevant development of solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors began some years after [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain]] invented the [[transistor]] in 1947. It was invented by [[Bell Laboratories]] in the early 1950s as a miniaturized, more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor. The solution found by R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring of the Bell labs in early 1950 was based on experiences with ceramics. They ground tantalum to a powder, which they pressed into a cylindrical form and then sintered at high a temperature between 1500 and 2000&amp;nbsp;°C under vacuum conditions to produce a pellet ("slug").&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring, "A metal semi-conductor capacitor", J. Electrochem. Soc., vol. 103, p. 611, November, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Reed, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [http://nepp.nasa.gov/docuploads/0EA22600-8AEC-4F47-9FE49BAABEAB569C/Tantalum%20Polymer%20Capacitors%20FY05%20Final%20Report.pdf Characterization of Tantalum Polymer Capacitors], NEPP Task 1.21.5, Phase 1, FY05&lt;/ref&gt;

These first sintered tantalum capacitors used a non-solid electrolyte, which does not fit the concept of solid electronics. In 1952 a targeted search at Bell Labs by D. A. McLean and F. S. Power for a solid electrolyte led to the invention of manganese dioxide as a solid electrolyte for a sintered tantalum capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. McLean, F. S. Power, Proc. Inst. Radio Engrs. 44 (1956) 872&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fundamental inventions came from Bell Labs, the inventions for manufacturing commercially viable tantalum electrolytic capacitors came from researchers at the [[Sprague Electric Company]]. [[Preston Robinson]], Sprague's Director of Research, is considered to be the actual inventor of tantalum capacitors in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Preston Robinson, Sprague, US Patent 3066247, 25. Aug. 1954 - 27. Nov. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Dr. Preston Robinson Granted 103rd Patent Since Joining Company In 1929 [http://www.mcla.edu/mcla_data/Library/Archive/Sprague/Vol25_No06.pdf]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His invention was supported by R. J. Millard, who introduced the "reform" step in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;A. Fraioli, Recent Advances in the Solid-State Electrolytic Capacitor, IRE Transactions on Component Parts, June 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Millard, Sprague, US Patent 2936514, October 24, 1955 - May 17, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; a significant improvement in which the dielectric of the capacitor was repaired after each dip-and-convert cycle of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deposition, which dramatically reduced the leakage current of the finished capacitors.

Although solid tantalum capacitors offered capacitors with lower ESR and leakage current values than the aluminum e-caps, 1980 a price shock for tantalum dramatically reduced the applications of Ta-e-caps especially in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Solid electrolytes===
[[File:Elektrolyte-Leitfähigkeitswerte.jpg|thumb|left|Conductivity of non-solid and solid electrolytes]]
The first solid electrolyte of manganese dioxide developed 1952 for tantalum capacitors had a conductivity 10 times better than all other types of non-solid electrolytes. It also influenced the development of aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte [[SAL electrolytic capacitor]] came on the market, developed by [[Philips]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Both, Valvo, SAL contra Tantal, Zuverlässige Technologien im Wettstreit, nachrichten elektronik 35, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

With the beginning of digitalization, Intel launched in 1971 its first microcomputer, MCS 4, and in 1972 Hewlett Packard launched one of the first pocket calculators, HP 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Computerposter.ch|title=Homepage|website=www.computerposter.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

It was not until 1983 when a new step toward ESR reduction was taken by [[Sanyo]] with its "[[OS-CON]]" aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These capacitors used a solid organic conductor, the charge transfer salt TTF-TCNQ ([[tetracyanoquinodimethane]]), which provided an improvement in conductivity by a factor of 10 compared with the manganese dioxide electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Shinichi Niwa, Yutaka Taketani, Development of new series of aluminium solid capacitors with organic Semiconductive electrolyte (OS-CON), Journal of Power Sources, Volume 60, Issue 2, June 1996, Pages 165–171, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775396800061 sciencedirect.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Panasonic came on the market with its "SP-Cap",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panasonic.com/industrial/electronic-components/parametric-search.aspx?src=/www-ctlg/ctlg/qABE0000_AM.html|title=Electronic Components - Panasonic Industrial Devices|website=www.panasonic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[Polymer capacitor|polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors]]. These aluminum electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes reached very low ESR values directly comparable to [[Ceramic capacitor|ceramic multilayer capacitors]] (MLCCs). They were still less expensive than tantalum capacitors and with their flat design for [[laptop]]s and [[cell phone]]s competed with tantalum chip capacitors as well.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with PPy polymer electrolyte cathode followed three years later. In 1993 NEC introduced its SMD polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors, called "NeoCap". In 1997 Sanyo followed with the "POSCAP" polymer tantalum chips.

A new conductive polymer for tantalum polymer capacitors was presented by Kemet at the "1999 Carts" conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Replacing-MnO2-with-Conductive-Polymer-in-Tantalum-Capacitors.pdf John Prymak, Kemet, Replacing MnO2 with Polymers, 1999 CARTS]&lt;/ref&gt; This capacitor used the newly developed organic conductive polymer PEDT Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), also known as PEDOT (trade name Baytron®) &lt;ref&gt;F.

===Niobium capacitors===
Another price explosion for tantalum in 2000/2001 forced the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Ch.

Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It was a question of the availability of the base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Pozdeev-Freeman, P.

===Water based electrolytes===
With the goal of reducing ESR for inexpensive non-solid e-caps from the mid-1980s in Japan, new water-based electrolytes for aluminum electrolytic capacitors were developed. Water is inexpensive, an effective solvent for electrolytes, and significantly improves the conductivity of the electrolyte. The Japanese manufacturer [[Rubycon Corporation|Rubycon]] was a leader in the development of new water-based electrolyte systems with enhanced conductivity in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Uzawa&gt;Shigeru Uzawa, Akihiko Komat-u, Tetsushi Ogawara, Rubycon Corporation, Ultra Low Impedance Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor with Water based Electrolyte or {{cite web |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200217/000020021702A0509168.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524092432/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200217/000020021702A0509168.php |archivedate=2012-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new series of non-solid e-caps with water-based electrolyte was described in the data sheets as having "low-ESR", "low-impedance", "ultra-low-impedance" or "high-ripple current".

In these e-caps the water reacts quite aggressively and even violently with aluminum, accompanied by strong heat and gas development in the capacitor, and often led to the explosion of the capacitor.

==Electrical characteristics==
=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of an electrolytic capacitor]]

The electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components which model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of an electrolytic capacitor:
* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR"
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor

===Capacitance, standard values and tolerances===
[[File:Capacitance versus frequency .tif|thumb|Typical capacitance as a function of frequency]]
[[File:E-cap-capacitance versus temperature.jpg|thumb|Typical capacitance as a function of temperature]]

The electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors depend on the structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of electrolytic capacitors, which depends on measuring frequency and temperature. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than do capacitors with solid electrolytes.

The basic unit of an electrolytic capacitor's capacitance is the [[Farad|microfarad]] (μF). The capacitance value specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers is called the rated capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or nominal capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed.

The standardized measuring condition for e-caps is an AC measuring method with 0.5&amp;nbsp;V at a frequency of 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz and a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp; V for types with a rated voltage ≤2.5&amp;nbsp;V, or 2.1 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of &gt;2.5&amp;nbsp;V, may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.

The capacitance value measured at the frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors are not directly comparable and differ from those of [[film capacitor]]s or [[ceramic capacitor]]s, whose capacitance is measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or higher.

Measured with an AC measuring method with 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz the capacitance value is the closest value to the electrical charge stored in the e-caps. The stored charge is measured with a special discharge method and is called the [[Direct current|DC]] capacitance. The DC capacitance is about 10% higher than the 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz AC capacitance. The DC capacitance is of interest for discharge applications like [[photoflash]].

The percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called the capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the [[Preferred number#E series|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.
* rated capacitance, series E3, tolerance ±20%, letter code "M"
* rated capacitance, series E6, tolerance ±20%, letter code "M"
* rated capacitance, series E12, tolerance ±10%, letter code "K"

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]], do not have the need for narrow tolerances because they are mostly not used for accurate frequency applications like in [[oscillator]]s.

===Rated and category voltage===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]

Referring to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the allowed operating voltage for electrolytic capacitors is called the "rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;" or "nominal voltage U&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;". The rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

The voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specifies a "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature, the "category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture at right.

Applying a higher voltage than specified may destroy electrolytic capacitors.

Applying a lower voltage may have a positive influence on electrolytic capacitors. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors a lower applied voltage can in some cases extend the lifetime.&lt;ref name=Voltage /&gt; For tantalum electrolytic capacitors lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.&lt;ref name=AVX-Reliability&gt;Ch. Reynolds, AVX, Technical Information, Reliability Management of Tantalum Capacitors, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/rmtant.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806053447/http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/rmtant.pdf |date=2013-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surge Voltage ===
The surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles.&lt;ref name=Voltage /&gt;
The surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a rated voltage of up to 315&amp;nbsp;V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times the rated voltage, and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315&amp;nbsp;V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times the rated voltage.

For tantalum electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage can be 1.3 times the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt. The surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitor's failure rate.&lt;ref name=surge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avxtantalum.com/pdf/SURGTANT.PDF|title=J. Gill, AVX, Surge in Solid Tantalum Capacitors|publisher=|access-date=2015-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214163113/http://www.avxtantalum.com/pdf/SURGTANT.PDF|archive-date=2014-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky&gt;A.

===Transient voltage===
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages higher than surge voltage, if the frequency and the energy content of the transients are low. This ability depends on rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a [[zener diode]].&lt;ref&gt;Imam, A.M., Condition Monitoring of Electrolytic Capacitors for Power Electronics Applications, Dissertation, Georgia Institute of Technology (2007) [https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/14472/imam_afroz_m_200705_phd.pdf smartech.gatech.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be approved very carefully.

Electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese oxide or polymer electrolyte, and aluminum as well as tantalum electrolytic capacitors can not withstand transients or peak voltages higher than surge voltage. Transients for this type of e-caps may destroy the components.&lt;ref name=surge /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky /&gt;

===Reverse voltage===
[[File:Exploded Electrolytic Capacitor.jpg|thumb|An exploded aluminum electrolytic capacitor on a PCB]]
Standard electrolytic capacitors, and aluminum as well as tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors are polarized and generally require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.

Nevertheless, electrolytic capacitors can withstand for short instants a reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles. In detail, aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a reverse voltage of about 1&amp;nbsp;V to 1.5&amp;nbsp;V. This reverse voltage should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Nichicon. "General Description of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors" [http://www.nichicon-us.com/english/products/pdf/aluminum.pdf PDF] section "2-3-2 Reverse Voltage".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubycon.

[http://www.cde.com/catalogs/AEappGUIDE.pdf "Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor Application Guide"] p. 4 and p. 6 and p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid tantalum capacitors can also withstand reverse voltages for short periods. The most common guidelines for tantalum reverse voltage are:
*10&amp;nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 1&amp;nbsp;V at 25&amp;nbsp;°C,
*3&amp;nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.5&amp;nbsp;V at 85&amp;nbsp;°C,
*1&amp;nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.1&amp;nbsp;V at 125&amp;nbsp;°C.
These guidelines apply for short excursion and should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bishop, J. Gill, AVX Ltd., Reverse Voltage Behavior of Solid Tantalum Capacitors [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/17_Reverse.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Vasina, T. Zednicek, Z. Sita, J. Sikula, J. Pavelka, AVX, Thermal and Electrical Breakdown Versus Reliability of Ta2O5 Under Both – Bipolar Biasing Conditions [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/thermele.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806054826/http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/thermele.pdf |date=2013-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But in no case, for aluminum as well as for tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors, may a reverse voltage be used for a permanent AC application.

To minimize the likelihood of a polarized electrolytic being incorrectly inserted into a circuit, polarity has to be very clearly indicated on the case, see the section on "Polarity marking" below.

Special bipolar aluminum electrolytic capacitors designed for bipolar operation are available, and usually referred to as "non-polarized" or "bipolar" types. In these, the capacitors have two anode foils with full-thickness oxide layers connected in reverse polarity. On the alternate halves of the AC cycles, one of the oxides on the foil acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse current from damaging the electrolyte of the other one. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.

===Impedance===
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|140px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances ''X&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and resistance ''ESR'' and for illustration the impedance ''Z'' and dissipation factor ''tan δ'']]

In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]. Especially aluminum electrolytic capacitors in many applications are used as [[decoupling capacitor]]s to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground or for [[capacitive coupling]] of audio AC signals. Then the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], is as important as the capacitance value.

[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverläufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency. The higher the capacitance the lower the resonance frequency.]]

The impedance ''Z'' is the vector sum of [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]; it describes the phase difference and the ratio of amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency. In this sense impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents and can be used like Ohm's law.
: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{eff}}{I_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the impedance is a frequency-dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency.

In data sheets of electrolytic capacitors only the impedance magnitude ''|Z|'' is specified, and simply written as ''"Z".'' Regarding the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 100&amp;nbsp;kHz depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.

Besides measuring, the impedance can be calculated using the idealized components of a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor ''C'', a resistor ''ESR'', and an inductance ''ESL''. In this case the impedance at the angular frequency ''ω'' is given by the geometric (complex) addition of ''ESR'', by a capacitive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''

: &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

and by an inductive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ([[Inductance]])

&lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then ''Z'' is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' have the same value (''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''), then the impedance will only be determined by ''ESR''. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ''ESL'' of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes an inductance.

===ESR and dissipation factor tan δ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Typical impedance and ESR curves as a function of frequency and temperature" class="centered" mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

File:E-cap-impedance_versus_temperature.jpg|Typical impedance as a function of temperature
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[equivalent series resistance]] (''ESR'') summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric oxide layer.&lt;ref&gt;A. Berduque, Kemet, Low ESR Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitors for Medium to High Voltage Applications, [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/DECEF7F25203B33E852578A400584ECC/$file/2011–03%20CARTS%20-%20Low%20ESR%20Aluminum%20Electrolytic%20Capacitors%20for%20Mid-to-High%20Voltage%20Applications.pdf kemet.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For electrolytic capacitors generally the ''ESR'' decreases with increasing frequency and temperature.&lt;ref name=DFR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Uprating-of-Electrolytic-Capacitors.pdf|title=Resources - DfR Solutions|first=DfR|last=Solutions|website=www.dfrsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''ESR'' influences the remaining superimposed AC [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] behind smoothing and may influence the circuit functionality. Related to the capacitor, ''ESR'' accounts for internal heat generation if a ripple current flows over the capacitor. This internal heat reduces the lifetime of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors or influences the reliability of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.

For electrolytic capacitors, for historical reasons the [[dissipation factor]] ''tan δ'' will sometimes be specified in the relevant data sheets, instead of the ''ESR''. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' minus the inductive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the ''ESR''. If the inductance ''ESL'' is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = \mbox{ESR} \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

The dissipation factor is used for capacitors with very low losses in frequency-determining circuits where the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is called the [[Q factor|quality factor]] (Q), which represents a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].

===Ripple current===
[[File:rippelstrom mit Schaltplan.png|thumb|250px|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flow across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitor's ''ESR'']]

A "ripple current" is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation within the specified temperature range. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.

Ripple currents generates heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is caused by ''ESR'' and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current ''I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L} = I_R^2 \cdot ESR&lt;/math&gt;

This internally generated heat, additional to the ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor body temperature having a temperature difference of ''Δ T'' against the ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' over the capacitor's surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''β'' to the ambient.

: &lt;math&gt; P_{th} = \Delta T \cdot A \cdot \beta&lt;/math&gt;

The internally generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]]. The temperature of the capacitor, which is the net balance between heat produced and distributed, must not exceed the capacitor's maximum specified temperature.

The ripple current is specified as an effective (RMS) value at 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz or at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz at upper category temperature.

===Current surge, peak or pulse current===
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged up to the rated voltage without any current surge, peak or pulse limitation. This property is a result of the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and of the capacitor's ESR. Only the frequency of peaks integrated over time must not exceed the maximal specified ripple current.

Solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte or polymer electrolyte are damaged by peak or pulse currents.&lt;ref name=surge /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky /&gt; Solid Tantalum capacitors which are exposed to surge, peak or pulse currents, for example, in highly inductive circuits, should be used with a voltage derating. If possible the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current experienced by the capacitor.

===Leakage current===
[[File:Leakage current curves.svg|thumb|right|general leakage behavior of electrolytic capacitors: leakage current &lt;math&gt;I_{leak}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; depending of the kind of electrolyte

]]

For electrolytic capacitors, [[Leakage (electronics)|DC leakage current]] (DCL) is a special characteristic that other conventional capacitors do not have. This current is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors.

The reasons for leakage current are different between electrolytic capacitors with non-solid and with solid electrolyte or more common for "wet" aluminum and for "solid" tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte as well as for electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes. For non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors the leakage current includes all weakened imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes taking place during the time without applied voltage (storage time) between operating cycles. These unwanted chemical processes depend on the kind of electrolyte. Electrolytes with water content or water based electrolytes are more aggressive to the aluminum oxide layer than are electrolytes based on organic liquids. This is why different electrolytic capacitor series specify different storage time without reforming instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay, Aluminium capacitors, Introduction, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, Chapter Storage, page 7 [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf vishay.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying a positive voltage to a "wet" capacitor causes a reforming (self-healing) process which repairs all weakened dielectric layers, and the leakage current remain at a low level.&lt;ref name=Baur&gt;Ch. Baur, N. Will, Epcos, Long-term stability of aluminum electrolytic capacitors [http://www.epcos.com/epcos-en/373562/tech-library/articles/applications---cases/applications---cases/built-to-last/172020 Built to last]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the leakage current of non-solid e-caps is higher than current flow over insulation resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors with organic electrolytes takes several weeks.

The main causes of DCL for solid tantalum capacitors include electrical breakdown of the dielectric, conductive paths due to impurities or poor anodization, bypassing of dielectric due to excess manganese dioxide, to moisture paths, or to cathode conductors (carbon, silver).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/leakage.pdf|title=R.W. Franklin, AVX, AN EXPLORATION OF LEAKAGE CURRENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "normal" leakage current in solid electrolyte capacitors cannot be reduced by "healing", because under normal conditions solid electrolytes cannot provide oxygen for forming processes. This statement should not be confused with the self-healing process during field crystallization, see below, Reliability (Failure rate).

The specification of the leakage current in data sheets is often given by multiplication of the rated capacitance value ''C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the value of the rated voltage ''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' together with an addendum figure, measured after a measuring time of 2 or 5 minutes, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Leak} = 0{,}01\,\mathrm{{A}\over{ V \cdot F}} \cdot U_\mathrm R \cdot C_\mathrm R + 3\,\mathrm{\mu A}&lt;/math&gt;

The leakage current value depends on the voltage applied, on the temperature of the capacitor, and on measuring time. Leakage current in solid MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tantalum electrolytic capacitors generally drops very much faster than for non-solid electrolytic capacitors but remain at the level reached.

===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

Dielectric absorption may be a problem in circuits where very small currents are used in the function of an electronic circuit, such as long-[[time constant|time-constant]] [[integrator]]s or [[sample-and-hold]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;"Understand Capacitor Soakage to Optimize Analog Systems" by Bob Pease 1982 [http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123210736/http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most electrolytic capacitor applications supporting power supply lines, dielectric absorption is not a problem.

But especially for electrolytic capacitors with high rated voltage the voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption can be a safety risk to personnel or circuits. In order to prevent shocks most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before the capacitors are used.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf "Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors", by Ken Kundert]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational characteristics==

===Reliability (failure rate)===
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|300px| [[Bathtub curve]] with times of “early failures”, “random failures”, and wear-out failures”. The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate and corresponds with the lifetime of non-solid e-caps.]]

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a component is a property that indicates how reliably this component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a [[stochastic process]] and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively; it is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors is empirically determined by identifying the [[failure rate]] in production accompanying [[endurance test]]s, see [[Reliability engineering]].

Reliability normally is shown as a [[bathtub curve]] and is divided into three areas: early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failures totalized in a failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction is generally expressed in a [[failure rate]] λ, abbreviated '''FIT''' ('''F'''ailures '''I'''n '''T'''ime]. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation (e.g., 1000 components for 1&amp;nbsp;million hours, or 1&amp;nbsp; million components for 1000 hours which is 1&amp;nbsp;ppm/1000 hours) at fixed working conditions during the period of constant random failures. This failure rate model implicitly assumes the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate.

Billions of tested capacitor unit-hours would be needed to establish failure rates in the very low level range which are required today to ensure the production of large quantities of components without failures. This requires about a million units over a long time period, which means a large staff and considerable financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niccomp.com/Products/smt/NTCRel-FR71399.pdf|title=NIC Components Corp. - Passive Components|website=www.niccomp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested failure rates are often complemented with figures resulting from feedback from the field from big users concerning failed components (field failure rate), which mostly results in a lower failure rate than tested.

The reciprocal value of FIT is [[Mean Time Between Failures|MTBF]] ('''M'''ean '''T'''ime '''B'''etween '''F'''ailures).

The standard operating conditions for the failure rate FIT are 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, capacitance value, circuit resistance (for tantalum capacitors), mechanical influences and humidity, the FIT figure can be recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial&lt;ref&gt;IEC/EN 61709, Electric components.

The higher the temperature and applied voltage the higher the failure rate, for example.

The most often cited source for recalculation of failure rate is the MIL-HDBK-217F, the “bible” of failure rate calculations for electronic components. SQC Online, the online statistical calculator for acceptance sampling and quality control, provides an online tool for short examination to calculate given failure rate values for given application conditions.&lt;ref&gt;SQC online table calculator, Capacitor Failure Rate Model, MIL-HDBK-217, Rev. F - Notice 2 [http://www.sqconline.com/capacitor-failure-rate-model-mil-hdbk-217-rev-f-notice-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers may have their own FIT calculation tables for tantalum capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/tantalum-reliability-calculator-list/|title=Vishay - Capacitors - Vishay - Silicon Capacitance Calculator|first=|last=Vishay|website=www.vishay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitachi, Precautions in using Tantalum Capacitors, 4.2 Failure Rate Calculation Formula [http://www.hitachiaic.com/docs/products/tantprecautions.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214165819/http://www.hitachiaic.com/docs/products/tantprecautions.pdf |date=2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for aluminum capacitors&lt;ref name=Parler&gt;Sam G. Parler, Cornell Dubilier, Reliability of CDE Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors ([http://www.cde.com/tech/reliability.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610143641/http://www.cde.com/tech/reliability.pdf |date=2014-06-10 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

It is good to know that for tantalum capacitors the failure rate is often specified in essence at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as reference conditions and expressed as percent failed components per thousand hours (n&amp;nbsp;%/1000&amp;nbsp;h). That is, “n” number of failed components per 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; hours, or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours.

Tantalum capacitors are now very reliable components. Continuous improvement in tantalum powder and capacitor technologies have resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of impurities which formerly caused most field crystallization failures. Commercially available industrially produced tantalum capacitors now have reached as standard products the high MIL standard "C" level, which is 0.01%/1000 h at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or 1 failure per 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; hours at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="FC-Study"&gt;T.Zednicek, AVX, A Study of Field Crystallization in Tantalum Capacitors and its effect on DCL and Reliability, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/FieldCrystallization.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Recalculated in FIT with the acceleration factors coming from MIL HDKB 217F at 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;, U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the failure rate. For a 100&amp;nbsp;µF/25&amp;nbsp;V tantalum chip capacitor used with a series resistance of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Ω the failure rate is 0.02 FIT.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors do not use a specification in "%&amp;nbsp;per 1000&amp;nbsp;h at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;". They use the FIT specification with 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as reference conditions. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are very reliable components. Published figures show for low voltage types (6.3…160&amp;nbsp;V) FIT rates in the range of 1 to 20 FIT&lt;ref name=Al-reliability&gt;A. Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, Reliability of Electrolytic Capacitors, [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Reliability-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and for high voltage types (&gt;160 …550&amp;nbsp;V) FIT rates in the range of 20 to 200 FIT.&lt;ref name=Parler /&gt; Field failure rates for aluminum e-caps are in the range of 0.5 to 20&amp;nbsp;FIT.&lt;ref name=Parler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Al-reliability /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitachi aic-europe, Explanations to the useful life, [http://www.aic-europe.com/images/stories/produkte/screw/p104_explanations_lifetime.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205012458/http://www.aic-europe.com/images/stories/produkte/screw/p104_explanations_lifetime.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The published figures show that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists in the case of [[Bathtub curve|wear-out failures]]. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the [[Service life|lifetime]] or [[service life]] of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

===Lifetime===
[[File:Lebensdauer-Testergebnisse-english.png|thumb|400px|The electrical values of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte change over time due to evaporation of electrolyte. Reaching the specified limits of the electrical parameters, the time of the constant failure rate ends and it is the end of the capacitor's lifetime. The graph show this behavior in a 2000&amp;nbsp;h endurance test at 105&amp;nbsp;°C.]]

The [[Service life|lifetime]], [[service life]], load life or useful life of electrolytic capacitors is a special characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's “life”. The “end of life” point is defined by the appearance of wear-out failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.

The lifetime is a specification of a collection of tested capacitors and delivers an expectation of the behavior of similar types. This lifetime definition corresponds with the time of the constant random failure rate in the bathtub curve.

But even after exceeding the specified limits and the capacitors having reached their “end of life” the electronic circuit is not in immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitors is reduced. With today's high levels of purity in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.

The lifetime of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms of “hours per temperature", like "2,000h/105&amp;nbsp;°C". With this specification the lifetime at operational conditions can be estimated by special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways for specification, some give special formulas,&lt;ref name=NCCTN&gt;NCC, Technical Note Judicious Use of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors [http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/al-e/al-sepa-e/001-guide/al-technote-e-140701.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214163021/http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/al-e/al-sepa-e/001-guide/al-technote-e-140701.pdf |date=2014-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubycon, LIFE OF ALUMINUM ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS, S. 9 ([http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/pdf/Life.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; others specify their e-caps lifetime calculation with graphs that consider the influence of applied voltage.&lt;ref name=Al-reliability /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jianglife&gt;A.

This rule is also known as [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius rule]]. It characterizes the change of thermic reaction speed. For every 10&amp;nbsp;°C lower temperature the evaporation is reduced by half. That means for every 10&amp;nbsp;°C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles. If a lifetime specification of an electrolytic capacitor is, for example, 2000&amp;nbsp; h/105&amp;nbsp;°C, the capacitor's lifetime at 45&amp;nbsp;°C can be ”calculated” as 128,000 hours—that is roughly 15 years—by using the 10-degrees-rule.

However, solid polymer electrolytic capacitors, aluminum as well as tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors also have a lifetime specification. The polymer electrolyte has a small deterioration of conductivity caused by a thermal degradation mechanism in the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreases as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains.&lt;ref&gt;E.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte do not have wear-out failures so they do not have a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Also, tantalum capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, the "wet tantalums", do not have a lifetime specification because they are hermetically sealed and evaporation of electrolyte is minimized.

Electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte do not have wear-out failures so they do not have a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

===Failure modes, self-healing mechanism and application rules===
The many different types of electrolytic capacitors show differences in electrical long-term behavior, their inherent failure modes, and their self-healing mechanism. Application rules for types with an inherent failure mode are specified to ensure capacitors with high reliability and long life.

=== Performance after storage ===
All electrolytic capacitors are "aged" during manufacturing by applying rated voltage at high temperature for a sufficient time to repair all cracks and weaknesses that may have occurred during production. However, a particular problem with non-solid aluminum models may occur after storage or unpowered periods. Chemical processes (corrosion) can weaken the oxide layer, which may lead to a higher leakage current. Most modern electrolytic systems are chemically inert and without corrosion problems, even after storage times of two years or longer. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors using organic solvents like [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] as electrolyte do not have problems with high leakage current after longer storage times.&lt;ref name="Baur" /&gt; They can be stored for up to 10 years without problems&lt;ref name="VishayIAC" /&gt;

Storage times can be tested using accelerated shelf-life testing, which requires storage without applied voltage at the upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours. This shelf life test is a good indicator for chemical stability and of the oxide layer, because all chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. Nearly all commercial series of non-solid electrolytics fulfill the 1000 hour shelf life test. However, many series are specified only for two years of storage. This also ensures the continuing solderability of the terminals.

For antique radio equipment or for electrolytics built in the 1970s or earlier, "pre-conditioning" may be appropriate. For this purpose, the rated voltage is applied to the capacitor via a series resistance of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ for one hour. Applying a voltage via a safety resistor repairs the oxide layer by self-healing. Capacitors that fail leakage current requirements after preconditioning, may have experienced mechanical damage.&lt;ref name="EpcosGTI" /&gt;

Electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes don’t have precondition requirements.

===Parallel connection===
Smaller or low voltage electrolytic capacitors may be connected in parallel without any safety correction action. Large size capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types should be individually guarded against sudden energy charge of the whole capacitor bank due to a failed specimen.

===Series connection===
Some applications like [[AC/AC converter]]s with DC-link for frequency controls in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase grids]] need the higher voltages aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage-withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across each of the capacitors connected in series is proportional to the inverse of the individual capacitor’s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs a little bit in individual leakage current, the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series-connected capacitors is not symmetrical. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.&lt;ref name=VishayIAC&gt;Vishay BCcomponents, Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EpcosGTI&gt;Epcos, Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, General technical informations [http://www.epcos.de/blob/185386/download/4/pdf-generaltechnicalinformation.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprinted markings===
Electrolytic capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. If they are large enough the capacitor is marked with
* manufacturer's name or trademark;
* manufacturer's type designation;
* polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;
* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)

Polarized capacitors have polarity markings, usually a "−" (minus) sign on the side of the negative electrode for electrolytic capacitors or a stripe or a "+" (plus) sign. Also, the negative lead for leaded "wet" e-caps is usually shorter.

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M “V”, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10&lt;sup&gt;Z&lt;/sup&gt; pF), the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (±10% and ±20% respectively) and “V” represents the working voltage.

Examples:

* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 1 µF (K = ±10%) with a rated voltage of 330 V.
* 476M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 47 µF (M = ±20%) with a rated voltage of 100 V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): µ47 = 0,47 µF, 4µ7 = 4,7 µF, 47µ = 47 µF

The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.

* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, "1208" is "2012, week number 8".
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: "R" = 2003, "S"= 2004, "T" = 2005, "U" = 2006, "V" = 2007, "W" = 2008, "X" = 2009, "A" = 2010, "B" = 2011, "C" = 2012, "D" = 2013, “E” = 2014 etc. Month codes are: "1" to "9" = Jan. to Sept., "O" = October, "N" = November, "D" = December. "X5" is then "2009, May"

For very small capacitors no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

===Standardization===
The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/|title=Welcome to the IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission|first=IEC - International Electrotechnical|last=Commission|website=www.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu|title=Welcome to the IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beuth.de/de/|title=Beuth Verlag - Normen und Fachliteratur seit 1924|website=www.beuth.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the '''Generic specification''':

* IEC/EN 60384-1 - Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment

The tests and requirements to be met by aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following '''sectional specifications''':

* IEC/EN 60384-3—''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-4—''Aluminium electrolytic capacitors with solid (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-15—''Fixed tantalum capacitors with non-solid and solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-18—''Fixed aluminium electrolytic surface mount capacitors with solid (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-24—''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-25—''Surface mount fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-26—''Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''

===Market===
The market for electrolytic capacitors in 2008 was roughly 30% of the total market in value
* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors—US$3.9 billion (22%);
* Tantalum electrolytic capacitors—US$2.2 billion (12%);
In number of pieces, these capacitors cover about 10% of the total capacitor market, or about 100 to 120 billion pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Capacitors, SIC 3675, NAICS 334414: Electronic Capacitor Manufacturing, Industry report: [http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EBM''' ''(Cooperative Elektra Birseck, Münchenstein)'' is a Swiss [[energy]] supplier with head office in [[Münchenstein]]. It was founded as a cooperative under private law in 1897. EBM supplies around 230,000 people with electricity in North-West Switzerland and Alsace. The company operates 167 ''local heat supply'' systems in Switzerland, Alsace and South Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebm.ch/sites/default/files/downloadcenter/ebm_rapportannuel_web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Vertraut mit Energie. Seit 1897|website=Ebm.ch|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The engineer Fritz Eckinger&lt;ref name="ebm.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebm.ch/en/our-history-1897|title=Our history - Since 1897 - EBM|website=Ebm.ch|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and politician Stephan Gschwind founded ''Elektra Birseck Münchenstein'' in 1897 with the intention of introducing electric lighting and the idea of organising a company as a cooperative, which was a new concept at the time. The supply area in the lower part of the [[Canton (country subdivision)|Canton]] of [[Basel-Country]] and Birseck-Dorneck, a part of the Canton of Solothurn, was soon expanded. Between 1906 and 1914,&lt;ref name="ebm.ch"/&gt; EBM connected eleven municipalities and the City of [[St. Louis|Saint-Louis (Haut Rhin)]] to the grid. Since 1921,&lt;ref name="ebm.ch"/&gt; EBM has been supplying a total of 60 municipalities with electricity in the Swiss Cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Solothurn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebm.ch/sites/default/files/downloadcenter/ebm_netz_2013_akkurat_-_kopie.pdf] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/2006-100-jahre-ebm-im-elsass.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221315/http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/2006-100-jahre-ebm-im-elsass.html |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, it became the first company in Switzerland to support the frugal and rational use of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/1979-umweltfreundliche-energien.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222050/http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/1979-umweltfreundliche-energien.html |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EBM implemented the first [[tariff]]s for promoting renewable energies and set up an energy and environmental advice centre for its customers. In the field of decentralised heating supplies, EBM developed the concepts «[[cogeneration plant]] and [[heat pump]]» at the beginning of the 1980s and constructed the first cogeneration plant in 1982.

Since 1992, the company constructs, supports and participates in [[photovoltaic plant]]s, to supply solar energy at a favourable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/1992-aktion-sonnenstrom-fuer-jedermann.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221545/http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/unternehmen/geschichte-innovationen/1992-aktion-sonnenstrom-fuer-jedermann.html |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, EBM opened an ''electricity museum'' in Münchenstein to celebrate its 100th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lernwelt-energie.ch/fuehrungen-energie/elektrizitaets-museum.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003534/http://www.lernwelt-energie.ch/fuehrungen-energie/elektrizitaets-museum.html |archive-date=2013-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, EBM started producing electricity from wind and solar power. The company founded ''aravis'' («Aravis Energy I LP») to realise large plants in Southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/presse/news-medienmitteilungen/detailansicht.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=346&amp;cHash=23449d0f81e3ba2fcc719f3ffc6bbfab |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233240/http://www.ebm.ch/ebm/presse/news-medienmitteilungen/detailansicht.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=346&amp;cHash=23449d0f81e3ba2fcc719f3ffc6bbfab |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first «Swiss Limited Partnership» (limited commercial partnership for collective capital investments) that was approved by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.

==Renewable energy==
EBM procures electricity from renewable energies from its own plants, partner plants and long-term agreements. In addition to plants in the region, specific plans are in place to realise large projects in suitable foreign locations.

EBM aims to expand in Europe and Switzerland in the medium terms with the help of the companies «EBM Greenpower AG», «Leading Swiss renewables AG» and its minority share in «Kleinkraftwerk Birseck AG». The electricity generated by foreign plants is not yet supplied to Switzerland but is sold directly abroad at local supply prices or on the foreign electricity markets. The electricity generated from renewable energies rose to 811,703 MWh (as of 31 December 2013) as a result of EBM increasing the number of its plants.

===LSR investment company===
«Leading Swiss renewables AG» (LSR) is an investment company founded by EBM, «Energie Wasser Bern»&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewb.ch|title=Privatkunden - Energie Wasser Bern|website=Ewb.ch|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and «Aravis» in January 2012. The company’s purpose is to develop renewable energy production plants in Europe in the medium term. It has around EUR 100 million in capital at its disposal to meet this target. EBM holds a share of EUR 65 million and «Energie Wasser Bern» a share of EUR 35 million. Plans are for the total installed output to exceed 100 Megawatt in an initial phase. The focus is on wind energy as there is an active market for wind power projects in numerous European countries.

===Kleinkraftwerk Birseck AG (KKB)===
Decentralised power plants have been gaining in importance in recent years as it has become increasingly difficult to construct large power plants in Switzerland and the rest of Europe. EBM has invested in KKB AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kkb-ag.ch/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126174955/http://www.kkb-ag.ch/ |archive-date=2017-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent producer of electricity generated from renewable energies. The company acquires and operates water, solar and wind power plants in Switzerland and certain European countries. KKB AG is listed at the stock exchange in Bern under securities number ISIN CH0023777235 listed.

==Heat production and renewable energy==
For more than 30 years, EBM Wärme AG has been operating in the field of [[heat]] contracting throughout Switzerland. Its focus has been on the use of renewable energies for many years. In the beginning, EBM mainly realised heating networks in its Swiss grid area. Today, the company is represented in almost all of Switzerland, in the adjoining Alsace by «EBM Thermique SAS» and even in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, by «EBM Wärme GmbH». In 2012, EBM operated a total of 170 plants.

==Company structure==
EBM is a [[cooperative]] under private law. The cooperative members include legal entities and private persons owning property that is connected to EBM’s grid. The company had over 50,000 cooperative members in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Ferroelectric capacitor''' is a [[capacitor]] based on a [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] material. In contrast, traditional capacitors are based on dielectric materials. Ferroelectric devices are used in digital electronics as part of [[ferroelectric RAM]], or in analog electronics as tunable capacitors (varactors).

[[Image:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|Schematic of a ferroelectric capacitor]]

In memory applications, the stored value of a ferroelectric capacitor is read by applying an [[electric field]]. The amount of [[Electric charge|charge]] needed to flip the memory cell to the opposite state is measured and the previous state of the cell is revealed. This means that the read operation destroys the memory cell state, and has to be followed by a corresponding write operation, in order to write the bit back. This makes it similar to the [[ferrite core memory]]. The requirement for a write cycle for each read cycle, together with the high but not infinite write cycle limit, sets a potential problem for some special applications.

== Theory ==
In a short-circuited ferroelectric capacitor with a metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structure, a charge distribution of screening charges forms at the metal-ferroelectric interface so as to screen the electric displacement of the ferroelectric.  Due to these screening charges, there is a voltage drop across the ferroelectric capacitor with screening in the electrode layer that can be obtained using the Thomas-Fermi approach as follows:&lt;ref name=dawber&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dawber |journal=J Phys Condens Matter|title=Depolarization corrections to the coercive field in thin-film ferroelectrics |volume=15 |page=393 |year=2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V = E_f d + E_e\left(2\lambda\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the film thickness, &lt;math&gt;E_f = \frac{V + 8\pi P_s a}{d + \epsilon_f\left(2a\right)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_e=\frac{\epsilon_f}{\epsilon_e}E_f - \frac{4\pi}{\epsilon_e}P_s&lt;/math&gt; are the electric fields in the film and electrode at the interface, &lt;math&gt;P_s&lt;/math&gt; is the spontaneous polarization, &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{\lambda}{\epsilon_e}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_e&lt;/math&gt; are the dielectric constants of the film and the metal electrode.

With perfect electrodes, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; or for thick films, with &lt;math&gt;d \gg a&lt;/math&gt; the equation reduces to:

&lt;math&gt;V = E_f d \Rightarrow E_f=\frac{V}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Brennreisig.JPG|thumb|Stack of firewood next to a building]]
[[File:Špalek na štípání.jpg|thumb|Stack of split firewood and a maul for splitting, Czech Republic]]
'''Firewood''' is any [[wooden]] material that is gathered and used for [[fuel]].  Generally, firewood is not highly processed and is in some sort of recognizable log or branch form, compared to other forms of [[wood fuel]] like [[pellet fuel|pellets]] or chips. Firewood can be seasoned (dry) or unseasoned (fresh/wet). It is generally classified as [[hardwood]] or [[softwood]].

Firewood is a [[renewable resource]]. However, demand for this fuel can outpace its ability to regenerate on a local or regional level. Good forestry practices and improvements in devices that use firewood can improve local wood supplies.

==Harvesting==
[[File:Mozambique - firewood collector.jpg|thumb|Firewood collector in Mozambique]]
Harvesting or collecting firewood varies by the region and culture.  Some places have specific areas for firewood collection.  Other places may integrate the collection of firewood in the cycle of preparing a plot of land to grow food as part of a field rotation process. Collection can be a group, family or an individual activity.  The tools and methods for harvesting firewood are diverse.

===North America===
Some firewood is harvested in "[[woodlot]]s" managed for that purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.unh.edu/news/2006/05/where_does_firewood_come_from.html|title=Where does firewood come from?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in heavily wooded areas it is more usually harvested as a byproduct of natural [[forest]]s. Deadfall that has not started to rot is preferred, since it is already partly [[seasoning (wood)|seasoned]]. Standing dead timber is considered better still, for it has less humid organic material on the trunk, allowing tools to stay sharper longer, as well as being both seasoned and less rotten. Harvesting this form of timber reduces the speed and intensity of [[bushfire]]s, but it also reduces habitat for snag-nesting animals such as owls and some rodents.

Harvesting timber for firewood is normally carried out by hand with [[chainsaw]]s. Thus, longer pieces – requiring less manual labour, and less chainsaw fuel – are  less expensive and only limited by the size of the firebox. In most of the United States, the standard measure of firewood is a [[cord (unit of volume)|cord]] or {{convert|128|cuft}}, however, firewood can also be sold by weight. The [[BTU]] value can affect the price. Prices also vary considerably with the distance from wood lots, and quality of the wood.

Buying and burning firewood that was cut only a short distance from its final destination prevents the accidental spread of invasive tree-killing insects and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dontmovefirewood.org|title=Don't Move Firewood - Trees and forests are threatened by invasive foreign insects and diseases|work=dontmovefirewood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/plaveg/for/prod/firee.shtml|title=Firewood|publisher=Government of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Plant Health and Biosecurity Directorate|website=www.inspection.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of the world, firewood is only prepared for transport at the time it is harvested. Then it is moved closer to the place it will be used as fuel and prepared there. The process of making [[charcoal]] from firewood can take place at the place the firewood is harvested.

Most firewood also requires splitting, which also allows for faster seasoning by exposing more surface area. Today most splitting is done with a hydraulic splitting machine, but it can also be split with a [[splitting maul]]. More unusual, and dangerous, is a tapered screw-style design, that augers into the wood, splitting it, and can be powered by either a [[power take-off]] drive, a dedicated internal combustion engine, or a rugged electric pipe-threading machine, which is safer than the other power sources because the power can be shut off more easily if necessary.  Another method is to use a kinetic log splitter, which uses a rack and pinion system powered by a small motor and a large flywheel used for energy storage.

==Storing==
[[File:Puuriidad Kuremäe kloostris.jpg|thumb|right|Firewood stacks at [[Pühtitsa Convent]] in [[Estonia]] are about 6 meters high.]]
[[File:FirewoodFrancheComte.jpg|thumb|Stacked with crib end, in eastern [[France]], covered by terracotta tiles.]]
[[File:stackingwood.jpg|thumb|upright|Stacking firewood in a shed]]
There are many ways to store firewood. These range from simple piles to free-standing stacks, to specialized structures.  Usually the goal of storing wood is to keep water away from it and to continue the drying process.

'''Stacks:''' The simplest stack is where logs are placed next to and on top of each other, forming a line the width of the logs. The height of the stack can vary, generally depending upon how the ends are constructed.  Without constructing ends, the length of the log and length of the pile help determine the height of a free-standing stack.

There is debate about whether wood will dry more quickly when covered. There is a trade-off between the surface of the wood getting wet vs. allowing as much wind and sun as possible to access the stack. A cover can be almost any material that sheds water – a large piece of plywood, sheet metal, terracotta tiles, or an oiled canvas cloth, even cheap plastic sheeting may also be used. Wood will not dry when ''completely'' enclosed. Ideally pallets or scrap wood should be used to raise the wood from the ground, reducing rot and increasing air flow.

There are many ways to create the ends of a stack. In some areas, a crib end is created by alternating pairs of logs to help stabilize the end.   A stake or pole placed in the ground is another way to end the pile.  A series of stacked logs at the end, each with a cord tied to it and the free end of the cord wrapped to log in the middle of the pile, is another way.

'''Under a roof:'''  Under a roof, there are no concerns about the wood being subjected to rain, snow or run-off, but ventilation needs to be provided if the wood is stored green so that moisture released from the wood does not recondense inside. The methods for stacking depend on the structure and layout desired.  Whether split, or in 'rounds' (flush-cut and unsplit segments of logs), the wood should be stacked lengthwise, which is the most stable and practical method. Again though, if the wood needs further seasoning there should be adequate air flow through the stack.

Storing outdoors: Firewood should be stacked with the bark facing upwards.  This allows the water to drain off, and standing frost, ice, or snow to be kept from the wood. Storing wood in close proximity to a dwelling increases the likelihood that insects such as termites can become established indoors.

Storing firewood indoors for any extended period of time is not recommended, for it increases the risk of introducing insects such as termites into the home.

Round stacks can be made many ways.  Some are piles of wood with a stacked circular wall around them. Others like the American Holz Hausen are more complicated.

:A Holz hausen, or "wood house", is a circular method of stacking wood; proponents say it speeds up drying on a relatively small footprint. A traditional holz hausen has a 10-foot diameter, stands 10 feet high, and holds about 6 cords of wood. The walls are made of pieces arranged radially, and tilted slightly inward for stability. The inside pieces are stacked on end to form a chimney for air flow. The top pieces are tilted slightly outward to shed rain and are placed bark side up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechimneysweep.ca/6seasoningwood.html|title=Seasoning Firewood How and When|work=thechimneysweep.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heating value ==
[[File:Seoul Firewood Carrier, 1945.jpg|thumb|150px|Firewood carrier, [[Seoul]], Korea 1945]]
The moisture content of firewood determines how it burns and how much heat is released.  Unseasoned (green) wood moisture content varies by the species; green wood may weigh 70 to 100 percent more than seasoned wood due to water content.  Typically, seasoned (dry) wood has 20% to 25% moisture content. Use of the [[lower heating value]] is advised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firewood-rack.net |title=Firewood Storage Racks - Wood Covers |publisher=Firewood Rack |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a reasonable standard way of reporting this data.

The energy content of a measure of wood depends on the tree species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northidahofirewood.com/learnfirewood|title=Northidahofirewood.com|work=northidahofirewood.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206165122/http://northidahofirewood.com/learnfirewood|archivedate=2009-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it can range from {{convert|15.5|to|32|MMBtu}} per cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodheat.org/firewood.html|title=A non-commercial service in support of responsible home heating with wood - Firewood|author=John Gulland|work=woodheat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the moisture content, the more energy that must be used to evaporate (boil) the water in the wood before it will burn. Dry wood delivers more energy for heating than green wood of the same species.

The Sustainable Energy Development Office (SEDO), part of the Government of Western Australia states that the energy content of wood is 4.5 kWh/kg or 16.2 gigajoules/tonne (GJ/t).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.sedo.energy.wa.gov.au/pages/heat_run.asp |title=Office of Energy - Clean Energy |publisher=Sedo.energy.wa.gov.au |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013100115/http://www1.sedo.energy.wa.gov.au/pages/heat_run.asp |archivedate=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kiln dried firewood===

The process of kiln drying firewood was invented by Anthony Cutara, for which a successful US patent was filed in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4597189|title=Packaged kiln dried firewood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the US Department of Agriculture replicated the method and published a detailed procedure for the production of kiln dried firewood, citing the higher heat output and increased combustion efficiency as a key benefit of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrn/fplrn254.pdf|title=Kiln-Drying Time of Split Oak Firewood|date=August 1987|author1=Simpson, William T.|author2=Boone, R. Sidney|author3=Chern, Joseph|author4=Mace, Terry|location=Madison, WI|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Buying fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|Firewood on the way to market]]
[[File:Selling fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|Firewood at a local market ready for sale]]
Usually firewood is sold by volume. While a specific volume term may be used, there can be a wide variation in what this means and what the measure can produce as a fuel.  For example, a [[Cord (volume)|cord]] which is made from {{convert|4|ft|m|2|adj=on}} logs will not be a cord when it has been cut into 1 foot logs and then split so each piece will fit through a {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} circle. A measure of green unseasoned wood with 65% moisture contains less usable energy than when it has been dried to 20%. Regardless of the term, firewood measurement is best thought of as an estimate.

===Metric===
In the [[metric system]], firewood is usually sold by the [[stère]], equivalent to a volume of 1 cubic meter ({{convert|1|m3|cord|3|disp=or|sp=us}}). The most common firewood piece length are 33&amp;nbsp;cm and 50&amp;nbsp;cm.  Wood can also be sold by the kilogram or by the metric [[tonne]], as in [[Australia]].

===North America===
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], firewood is usually sold by the full cord, face cord or bag.

*A '''[[cord (unit)|full cord]]''' or '''bush cord''' has a volume of {{convert|128|cuft}}, including wood, bark, and air space in a neatly stacked pile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mc-mc.nsf/eng/lm03963.html "Buying Firewood? Don't Get Burned!"]. Measurement Canada. Retrieved 2013-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual wood volume of a cord may be in the range of {{convert|80|to|100|cuft|m3}} as stacked wood takes up more space than a piece of solid wood. The most common firewood piece length is {{convert|16|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="woodheat"&gt;[http://www.woodheat.org/cord-wood.html "What is a Cord? And How to Avoid Paying Too Much for One"]. Woodheat.org. Retrieved 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A '''[[face cord]]''' is one third of a full or bush cord stack of wood that is {{convert|4|by|8|ft|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} and has a volume of {{convert|42.6|cuft}}.&lt;ref name="woodheat" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In [[Norway]], the non-fiction book ''Hel Ved'' (In English: ''Solid Wood: All About Chopping, Drying and Stacking Wood – and the Soul of Wood-Burning'') by [[Lars Mytting]] became a bestseller in 2011–2012, selling 150,000 copies. A version of the book has also been published in [[Sweden]], selling 50,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Norsk-ved-TV-vekker-oppsikt-i-USA-7127150.html Norsk ved-TV vekker oppsikt i USA] Aftenposten, February 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the Norwegian state broadcast [[NRK2|NRK]] sent a 12-hour live program on the topic of woodfire, where a large part of the program consisted of showing firewood burning in a fireplace. More than one million people, 20% of Norway's population, saw part of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Lyall: [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/world/europe/in-norway-tv-program-on-firewood-elicits-passions.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Bark Up or Down?

'''Fuel-management systems''' are used to maintain, control and monitor [[fuel consumption]] and stock in any type of industry that uses [[transport]], including [[rail transport|rail]], [[road transport|road]], [[water transport|water]] and [[air transport|air]], as a means of business.
 
Fuel-management systems are designed to effectively measure and manage the use of [[fuel]] within the transportation and construction industries. They are typically used for [[vehicle fleet|fleets of vehicles]], including railway vehicles and aircraft, as well as any vehicle that requires fuel to operate. They employ various methods and technologies to monitor and track fuel inventories, fuel purchases and fuel dispensed. This information can be then stored in computerized systems and reports generated with data to inform management practices. Online fuel management is provided through the use of web portals to provide detailed fueling data, usually vis a vis the back end of an automated fuel-management system. This enables consumption control, cost analysis and tax accounting for fuel purchases.
 
There are several types of fuel-management systems. [[Fuel card|Card-based]] fuel-management systems typically track fuel transactions based on a fueling [[credit card]] and the associated driver PIN. Reports can then be generated based on fuel consumption by driver, and data can be directly downloaded. On-site fuel-management systems may employ fleet refueling services or bulk fuel tanks at the site. Fuel is tracked as it is pumped into vehicles, and on-site storage levels can be managed.
 
Some fuel companies offer total fuel-management systems whereby they provide elements of a card-based system along with on-site fuel delivery and refueling services. Mobile fuel management refers to a fleet of fuel trucks or tankers which provide fuel supply to commercial fleets of trucks or construction equipment. May involve combining [[RFID]] technology to identify equipment and automated fuel management to append the details of each transaction to a unique piece of equipment. By refueling vehicles in the evening when they are not in use, the company can conserve man-hours as the operators do not refuel and the vehicles do not require additional fuel to travel to the refueling station. They may also employ more sophisticated systems that utilize remote data collection to gather specific technical information about the vehicle usage and performance characteristics such as mileage, hours of operation and engine idling time.

The increasing use of biofuel has introduced another challenge in fuel management. With greater water content, there will be a risk of microbial growth – depending on the storage conditions, the fuel quality will deteriorate over time, leading to clogged filters and loss of productivity.

[[Tank manufacturer]]s have introduced [[fuel filter]]ing and cleansing packs which recirculate the tank contents through a series of filters and ultraviolet treatment to kill bacteria. Data from fuel quality instrumentation can be streamed to allow remote monitoring over Internet connections.

==Hardware==

There have been, to date, four recognizable generations of fuel-management system:

'''First generation''' : A bank of  a number of [[electromechanical]] [[Counter (digital)|counters]], pulsed by a shaft-driven encoder fitted to the pump. The correct counter is selected by the use of an encoded key. These types of systems were available throughout the 1960s superseded by more sophisticated systems in the late 1970s.

'''Second generation''' : A self-contained, electronic and/or [[microprocessor]]-controlled fuel-island control systems which has an ID reader (key, card, RFID etc.) to identify the vehicle and driver, a means of controlling a pump, a means of measuring the fuel delivered, and usually, a means of reporting fuel drawn by a vehicle. The fleet list is usually input using an integral keypad or an office based console. These systems were either fitted with integral printers or permanently hard-wired to back office consoles that provided simple reporting and printouts, these system types were superseded by the proliferation of low cost PC's.

'''Third generation''' : A fuel-island control system similar to a second-generation system, which is either periodically, or permanently connected to a PC which is used to report on the fuellings and input the fleet information. These systems also provided the first "networked" systems, usually fitted with a dial up modem within the island terminal, networks could be polled around usually at 12pm onwards to download the days transaction to a central PC and controller.

'''Fourth generation''' : The fuel-island controller is fully connected directly to a central [[Internet]]-based server which is updated in real time. All fleet information and transactions are held on the central server. Connection is made from the fuel island to the server using [[GPRS]], or can use the operators own network using a [[Wi-Fi]] or Cabled Network Link. Continuous Internet connection can not be guaranteed and hence any fourth-generation system must have a fall-back white/black list, usually built in real time from previous authorisations.

The principal advantages of a real-time system are that site operation can be monitored in real time, stock figures are always current, and, with integrated tank gauging, fuel theft from tanks and short deliveries can be identified immediately.

The advent of real-time systems has much reduced the requirements of having printed reports, usually circulated and ignored, in favour of users looking at live and current data presented as and when they need it. Having users interact with live and relevant data, rather than simply viewing lists of out of date information encourages a more active view of fuel management than was previously possible, so that active, timely interventions take place generating fuel savings - which is the entire point of the system. The challenge facing manufacturers currently is to make real time data analysis tools which are relevant to the industry and are quick and simple to use by any operator with no technical background.

==ID Devices/Methods==
To identify the vehicle/equipment being fuelled, some sort of ID token is normally used. On the most simple systems, this may be an ID or registration number typed in through a keypad, but as this is open to abuse, offering no real fuel security, a physical token is most often used. Some of the most common are listed here :

'''RFID Tags''' : By far the most common type of ID token as it is the most reliable in the sometimes harsh environment where fuelling takes place. Using an RFID tag means there are no openings required in the fuel-management terminal and hence best protection from water or dust ingress. [[RFID tag]]s are low cost and very reliable and the reader requires no ongoing maintenance.

'''Magnetic Cards''' : Often seen as a saving over purchasing RFID tags, a fleet already using fuel cards will use these same [[magnetic card|cards]] at the fuel-island terminal. The exposed nature of most fuel islands is not the ideal environment for the use of fuel cards so reliability may be compromised and hence perceived savings not achieved. If the readers are regularly cleaned, then an acceptable level of reliability may be achieved.

'''Dallas Touch Keys / IButtons''' : A popular alternative to RFID tags, these keys have two electrical contacts which need to be touched to a reader. These keys are very reliable with only minimal maintenance of the key reader required.

'''Nozzle Based Technologies''' : In this system, the fuelling nozzle has a reader mounted on it, or [https://www.banlaw.com/fuel-management-systems/auto-id-refuelling-hardware/ integrated within the nozzle itself]. When the refuelling nozzle is inserted into the vehicle filler neck, or connected as part of a dry break fuel system, the vehicle ID is read. This vehicle identification is then transmitted back to the FM terminal using wires or RFID technology. The advantage of this type of system is that the fuelling nozzle must be fully inserted or connected to the vehicle before fuel starts to flow, and fuelling stops if the nozzle is removed, making on-site fuel theft much more difficult. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop off-site fuel theft, and so should be coupled with anti-syphoning technologies to complete the system.

'''Hand Held Scanners''' : These are especially useful for Mobile Refuelling Solutions where the fueller is some distance from the pumping unit (eg Bowser) when fuelling takes place. The Hand Held Unit has either an RFID, Near field or Barcode Reader to read a tag or barcode permanently attached to the equipment to be fuelled. The HHU then uses a radio link to transmit the ID data back to the bowser where it is validated and the pump started. The fueller is at the point of delivery and hence can control the hose, minimising spillage issues.

'''Bluetooth technology''': Vehicles may be retrofitted with a [[Bluetooth]] transponder to allow for both vehicle identification and data transfer from the vehicle's [[CAN bus|CAN]] network.

==Software==
'''[[Fuel oil|Fuel-oil]] management system''' (FOMS) is a recent development in the field of [[electric power]] by which the [[fuel oil]] level in any [[power plant]] or any industry can be monitored and controlled using [[programmable logic controller]] and [[supervisory control and data acquisition]].  TrackME Guam! Fleet and Fuel Management system is a great example of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/60018027 | title=Development of fuel oil management system software: Phase 1, Tank management module | date=1992 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Lange, H.B., (et al.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glass-like carbon''', often called '''glassy carbon''' or '''vitreous carbon''', is a non-graphitizing, or nongraphitizable, [[carbon]] which combines glassy and [[ceramic]] properties with those of [[graphite]]. The most important properties are high temperature resistance, hardness (7 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]), low density, low electrical resistance, low friction, low thermal resistance, extreme resistance to chemical attack and impermeability to gases and liquids. Glassy carbon is widely used as an electrode material in [[electrochemistry]], as well as for high temperature [[crucible]]s and as a component of some prosthetic devices, and can be fabricated as different shapes, sizes and sections.

The names ''glassy carbon'' and ''vitreous carbon'' have been introduced as trademarks; therefore, [[IUPAC]] does not recommend their use as technical terms.&lt;ref name="iupac"/&gt;

Vitreous carbon can also be produced as a foam. It is then called reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC). This foam was first developed in the mid to late 1960s as a thermally insulating, microporous glassy carbon electrode material. RVC foam is a strong, inert, electrically and thermally conductive, and corrosion resistant porous form of carbon with a low resistance to gas and fluid flow. Due to these characteristics, the most widespread scientific use of RVC is as three-dimensional electrode in electrochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=F.C.|last2=Arenas|first2=L.F.|last3=Ponce de León|first3=C.|last4=Reade|first4=G.W.|last5=Whyte|first5=I.|last6=Mellor|first6=B.G.|title=The continued development of reticulated vitreous carbon as a versatile electrode material: Structure, properties and applications|journal=Electrochimica Acta|date=2016|volume=215|pages=566–591|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2016.08.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, RVC foams are characterized by an exceptionally high void volume, high surface area, and very high thermal resistance in non-oxidising environments, which allows for heat sterilization and facilitates manipulation in biological applications.

==History==
Glassy carbon was first observed in the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK, in the mid-1950s by Bernard Redfern, a materials scientist and diamond technologist.  He noticed that [[Sellotape]] he used to hold ceramic (rocket nozzle) samples in a furnace maintained a sort of structural identity after firing in an inert atmosphere.
He searched for a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|resole]] resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this phenolic resin, crucibles were produced.  Crucibles were distributed to organisations such as UKAEA Harwell.

Bernard Redfern left The Carborundum Co., which officially wrote off all interests in the glassy carbon invention.  While working at [[Plessey|the Plessey Company]] laboratory (in a disused church) in Towcester, UK, Redfern received a glassy carbon crucible for duplication from UKAEA. He identified it as one he had made from markings he had engraved into the uncured precursor prior to carbonisation. (It is almost impossible to engrave the finished product.)  The Plessey Company set up a laboratory first in a factory previously used to make briar pipes, in Litchborough, UK, and then a permanent facility at Caswell, near Blakesly, UK. Caswell became the Plessey Research Centre and then the Allen Clark Research Centre.  Glassy carbon arrived at the Plessey Company Limited as a fait accompli.  Redfern was assigned J.C. Lewis, as a laboratory assistant, for the production of glassy carbon. F.C. Cowlard was assigned to Redfern's department later, as a laboratory administrator.  Cowlard was an administrator who previously had some association with Silane (Silane US Patent assignee 3,155,621 3 Nov 1964). Neither he nor Lewis had any previous connection with glassy carbon.
The contribution of Bernard Redfern to the invention and production of glassy / Vitreous carbon is acknowledged by his co-authorship of early articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=J.C. |author2=Redfern, B. |author3=Cowlard, F.C. |year=1963 |title=Vitreous carbon as a crucible material for semiconductors |journal=Solid-State Electronics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=251–254 |doi=10.1016/0038-1101(63)90081-9 |bibcode = 1963SSEle...6..251L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But references to Redfern were not obvious in subsequent publications by Cowlard and Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cowlard |first=F.C. |author2=Lewis, J.C. |year=1967 |title=Vitreous carbon — A new form of carbon |journal=Journal of Materials Science |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=507–512 |doi=10.1007/BF00752216 |bibcode = 1967JMatS...2..507C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Original boat crucibles, thick section rods and precursor samples exist.

Redfern's UK patent application were filed on 11 January 1960 and Bernard Redfern was the author of US patent US3109712A, granted 5 November 1963, priority date 11 January 1960, filing date 9 January 1961.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US3109712&lt;/ref&gt; This came after the rescinded British patent.
This prior art is not referenced in US patent 4,668,496, 26 May 1987 for Vitreous Carbon.  Patents were filed "Bodies and shapes of carbonaceous materials and processes for their production" and the name "Vitreous Carbon" presented to the product by the son of Redfern.

Glassy/Vitreous Carbon was under investigation used for components for thermonuclear detonation systems and at least some of the patents surrounding the material were rescinded (in the interests of national security) in the 1960s.

Large sections of the precursor material were produced as castings, moldings or machined into a predetermined shape. Large crucibles and other forms were manufactured. Carbonisation took place in two stages. Shrinkage during this process is considerable (48.8%) but is absolutely uniform and predictable. A nut and bolt can be made to fit as the polymer, processed separately and subsequently give a perfect fit.

Some of the first ultrapure samples of [[Gallium Arsenide]] were zone refined in these crucibles. (Glassy carbon is extremely pure and unreactive to GaAs).

Doped/impure glassy carbon exhibited semiconductor phenomena.

Uranium carbide inclusions were fabricated (using U238 carbide at experimental scale).

On October 11, 2011, research conducted at the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory led by Stanford’s Wendy L. Mao and her graduate student Yu Lin described a new form of glassy carbon formed under high pressure with hardness equal to diamond, a kind of [[diamond-like carbon]]. Unlike diamond, however its structure is that of [[amorphous carbon]] so its hardness may be isotropic. Research is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-10-superhard-carbon.html New form of superhard carbon observed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The structure of glassy carbon has long been a subject of debate. Early structural models assumed that both [[Orbital hybridisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded]] atoms were present, but it is now known that glassy carbon is 100% sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More recent research has suggested that glassy carbon has a [[fullerenes|fullerene]]-related structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~scsharip/PM_glassy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Fullerene-related structure of commercial glassy carbons|first1= P.J.F. |last1=Harris|date=2003|doi=10.1080/14786430410001720363|journal=Philosophical Magazine|issue=29|volume=84|pages=3159–3167|bibcode=2004PMag...84.3159H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that glassy carbon should not be confused with [[amorphous carbon]]. This from IUPAC: "Glass-like carbon cannot be described as amorphous carbon because it consists of two-dimensional structural elements and does not exhibit ‘dangling’ bonds."&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/G02639.html The entry for "Glass-like carbon" in IUPAC Goldbook.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It exhibits a [[conchoidal fracture]].

==Electrochemical properties==
Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in aqueous solutions is considered to be an inert electrode for [[hydronium]] ion reduction:&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

Comparable reaction on platinum:
: &lt;chem&gt;{H3O+_{(aq)}} + {Pt_{(s)}} + e^- &lt;=&gt; Pt:H_{(s)}&lt;/chem&gt; {{nb5}} &lt;math&gt;E^\ominus = \ 0.000\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt; versus NHE at 25 °C

The difference of 2.1 V is attributed to the properties of platinum which stabilizes a covalent Pt-H bond.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"/&gt;

==Physical properties==
Properties include 'high temperature resistance', hardness (7 Mohs), low density, low electrical resistance, low friction, and low thermal resistance.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} &lt;!-- fill in actual measured values --&gt;

== Advantages ==
Due to their specific surface orientation, glassy carbon is employed as an electrode material for the fabrication of sensors. Glassy carbon paste, glassy carbon, carbon paste etc. electrodes when modified are termed as chemically modified electrodes.

'''Hematine''' (also '''magnetic hematite''', '''hemalyke''' or '''hemalike''') is an artificial magnetic material. Hematine is widely used in jewelry. 

Although it is claimed by many that it is made from ground [[hematite]] or [[iron oxide]] mixed with a [[resin]], analysis has demonstrated it to be an entirely artificial compound, a [[Ferrite (magnet)|barium-strontium ferrite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-35948.html ''Magnetic Hematite'' on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transformers at Kraftwerk Kachlet, Passau.jpg|thumb|High-voltage transformers with [[Bushing (electrical)|bushings]] on top, separated by a fire barrier]]
[[File:St marys kfg ext installation.jpg|thumb|upright|High-voltage transformer inside an electrical service building, behind an external damper at the (now defunct) [[St. Mary's Paper]]. When inside a [[building]] the room containing the [[transformer]] is referred to as a transformer vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmweb.com/code-basics/article-450-transformers-and-transformer-vaults Ecmweb.com article on transformer vaults, as mentioned in NEC (National Electrical Code) or '''NFPA 70''' Article 450: Transformers and Transformer Vaults]&lt;/ref&gt; for example in [https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=5000 NFPA 5000 - 2015]'s 16.3.2.1 Service Equipment, Hazardous Operations or Processes, and Storage Facilities, whereby the walls containing such equipment have unique requirements, separate and apart from outdoor transformer fire walls, which are not subject to [[building code]]s. In this case, a [[Mortar (masonry)#Firestop mortar|firestop mortar]] is being installed in an exterior [[electrical cable]] through-penetration.]]

'''High-voltage transformer fire barriers''', or '''transformer firewalls''', '''transformer ballistic firewalls''', '''transformer blast walls''', are outdoor countermeasures against [[cascading failure]]s in a national [[electric grid]]. 
The purpose of these barriers, like common fire barriers in building construction, is [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]] of transformer fires, as well as transformer and [[Bushing (electrical)|bushing]] explosions where the fuel source of both fires and explosions is the [[transformer oil]]. 
Without compartmentalisation, one ruptured transformer could start its neighbouring transformer on fire and thus create a [[domino effect]] that can affect the surrounding electric grid, particularly during peak times. 

High-voltage transformer fire barriers are typically located in [[electrical substation]]s, but may also be attached to buildings, such as [[valve hall]]s or manufacturing plants with large [[Electric power distribution|electrical distribution systems]], such as [[Paper mill|pulp and paper mills]]. 
Outdoor transformer fire barriers that are attached at least on one side to a building are referred to as [[wing wall]]s.
At times, high-voltage transformers can be located immediately outside and sometimes inside of buildings, requiring higher fire-resistance ratings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmweb.com/code-basics/article-450-transformers-and-transformer-vaults Ecmweb.com article entitled "Article 450: Transformers and Transformer Vaults" by Mike Holt, dated 01. May 2008, Search for "Vault construction" Paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt; than other fire compartments in a building.

==Substations as deliberate targets==
As early as [[World War II]], substations have been military targets. During WW2, [[Operation Josephine B]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpsas.fr/nos-comites/comites-regionaux/comite-sud-ouest/operation-josephine-b Afpsas.fr essay with pictures, documenting Operation Josephine B, SOE sabotage of French substation during WW2.]&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Special Operations Executive]] successfully targeted a French substation with high-voltage transformers in order to disrupt the German war effort there.


==Code requirements==
Outdoor structures, such as the transformers and fire barriers that separate them, do not constitute buildings, as defined by [[building code]]s. Building codes, therefore, do not typically apply to them, unless buildings are in close proximity and may be adversely affected by transformer ruptures. Where building code issues are inapplicable, no typical building permit is required, as would be the case for a house or office building&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Permits/carl-building-development-permit-search.aspx City of Calgary Building and Development lists and forms, indicating need for building permits for new buildings as well as changes to existing ones]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
If no building code applies, then also no [[Fire_safety#Fire_code|fire code]] applies, as fire codes presume construction and approval per the local building code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/the-codes Province of British Columbia Explanatory Guide entitled "The Codes", indicating that the BC Building Code is for new construction, whereas the BC Fie Code is for buildings that are already in use.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is a crucial factor in terms of regulatory or judicial oversight concerning the construction and maintenance of transformer fire barriers. 

Building construction and maintenance have the benefit of a defined [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gridalternatives.org/sites/default/files/Linked%20documents/The%20Code%20Corner%20No.%209%20-%20Authorities%20Having%20Jurisdiction.pdf Gridalternatives.org explanatory guide concerning AHJs, Authority Having Jurisdiction]&lt;/ref&gt;.
When a building is designed, the architect submits drawings and specifications to the municipal or regional building department, such as the [[New York City Department of Buildings]], along with a fee, which covers plans examinations and inspections.
The building department then has a plans examiner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-plans-examiner-do.htm Wisegeek.com definition of "plans examiner"]&lt;/ref&gt; check construction documents for compliance with the applicable building code. 
He or she may require changes before construction may proceed. 
Once construction is underway, the building department typically has a building inspector checking on progress and compliance. 
Once a building, or occupancy, is completed and in use, the Authority Having Jurisdiction typically changes from the building department, enforcing the building code that was in effect on the date of the building permit application, over to the fire department, and, specifically the local fire prevention officer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://iroquoisfalls.civicweb.net/document/5449/Fire%20Prevention%20Officer%20-%20Revision%200.pdf?handle=88995F8C2B06414FA505F5D8ECACE4A8 Fire prevention officer job description, City of Iroquois Falls, Ontario, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; who is tasked to enforce the local fire code, which is based upon the building code. 
A fire prevention officer is actually a law enforcement official, who can criminally charge violators of the fire code, such as home owners or office building or plant owners. While North American outdoor transformer fire barriers use identical fire test standards to qualify fire barriers as are used in buildings (ASTM E119,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119 Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; UL263,&lt;ref&gt;[https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_263_14 UL263 Standard for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; CAN/ULC-S101,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.orderline.com/can-ulc-s101-14-standard-methods-of-fire-endurance-tests-of-building-construction-and-materials-fifth-edition-12 CAN/ULC-S101 Standard Methods of Fire Endurance Tests of Building Construction and Materials Fifth Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; and, formerly, NFPA 251&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=251 NFPA 251 Standard Methods of Tests of Fire Resistance of Building Construction and Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;), and despite the fact that the national electric grid is considered critical national infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/articles/national-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-month-improving-security-and National Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month: Improving the Security and Resilience of the Nation's Grid November 3, 2015 by Patricia A. Hoffman, OE-1]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no governmental oversight, such as exists for any buildings. 
For example, in buildings, it is customary to have to prove compliance with codes by means of [[certification listing]]s, bounding and [[certification mark]]s. This is the easiest way to communicate to an Authority Having Jurisdiction, that the item tested is identical to the item being sold and installed as intended and within the tolerances indicated in the certification listing, which summarises the test report. 
However, in the absence of a code for such outdoor installations, as is the case in North America, there is also no AHJ to make sure that what is being installed is verified by a third party to be fit for purpose, which leaves the property owners to perform this task. In the absence of certification listings that [[bounding|bound]] the installed configuration, complete with certification marks on the installed fire barrier, which points to the listing number, the end-user must also interpret the test report to resolve bounding issues, which requires knowledge and comprehension of test standards, and the corresponding conditions of acceptance, as well as the raw data provided by the vendor to prove compliance. Personnel familiar with electrical matters, such as [[high-voltage direct current]], [[electric power transmission]] and transformers, who may be expected to decide on a tender for transformer fire barriers, can thus benefit from training concerning [[fire-resistance rating]]s and [[fire test]]ing, which are completely different fields, that do not ordinarily cross over into the electrical realm, particularly for outdoor installations&lt;ref&gt;[https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/curriculum/ee-curriculum-06.asp Illinois Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Curriculum for Electrical Engineering, lacking mention of fire-resistance testing per ASTM E119, NFPA 251, NFPA 850, NFPA 5000, CAN/ULC-S101, UL 263, BS476, DIN 4102, ISO 834]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/curriculum MIT EECS Curriculum page for Electrical Engineering, lacking any mention of fire-resistance testing per ASTM E119, NFPA 251, NFPA 850, NFPA 5000, CAN/ULC-S101, UL 263, BS476, DIN 4102, ISO 834]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Voluntary recommendations by NFPA 850==
The primary North American document that deals with outdoor high-voltage transformer fire barriers is NFPA 850&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=850 NFPA 850 Recommended Practice for Fire Protection for Electric Generating Plants and High-Voltage Direct Current Converter Stations]&lt;/ref&gt;. NFPA 850 – 2015 indicates 3.3.24.2 Fire Resistance Rating. The time, in minutes or hours, that materials or assemblies have withstood a fire exposure as determined by the [[Fire test|tests]], or methodology based on testing, as mandated in NFPA 5000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=5000 NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code®]&lt;/ref&gt;. NFPA 5000 states under 8.2.1.1, that the [[fire-resistance rating]]s of structural elements and building assemblies shall be determined in accordance with the prescriptive requirements of 8.2.2 based on the test procedures set forth in '''ASTM E 119, Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials, or UL 263, Standard for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials''', or other approved test methodology or analytical methods as per §8.2.3., which refer to the use of ASCE/SFPE 29, Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection. NFPA 850 further outlines that outdoor oil-insulated transformers should be separated from adjacent structures and from each other by [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]], spatial separation, or other approved means for the purpose of limiting the damage and potential spread of fire from a transformer failure. 5.1.4.3 states that unless consideration of the factors in 5.1.4.2 indicates otherwise, it is recommended that any oil-insulated transformer containing 500 US [[gallon]]s (1,893 [[Litre|L]]) or more of oil be separated from adjacent structures by a 2-hour–rated firewall or by spatial separation in accordance with Table 5.1.4.3. Where a firewall is provided between structures and a transformer, it should extend vertically and horizontally as indicated in Figure 5.1.4.3.
5.1.4.4 of NFPA 850 states that unless consideration of the factors in 5.1.4.2 indicates otherwise, it is recommended that adjacent oil-insulated transformers containing 500 US gallons (1,893 litres) or more of oil be separated from each other by a 2 hour–rated fire separation or by spatial separation as per Table 5.1.4.3. When the oil containment, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.4, consists of a large, flat concrete containment area that holds several transformers and other equipment in it without the typical pit containment areas, specific containment features to keep the oil in one transformer from migrating to any other transformer or equipment should be provided. Subsection 5.5.7 may be used for guidance. Where a firewall is provided between transformers, it should extend at least 30cm (12") above the top of the transformer casing and oil conservator tank and at least 61cm or 24" beyond the width of the transformer and cooling radiators, or to the edge of the containment area, whichever is greater.
'''5.1.4.5 Where a firewall is provided, it should be designed to withstand the effects of projectiles from exploding transformer bushings or lightning arresters'''.
The above results in the following checklist for compliance against NFPA 850 and its subordinate documents (NFPA 5000, ASTM E119, UL 263, as well as NFPA 251 and CAN/ULC S101, all of which are identical, and represent the sum of North American wall fire testing standards)

The furnace instrumentation, and, specifically, whether the furnace thermocouples are shielded, has an influence upon the severity of the initial thermal shock upon any fire test sample, whereby shielded thermocouple experience a time lag, during the first half hour of a fire test, until the heat has sufficiently soaked into the Inconel thermocouple shielding tubes, to be responsive to changes in the average furnace temperature. This means that North American furnaces can run ca. 200[[Celsius|°C]] (392[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) hotter (early in the test, inflicting greater thermal shock) than [[Europe]]an furnaces equipped with fast response thermocouples (using bare copper plates). In the aforementioned [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/enforcement/actions/non-licensees/ea95009.html Thermo-Lag Scandal], it was determined and entered into the record of the [[Library of Congress]] in the case against Thermal Science Inc.

Using a furnace equipped with fast response thermocouples, the test samples passed, but identical test samples failed when tested in accordance with the same time/temperature curve (ASTM E119 curve) when the furnace was instrumented per North American standards, using shielded thermocouples, at Omega Point Laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trademarkia.com/omega-point-laboratories-73727427.html Trademarkia.com reference to Omega Point Laboratories, which was acquired by Intertek]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Elmendorf, Texas]], in support of the government’s case against TSI.

*5.) [[File:Cfd construction 234.jpg|thumb|Mandatory hose stream test, of a wall system, containing a [[fire door]]. Up to and including 3 hours of fire-endurance, the pressure at the base of the nozzle is 2.1 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] or 30 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]. From 4 hours on, the pressure must be 3.1 bars of 45PSI. The duration of the hose stream test depends on the sample size and the length of the fire endurance period: 1 minute per 100ft² (9.3m²) up to 1 hour of fire testing. 1.5 minutes per 100ft² (9.3m²) up to 1.5 hours of fire testing. 2.5 minutes per 100ft² (9.3m²) up to 3 hours of fire testing. 5 minutes per 100ft² (9.3m²) from 4 hours to less than 8 hours of fire testing. Therefore, a 6 hours fire-resistance test sample would have to undergo 45PSI (3.1 bar), at 5 minutes per 100ft² or 9.3m² in order to qualify. 6 minutes for 8 hours of fire-resistance and above per 100ft² or 9.3m².]] '''Mandatory hose stream testing'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrJpqRVn29o YouTube video of a mandatory hose stream test following an ASTM E119 fire endurance test of a non-loadbearing wall system]&lt;/ref&gt; following the end of the fire endurance test within 10 minutes of gas shutoff. ASTM E119 now refers to a separate document, ASTM E2226,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2226.htm ASTM E2226 Standard Practice for Application of Hose Stream]&lt;/ref&gt; for the hose stream test, in order to avoid duplication, as the hose stream procedure is used in other fire-resistive assemblies in addition to those tested under ASTM E119. Testing outside of North America typically excludes hose stream testing, unless witnessed by North American authorities for the purpose of obtaining ratings inside of North America. In order to qualify for a rating or to be able to use the term '''fire-resistance''' for a wall system in North America, in addition to all other requirements, there can be no through-projection of water from the exposed side to the unexposed side of the test sample.
*6.) The temperature on the unexposed side of the '''wall sample must be equipped with a minimum of 9 (nine) thermocouples''', which are covered with defined [[High-temperature insulation wool|ceramic fibre]] pads, sized 6" x 6" x 3/8" or 15 x 15 x 0.95 cm, density 18.7lbs/ft³ or 300kg/m³. The temperature rise on the unexposed side on the average of the minimum 9 thermocouples on a wall sample shall not exceed 139°C (250°F) and no single hot spot is permitted in excess of a heat rise above 181°C (325°F). The nearly identical Canadian test standard CAN/ULC-S101 (metric) states 140°C and 180°C for average, versus single point hot spot. The point in time at which either or both of those maximum heat arises, above the starting temperature before the fire has begun, is exceeded, that time period to thermal failure determines the overall rating of the assembly. Example: If a 2-hour fire endurance test, were to have a thermal failure at the 10 or 17-minute point, there would be no use in continuing the test once the limiting temperature were reached, even if the sample could, after the fire endurance period, pass the hose stream test, as any single criterion can fail the sample altogether. Temperatures radiated from a test sample to a subjective distance away from the unexposed side are immaterial, as the test standards all mandate the temperature be used that is measured by the unexposed side thermocouple, under the thermocouple pad.

===Fragmentation resistance per NFPA 850 in addition to standard fire-resistance for transformer fire walls===
NFPA 850 recommends the following additional test criterion during a fire event:
: '''5.1.4.5 Where a firewall is provided, it should be designed to withstand the effects of [[projectile]]s from exploding [[Bushing (electrical)|transformer bushings]] or [[lightning arrester]]s.'''
*NFPA 850 does not provide a test procedure for this fragmentation of electrical equipment as a result of a transformer explosion. It would stand to reason that the fragmentation is a fire event, since there is no explosion without sufficient [[heat]] [[Arc flash|to ignite]] the [[transformer oil]]. However, added fragmentation exposures during standardised fire testing is outside of fire test standards. Therefore, the application of fragmentation following the mandatory hose stream test would leave the fire test procedure unaltered and still compliant with this requirement. Using the wording provided in NFPA 850, the test sample has to resist the effects of the fragmentation, meaning that the fragmentation should not permit the creation of see-through openings in the sample, which would during the course of a fire, permit heat and hot projectiles to traverse the barrier. What is missing, however, is data on the size, shape, momentum and number of projectiles to be employed in any qualifying tests, leaving that consideration to the end-user, particularly in the absence of a code or Authority Having Jurisdiction.

==Hydrocarbon fire testing==
{{Commons category|Time/Temperature Curves}}
===Why test high-voltage transformer fire barriers to the hydrocarbon (UL 1709) time/temperature curve?===
NFPA 850 recommends the use of the cellulosic time/temperature curve, which is over 100 years old and is based upon burning wood, as that was a predominant building material and furniture material in buildings at the time. It is a severe fire test. However, the [[fuel]] in transformer fires and explosions, is [[transformer oil]]. Oil is a [[hydrocarbon]]. Hydrocarbons burn more rapidly and release more heat faster than the same quantity of wood. Therefore, a comparison of the ASTM E119 and UL 1709 time/temperature curves suggests the continued use standard wall fire test procedures in ASTM E119, as recommended in NFPA 850, as this applies to non-loadbearing walls, regardless of which time/temperature curve is employed, but to substitute a hydrocarbon time/temperature curve, because transformers are filled with oil, not wood, which explains the different heat signatures.

===Nomenclature clarification===
Any reference to hydrocarbon fire testing, particularly in North America, implies the use of the '''UL 1709'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_1709 Underwriters Laboratories Abstract of the Standard for Rapid Rise Fire Tests of Protection Materials for Structural Steel]&lt;/ref&gt; time/temperature curve, which inherently also implies the use of UL1709’s provisions or furnace instrumentation. In France, and French-influenced countries, it could also mean the use of the modified French hydrocarbon curve, using fast response furnace thermocouples. Where any walls are concerned, including high-voltage transformer fire barrier walls, particularly with the use of the terms ''fire-resistance'' or ''fire-resistant'', what is inherently implied in North America, is the use of one of the identical fire test standards that are used to evaluate non-loadbearing wall assemblies, including and limited to NFPA 251, ASTM E119, UL 263 and/or CAN/ULC-S101. European standards, such as ISO 834, DIN 4102 or BS476, that exclude the mandatory hose stream test and rely on fast response thermocouples for furnace instrumentation, cannot be implied under the terminology of “fire-resistance” or “fire-resistant” for North America, and would have to be very explicitly outlined in order to comply with the [[Competition Act]], Section VII.1 and [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], §45, which states ’’“Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful. '''Specifically, BS476, Part 20, 1987 makes the “insulation rating” optional (which is never the case in North American wall fire test standards), and also permits the lab’s use of depth gauges to measure maximum gaps in a fire barrier that may develop as a result of fire test exposure.''' Such practices are not permitted in any North American wall fire test standards. Therefore, a North American high-voltage transformer fire barrier, advertised as a hydrocarbon fire wall or hydrocarbon fire barrier, implies the use of a North American wall fire test standard, whereby the test sample is exposed to the UL 1709 time/temperature curve, substituting the cellulosic curve, using shielded thermocouples, in a calibrated furnace, and satisfying the conditions of acceptance in ASTM E119, NFPA 251, UL 263 and/or CAN/ULC S101 for non-loadbearing walls, which includes mandatory insulation and hose stream test passing performance.

==Concrete used as transformer fire barrier==
Cast concrete is an effective fire barrier in ''building construction'', whose fire exposure is limited to cellulosic time/temperature curve exposures. Evidence of this is plentiful&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/th-buildings-structures-pdfs/fire-concrete-struc-sei-08.pdf?sfvrsn=4 Portland Cement Association publication entitled "Fire and Concrete Structures", from "Structures 2008: Crossing Borders"]&lt;/ref&gt;. This does not mean that concrete of ''any'' mix design inherently achieves fire-resistance in all situations without careful consideration of multiple factors. For example, [[polypropylene]] [[Fiber-reinforced concrete|fibres]] have been successfully used to mitigate spalling of concrete when exposed to [[hydrocarbon]] fires&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal/m/details/id/51685607 American Concrete Institute, International Concrete Abstracts Portal, "Testing of Normal- and High-Strength Concrete Walls Subjected to Both Standard and Hydrocarbon Fires" by Tuan Ngo, Sam Fragomeni, Priyan Mendis, and Binh Ta, dated 01. May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;. The types of aggregate used in concrete can affect fire resistance&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285259332_Fire_Resistance_of_Steel_Slag_Aggregates_Concrete Researchgate.net Abstract on Fire Resistance of Steel Slag Aggregates Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The amount of moisture in concrete is known to affect fire-resistance&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281113999_FIRE_SPALLING_-_THE_MOISTURE_EFFECT Researchgate.net Abstract on "FIRE SPALLING – THE MOISTURE EFFECT", dated September 2009 from Robert Jansson McNamee and Lars Bostrom]&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, typically, cementitious products and concrete slabs in fire test laboratories are equipped with moisture probes and ordinarily not subjected to fire testing unless relative humidity is at or below 75%. Further, ASTM E119 indicates in §6.2, that, prior to fire-resistance testing, test specimens are to be conditioned with the objective of providing a moisture condition within the test specimen representative of that in similar construction in buildings. For purposes of standardisation, this condition is established at equilibrium resulting from conditioning in an ambient atmosphere of 50 % [[relative humidity]] at 22.8°C or 73°F. There is public domain video evidence on concrete spalling when exposed to high temperatures&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CixMjo5VtgA YouTube video from Efectis Nederland, showing the underside of a concrete slab spalling within a half hour to the point of exposing rebar when testing to the RWS time/temperature curve]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjIy-500j00 YouTube Video from Propex, showing explosive spalling of concrete exposed to direct flame]&lt;/ref&gt;. Both the amount of free water, which could evaporate out in hot and dry conditions, and the concentration of [[hydrate]]s play a role in concrete's reaction to fire. The binder used also makes a difference, whereby '''[[calcium aluminate cements]]''' are broadly used in '''[[Refractory|refractory castables]]'''. Just because a calcium aluminate cement is used in a concrete mix design, however, does not mean that there aren't important design considerations, as free water and hydrates are considered here too, to prevent spalling. In fact, it is customary for freshly placed castables to be subjected to a certain heating regime&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955221903003261 Journal of the European Ceramic Society Abstract on "Drying behavior of hydratable alumina-bonded refractory castables", Volume 24, Issue 5, May 2004, Pages 797-802, by Fábio A.Cardoso, Murilo D. M. Innocentini, Marcela F.S.Miranda, Fernando A. O. Valenzuela and Professor Victor C. Pandolfelli]&lt;/ref&gt;in order to prevent explosive spalling as a result of heat exposure. Apart from moisture-based spalling, there is also the process of ''"conversion"'', whereby concrete made with calcium aluminate cement first gains significant strength, but then loses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/materials/calcium-aluminate-cement-concrete_o Concreteconstruction.net article entitled "Calcium Aluminate Cement Concrete, A rapid-hardening material which resists high temperatures and corrosive substances" by J. H. Fishwick, Posted on: 01. May 1982] &lt;/ref&gt; some of it in the conversion process&lt;ref&gt;[https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/kw52jd85q Oregon State University Publication entitled "Factors Influencing Conversion and Volume Stability in Calcium Aluminate Cement Systems" by Matthew Peter Adams, dated 28. May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;. Incorrect use of calcium aluminate cements in construction has led to widespread problems, especially during the third quarter of the 20th century when this type of cement was used because of its faster hardening properties. The problem here was the false assumption that the pre-conversion strength was the final compression or "cold crushing" strength. After several years, some of the buildings and structures collapsed due to degradation of the cement and many had to be torn down or reinforced. Heat and humidity accelerate the conversion process; the roof of a swimming pool was one of the first structures to collapse in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webs.demasiado.com/forjados/patologia/aluminoso/index.htm Degradation of concrete made with calcium aluminate cement]&lt;/ref&gt;. In Madrid, Spain, a large housing block nicknamed Korea (because it was built to house Americans during the [[Korean War]]), built 1951~1954 was affected and had to be torn down in 2006.  Also in Madrid the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium]] was affected and had to be partially rebuilt and reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unitshine.com/technology-2/19-development-of-calcium-aluminate-cement-and-arousing-problems.html Unitshine.com Article entitled: "Development of Calcium Aluminate Cement and Arousing Problems" confirming construction failures as a result of the incorrect use of calcium aluminate cement.]&lt;/ref&gt;. While NFPA 850 refers to analytical methods used to determine fire-resistance of concrete structures, one must bear in mind that this refers back to building codes, which are based upon fires in relatively dry buildings. Outdoor transformer fire barrier design based on concrete, regardless whether the binder is [[Portland cement]] or calcium aluminate cement, must take into account moisture conditions both in terms of free moisture and hydrates. Simply substituting binders to refractory binders, does not eliminate the ASTM E119 requirements concerning sample conditioning. This means that one rainfall or high humidity, even with heat treatment of CAC bound concrete can affect fire-resistance. Painting the concrete does not stop [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserdampfdiffusionswiderstand steam diffusion] and may just lock in moisture that can exacerbate spalling. Suppose hypothetically that a design verified an 8" or 20cm thickness of a certain concrete mix design. There is still the fire-event fragmentation to be considered as well, as its test sequencing. It is possible to overcome the technical challenges, but one must take all factors into account, or use a certification listed system, that can be verified to have taken the aforementioned factors into account.

==Ballistic resistance==
[[File:Pannzerung plastische deformation.png|thumb|Steel-based armour, exhibiting [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] as a result of [[projectile]] [[Impact (mechanics)|impacts]]. Plastic deformation as a result of impact can knock loose, tear or squish [[passive fire protection]] (PFP) materials, particularly once the PFP materials are stressed. Some PFP materials can at times be very resilient, impact resistant and ductile ''at ambient''. Once stressed by fire, that can change as free water dissipates at 100°C (212°F), and hydrates can be spent near 300°C (572°F), all of which is reached within minutes of a fire. Construction level binders, unlike certain refractories, can also degrade with heat, thus changing the physical properties of many PFP materials across different temperature ranges. None of that is normally a problem. In fact it is part of PFP designs for various reasons. But when combining PFP with ballistics or fragmentation, it is prudent to consider all relevant stresses in designing barriers that must (or may be presumed or advertised to) simultaneously defeat fire, followed by hose stream and impacts that come during a fire event. For example, if a PFP material failed the hose stream test after only 1 hour of fire endurance, this would be an indicator of loss of ductility as a result of heat exposure.]]

Utilities at times require ballistic protection of their high-voltage transformer fire barriers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/durasystems-barriers-inc/vaughan-ontario-l4k-4t2/durasystems-barriers-inc-dsbi-durabarrier-high-voltage-transformer-fire-barrier-is-a-sca-1465535#comment_1 Comment 1 on Ripoff Report concerning NERC's removal of former link included here concerning ballistic transformer fire barriers]&lt;/ref&gt;. This can have two reasons. First, there have been a number of incidents of reports of shots fired on transformers, for example, in Nova Scotia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/shots-fired-at-newfoundland-power-transformer-cause-outage-1.2594158 CBC News article entitled "Shots fired at Newfoundland Power transformer cause outage" Damages caused 8,000-litre oil spill, Posted: 01.

November 2017, 15:01 hours, by David Giles, Senior Web Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/operations/turbines-shut-down-transformer-damaged-after-shots-fired-at-alberta-wind-farm-184628/ Canadianmanufacturing.com article entitled "Transformer damaged, turbines shut down after shots fired at Alta. wind farm" TransAlta staff discovered bullet holes in a transformer at its McBride Lake wind farm south of Calgary when responding to a remote alert; RCMP investigating, say shots were possibly fired from nearby road]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metcalf sniper attack]]. Shooting at an operating transformer could cause a fire and explosion. This scenario could be tested by exposing the test sample to shots fired before a fire test. Secondly, since NFPA 850 mentions and anecdotal evidence confirms the possibility of fragmentation from bushings and lightning arresters, which form part of the transformer, one could argue that a ballistic test could simulate fire-event fragmentation. Both scenarios have validity, at least until NFPA adds a specific test regime or performance requirement for the fragmentation.
Whether to defeat ballistic sabotage or transformer fragmentation, either the fire barrier has inherent ballistic resistance properties, or it is added on by means of [[Vehicle armour|armour]]. Vehicle armour traditionally has to consider trade-offs between resistance and weight. For a static wall, keeping the weight low is less important than for fighting vehicles, where every pound of added weight affects range and cargo carrying capacity. Also, a transformer fire barrier is not ordinarily designed to defeat [[artillery]], whereas a [[main battle tank]] would be. However, particularly in subsequent installations, where adding the protection is an afterthought, rather than forming part of the original design, there is an incentive to keep barriers as small and modular as possible whilst defeating the given requirements of fire, fragmentation and ballistics, simply due to spatial geometry and the need to perform installation and maintenance work in confined spaces.
Particularly for added armour, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_steel#High-tensile_steel high tensile strength steel], or [[rolled homogeneous armour]] (RHA), or even combustible armour materials, such as [[composite material]] including [[Kevlar]] it is important to include such components in fire testing, as they can fundamentally alter fire-resistance performance. In the case of steel armour, this would need to be [[Fireproofing|fireproofed]], like all [[structural steel]] is for fire-resistant applications. If not, steel first expands and then loses its strength&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelforce.com.au/Article-Structural-Steel-pg27186.html Steelforce.com.au article including reference to steel critical temperature]&lt;/ref&gt;, which can cause damage. In the case of combustible materials added for ballistic resistance, meaning materials that do not pass ASTM E136,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E136.htm ASTM Abstract on ASTM E136 Standard Test Method for Behavior of Materials in a Vertical Tube Furnace at 750°C]&lt;/ref&gt; these can add fuel to a fire, which is dangerous as part of a fire-resistant assembly, that should not burn from the inside or on the unexposed side, due to heat transmission and autoignition. Therefore, added ballistic resistance without being included in the qualifying fire and hose-stream testing, can have a deleterious effect, defeating the purpose of the barrier.

===Ballistic testing===
Internationally, there is a variety of ballistic test standards. For North America, [[product certification]] is available from the two primary fire testing and certification organisations using the ballistic test standard UL 752&lt;ref&gt;[https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_752 UL LLC Standards Catalogue, Abstract of UL 752 Standard for Bullet-Resisting Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;. Those two organisations are [[UL (safety organization)|UL LLC]] and [[Intertek]]. This combination of organisations that perform both fire and ballistic testing is desirable, simply because the label on the product indicates compliance. When there is no certification mark on the product installed in the field, visible upon inspection of the installed configuration, there is no third-party evidence that what is installed is identical to that which passed testing. UL752 requires ballistic testing in a calibrated range, with samples measuring 12” x 12” or 30 x 30cm, as well as the use of a calibrated [[gun chronograph]]. UL publishes such listings via Guide CNEX&lt;ref&gt;[http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/showpage.html?name=CNEX.GuideInfo&amp;ccnshorttitle=Bullet-resisting+Materials&amp;objid=1074253800&amp;cfgid=1073741824&amp;version=versionless&amp;parent_id=1073985139&amp;sequence=1 UL Online Certifications Directory CNEX.GuideInfo Bullet-resisting Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;. Intertek describes its UL752 work online,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intertek.com/building/standards/ul-752/ Intertek Website describing its UL 752 work for bullet resisting equipment]&lt;/ref&gt; as performed by its ballistic [[laboratory]] in [[York, Pennsylvania]]. Legitimate testing per UL 752 requires the use of samples conforming to the standard, sized correctly and, where necessary, tested at three different temperatures, in a calibrated range by a qualified technician. [[Certification mark]] use on the product installed in the field enables inspectors and end-users to have verification that the item tested was identical to the item being sold and used. Outdoor test samples shown in advertising, ''outside of [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pannzerung_plastische_deformation.png the normal shot pattern]'', with samples outside of the parameters dictated by the test standard, particularly without the use of the certification mark, visible on the product on the installed configuration, may be indicative.

====Testing sequence====
Since a UL752 ballistic test sample measures 12" x 12" or 30 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and any ''legitimate'' wall fire-resistance test sample is minimum 100ft² or 9.3m², and since ''legitimate'', compliant, ballistic testing must occur in a range, into which one cannot fit a full scale fire test sample, and fire test laboratories cannot, for [[occupational safety and health]] reasons, permit gunfire, testing of fire-resistance and [[Ballistics|ballistic]] resistance must occur on separate samples, or be out of compliance with '''something'''. For the combination between fire-resistance materials with ballistic resistance materials to be meaningful, whereby one must not defeat the other, common sense dictates that adding fire-resistive materials to a ballistic material can only improve ballistic resistance, since more material in the way of projectiles, however slight, can only improve ballistic resistance. The opposite, however, is not true. [[Composite armour|Lightweight armour]] using [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] [[composite material]]s can add fuel to a fire. [[Metal]]lic armour plating or high tensile strength steel requires fireproofing in order to retain its strength and shape. Therefore, any armour materials, both combustible and non-combustible, added to a fire-resistive assembly must be included at the time of the qualifying fire test to ASTM E119, UL263 or CAN/ULC-S101 in order to provide evidence that the complete system meets the conditions of acceptance for non-loadbearing walls. One may also, subsequently, expose 12" x 12" or 30 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm samples of the combined ballistic and fire-resistive layers in order to take advantage of the added ballistic resistance offered by the fire-resistive materials. If the fire barrier material itself were used to defeat ballistic threats and were reduced in thickness at the points of impact&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TK8nZ3vpQ8 YouTube video showing successful ballistic testing of precast concrete, reducing the concrete thickness at the point of impact, passing UL 752 but requiring consideration of the remaining thickness in terms of the minimum thickness qualified to achieve the desired fire-resistance rating]&lt;/ref&gt;, then the overall thickness and/or configuration should be considered if the barrier must simultaneously defeat fire, fragmentation and ballistics. As an example, if a 2" or 5cm thick precast concrete panel passed a UL752 ballistic test but were reduced in thickness below the thickness necessary to achieve the mandated fire-resistance rating, then the minimum thickness of that barrier must be evaluated to simultaneously defeat all threats.

[[STANAG 4569]], level 1, may be used on a full-scale wall sample in advance of fire testing, depending upon access to the test range, which may require some disassembly and re-assembly of wall modules.

===Test sequencing===
There are arguments for and against doing the fragmentation test before or after the fire test. It is prudent to look at all product testing to see the [[Synergy|synergistic]] effects. For example, a steel-based armour plate may pass a ballistic test but may exhibit [[plastic deformation]] at the point of bullet impact. While that plate may pass the ballistic test, the plastic deformation could knock loose fire-resistive material (particularly, though not exclusively, once stressed by fire) it is in contact with and thus degrade or delete the overall system’s fire-resistance, thus defeating the point of the exercise. One of the considerations must be whether the fire-resistive barrier exhibits inherently sufficient fragmentation resistance without requiring an added layer for resisting airborne fragments or projectiles, or whether the fragmentation resistance is added on to a fire-resistive material. Either way, both must be included in fire testing, for the same reasons to do this with ballistic resistance materials, which may be one and the same, such as [[Covalent bond|covalently]] or [[Ionic bonding|ionically]] bonded [[Toughness|impact-resistance]] products. If a barrier is first exposed to fire, which has a deleterious effect, especially when combined with the mandatory hose stream testing, a metallic armour plate may have lost its strength, if it was not sufficiently fireproofed, meaning that its ballistic rating, once exposed to elevated temperatures, may be seriously degraded and will at the very least be outside of its ballistic listing [[bounding]], which only covers temperature ranges, per UL 752, of -32°C (-25.6°F), +20°C (68°F) and + 49°C (120.2°F) (compared to fire testing, which goes up to ca. 1100°C, depending on the duration of the test). A covalently bound armour material may in fact melt and/or burn as a result of exposure in an ASTM E119 fire test, which could have a disastrous effect on a fire barrier. Combining materials, just because they can individually pass testing to one standard, does not necessarily mean that when combined with another material that has passed a different standard, that the sum of the parts will defeat testing to both standards simultaneously. The conservative approach would be to require a combined ballistic/fragmentation and fire-resistive barrier to undergo fire and hose stream testing first, and then to also defeat bullets and/or flying debris. If materials that are only individually tested, separately concerning fragmentation, ballistics, fire and hose stream, the combination would violate individual certification listings and claims or implications for such systems to meet all sets of requirements without having been tested together may be subject to interpretation in terms of the [[Competition Act]] Part VII.1, Deceptive Marketing Practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-17.html Government of Canada Justice Laws Website, 1985 Competition Act, (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34) Part VII.1]&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] §45, which states '''"Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45 Cornell Law School. Legal Information Institute 15 U.S. Code § 45 - Unfair methods of competition unlawful; prevention by Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;. Concerning the use of [[structural steel]], which is identical to armour plating or high tensile strength steel, in terms of fire-resistance, it is in consideration of the reaction of unprotected steel to fire that ASTM E119 requires the instrumentation of structural steel components in fire-resistive assemblies, to determine the point in time, at which such steel components exceed a heat rise above 538°C or 1,000°F, above ambient before the fire has begun, as this has an effect upon the overall system. Consequently, the point that such temperatures upon steel have been exceeded, which is minutes into a fire test, if there is no fireproofing of the steel, be it armour or otherwise, is the point in time when loaded assemblies have failed. Such a measurement is not required for non-bearing assemblies, such as transformer fire barriers. But that does not mean that steel added on without fire testing can be done without affecting the validity of testing, let alone certification listings. For that reason, ASTM E119 states, identically to NFPA 251, UL 263 and CAN/ULC-S101, in paragraph 5.1, that the test specimen shall be representative of the construction that the test is intended to assess, as to materials, workmanship, and details such as dimensions of parts, and shall be built under conditions representative of those applied in building construction and operation. The physical properties of the materials and ingredients used in the test specimen shall be determined and recorded.
==Modularity==
[[Modularity]] is offered by some of the North American product vendors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bing.com/search?q=transformer%20firewall%20modularity&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=undefined&amp;sc=0-31&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=5487E500BDEA419CBB2FFA1F22AF16C9 Bing search using key words "transformer firewall modularity"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the realm. Modularity enables changes, for example, when one transformer ruptures, damaged wall segments can be replaced, presuming the original equipment vendor is still in business, work can proceed without complete destruction, or, if a transformer were equipped with sensors to enable a monitoring programme to judge the fitness of the transformer and/or its bushings, and the maintenance decision were to replace the transformer, then room can be made for such work by temporarily removing wall segments that are in the way during an outage. As with all such changes, similar to [[firestop]]s or any [[passive fire protection]] [[system]]s, it is prudent to be able to demonstrate in advance of the qualifying fire/blast/fragmentation/ballistics testing, that initially installed segments can be demounted and then re-installed, following the manufacturer's instructions and then still pass the required qualifying tests. Typically, manufacturer's instructions accompany test reports and technicians' notes, at laboratories nationally accredited for fire testing and product certification, such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://industries.ul.com/plumbing-products-and-water-system-components/plumbing-products/ul-accreditations UL Statement concerning its Accreditations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intertek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intertek.com/building/product-certification/ Intertek Statement concerning Product Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southwest Research Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swri.org/industries/accreditation-certification SwRI Statement of Accreditation and Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swri.org/industries/listing-labeling-follow-inspections SwRI Statement concerning Listing, Labeling and Follow Up Service]&lt;/ref&gt; before public domain certification listings are issued&lt;ref&gt;[https://services.ul.com/service/ul-mark-surveillance/ UL Follow Up Service Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. If the intention of modularity exists in advance of the fire test, the instructions for de-mounting and re-assembly are typically followed through before the fire test, particularly if the test is intended to result in a certification listing, which results in the ability to use the laboratory's certification mark on the product, as opposed to testing for information purposes only, which does not entail assurance that the item tested is identical to the item sold and installed, in the absence of the certification label's being visible on the installed configuration as verifiable proof of compliance, pointing to the certification listing upon which the installation and local approval is based.

The '''Home Energy Assistance Target''' (H.E.A.T.) program is the [[State of Utah]]’s program through which funds are distributed to the [[target audience|target population]]. This program is specifically administered by the state and various Associations of Governments (AOG). The Mountain land AOG provides H.E.A.T. assistance to persons in Utah, [[Wasatch County, Utah|Wastach]], and [[Summit County, Utah|Summit]] Counties. MAG receives nearly $2.5 Million annually.

==Recipients==

Program recipients are on the rise. This may be illustrated in the following chart{{clarify|date=January 2013}} showing the increase in households served by the program in relation to the amount of [[LIHEAP]] funds allocated to the State of Utah. Some statistics of note for the State of Utah include:
*SEALworks recorded that 1,619 households were shut off before coming in for HEAT assistance 
*HEAT program helped prevent 10,243 households, that had shut off notices, from being shut off
*Almost $375,769 in regular HEAT Crisis assistance assisted 1,373 families in 2011
*The program served 18,592 families with young children in 2011
*The program assisted 10,875 elderly households to receive HEAT assistance in 2011
*The program assisted 17,947 people who have disabilities in 2011

==Coordination with Outside Programs==

In addition to providing matching funds through the Leveraging Incentive Program, LIHEAP strives to coordinate efforts with private [[utility companies]] and [[nonprofit organisations|non-profits]] where [[federal funding]] is not available.  In the State of Utah, some of these other sources include [[Rocky Mountain Power]]’s Home Electric Lifeline and Lend-a-Hand Programs, [[Questar Corporation (gas company)|Questar]]’s Energy Assistance Fund and REACH program, Catholic Community Services, [[American Red Cross]], and [[Murray, Utah|Murray City]] Relief Program.  H.E.A.T. funding applicants may be referred to these or other private assistance groups if there are not sufficient LIHEAP funds.

{{About|the breathing gas|the cookie brand|Hydrox}}

'''Hydrox''', a gas mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], was used as a [[breathing gas]] in very [[deep diving]]. It allows divers to descend several hundred metres.&lt;ref name=fife&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Paul Fife|Fife, William P]] |title=The use of Non-Explosive mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen for diving |volume=TAMU-SG-79-201 |journal=Texas A&amp;M University Sea Grant |date=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uhms33&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brauer RW (ed). |title=Hydrogen as a Diving Gas. |journal=33rd Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Workshop. |issue=UHMS Publication Number 69(WS–HYD)3–1–87 |publisher=[[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society]] |year=1985 |pages=336 pages |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4862 |accessdate=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOA1984&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ornhagen H |title=Hydrogen-Oxygen (Hydrox) breathing at 1.3 MPa |journal=National Defence Research Institute |volume=FOA Rapport C58015-H1 |issn=0347-7665 |year=1984 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precautions are necessary when using hydrox, since mixtures containing more than a few percent of both oxygen and hydrogen are explosive if ignited. Hydrogen is the lightest [[gas]] (half the weight of [[helium]]) but still has a [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcotic potential]] and may cause [[hydrogen narcosis]].&lt;ref name=uhms33/&gt;&lt;ref name=FOA1984/&gt;

==History==
Although the first reported use of hydrogen seems to be by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743–1794), who had [[guinea pigs]] breathe it, the actual first uses of this gas in [[Underwater diving|diving]] are usually attributed to trials by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] engineer, [[Arne Zetterström]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=FOA1984/&gt;

Zetterström showed that hydrogen was perfectly usable to great depths. Following a fault in using the surface equipment, he died during a demonstration dive. The study of hydrogen was not resumed until several years later by the [[United States Navy]] and by the [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises]] (Comex), initially during their Hydra I and Hydra II experiments, in 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comex.fr/fileadmin/telechargement/Comex_4_us_web.pdf Comex keeps up the High Pressure, Comex Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202455/http://www.comex.fr/fileadmin/telechargement/Comex_4_us_web.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comex subsequently developed procedures allowing dives between 500 and 700 metres (1650 to 2300 feet) in depth, while breathing gas mixtures based on hydrogen, called hydrox (hydrogen-oxygen) or [[hydreliox]] (hydrogen-helium-oxygen).&lt;ref name=fife/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rostain |first=J.

=== Memorial dives ===

In July 2012, after about a year of preparation and planning, members of the Swedish Historical Diving Society and the Royal Institute of Technology Diving Club, performed a series of hydrox dives in memory of Arne Zetterström, who was accidentally killed during the ascent from his record dive using hydrox in August 1945. The memorial dives were performed using the same breathing mixture of 96% hydrogen and 4% oxygen as was developed and tested by Zetterström in the 1940s. The dives were made to a depth of {{convert|40|m}}, just deep enough to be able to use the oxygen-lean gas mixture. Project Leader Ola Lindh commented that in order to repeat Zetterström's record the team would need to make a dive to {{convert|160|m}}, and even today a dive to that depth is considered extreme.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--https://en-gb.facebook.com/SvenskDHF/posts/10151094530233973--&gt;

==Use==
Hydrox may be used to combat [[high pressure nervous syndrome]] (HPNS), commonly occurring during very deep dives.&lt;ref name=hpns&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunger Jr |first=W. L. |author2=P. B. Bennett. |title=The causes, mechanisms and prevention of the high pressure nervous syndrome |journal=Undersea Biomed. Res. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |date=1974 |issn=0093-5387 |oclc=2068005 |pmid=4619860 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2661 |accessdate=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies scored a resounding success with a simulated dive to {{convert|701|m|ft}}, by [[Theo Mavrostomos]] on 20 November 1990 at [[Toulon]], during the COMEX Hydra X [[decompression chamber]] experiments. This dive made him "the deepest diver in the world".&lt;ref name="pmid7742710"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lafay V, Barthelemy P, Comet B, Frances Y, Jammes Y |title=ECG changes during the experimental human dive HYDRA 10 (71 atm/7,200 kPa) |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7742710 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2203 |accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2738">'''Ion cyclotron resonance''' is a phenomenon related to the movement of [[ions]] in a [[magnetic field]]. It is used for accelerating ions in a [[cyclotron]], and for measuring the masses of an ionized analyte in [[mass spectrometry]], particularly with [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometers. It can also be used to follow the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics of chemical reactions]] in a dilute gas mixture, provided these involve charged species.

==Definition of the resonant frequency==
An ion in a static and uniform magnetic field will move in a circle due to the [[Lorentz force]]. The [[angular frequency]] of this ''cyclotron motion'' for a given magnetic field strength ''B'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f = \frac{zeB}{m},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the number of positive or negative charges of the ion, ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] and ''m'' is the mass of the ion.&lt;ref&gt;In SI units, the elementary charge ''e'' has the value 1.602×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; [[Coulomb|C]], the mass of the ion ''m'' is often given in [[unfied atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]] or dalton: 1{{nbsp}}u&amp;nbsp;= 1{{nbsp}}Da&amp;nbsp;≈ 1.660539040(20)&amp;nbsp;×{{nbsp}}10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;{{nbsp}}kg, the magnetic field ''B'' is measured in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]], and the angular frequency ω is measured in [[Radian|radians]] per second.&lt;/ref&gt; An electric excitation signal having a frequency ''f'' will therefore resonate with ions having a mass-to-charge ratio ''m/z'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{z} = \frac{eB}{2\pi f}.&lt;/math&gt;

The circular motion may be superimposed with a uniform axial motion, resulting in a [[helix]], or with a uniform motion perpendicular to the field (e.g., in the presence of an electrical or gravitational field) resulting in a [[cycloid]].

== Ion cyclotron resonant heating in the solar wind ==

On March 8, 2013, NASA released an article according to which ion cyclotron waves were identified by its solar probe spacecraft called WIND as the main cause for the heating of the [[solar wind]] as it rises from the sun's surface. Before this discovery, it was unclear why the solar wind particles would heat up, instead of cool down, when speeding away from the sun's surface.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08mar_solarwind/|title=Solar Wind Energy Source Discovered  - NASA Science|publisher=science.nasa.gov|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kantar''' is the official [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] weight unit for measuring [[cotton]].  It corresponds to the US hundredweight, and is roughly equal to 99.05 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], or 45.02 [[kilogram]]s.  It is equal to either 157 kilograms of seed cotton or 50 kilograms of lint cotton.&lt;ref&gt;

'''King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy''' (also known as '''K•A•CARE'''; {{lang-ar|مدينة الملك عبدالله للطاقة الذرية والمتجددة}}) is an independent organization established by Royal Order in April 2010. This city has the responsibility to develop the [[Atomic energy|atomic]] and [[renewable energy]] program in [[Saudi Arabia]]. 

The activities in K•A•CARE has been increased rapidly in order to develop and implement the national [[sustainable energy]] program. Which aims to create:
*a master plan for [[Sustainable city]] near [[Riyadh]]. This city is [[state-of-the-art]] which will act as a headquarters for K•A•CARE
*quarters for the sustainable energy [[policy-makers]]
*energy industries and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] laboratories

K•A•CARE’s team of strategists have made a full evaluation of the [[alternative energy sources]]. The result of this evaluation led to the conclusion that [[hydrocarbons]] will remain a prime source of energy for a while. They have estimated that by 2032, the [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and renewable energy will be distributed as in the following basis: 
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
|-

[[File:SoKamDerMenschAufDenHund.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Verlag G. Borotha-Schoeler)]]
'''''Man Meets Dog''''' is a zoological book for the general audience, written by the [[Austria]]n scientist [[Konrad Lorenz]] in 1949. The first English-language edition appeared in 1954.

The original German title is ''So kam der Mensch auf den Hund'', which could be literally translated as "How man ended up with dog". The German title is also a play on the phrase "Auf den Hund kommen", which is a common idiom in German-speaking countries and probably comes from the old days when farmers with economic problems had to sell their [[livestock]] animals and ended up with only the dog.

==Contents==
The opening chapter "How it may have started" deals with theories concerning the question where and when man first domesticated the predecessor of the modern [[dog]]. The book has a lot of interesting anecdotes of the author's experiences with dogs, these stories are often illustrated with simple drawings. Lorenz usually owned several dogs and many other animals and lived with them in his house near Vienna. There are also many insights into the [[behavior of cats]] and [[Bird behavior|birds]], though the focus is of course on the [[behavior of dogs]].

[[Daniel Pinkwater]] refers amusingly to ''Man Meets Dog'' in his ''Uncle Boris in the Yukon and other shaggy dog stories'',&lt;ref&gt;Pinkwater, D. (2001) ''Uncle Boris in the Yukon and other shaggy dog stories''. New York: Simon &amp;amp; Schuster {{ISBN|0-684-85632-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating among other things:

{{quote|When I read ''Man Meets Dog'', I had no way of knowing that the caraway seeds in Konrad Lorenz's sauerkraut had fermented and addled his brain. He put forth a theory that there are two races of dogs: Der Dogg, and Der Überdogg. No kidding ... and if Konrad had ever lived with a [[wolf]], or a dog with strong wolf traits, he would have noticed that the ratio of dignified and heroic to downright silly is something like one to twenty. Standard for all dogs ... and humans.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4883">In [[chemistry]], the '''mass fraction''' &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of one substance with mass &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; to the mass of the total mixture &lt;math&gt;m_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = M03722 | title = mass fraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac {m_i}{m_\text{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is also used to denote mass fraction. The sum of all the mass fractions is equal to 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i = m_\text{tot} ; \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Mass fraction can also be expressed, with a [[denominator]] of 100, as '''percentage by mass''' (in commercial contexts often called ''percentage by weight'', abbreviated ''wt%''; see [[mass versus weight]]). It is one way of expressing the composition of a mixture in a [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless size]]; [[mole fraction]] (percentage by [[mole (unit)|moles]], mol%) and [[volume fraction]] ([[volume percent|percentage by volume]], vol%) are others.

For [[elemental analysis]], mass fraction (or ''mass percent composition'') can also refer to the ratio of the mass of one element to the total mass of a compound. It can be calculated for any compound using its [[empirical formula]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://khanexercises.appspot.com/video?v=xatVrAh2U0E Formula from Mass Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; or its [[chemical formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/workedchemistryproblems/a/mass-percent-worked-problem.htm|title=How to Calculate Mass Percent Composition|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
"Percent concentration" does not refer to this quantity. This improper name persists, especially in elementary textbooks. In biology, the unit "%" is sometimes (incorrectly) used to denote mass concentration, also called "mass/volume percentage." A solution with 1 g of solute dissolved in a final volume of 100 mL of solution would be labeled as "1 %" or "1 % m/v" (mass/volume). This is incorrect because the unit "%" can only be used for dimensionless quantities. Instead, the concentration should simply be given in units of g/mL. "Percent solution" or "percentage solution" are thus terms best reserved for "mass percent solutions" (m/m = m% = mass solute/mass total solution after mixing), or "volume percent solutions" (v/v = v% = volume solute per volume of total solution after mixing). The very ambiguous terms "percent solution" and "percentage solutions" with no other qualifiers continue to occasionally be encountered.

In [[thermal engineering]], '''[[vapor quality]]''' is used for the mass fraction of vapor in the steam.

In alloys, especially those of noble metals, the term '''[[fineness]]''' is used for the mass fraction of the noble metal in the alloy.

==Properties==
The mass fraction is independent of temperature.

==Related quantities==
=== Mixing ratio ===
The mixing of two pure components can be expressed introducing the (mass) [[mixing ratio]] of them &lt;math&gt;r_m = \frac{m_2}{m_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the mass fractions of the components will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  w_1 &amp;= \frac{1}{1 + r_m} \\[3pt]
  w_2 &amp;= \frac{r_m}{1 + r_m}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass ratio equals the ratio of mass fractions of components:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{w_2}{w_1}&lt;/math&gt;

due to division of both numerator and denominator by the sum of masses of components.

===Mass concentration===
The mass fraction of a component in a solution is the ratio of the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]] of that component ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (density of that component in the mixture) to the [[density]] of solution &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac {\rho_i}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

===Molar concentration===
The relation to molar concentration is like that from above substituting the relation between mass and molar concentration

&lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac {\rho_i}{\rho}=\frac {c_i M_i}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the molar concentration and &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is the molar mass of the component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Mass percentage===

The mass percentage is sometimes called weight percent (wt%) or weight-weight percentage.

===Mole fraction===
The [[mole fraction]] ''&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;'' can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;x_i = w_i \cdot \frac {M}{M_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the molar mass of the component ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'' is the average [[molar mass]] of the mixture.

Replacing the expression of the molar mass-products:

:&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac {\frac{w_i}{M_i}}{\sum_i\frac{w_i}{M_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Spatial variation and gradient==

In a [[inhomogeneous|spatially non-uniform]] mixture, the mass fraction [[gradient]] gives rise to the phenomenon of [[diffusion]].

'''Massimo Moratti''' (born 16 May 1945) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[petroleum]] [[tycoon]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) of the [[Saras S.p.A.|Saras Group]], founded in 1962 by his father, industrialist [[Angelo Moratti]]; the main production site of the Saras Group is the Sarroch refinery located on the island of [[Sardinia]], one of Europe's only six supersites, with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, representing 15% of refining capacity in Italy. In recent years, initially to enable independence of the Sarroch refinery from terms of energy, the Saras Group has entered in the production of electricity and is expanding its production of alternative energy sources, particularly in the field of wind energy, through its subsidiaries Sarlux and Sardeolica, the latter of which is controlled indirectly through the company Eolici Ulassai.

From 1995 until 2013, Moratti was the chairman of [[Inter Milan|F.C. Internazionale Milano]]. He is said to have spent around €1.5 billion of his personal fortune in the transfer market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2013/09/26/bandini-massimo-morattis-inter-legacy-nears-its-end-as-he-prepares-to-sell/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140702053647/http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2013/09/26/bandini-massimo-morattis-inter-legacy-nears-its-end-as-he-prepares-to-sell/ |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was famous for signing numerous football superstars.

He was Inter's honorary chairman, and also a [[United Nations]] [[Goodwill Ambassador]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 2013, he was inducted into the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/27-10-2015/hall-of-fame-vialli-mancini-facchetti-ronaldo-herrera-agnelli-tardelli-ferlaino-130676725232.shtml|title=Hall of fame, 10 new entry: con Vialli e Mancini anche Facchetti e Ronaldo|trans-title=Hall of fame, 10 new entries: with Vialli and Mancini also Facchetti and Ronaldo|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Massimo Moratti is the fourth son of industrialist [[Angelo Moratti]], who was the chairman of [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Football Club Internazionale Milano]] during the team's "Golden Age" from 1955 to 1968. Born in the family villa in the [[Bosco Chiesanuova]], close to [[Verona]], he graduated from [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]] with a master's degree in [[Political Science]].
[[File:1966–67 Serie A - AC Mantova v Inter Milan - Gian Marco, Massimo and Angelo Moratti.jpg|thumb|left|Gian Marco, Massimo and [[Angelo Moratti]] in 1967]]

[[Letizia Moratti]], his brother's wife, was the Mayor of Milan from 2006 until 2011.

On his father's death, Massimo Moratti inherited his shares in the Saras Group, engaged in the refining of petroleum, where he is presently C.E.O. Moratti is also the owner of Sarlux, headquartered in [[Cagliari]], which focuses on the production of electricity from the waste oil.

Married to the environmental activist Emilia Moratti (née Bossi), the couple have five children. On 10 September 2009, Sauro Gori announced that Moratti had been appointed a [[United Nations]] [[Goodwill Ambassador]].

In May 2011, Moratti supported [[Giuliano Pisapia]]'s bid to become mayor of Milan against his sister-in-law [[Letizia Moratti |Letizia]]. His call for 'change' was perceived as an extension of his rivalry with [[A.C. Milan]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]], from football to the political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnotizie.it/2011/05/26/massimo-moratti-pisapia-berlusconi-autogol|title=Massimo Moratti a sostegno di Pisapia: Berlusconi fa solo autogol|publisher=newnotizie.it|accessdate=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman of Inter==
Moratti took over as chairman of Inter from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, during a period where many considered Inter to be underachievers. During the 18 years of his leadership, Inter has clinched five [[Serie A|Scudetti/Serie A]] in a row from 2006 to 2010 (equalling the all-time record), four [[Coppa Italia]] titles (2005, 2006, 2010, 2011), four [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles (2005, 2006, 2008, 2010), one [[UEFA Champions League]] (2010), one [[FIFA Club World Cup]] (2010) and one [[UEFA Cup]] (1998). Inter won the Scudetto, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League in the 2009-2010 season, becoming the first Italian team that managed to achieve the [[Treble (association football)|Treble]].  

Moratti is said to have spent around €1.5 billion of his personal fortune in the transfer market in his time as chairman. His most famous signing was that of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] from [[FC Barcelona]] in the summer of 1997, at a time when he was widely considered the best player in the world. Later, in July 1999, Moratti sanctioned a then world-record €48 million purchase of striker [[Christian Vieri]] and has purchased numerous other superstars, including [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Hernán Crespo]], [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]], [[Iván Zamorano]], [[Maicon Douglas Sisenando|Maicon]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[Luís Figo]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Samuel Eto'o]], [[David Suazo]] and [[Wesley Sneijder]].

However, criticism also been levelled against Moratti, as he fired coaches frequently. Except keeping [[Giuseppe Baresi]] and [[Daniele Bernazzani]] as backroom staff in the first team or in the youth system, as well as [[Marco Branca]] as one of the directors, the team had changed from [[Rafael Benítez]], [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]], [[Gian Piero Gasperini|Gasperini]] and most recently [[Claudio Ranieri|Ranieri]] in just 2 seasons. [[Roberto Mancini]] and [[José Mourinho]] were the only two trophy winning and longest serving coach in recent years. Before Mancini, Massimo employed more than 10 short-lived coaches, including [[Roy Hodgson]], [[Marcello Lippi]], [[Marco Tardelli]], [[Héctor Cúper]] and [[Alberto Zaccheroni]].

The day after Ranieri was dismissed, chief scout of the first team  Giovanni Battista Lanfranchi was fired and replaced by the former technical commission of Udinese, Valentino Angeloni.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=39516&amp;L=en&lt;/ref&gt; Lanfranchi had served for Inter for 13 years&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=57259&amp;L=it&lt;/ref&gt; in different positions.

On 15 November 2013, International Sports Capital took control of 70% of the club. Indonesian businessman [[Erick Thohir]], a part-owner of that company, was elected chairman of Inter, but Moratti remained with the club as the honorary chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/44183 |title=F.C. Internazionale statement |publisher=F.C. Internazioanle Milano |date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2016 Massimo Moratti's Internazionale Holding S.r.l. sold all its stake in [[Inter Milan|F.C. Internazionale Milano S.p.A.]] to [[Erick Thohir]]'s Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited for €60&amp;nbsp;million (and re-sold to [[Zhang Jindong]]'s [[Suning Holdings Group]]). As of 2018, Massimo Moratti's wife, Milly Moratti, remained in the advisory board of Inter. However, Massimo Moratti himself, was no longer the honorary chairman of the club.&lt;ref name=organigramma&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/it/organigramma |title=organigramma|trans-title=Organization Chart |publisher=F.C. Internazionale Milano |accessdate=13 November 2018|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other member of Moratti family, Angelomario Moratti, Carlotta Moratti, Giovanni Moratti, remained as the member of the board of a subsidiary of the club, Inter Futura.&lt;ref name=organigramma/&gt;

The '''Nabucco-West pipeline''' (also referred to as the '''Turkey–Austria gas pipeline''') was a proposed [[natural gas]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Bulgaria]]n border to [[Austria]]. It was a modification of the original Nabucco Pipeline project, which was to run from [[Erzurum]] in [[Turkey]] to [[Baumgarten an der March]] in [[Austria]]. The aim of the Nabucco pipeline was to diversify the natural gas suppliers and delivery routes for Europe, thus reducing [[Russia in the European energy sector|European dependence on Russian energy]]. The original project was backed by several [[European Union]] member states and by the [[United States]], and was seen as a rival to the [[South Stream]] pipeline project. The main supplier was expected to be [[Iraq]], with potential supplies from [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The main supply for the Nabucco West was to be [[Shah Deniz]] gas through the proposed [[Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline]] (TANAP).

The project was developed by a consortium of six companies. Preparations started in 2002 and the intergovernmental agreement between Turkey, [[Romania]], Bulgaria, [[Hungary]] and Austria was signed on 13 July 2009. After an announcement of the construction of TANAP, the consortium  submitted the Nabucco-West project.&lt;ref name=edm230512&gt;

[[Southeast Europe|South Eastern Europe]] is important as many of the regions are heavily dependent on [[Russia]]n gas imports. Nabucco aims to diversify the gas supply to increase competition and security. [[Simon Pirani]], senior research fellow, [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]] presented to delegates at the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Energy Forum in 2013 a list of prices from the Russian newspaper [[Izvestia]]: "What they show is the prices at which Russian gas is being purchased in different European countries, and this tells quite a simple story. If you're in Eastern Europe, and you are quite heavily dependent on Russian gas, you pay more than $500/TCM; if you're in the UK, where we have a pretty much complete domination of gas-to-gas market, you pay $300, or $370+ in Germany, which is somewhere in between."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Preparations for the Nabucco project started in February 2002 when first talks took place between Austrian [[OMV]] and Turkish [[BOTAŞ]]. In June 2002, five companies (OMV of Austria, [[MOL Group]] of Hungary, [[Bulgargaz]] of Bulgaria, [[Transgaz]] of Romania and BOTAŞ of Turkey) signed a protocol of intention to construct the Nabucco pipeline. The protocol followed by the cooperation agreement in October 2002. The name ''[[Nabucco]]'' comes from the same famous [[opera]] of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], that the five partners had listened to at the [[Vienna State Opera]] after this meeting.&lt;ref name=nabucconame&gt;

In Romania, the pipeline will be crossing into the country under the Danube. The route on the Romanian territory will go from south-west to north-west, its south-western starting point being located at the Danube-crossing point upstream the [[Port of Bechet]], and the north-western end point being located north of [[Nădlac]]. The pipe will follow the south western border of Romania and will travel through the counties of [[Dolj County|Dolj]], [[Mehedinţi County|Mehedinti]], [[Caraş-Severin County|Caras-Severin]], [[Timiş County|Timiş]], and [[Arad County|Arad]]. The pipeline will cross 11&amp;nbsp;protected sites, two national parks, three natural reserves, and 57&amp;nbsp;watercourses, namely major rivers such as: [[Jiu River|Jiu]], [[Coşuştea River|Coşuştea]], [[Cerna River (Danube)|Cerna]], Bela Reca, [[Timiş River|Timiş]], [[Bega River (Tisza)|Bega]], and [[Mureş River|Mureş]], as well as their tributaries. The terrain is rockier in Romania and mainly constituted of limestone. This section is {{convert|469|km}} long.&lt;ref name="route" /&gt;&lt;ref name=eia-romania&gt;

The Nabucco project is included in the EU Trans-European Energy Network programme and a feasibility study for the Nabucco pipeline has been performed under an EU project grant. The [[Front End Loading|front end engineering and design (FEED)]] services of the pipeline, including the overall management of the local FEED contractors, the review of the technical feasibility study, route confirmation, preparation of the design basis, hydraulic studies, overall [[SCADA]] and telecommunications, GIS and preparation of tender packages for the next phase, was managed by UK-based consultancy [[Penspen]].&lt;ref name=upstream4&gt;

On 28 January 2013, it was announced that a re-feed for the Nabucco West project is being conducted by [[Saipem]] following the selection of the project as the [[Central Europe]]an route by the [[Shah Deniz gas field|Shah Deniz]] consortium in June last year.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2013, the Shah Deniz Consortium had chosen a rival project, [[Trans Adriatic Pipeline]], that has a route Turkey–Greece-Albania-Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU-backed Nabucco project 'over' after rival pipeline wins Azeri gas bid|url=http://www.euractiv.com/energy/eu-favoured-nabucco-project-hist-news-528919|publisher=EurActiv.com|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of Nabucco project is unclear.

==Financing==
The pipelines costs are undisclosed, however [[Reinhard Mitschek]] said in late 2012 that the costs of Nabucco West would be far lower than €7.9 billion previously suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a commercial project, it will be financed 30% by the project's partners and the rest by commercial financial instruments. The European Commission has awarded an EU project grant in the amount of 50% of the estimated total eligible cost of the feasibility study&lt;ref name=romania/&gt;&lt;ref name=hungary/&gt;&lt;ref name=bulgaria/&gt; and has also decided to allocate €200 million from the European Economic Recovery Plan.&lt;ref name=euractiv040310&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  To receive this financing, this grant should be committed by the end 2010.&lt;ref name=euractiv040310/&gt;

At the Nabucco Summit held in Budapest on 27 January 2009, the heads of the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) confirmed, that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the project.&lt;ref name=dw270109/&gt;  On 5 February 2010, the EIB vice-president Mathias Kollatz-Ahnensaid that Nabucco consortium is seeking up to €2&amp;nbsp;billion (20–25% of costs) financing from the bank. The EIB is ready to participate in the financing of this project; however, the precondition is that the partner countries should legally approve the pipeline's transit in their countries.&lt;ref name=reuters050210&gt;

In September 2010, the consortium signed an agreement with EIB, EBRD, and the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), according to which the banks will conduct [[due diligence]] for a financing package of €4&amp;nbsp;billion. Up to €2&amp;nbsp;billion will be signed by the EIB, up to €1.2&amp;nbsp;billion by the EBRD, and up to €800&amp;nbsp;million by the IFC.&lt;ref name=upstream060910&gt;

Even more important competitor became TANAP which would follow the Nabucco's original route in Turkey.

==Controversial aspects==
===Economic and political aspects===
The Nabucco pipeline will supply only a limited number of countries in South-East and Central Europe.&lt;ref name=nyt221209/&gt; In 2013, it was confirmed by Bulgarian President [[Rosen Plevneliev]] that the pipeline would transport gas to a minimum of 16 European countries including the gas hub in [[Baumgarten an der March|Baumgarten]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, before the raise of project's costs and the proposal of modified project, RWE had claimed that the transportation of natural gas through the Nabucco pipeline would be cheaper than through South Stream or other alternative pipelines. According to RWE, the transportation of thousand cubic meters of gas from Shah Deniz field to Europe will cost through the Nabucco pipeline €77 versus €106 through the South Stream pipeline.&lt;ref name=trend150110/&gt;
Russian opposition to the pipeline stems from their monopoly over European gas supplies. The Pipeline would lead to cheaper more secure gas supplies for the whole of Europe, due to the decreased influence of the oil linked gas price, this would provide economic benefits to the EU with cheaper energy helping the union become more competitive.

NGOs have also criticized the fact that the pipeline results in effective support of the [[authoritarian]] regime in [[Turkmenistan]], which undermines the [[European Union]]'s policy of [[human rights]] promotion.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;[http://bankwatch.org/our-work/projects/nabucco-gas-pipeline Nabucco gas pipeline], CEE Bankwatch Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil fuels===
Some NGOs criticize the EIB and EBRD for their willingness to finance a fossil fuel project, claiming that it goes against the November 2007 resolution on trade and climate change passed in the European Union Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''niobium electrolytic capacitor''' is a polarized [[capacitor]] whose [[anode]] [[electrode]] (+) is made of passivated [[niobium]] metal or [[niobium monoxide]] on which an insulating [[niobium pentoxide]] layer acts as the [[dielectric]] of the niobium capacitor. A solid [[electrolyte]] on the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second electrode ([[cathode]]) (-) of the capacitor.

Niobium electrolytic capacitors are passive [[electronic component]]s and members of the family of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.

Niobium capacitors are available as [[Surface-mount technology|SMD]] chip capacitors and compete with [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum]] chip capacitors in certain voltage and capacitance ratings. They are available with a solid [[manganese dioxide]] electrolyte. 
Niobium capacitors are polarized components by manufacturing principle and may only be operated with [[Direct current|DC]] voltage in correct polarity. Reverse voltage or ripple current higher than specified can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor. The destruction of the dielectric may have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers specify special circuit design rules for the safe operation of niobium capacitors.

Niobium capacitors were developed in the United States as well as in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s. Since 2002 they have been commercially available in the West to take advantage of the lower cost and better availability of niobium compared with tantalum.

==Basic information==
Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum. Niobium has a similar melting point (2744&amp;nbsp;°C) to tantalum and exhibits similar chemical properties. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. However, niobium as a raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.

Niobium electrolytic capacitors can be made with high purity niobium as the anode but the diffusion of oxygen from the dielectric (Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) into the niobium anode metal is very high, resulting in leakage current instability or even capacitor failures. There are two possible ways to reduce oxygen diffusion and improve leakage current stability – either by doping metallic niobium powders with nitride into [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] [[niobium nitride]] or using [[niobium oxide]] (NbO) as anode material. Niobium oxide is a hard ceramic material characterized by high metallic conductivity. Niobium oxide powder can be prepared in a similar structure to that of tantalum powder and can be processed in a similar way to produce capacitors. It also can be oxidized by anodic oxidation ([[anodizing]], forming) to generate the insulating dielectric layer. Thus two types of niobium electrolytic capacitors are marketed, those using a passivated niobium anode and those using a niobium oxide anode. Both types use [[niobium pentoxide]] (Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) as the dielectric layer.

===Basic principle of anodic oxidation===
[[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of the anodic oxidation, in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]

Niobium is a so-called valve metal such as tantalum and aluminum, on which an electrically insulating oxide layer is formed by anodic oxidation, if a positive voltage is applied. Applying a positive voltage to the [[anode]] material in an [[Electrolyte|electrolytic]] bath forms an oxide [[barrier layer]] with a thickness corresponding to the applied [[voltage]]. This oxide layer acts as [[dielectric]] in an [[electrolytic capacitor]].

For niobium this behavior was known since the beginning of the 20th century. Niobium is more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive but the high melting point of 2744&amp;nbsp;°C hindered the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors.

In the 1960s, the better availability of niobium ore compared with tantalum ore prompted research into niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center, Tantalum and Niobium - Early History [http://tanb.org/history]  and Applications for Niobium [http://tanb.org/niobium]&lt;/ref&gt; Here they took the place that was filled by tantalum capacitors in the West. With the collapse of the Iron Curtain, this know-how has been publicized in the West. In the late 1990s the interest in this technology awoke in the major capacitor manufacturers. The materials and processes used to produce niobium capacitors are essentially the same as for tantalum capacitors. However, a price rise for tantalum in 2000/2001 encouraged the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, as well as polymer electrolyte which have been available since 2002.&lt;ref name=Roadmap /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Schnitter, A. Michaelis, U. Merker,  H.C. Starck, Bayer,  New Niobium Based Materials for Solid Electrolyte Capacitors, Carts 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|center|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''' and with a separation of '''''d'''''.]]

Every electrolytic capacitor in principle forms a "plate capacitor" whose capacitance increases with the electrode area (A) and the [[permittivity]] (ε) and decreases with the thickness (d) of the dielectric.

:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric thickness of niobium electrolytic capacitors is very thin, in the range of [[Meter|nano-meter]] per volt.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;J. Moore, Kemet, Nb capacitors compared to Ta capacitors a less costly alternative [http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/143/V11N01%20Nb%20vs%20Ta%20Capacitors.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; With this very thin dielectric oxide layer, combined with a sufficiently high dielectric strength, the niobium electrolytic capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance comparable to tantalum capacitors. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other conventional capacitors.

The niobium anode material is manufactured from a powder sintered into a pellet with a rough surface structure intended to increase the electrode surface A compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the later capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by the factor of up to 200 for solid niobium electrolytic capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Niobium Powder for Electrolytic Capacitor, JFE TECHNICAL REPORT No. 6 (Oct. 2005) [http://www.jfe-steel.co.jp/en/research/report/006/pdf/006-15.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The large surface compared to a smooth one is the second reason for the relatively high capacitance values of niobium electrolytic capacitors.

One special advantage is given for all electrolytic capacitors. Because the forming voltage defines the oxide layer thickness the voltage proof of the later electrolytic capacitor can be produced very simple for the desired rated value. That makes electrolytic capacitors fit for uses down to 2&amp;nbsp;V applications in which other capacitor technologies must stay to much higher limits.

The properties of this niobium pentoxide dielectric layer compared with [[tantalum pentoxide]] layer are given in the following table:&lt;ref name=Karnik&gt;T. Kárník, AVX,  NIOBIUM OXIDE FOR CAPACITOR MANUFACTURING , METAL 2008, 13. –15. 5. 2008, [http://www.metal2014.com/files/proceedings/metal_08/Lists/Papers/087.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The higher permittivity but lower breakdown voltage of niobium pentoxide in niobium capacitors results in capacitors of similar size to those using tantalum pentoxide in tantalum capacitors.

===Comparison of electrical parameters of niobium and tantalum capacitor types ===
In order to compare the different characteristics of the different electrolytic chip capacitor types, specimens with the same dimensions and of comparable capacitance and voltage are compared in the following table. In such a comparison the values for ESR and ripple current load are the most important parameters for the use of electrolytic capacitors in modern electronic equipment. The lower the ESR the higher the ripple current per volume the better the functionality of the capacitor in the circuit.

==History==
{{see also|Electrolytic capacitors#History}}

The phenomenon that can electrochemically form an oxide layer on aluminum and metals like tantalum or niobium, blocking an electric current in one direction but allowing it to flow in the other direction, was discovered in 1875 by the French researcher [[Eugène Ducretet]]. He coined the term "valve metal“ for such metals. Charles Pollak (born [[Karol Pollak]]) used this phenomenon for an idea of an polarized “Electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes”. In 1896 Pollak obtained a patent for the first electrolytic capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pollack: D.R.P. 92564, filed 14. January 1896, granted 19. May 1897 [http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000000092564A D.R.P. 92564]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first tantalum electrolytic capacitors with wound tantalum foils and non-solid electrolyte were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronics Inc., USA, and used for military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Tailor, Tantalum and Tantalum Compounds, Fansteel Inc., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 19, 2nd ed. 1969 John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors began in the early 1950s as a miniaturized, more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement the newly invented [[transistor]]. The solution found by R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring of the Bell Labs was based on experience with ceramics. They ground down tantalum to a powder, pressed this powder into a cylindrical form and then sintered the powder particles into a pellet (“slug”) at high temperatures, between 1500 and 2000&amp;nbsp;°C, under vacuum conditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring, “A metal semi-conductor capacitor,” J. Electrochem. Soc., vol. 103, p. 611, November, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Reed, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Characterization of Tantalum Polymer Capacitors, NEPP Task 1.21.5, Phase 1, FY05]   [http://nepp.nasa.gov/docuploads/0EA22600-8AEC-4F47-9FE49BAABEAB569C/Tantalum%20Polymer%20Capacitors%20FY05%20Final%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; These first sintered tantalum capacitors used a non-solid electrolyte not consistent with the concept of solid state electronics. 1952 a targeted search in the Bell Labs for a solid electrolyte by D. A. McLean and F. S. Power led to the invention of manganese dioxide as a solid electrolyte for a sintered tantalum capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. McLean, F. S. Power, Proc. Inst. Radio Engrs. 44 (1956) 872&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical characteristics==

=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of a tantalum capacitor]]

Niobium electrolytic capacitors as discrete components are not ideal capacitors, they have losses and parasitic inductive parts. All properties can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed out of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics are defined by:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR"
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".

Using a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is specified by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/EN 60384-1.

===Capacitance standard values and tolerances===

The electrical characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors depend on structure of the anode and the type of electrolyte. The capacitance value of the capacitor depends on measuring frequency and temperature. The rated capacitance value or nominal value is specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers and is symbolized  C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. The standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors  an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz. The AC measuring voltage shall not exceed 0,5&amp;nbsp; V&amp;nbsp; AC-[[Root mean square|RMS]].

The percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E3 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M“
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E6 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M“
* rated capacitance, [[E12 series]], tolerance ±10%, letter code "K“

===Rated and category voltage===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]

Referring to IEC/EN 60384-1 standard the allowed operating voltage for niobium capacitors is called "rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; " or "nominal voltage U&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;". The rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; (IEC/EN 60384-1).

The voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature, the "category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.

Lower voltage applied may have positive influences for tantalum electrolytic capacitors. Lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduce the expected failure rate.&lt;ref name=AVX-Reliability&gt;Ch. Reynolds, AVX, Technical Information, Reliability Management of Tantalum Capacitors, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/rmtant.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806053447/http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/rmtant.pdf |date=2013-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying a higher voltage than specified may destroy electrolytic capacitors.

===Surge Voltage===

The surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles. The surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For niobium electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage shall be not higher than round 1.3 times of the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt.
The surge voltage applied to niobium capacitors may influence the capacitors failure rate.

===Reverse voltage===

Like other electrolytic capacitors, niobium electrolytic capacitors are polarized and require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.

===Impedance, ESR and dissipation factor, ripple current , leakage current===

General information to impedance, ESR, dissipation factor tan δ, ripple current, and leakage current see [[electrolytic capacitor]]

==Reliability and life time==

For general information on reliability and failure rate see [[electrolytic capacitor]].

The [[Service life|life time]], [[service life]], load life or useful life of electrolytic capacitors is a special characteristic of non-solid electrolytic capacitors, especially non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors which liquid electrolyte can evaporate over the time leading to wear-out failures. Solid niobium capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so the constant failure rate lasts up to the point all capacitors have failed. They don’t have a life time specification like non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

However, solid polymer niobium electrolytic capacitors do have a life time specification. The polymer electrolyte deteriorates by a thermal degradation mechanism of the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreases, as a function of time, in agreement with a granular structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains.&lt;ref&gt;E.

==Failure modes, self-healing mechanism and application rules==
The different types of electrolytic capacitors show different behaviors in long-term stability, inherent failure modes and their self-healing mechanisms. Application rules for types with an inherent failure mode are specified to ensure capacitors high reliability and long life.

[[File:Self-Healing-Nb-MnO2-E-Caps.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Self-healing in solid niobium capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte]]

A rare failure in solid electrolytic capacitors is breakdown of the dielectric caused by faults or impurities. In niobium electrolytic capacitors the dielectric is niobium pentoxide (Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). Besides this pentoxide there is an additional niobium suboxide, [[niobium dioxide]] (NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a semi-conducting material with a higher conductivity than Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; but much lower than a short. In case of faults or impurities in the dielectric which evokes a partial dielectric breakdown the conducting channel. would be effectively isolated by reduction of Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; into high ohmic NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if energy is limited.

As more energy is applied to a faulty solid niobium eventually either the high ohmic NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel or the Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; dielectric breaks down and the capacitor exhibits a thermal runaway failure. In comparison to solid tantalum capacitors the thermal runaway of niobium anodes will occur at about three times higher power than of tantalum anodes. This gives a significant reduction (95%) of the ignition failure mode compared to solid tantalum capacitors.

The dielectric layer Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of solid niobium electrolytic capacitors has a lower breakdown voltage proof than Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in tantalum capacitors and therefore grows thicker per applied volt and so operates at lower field strength for a given voltage rating with the lower electrical stress the dielectric. In combination with niobium oxide anodes, which are more stable against oxygen diffusion that results in lower voltage derating rules compared with passivated niobium or tantalum anodes.&lt;ref name=Karnik /&gt;

===Polarity marking===
[[File:Polymer-Quader-Polarität.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are marked with a bar at the positive component side]]
Niobium capacitors are in general polarized components, with distinctly marked positive terminals. When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly), the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down, which can cause it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity. If the failure is a short circuit (the most common occurrence), and current is not limited to a safe value, catastrophic thermal runaway may occur.

===Standardization===

The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for capacitors for use in electronic equipment are set out in the generic specification:
* IEC 60384-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 1: Generic specification

Until now (2014) no IEC detail specification for niobium electrolytic capacitors is available.

For electronics manufacturers in the United States the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]  publish a standard for niobium and tantalum chip capacitors:  
* EIA-717-A Surface Mount Niobium and Tantalum Capacitor Qualification Specification

===Features===

* Niobium capacitors serve as a replacement for tantalum capacitors  
* Niobium capacitors are available in SMD style, that makes them suitable for all portable electronic systems with flat design 
* Niobium capacitors have no inrush current limitation
* Niobium capacitors are available with solid electrolyte for low ESR applications and stable electrical parameters
* Niobium capacitors have a limited number of manufacturers (AVX and Vishay)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2012/nov/niobium-capacitors-slow-to-take-hold G. Roos, Digi-Key, Niobium Capacitors Slow to Take Hold, 2012-11-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear decommissioning''' is the process whereby a [[nuclear facility]] is dismantled to the point that it no longer requires measures for radiation protection. 
The presence of [[radioactive]] material necessitates processes that are potentially occupationally hazardous, expensive, time-intensive, and present environmental risks that must be addressed to ensure radioactive materials are either transported elsewhere for storage or stored on-site in a safe manner.&lt;ref name="Benjamin K. Sovacool 2010, p. 373"&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. "A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia", ''[[Journal of Contemporary Asia]]'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decommissioning is an administrative and technical process. 
It includes clean-up of radioactive materials and progressive demolition of the facility. 
Once a facility is fully decommissioned, no radiological danger should persist. 
The costs of decommissioning are generally spread over the lifetime of a facility and saved in a decommissioning fund.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/decommissioning.html Quote: Before a nuclear power plant begins operations, the licensee must establish or obtain a financial mechanism – such as a trust fund or a guarantee from its parent company – to ensure there will be sufficient money to pay for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility.&lt;/ref&gt;  
After a facility has been completely decommissioned, it is released from regulatory control and the plant licensee is no longer responsible for its nuclear safety. 
Decommissioning may proceed all the way to "[[greenfield status|greenfield]]" status.

==Definition==
Nuclear decommissioning is the administrative and technical process whereby a [[nuclear facility]] such as a [[nuclear power plant]] (NPP), a [[research reactor]], an [[isotope]] production plant, a [[particle accelerator]], or [[uranium mine]] is dismantled to the point that it no longer requires measures for [[radiation protection]]. 
The progressive demolition of buildings and removal of [[radioactive]] material is potentially occupationally hazardous, expensive, time-intensive, and presents environmental risks that must be addressed to ensure radioactive materials are either transported elsewhere for storage or stored on-site in a safe manner.&lt;ref name="Benjamin K. Sovacool 2010, p. 373"/&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} Decommissioning may proceed all the way to "[[greenfield status]]". Once a facility is decommissioned no radioactive danger persists and it can be released from regulatory control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/liability-for-nuclear-damage.aspx Liability for Nuclear Damage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Options==
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] defines three options for decommissioning:
* ''Immediate Dismantling'' (Early Site Release/[[Decon]] in the United States) allows for the facility to be removed from regulatory control relatively soon after shutdown. Final dismantling or [[decontamination]] activities begin within a few months or years, and depending on the facility, it could take five years or more.&lt;ref name="NEI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Decommissioning-Nuclear-Energy-Facilities |title= Fact Sheets: Decommissioning Of Nuclear Power Plants |publisher=National Energy Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being removed from regulatory control, the site becomes available for unrestricted use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/search.html?q=Decon&amp;site=allSites#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=Decon&amp;gsc.page=1 DECON: a method of decommissioning, in which structures, systems, and components that contain radioactive contamination are removed from a site and safely disposed at a commercially operated low-level waste disposal facility, or decontaminated to a level that permits the site to be released for unrestricted use shortly after it ceases operation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Safe Enclosure'' (or Safestor(e) [[Safstor]]) postpones the final decommissioning for a longer period, usually 40 to 60&amp;nbsp;years. The nuclear facility is placed into a safe storage configuration during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/safstor.html SAFSTOR: a method of decommissioning in which a nuclear facility is placed and maintained in a condition that allows the facility to be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated (deferred decontamination) to levels that permit release for unrestricted use.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nuclear entombment|Entombment/Entomb]]'' involves placing the facility in a condition that allows the remaining radioactive material to remain on-site indefinitely. The size of the area where the radioactive material is located is generally minimized and the facility is encased in a long-lived material such as concrete, with the aim of preventing a release of radioactive material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/entomb.html ENTOMB: a method of decommissioning, in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a structurally long-lived material, such as concrete. The entombed structure is maintained and surveillance is continued until the entombed radioactive waste decays to a level permitting termination of the license and unrestricted release of the property. During the entombment period, the licensee maintains the license previously issued by the NRC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==

The decommission of a nuclear reactor can only take place after the appropriate licence has been granted pursuant to the relevant legislation. As part of the licensing procedure, various documents, reports and expert opinions have to be written and delivered to the competent authority, e.g. safety report, technical documents and an [[environmental impact study]] (EIS).

In the European Union these documents are the basis for the [[environmental impact assessment]] (EIA) according to Council Directive 85/337/EEC. A precondition for granting such a licence is an opinion by the European Commission according to Article 37 of the [[Euratom Treaty]]. Article 37 obliges every Member State of the European Union to communicate certain data relating to the release of radioactive substances to the Commission. This information must reveal whether and if so what radiological impacts decommissioning – planned disposal and accidental release – will have on the environment, i.e. water, soil or airspace, of the EU Member States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/lw_resource/datapool/__pages/pdp_1407/atw-2008-06_HEUEL-FABIANEK.pdf Heuel-Fabianek, B., Kümmerle, E., Möllmann-Coers, M., Lennartz, R.

&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of these general data, the Commission must be in a position to assess the exposure of reference groups of the population in the nearest neighbouring states.

In the United States, the NRC recommends that the costs of decommissioning should be spread over the lifetime of a facility and saved in a decommissioning fund.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/decommissioning.html NRC Factsheet Decomissoning] Quote: Before a nuclear power plant begins operations, the licensee must establish or obtain a financial mechanism – such as a trust fund or a guarantee from its parent company – to ensure there will be sufficient money to pay for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility.&lt;/ref&gt; Repository delay seems to be effective in reducing NPP decommissioning costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsrepository-delay-reduces-swiss-npps-decommissioning-costs-5703898 Repository delay reduces Swiss NPPs’ decommissioning costs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, decommissioning of [[Brennilis Nuclear Power Plant]], a fairly small 70&amp;nbsp;MW power plant, already cost €480&amp;nbsp;million (20x the estimate costs) and is still pending after 20&amp;nbsp;years. 
Despite the huge investments in securing the dismantlement, radioactive elements such as [[plutonium]], [[caesium-137]] and [[cobalt-60]] leaked out into the surrounding lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letelegramme.com/ar/viewarticle1024.php?aaaammjj=20071129&amp;article=20071129-2063574&amp;type=ar Le Télégramme: Brennilis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayennesurvoltee.com/Mayenne_survoltee/Actualites/actua_nation/actua_brennilis_12072007/BRENNILIS.jpg Ouest-France: "Brennilis : EDF se fait taper sur les doigts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501102123/http://www.mayennesurvoltee.com/Mayenne_survoltee/Actualites/actua_nation/actua_brennilis_12072007/BRENNILIS.jpg |date=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, decommissioning of the Windscale [[Advanced gas cooled reactor]] (WAGR), a 32&amp;nbsp;MW prototype power plant, cost €117&amp;nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
A 2013 estimate by the United Kingdom's [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] predicted costs of at least £100&amp;nbsp;billion to decommission the 19 existing United Kingdom nuclear sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Nuclear Decommissioning Authority: Managing risk at Sellafield |date=February 4, 2013 |publisher=London: The Stationery Office Limited|author=House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/746/746.pdf| accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, decommissioning of [[Niederaichbach]] nuclear power plant, a 100&amp;nbsp;MW power plant, amounted to more than €143&amp;nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

New methods for decommissioning have been developed in order to minimize the usual high decommissioning costs. 
One of these methods is in situ decommissioning (ISD), meaning that the reactor is entombed instead of dismantled. 
This method was implemented at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site in South Carolina for the closures of the P and R Reactors. 
With this tactic, the cost of decommissioning both reactors was $73&amp;nbsp;million. 
In comparison, the decommissioning of each reactor using traditional methods would have been an estimated $250&amp;nbsp;million. 
This results in a 71% decrease in cost by using ISD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/26-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20-%20SRS%20P%20and%20R%20Reactor%20Basins%20ISD%20Final.pdf|title=SRS P and R Reactor Basins ISD Final|last=|first=|date=|website=D&amp;D KM-IT – Deactivation and Decommissioning Knowledge Management Information Tool|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in a meeting in [[Vienna]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] estimated the total cost for the decommissioning of all nuclear facilities.
Decommissioning of all nuclear power reactors in the world would require US$187 [[billion (short scale)|billion]]; US$71 billion for fuel cycle facilities; less than US$7 billion for all research reactors; and US$640 billion for dismantling all military reactors for the production of weapons-grade [[plutonium]], research fuel facilities, [[nuclear reprocessing]] chemical separation facilities, etc. 
The total cost to decommission the [[nuclear fission]] industry in the [[World]] (from 2001 to 2050) was estimated at around US$1 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1201_web.pdf Status of Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities around the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decommissioning funds ===
In Europe there is considerable concern over the funds necessary to finance final decommissioning. In many countries either the funds do not appear sufficient to cover decommissioning and in other countries decommissioning funds are used for other activities, putting decommissioning at risk, and distorting competition with parties who do not have such funds available.&lt;ref&gt;[[The ENDS Report|ENDS]]: [http://www.climatesceptics.org/decommissioning/nuclear-decommissioning-funds-require-oversight Nuclear decommissioning funds “require oversight”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[European Commission]] assessed that European Union's nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118&amp;nbsp;billion euros, with only 150&amp;nbsp;billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268&amp;nbsp;billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. [[Nuclear power in France|France]] had the largest shortfall with only 23&amp;nbsp;billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74&amp;nbsp;billion euros of expected costs.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160216&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-nuclear-idUKKCN0VP2KN |title=EU short of 118&amp;nbsp;billion euros in nuclear decommissioning funds |author=Christoph Steitz, Barbara Lewis |publisher=Reuters |date=February 16, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concerns exist in the United States, where the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has located apparent decommissioning funding assurance shortfalls and requested 18 power plants to address that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0917/ML091700104.pdf |title=NRC Requests Plans from 18 Nuclear Power Plants to Address Apparent Decommissioning Funding Assurance Shortfalls |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |date= June 19, 2009 |accessdate=2014-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decommissioning cost of [[Small modular reactor]]s is expected to be twice as much respect to Large Reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Mancini|first2=Mauro|date=July 2, 2010|title=Competitiveness of Small-Medium, New Generation Reactors: A Comparative Study on Decommissioning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4000613|journal=Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power|volume=132|issue=10|pages=102906–102906|doi=10.1115/1.4000613|issn=0742-4795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International collaboration ==
Organizations that promote the international sharing of information, knowledge, and experiences related to nuclear decommissioning include the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency]] and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]].&lt;ref name="Nuclear Decommissioning"/&gt; In addition, an online system called the [[D&amp;D KM-IT|Deactivation and Decommissioning Knowledge Management Information Tool]] was developed under the [[United States Department of Energy]] and made available to the international community to support the exchange of ideas and information. The goals of international collaboration in nuclear decommissioning are to reduce decommissioning costs and improve worker safety.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Decommissioning"/&gt;

==List of inactive or decommissioned civil nuclear reactors==
[[File:Pickering-nuclear-generating-station-001.jpg|thumb|700px|The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, viewed from the west. All eight reactors are visible; two units have been shut down.]]
A wide range of nuclear facilities have been decommissioned so far. The number of decommissioned nuclear reactors out of the  [[List of nuclear reactors]] is small. As of 2016, 150 nuclear reactors were shut-off, in several early and intermediate stages (cold shut-down, defueling, SAFSTOR, internal demolition), but only 17 have been taken to fully "[[greenfield status]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities.aspx World Nuclear Association: Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these sites still host [[spent nuclear fuel]] in the form of [[Dry cask storage|dry casks]] embedded in concrete filled steel drums.&lt;ref&gt;http://infcis.iaea.org/NFCIS/Facilities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agency2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD Nuclear Energy Agency|title=Management of recyclable fissile and fertile materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1UuVHi7CDAC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=May 2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-03255-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[nuclear engineering]] and [[building demolition]] [[companies]] specialize in nuclear decommissioning, which has become a profitable business. More recently, construction and demolition companies in the UK have also begun to develop nuclear decommissioning services. Due to the [[Neutron activation|radioactivity]] in the reactor structure (specially with high [[neutron]]-flux), decommissioning takes place in stages.&lt;ref name="gru.com"&gt;[https://gru.com/Portals/0/Legacy/Pdf/futurePower/CR3/Site-Specific%20Decommissioning%20Cost%20Estimate.pdf Estimate of Decommissioning Periods and Cost for Crystal River 3 NPP]&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for decommissioning reactors have a time frame of decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org www.world-nuclear.org]: [http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities.aspx Decommissioning nuclear facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The long time frame makes reliable cost estimates difficult and cost overruns are common even for "quick" projects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Exelon has contracted with a specialist company – EnergySolutions, to remove the plant and return the site to greenfield status. To achieve this, the plant's licence and decommissioning funds will be transferred to EnergySolutions, which will then be owner and licensee, and the site will be returned to Exelon about 2018.

On July 16, 1985, the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) issued Amendment No. 19 to the HBPP Unit 3 Operating License to change the status to possess-but-not-operate, and the plant was placed into a [[SAFSTOR]] status. &lt;/small&gt;

===Ships, mobile reactors, military reactors ===
Many warships and a few civil ships have used [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear reactors for propulsion]]. Former Soviet and American warships have been taken out of service and their power plants removed or scuttled. Dismantling of [[Decommissioning of Russian nuclear-powered vessels|Russian submarines and ships]] and [[Ship-Submarine Recycling|American submarines and ships]] is ongoing. Marine power plants are generally smaller than land-based electrical generating stations.

The biggest American military nuclear facility for the production of [[weapons-grade plutonium]] was [[Hanford site]] (in the [[State of Washington]]), now defueled, but in a slow and problematic process of decontamination, decommissioning, and demolition. There is "the [[canyon]]" a giant structure for the chemical extraction of [[plutonium]] with the [[PUREX]] process. There are also many big containers and underground tanks with a solution of water, hydrocarbons and [[uranium]]-[[plutonium]]-[[neptunium]]-[[cesium]]-[[strontium]] (all highly radioactive). With all reactors now defueled, some were put in [[SAFSTOR]] (with their cooling towers demolished). Several reactors have been declared [[National Historic Landmark]]s.

[[File:Yangjiang NPP 2009-1.jpg|thumb|[[Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station]] in [[Guangdong]] will supply electricity to Hong Kong in 2017]]

Currently, there is no '''nuclear power plant in Hong Kong'''. However, a [[Hong Kong]] company, [[Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Company]] (HKNIC), owns 25% share in [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Guangdong]]. About 70% of the power plant electricity output is supplied to Hong Kong by their electric utility company [[CLP Group|China Light and Power Co., Ltd.]] (CLP) to meet the electricity demand in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="legco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr10-11/english/panels/se/papers/se0117cb2-767-2-e.pdf|date=11 January 2011|publisher=立法會Legislative Council|title=Background brief prepared by the Legislative Council Secretariat for the special meeting on 17 January 2011 &amp;#124; Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station Notification Mechanism|accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity import from nuclear power plants in Mainland China==
Hong Kong currently imports electricity from [[Mainland China]] from the [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Guangdong]] since 1994. The agreement of electricity import lasts until 2034. [[CLP Group|CLP]] will also import 17% of electricity from the planned [[Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station]] in Guangdong by 2017 under the agreement with [[China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company]].

==Carbon emission mitigation==
To reduce the carbon dioxide emission in Hong Kong, new coal-fired power plants have not been allowed to be built anymore since 1997. The [[government of Hong Kong]] have been trying to boost the share of [[renewable energy]], natural gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] for power generation in Hong Kong. The current existing coal-fired power plants will be kept on low utilization as [[power reserve|reserve]].

The government itself plan to cut carbon emission up to 50-60% from the current emission by 2020 by gradually replacing coal-based power generation with more nuclear power and other [[Sustainable energy|green energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/EE_Hong_Kong_to_replace_coal_with_nuclear_1509101.html |title=Hong Kong to replace coal with nuclear |publisher= [[World-nuclear-news.org]] |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nucleus drawing.svg|thumb|right|An [[atomic nucleus]] is shown here as a compact bundle of the two types of nucleons, [[proton]]s (red) and [[neutron]]s (blue). In this picture, the protons and neutrons are shown as distinct, which is the conventional view in [[chemistry]], for example. But in an actual nucleus, as understood by modern [[nuclear physics]], the nucleons are partially delocalized and organize themselves according to the laws of [[quantum chromodynamics]].]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], a '''nucleon''' is either a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]], considered in its role as a component of an [[atomic nucleus]]. The number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an [[isotope]]'s [[mass number|mass number (nucleon number)]].

Until the 1960s, nucleons were thought to be [[elementary particle]]s, not made up of smaller parts. Now they are known to be [[composite particle]]s, made of three [[quark]]s bound together by the so-called [[strong interaction]]. The interaction between two or more nucleons is called [[internucleon interaction]] or [[nuclear force]], which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction. (Before the discovery of quarks, the term "strong interaction" referred to just internucleon interactions.)

Nucleons sit at the boundary where [[particle physics]] and [[nuclear physics]] overlap. Particle physics, particularly [[quantum chromodynamics]], provides the fundamental equations that explain the properties of quarks and of the strong interaction. These equations explain quantitatively how quarks can bind together into protons and neutrons (and all the other [[hadron]]s). However, when multiple nucleons are assembled into an atomic nucleus ([[nuclide]]), these fundamental equations become too difficult to solve directly (see [[lattice QCD]]). Instead, nuclides are studied within [[nuclear physics]], which studies nucleons and their interactions by approximations and models, such as the [[nuclear shell model]]. These models can successfully explain nuclide properties, as for example, whether or not a particular nuclide undergoes [[radioactive decay]].

The proton and neutron are both [[baryon]]s and both [[fermion]]s. The proton carries a positive net [[Electric charge|charge]] and the neutron carries a zero net charge; the proton's [[mass]] is only about 0.13% less than the neutron's. Thus, they can be viewed as two states of the same nucleon, and together form an [[isospin]] doublet ({{nowrap|''I'' {{=}} {{frac|1|2}}}}). In isospin space, neutrons can be transformed into protons via [[SU(2)]] symmetries, and vice versa. These nucleons are acted upon equally by the strong interaction, which is invariant under rotation in isospin space. According to the [[Noether theorem]], isospin is conserved with respect to the strong interaction.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2008&gt;{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Elementary Particles|edition=2nd revised| publisher=WILEY-VCH |year=2008|isbn= 978-3-527-40601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129–130}}

Protons and neutrons are best known in their role as nucleons, i.e., as the components of atomic nuclei, but they also exist as free particles. Free neutrons are unstable, with a half-life of around 13 minutes, but they are common in nature and have important applications (see [[neutron radiation]] and [[neutron scattering]]). Singular protons, not bound to other nucleons, are usually regarded as the nuclei of hydrogen atoms or ions, but in some extreme cases (cosmic rays, proton beams), they may be regarded as free protons.

Neither the proton nor neutron is an [[elementary particle]], meaning each is composed of smaller parts, namely three [[quarks]] each. A proton is composed of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], while the neutron has one up quark and two down quarks. Quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction|strong force]], or equivalently, by [[gluon]]s, which mediate the strong force.

An up quark has [[electric charge]] &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']], and a down quark has charge &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;''e'', so the summed electric charges of proton and neutron are  +[[elementary charge|''e'']] and 0, respectively.&lt;ref name=coeffs group="note"&gt;The resultant coefficients are obtained by summation of the component charges: Σ= &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|2|3}}  +  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|2|3}}  +  &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|1|3}} = &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|3|3}} =  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;1, and  Σ= &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|2|3}}  +  &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|1|3}}  +  &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{frac|1|3}} = {{frac|0|3}} = 0.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the neutron has a charge of 0 (zero), and therefore is electrically neutral; indeed, the term "neutron" comes from the fact that a neutron is electrically neutral.

The mass of the proton and neutron is quite similar: The proton is {{val|1.6726|e=-27|ul=kg}} or {{val|938.27|ul=MeV/c2}}, while the neutron is {{val|1.6749|e=-27|ul=kg}} or {{val|939.57|ul=MeV/c2}}. The neutron is roughly 0.13% heavier. The similarity in mass can be explained roughly by the slight difference in masses of up quarks and down quarks composing the nucleons.  However, a detailed explanation remains an unsolved problem in particle physics.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2008/&gt;{{rp|135–136}}

The [[spin (physics)|spin]] of both protons and neutrons is {{frac|1|2}}, which means they are [[fermion]]s and, like electrons (and unlike [[bosons]]), are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], a very important phenomenon in [[nuclear physics]]: protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus cannot all be in the same [[quantum state]]; instead they spread out into [[nuclear shell]]s analogous to [[electron shell]]s in chemistry. Also important, this spin (of proton and neutron) is the source of [[nuclear spin]] in larger nuclei. Nuclear spin is best known for its crucial role in the [[NMR]]/[[MRI]] technique for chemical and biochemical analyses.

The [[magnetic moment]] of a proton, denoted μ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, is {{val|2.79|u=[[nuclear magneton]]s (&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, while the magnetic moment of a neutron is μ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|-1.91|u=μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These parameters are also important in NMR/MRI.

===Stability===
A neutron in free state is an unstable particle, with a [[half-life]] around ten minutes. It undergoes [[beta decay|{{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay]] (a type of [[radioactive decay]]) by turning into a proton while emitting an electron and an [[electron antineutrino]]. (See the [[Neutron]] article for more discussion of neutron decay.) A proton by itself is thought to be stable, or at least its lifetime is too long to measure. This is an important discussion in particle physics, (see [[Proton decay]]).

Inside a nucleus, on the other hand, combined protons and neutrons (nucleons) can be stable or unstable depending on the [[nuclide]], or nuclear species. Inside some nuclides, a neutron can turn into a proton (producing other particles) as described above; the reverse can happen inside other nuclides, where a proton turns into a neutron (producing other particles) through [[beta decay|{{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay]], or [[electron capture]]. And inside still other nuclides, both protons and neutrons are stable and do not change form.

===Antinucleons===
{{main article|Antineutron|Antiproton|Antimatter}}

Both nucleons have corresponding [[antiparticle]]s: the [[antiproton]] and the [[antineutron]], which have the same mass and opposite charge as the proton and neutron respectively, and they interact in the same way. (This is generally believed to be ''exactly'' true, due to [[CPT symmetry]]. If there is a difference, it is too small to measure in all experiments to date.) In particular, antinucleons can bind into an "antinucleus". So far, scientists have created [[antideuterium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Massam, T|year = 1965 |title = Experimental observation of antideuteron production |journal = Il Nuovo Cimento |volume = 39|issue = 1 |pages = 10–14 |doi = 10.1007/BF02814251|last2 = Muller|first2 = Th.|last3 = Righini|first3 = B.|last4 = Schneegans|first4 = M.|last5 = Zichichi|first5 = A.|bibcode = 1965NCimS..39...10M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Dorfan, D.

===Nucleon resonances===
'''Nucleon resonances''' are [[excited state]]s of nucleon particles, often corresponding to one of the quarks having a flipped [[spin (physics)|spin]] state, or with different [[Azimuthal quantum number|orbital angular momentum]] when the particle decays. Only resonances with a 3 or 4 star rating at the [[Particle Data Group]] (PDG) are included in this table. Due to their extraordinarily short lifetimes, many properties of these particles are still under investigation.

The symbol format is given as N(M) L&lt;sub&gt;2I2J&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is the particle's approximate mass, L is the orbital angular momentum of the Nucleon-meson pair produced when it decays, and I and J are the particle's [[isospin]] and [[total angular momentum]] respectively. Since nucleons are defined as having {{frac|1|2}} isospin, the first number will always be 1, and the second number will always be odd. When discussing nucleon resonances, sometimes the N is omitted and the order is reversed, giving L&lt;sub&gt;2I2J&lt;/sub&gt; (M). For example, a proton can be symbolized as "N(939) S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;" or "S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (939)".

The table below lists only the base resonance; each individual entry represents 4 [[baryon]]s: 2 nucleon resonances particles, as well as their 2 antiparticles. Each resonance exists in a form with a positive [[electric charge]] (Q), with a quark composition of {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark}} like the proton, and a neutral form, with a quark composition of {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark}} like the neutron, as well as the corresponding antiparticles with antiquark compositions of {{SubatomicParticle|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down antiquark}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down antiquark}} respectively. Since they contain no [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]], or [[top quark|top]] quarks, these particles do not possess [[strangeness]], etc. The table only lists the resonances with an isospin of {{frac|1|2}}. For resonances with {{frac|3|2}} isospin, see the [[Delta baryon]] article.

† ''The P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;(939) nucleon represents the excited state of a normal proton or neutron, for example, within the nucleus of an atom. Such particles are usually stable within the nucleus, i.e. [[Lithium-6]].''

==Quark model classification==
In the [[quark model]] with [[SU(2)]] [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]], the two nucleons are part of the ground state doublet.  The proton has quark content of ''uud'', and the neutron, ''udd''. In [[SU(3)]] flavour, they are part of the ground state octet ('''8''') of [[spin (physics)|spin]] {{frac|1|2}} [[baryon]]s, known as the [[eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold way]]. The other members of this octet are the [[hyperon]]s [[strangeness|strange]] [[isopin|isotriplet]] [[Sigma baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Sigma+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma-}}]], the [[Lambda baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Lambda}}]] and the strange isodoublet [[Xi baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Xi0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Xi-}}]]. One can extend this multiplet in [[SU(4)]] flavour (with the inclusion of the charm quark) to the ground state '''20'''-plet, or to [[SU(6)]] flavour (with the inclusion of the top and bottom quarks) to the ground state '''56'''-plet.

The article on [[isospin]] provides an explicit expression for the nucleon wave functions in terms of the quark flavour eigenstates.

==Models==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Casimir effect]] --&gt;
{{Confusing|section|date=August 2007}}

Although it is known that the nucleon is made from three quarks, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, it is not known how to solve the [[equations of motion]] for [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Thus, the study of the low-energy properties of the nucleon are performed by means of models. The only first-principles approach available is to attempt to solve the equations of QCD numerically, using [[lattice QCD]]. This requires complicated algorithms and very powerful [[supercomputer]]s. However, several analytic models also exist:

===Skyrmion models===
The [[Skyrmion]] models the nucleon as a [[topological soliton]] in a non-linear [[SU(2)]] [[pion]] field. The topological stability of the Skyrmion is interpreted as the conservation of [[baryon number]], that is, the non-decay of the nucleon. The local [[topological winding number]] density is identified with the local [[baryon number]] density of the nucleon. With the pion isospin vector field oriented in the shape of a [[hedgehog space]], the model is readily solvable, and is thus sometimes called the ''hedgehog model''. The hedgehog model is able to predict low-energy parameters, such as the nucleon mass, radius and [[axial coupling constant]], to approximately 30% of experimental values.

===MIT bag model===
The ''MIT bag model'' confines three non-interacting quarks to a spherical cavity, with the [[boundary condition]] that the quark [[vector current]] vanish on the boundary. The non-interacting treatment of the quarks is justified by appealing to the idea of [[asymptotic freedom]], whereas the hard boundary condition is justified by [[quark confinement]].

Mathematically, the model vaguely resembles that of a [[radar cavity]], with solutions to the [[Dirac equation]] standing in for solutions to the [[Maxwell equations]] and the vanishing vector current boundary condition standing for the conducting metal walls of the radar cavity. If the radius of the bag is set to the radius of the nucleon, the '''bag model''' predicts a nucleon mass that is within 30% of the actual mass.

Although the basic bag model does not provide a pion-mediated interaction, it describes excellently the nucleon-nucleon forces through the 6&amp;nbsp;quark bag s-channel mechanism using the P&amp;nbsp;matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaffe | first1 = R.

===Chiral bag model===
The ''chiral bag model''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[Gerald E. Brown]] and [[Mannque Rho]]|date=March 1979|title = The little bag|journal = Phys. Lett. B|volume = 82|issue = 2 |pages = 177–180| doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(79)90729-9|bibcode = 1979PhLB...82..177B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; merges the ''MIT bag model'' and the ''Skyrmion model''. In this model, a hole is punched out of the middle of the Skyrmion, and replaced with a bag model. The boundary condition is provided by the requirement of continuity of the [[axial vector current]] across the bag boundary.

Very curiously, the missing part of the topological winding number (the baryon number) of the hole punched into the Skyrmion is exactly made up by the non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]] (or [[spectral asymmetry]]) of the quark fields inside the bag. {{As of|2017}}, this remarkable trade-off between [[topology]] and the [[spectrum of an operator]] does not have any grounding or explanation in the mathematical theory of [[Hilbert space]]s and their relationship to [[geometry]]. Several other properties of the chiral bag are notable: it provides a better fit to the low energy nucleon properties, to within 5–10%, and these are almost completely independent of the chiral bag radius (as long as the radius is less than the nucleon radius). This independence of radius is referred to as the ''Cheshire Cat principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the fading to a smile of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Cheshire Cat]]. It is expected that a first-principles solution of the equations of QCD will demonstrate a similar duality of quark-pion descriptions.

It consisted of double-circuit 330&amp;nbsp;kV lines between [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], [[Dumaresq, New South Wales|Dumaresq]], [[Bulli Creek, Queensland|Bulli Creek]] and [[Braemar, New South Wales|Braemar]], and a double-circuit 275&amp;nbsp;kV line between Braemar and [[Tarong, Queensland|Tarong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interconnector capabilities for the national electricity market |last = Blake|first = Ben|publisher = Australian energy Market Operator|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 6|publication-place = |publication-date = July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original maximum transfer capacity was 300 to 350&amp;nbsp;MW in both directions. This has been progressively increased to 700&amp;nbsp;MW from New South Wales to Queensland and 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW from Queensland to New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Project assessment conclusions report—development of the Queensland NSW Interconnector |publisher = Powerlink Transgrid|date = 13 November 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interconnector is operated by [[TransGrid]] and [[Powerlink Queensland]].

'''Rujm el-Hiri''' ({{lang-ar|رجم الهري}}, ''Rujm al-Hīrī''; {{lang-he-n|גִּלְגַּל רְפָאִים}} ''Gilgal Refā'īm'' or ''Rogem Hiri'') is an ancient [[megalith]]ic monument consisting of concentric circles of stone with a [[tumulus]] at center.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; It is located in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] portion of the [[Golan Heights]], some {{convert|16|km}} east of the coast of the [[Sea of Galilee]], in the middle of a large plateau covered with hundreds of [[dolmen]]s.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avraham Negev|author2=Shimon Gibson|title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=30 March 2011|date=July 2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-8571-7|pages=207, 443, 518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]]|title=The Holy Land:An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT531|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164766-6|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Made up of more than 42,000 [[basalt]] rocks arranged in concentric circles, it has a mound {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall at its center.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; Some circles are complete, others incomplete. The outermost wall is {{convert|520|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|8|ft|m}} high. The establishment of the site, and other nearby ancient settlements, is dated by archaeologists to the [[Bronze Age#Age sub-divisions|Early Bronze Age II]] period (3000–2700 BCE).&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;

Since excavations have yielded very few material remains, [[Israel]]i archeologists theorize that the site was not a defensive position or a residential quarter but most likely a ritual center, possibly linked to the cult of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-3a82d460d57c4e598c18e3de8bce3c8a.html Grisly theory for Holy Land mystery]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is no consensus regarding its function, as no similar structure has been found in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/27926134?uid=3738240&amp;uid=377779673&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21102112483707 Rogem Hiri: A Megalithic Monument in the Golan, Mattanyah Zohar, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Rujm el-Hiri, "stone heap of the wild cat",&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; was originally taken from [[Syria]]n maps.&lt;ref name="Museumsle-arkheʾologyah1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yonathan Mizrachi|author2=Mattanyah Zohar|author3=Moshe Kochavi|author4=Vincent Murphy|author5=Simcha Lev-Yadun|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|title = The 1988–1991 Excavations at Rogem Hiri, Golan Heights|year=1996|pages=167–195|volume=46|number=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[rujm]]'' in Arabic (pl. ''rujum''; Hebrew: ''rogem'') can also refer to a [[tumulus]], a heap of stones underneath which human burial space was located.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; The name is sometimes [[Romanization|romanized]] as Rujm Hiri or Rujum al-Hiri.

Rogem Hiri is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version of the Arabic name Rujm el-Hiri.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; A modern Hebrew name used for the site is ''Gilgal Refā'īm'' or ''Galgal Refā'īm'', "Wheel of Spirits" or "Wheel of Ghosts" as ''Refa'im'' means "ghosts" or "spirits".&lt;ref name=MFA&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-24|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/rogem%20hiri%20-%20ancient-%20mysterious%20construction.aspx|title=Rogem Hiri - Ancient Mysterious Construction|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204852/http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/rogem%20hiri%20-%20ancient-%20mysterious%20construction.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel's answer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/in-the-wildcat-s-pile-of-stones-1.11251|title=In the wildcat's pile of stones|publisher=[[Ha'aretz]]|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and description==
[[File:Rujm el Hiri View Top.jpg|thumb|150px|Entrance to burial cave]]
The site's size and location, on a wide plateau which is also scattered with hundreds of [[dolmen]]s, means that an aerial perspective is necessary to see the complete layout.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; The site was made from Basalt rocks, common in the Golan Heights due to the region's history of [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. It is made from 37,500 - 40,000&lt;ref name="Freikman 2012"/&gt; tons of partly worked stone stacked up to {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} high.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony F. Aveni|title=Skywatchers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDBu_x6vlZ4C&amp;pg=PA323|accessdate=30 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70502-9|pages=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated by Freikman that the transportation and building of the massive monument would have required more than 25,000 working days.&lt;ref name="Freikman 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freikman|first=M.|title=A Near Eastern Megalithic Monument in Context|journal=[http://journal.topoi.org/index.php/etopoi Journal for Ancient Studes]|year=2012|issue=3|pages=143–147|url=http://journal.topoi.org/index.php/etopoi/article/download/99/129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is often referred to as the "[[Stonehenge]] of the [[Levant]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2774727411.html What's in a (wine's) name, Washington Jewish Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains consist of a large circle (slightly oval) of [[basalt]] rocks, containing four smaller concentric circles, each getting progressively thinner; some are complete, others incomplete.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt; The walls of the circles are connected by irregularly placed smaller stone walls perpendicular to the circles.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt;

The central [[tumulus]] is built from smaller rocks, and is thought to have been constructed after the surrounding walls were constructed.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; Connecting to it are four main stone walls. The first wall, shaped like a semicircle, is 50m in diameter and 1.5m wide. That wall is connected to a second one, an almost complete circle 90m in diameter. The third wall is a full circle, 110m in diameter and 2.6m wide. The fourth and outermost wall is the largest: 150m in diameter and 3.2m wide.

A central tumulus {{convert|65|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|15|ft|m}} high is surrounded by concentric circles, the outermost of which is {{convert|520|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|8|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt; Two entrances to the site face the northeast ({{convert|29|m|ft|sp=us}} wide) and southeast ({{convert|26|m|ft|sp=us}} wide).&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt; The northeast entrance leads to an accessway {{convert|20|ft|m}} long leading to the center of the circle which seems to point in the general direction of the [[Solstice|June solstice]] sunrise.&lt;ref name="Murphy-O'Connor2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; The axis of the tomb discovered at the site's center is similarly aligned.&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] is almost due north and [[Mount Tabor]] is close to December solstice sunrise. Geometry and astronomy are visually connected by the temple's design.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"/&gt;

==History and purpose==
The site was cataloged during an archaeological survey carried out in 1967-1968 by Shmarya Gutman and Claire Epstein.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson2005"/&gt;  The site is probably the source of the legends about "a remnant of the giants" or [[Rephaim]] for [[Og]].&lt;ref name="Yuval Ne'eman"&gt;[http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/judaism/jewish_astro.html Astronomy in Israel: From Og's Circle to the Wise Observatory], [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Tel Aviv University]]&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyors used Syrian maps, and a Syrian [[Triangulation station|triangulation post]] was found on top of its [[cairn]].&lt;ref name="Museumsle-arkheʾologyah1996"/&gt; After this initial study, serious [[Archeology|archaeological excavation]]s commenced in the 1980s under Israeli professors [[Moshe Kochavi]] and Yoni Mizrachi, as part of the Land of Geshur Archaeological Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kochavi|first=Moshe|author2=Renner, Timothy |author3=Spar, Ira |author4= Yadlin, Esther |title=Rediscovered! The Land of Geshur|journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]|date=July–August 1992|volume=18|issue=4|url=http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Rediscovered!_The_Land_of_Geshur,_Moshe_Kochavi,_Timothy_Renner,_Ira_Spar_and_Esther_Yadin,_BAR_18:04,_Jul/Aug_1992.|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Stephen Gabriel|title=The wheel of giants|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/The-wheel-of-giants|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypotheses===
&lt;!--Better if converted to prose?--&gt;
* Worship - According to this hypothesis, the site was used for special ceremonies during the longest and shortest days of the year. It seems, that in the year [[3rd millennium BC|3000 BCE]], on the longest day, the first rays of the sun shone through the opening in the north-east gate, which is 20 by 29 meters. However, they did not shine in a perfect angle. It is assumed this is because the builders did not have sufficiently accurate architectural tools. The residents probably used the site to worship [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Ishtar]], the gods of fertility,&lt;ref name="Aveni2001"/&gt; to thank them for the good harvest during the year. After the erection of the tomb in the center, the rays' path was blocked.
* Burial site - It appears that the place of worship later became a burial site&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive L. N. Ruggles|title=Ancient astronomy: an encyclopedia of cosmologies and myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=29 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-477-6|pages=366–368}}&lt;/ref&gt; for leaders or other important individuals. Supporting this theory was the tomb in the dolmen. However, no human remains were found, only objects pointing to its function as a tomb. Also, even if it were a tomb, that was not the site's original function, as the tomb is 1,000 years newer than the site itself.
* [[Dakhma]] – Archaeologist Rami Arav suggests the site was used like the Dakhmas of the Zoroastrians, in which dead persons were laid out for birds to remove the flesh from their bones.&lt;ref name="Israel's answer" /&gt;
* Calendar - Some believe the site was used as an ancient [[calendar]]. At the times of the two [[equinox]]es, the sun's rays would pass between two rocks, 2m in height, 5m in width, at the eastern edge of the compound.  According to Anthony Aveni and Yonatan Mizrachi the entrance to the center opens on sunrise of the summer solstice. Other notches in the walls indicate the spring and fall equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm Ancient Archaeoastronomy in the Golan Heights]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Astronomical observations - Perhaps the site was used for [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations of the [[constellation]]s, probably for [[Religion|religious]] calculations. Researchers found the site was built with dimensions and scales common for other period structures, and partly based on the stars' positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm Ancient Astronomy at Rujm el-Hiri: Star Watching in Ancient Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
In 2007, the site was excavated by Yosef Garfinkel and Michael Freikman of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Freikman returned in the summer of 2010 for further investigation of the site's date and function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digs.bib-arch.org/digs/rujm-el-hiri.asp Rujm el Hiri, Israel – Find a dig]&lt;/ref&gt; Freikman believes that the tomb in the center was built at the same time as the rings. Tomb robbers looted the remains, which included jewelry and weapons, but based on the discovery of one Chalcolithic pin dropped in a passageway, Freikman's theory is that the tomb was the centerpiece of the rings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britam.org/megaliths/MT14.html Brit-Am Megalithic Bulletin Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Age]] movements advocating a return to nature gather at the site on the summer [[solstice]] and on the equinox to view the first rays of the sun shine though the rocks. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12537">A '''samarium–cobalt (SmCo)''' magnet, a type of [[rare earth magnet]], is a strong [[permanent magnet]] made of an [[alloy]] of [[samarium]] and [[cobalt]].  They were developed in the early 1960s based on work done by Karl Strnat and Alden Ray at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] and the [[University of Dayton]], respectively.  In particular, Strnat and Ray developed the first formulation of SmCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dayton Contributes to the History of Magnetic Mateials|url=https://www.udri.udayton.edu/News/1999/Pages/DaytonContributestotheHistoryofMagneticMaterials.aspx|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Research and Development of Rare Earth Transition Metal Alloys as Permanent Magnet Materials, '''AD-750 746''' Alden E. Ray, et al, August 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  They are generally ranked similarly in strength to [[neodymium magnet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2012_08/pr1601.htm|title=Toshiba : Press Release (16 Aug, 2012): Toshiba Develops Dysprosium-free Samarium-Cobalt Magnet to Replace Heat-resistant Neodymium Magnet in Essential Applications|website=www.toshiba.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have higher temperature ratings and higher [[coercivity]].  They are brittle, and prone to cracking and chipping.  Samarium–cobalt magnets have maximum energy products (BH&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) that range from 16 [[Oersted#Stored energy|megagauss-oersteds (MG&amp;middot;Oe)]] to 33 MG·Oe, that is approx. 128 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 264 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; their theoretical limit is 34 MG·Oe, about 272 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  They are available in two "series", namely Series 1:5 and Series 2:17.

Sintered Samarium Cobalt magnets exhibit magnetic [[anisotropy]], meaning they can only be magnetized in the axis of their magnetic orientation. This is done by aligning the crystal structure of the material during the manufacturing process.

==Series 1:5==

These samarium–cobalt magnet alloys (generally written as SmCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, or SmCo Series 1:5) have one atom of rare earth samarium per five atoms of cobalt.  By weight this magnet alloy will typically contain 36% samarium with the balance cobalt.  The energy products of these samarium–cobalt alloys range from 16 MG·Oe to 25 MG·Oe, that is, approx. 128&amp;ndash;200 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  These samarium–cobalt magnets generally have a [[Temperature coefficient#Reversible temperature coefficient|reversible temperature coefficient]] of -0.05%/°C.  Saturation magnetization can be achieved with a moderate magnetizing field.  This series of magnet is easier to calibrate to a specific magnetic field than the SmCo 2:17 series magnets.

In the presence of a moderately strong magnetic field, unmagnetized magnets of this series will try to align their orientation axis to the magnetic field, thus becoming slightly magnetized.  This can be an issue if postprocessing requires that the magnet be plated or coated.  The slight field that the magnet picks up can attract debris during the plating or coating process, causing coating failure or a mechanically out-of-tolerance condition.

===Reversible temperature coefficient===

''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' drifts with temperature and it is one of the important characteristics of magnet performance.  Some applications, such as inertial gyroscopes and travelling wave tubes (TWTs), need to have constant field over a wide temperature range.  The reversible temperature coefficient (RTC) of ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as
:(∆B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) x (1/∆T)  &amp;times; 100%.

To address these requirements, temperature compensated magnets were developed in the late 1970s. For conventional SmCo magnets, ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' decreases as temperature increases.  Conversely, for GdCo magnets, ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases as temperature increases within certain temperature ranges. By combining samarium and gadolinium in the alloy, the temperature coefficient can be reduced to nearly zero.

===Coercivity mechanism===

SmCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; magnets have a very high [[coercivity]] (coercive force); that is, they are not easily demagnetized.  They are fabricated by packing wide-grain lone-domain magnetic powders. All of the [[magnetic domain]]s are aligned with the easy axis direction. In this case, all of the domain walls are at 180 degrees. When there are no impurities, the reversal process of the bulk magnet is equivalent to lone-domain motes, where coherent rotation is the dominant mechanism. However, due to the imperfection of fabricating, impurities may be introduced in the magnets, which form nuclei. In this case, because the impurities may have lower anisotropy or misaligned easy axes, their directions of magnetization are easier to spin, which breaks the 180° domain wall configuration. In such materials, the coercivity is controlled by nucleation. To obtain much coercivity, impurity control is critical in the fabrication process.

==Series 2:17==
These alloys (written as Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;, or SmCo Series 2:17) are age-hardened with a composition of two atoms of rare-earth samarium per 13–17 atoms of transition metals (TM). The TM content is rich in cobalt, but contains other elements such as iron and copper. Other elements like [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], and such may be added in small quantities to achieve better heat treatment response. By weight, the alloy will generally contain 25% of samarium. The maximum energy products of these alloys range from 20 to 32 MGOe, what is about 160-260 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These alloys have the best reversible temperature coefficient of all rare-earth alloys, typically being -0.03%/°C. The "second generation" materials can also be used at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Nanocomposite Sm-Co melt spun ribbons&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coercivity mechanism===
In Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; magnets, the coercivity mechanism is based on [[Domain wall (magnetism)#Depinning of a domain wall|domain wall pinning]]. Impurities inside the magnets impede the domain wall motion and thereby resist the [[magnetization reversal]] process. To increase the coercivity, impurities are intentionally added during the fabrication process.

==Machining samarium–cobalt==

The alloys are typically machined in the unmagnetized state.  Samarium–cobalt should be ground using a wet grinding process (water-based coolants) and a diamond grinding wheel.  The same type of process is required if drilling holes or other features that are confined.  The grinding waste produced must not be allowed to completely dry as samarium–cobalt has a low ignition point.  A small spark, such as that produced with static electricity, can easily commence combustion.  The fire produced will be extremely hot and difficult to control.

==Production==
The reduction/melt method and reduction/diffusion method are used to manufacture samarium–cobalt magnets. The reduction/melt method will be described since it is used for both SmCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; production. The raw materials are melted in an induction furnace filled with argon gas. The mixture is cast into a mold and cooled with water to form an ingot. The ingot is pulverized and the particles are further milled to further reduce the particle size. The resulting powder is pressed in a die of desired shape, in a magnetic field to orient the magnetic field of the particles. Sintering is applied at a temperature of 1100˚C–1250˚C, followed by solution treatment at 1100˚C–1200˚C and tempering is finally performed on the magnet at about 700˚C–900˚C.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} It then is ground and further magnetized to increase its magnetic properties. The finished product is tested, inspected and packed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Hazards==

*Samarium–cobalt magnets can easily chip; eye protection must be worn when handling them.
*Allowing magnets to snap together can cause the magnets to shatter, which can cause a potential hazard.
*Samarium–cobalt is manufactured by a process called [[sintering]], and as with all sintered materials, inherent cracks are very possible.  These magnets do not have mechanical integrity; instead the magnet must be used for its magnetic functions and other mechanical systems must be designed to provide the mechanical reliability of the system.

==Attributes==

*Extremely resistant to demagnetization
*Good temperature stability (maximum use temperatures between {{convert|250|C|K}} and {{convert|550|C|K}}; Curie temperatures from {{convert|700|C|K}} to {{convert|800|C|K}}
*Expensive and subject to price fluctuations (cobalt is market price sensitive)

'''[[Solar energy]]''' is widely available in [[Armenia]] due to its geographical position and is considered a developing industry.

According to the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/416|title=Արևային էներգետիկա - էներգետիկա - www.minenergy.am|last=|first=|date=|website=www.minenergy.am|publisher=Ministry Of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources Of The Republic Of Armenia|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia has an average of about 1720 [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh) solar energy flow per square meter of horizontal surface annually and has a potential of 1000 MW power production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Energy|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/416|website=Ministry of Energy of Armenia|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital [[Yerevan]], the average solar energy flux is equal to 1642 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gea.am/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Արևային-կայանների-կիրառումը.pdf|title=Արևային-կայանների-կիրառումը|last=|first=|date=August 2016|website=gea.am|publisher=Green Energy Association|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia's area cannot be considered as homogeneous from the perspective of available solar energy: the difference between the amount of solar energy reaching the ground in different places in the country can be up to 20% in the summer time, and 50% in the winter time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The use of solar energy in Armenia is increasing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example is the [[American University of Armenia]] (AUA). According to [[International Network for Sustainable Energy]], solar panels were installed on the rooftop of [[American University of Armenia]] in 1999-2002. Also, AUA has solar heaters, which are used to heat up auditoriums, and supply hot water during cold periods. Another example is the [[United Nations in Armenia|United Nations]] House in Armenia. Its building also uses solar power energy.

== Photovoltaics ==
[[File:Արևային վահանակներ.jpg|thumb|Solar panels on the rooftop of [[American University of Armenia]]]]
The PV system ([[Photovoltaics]]) is used in many countries including Armenia. There are a number of buildings equipped with solar panels, such as the [[American University of Armenia]] generating enough power for the elevators and other uses, and the UN House in Armenia, as well as other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contact-a.am/activity.html|title=Photovoltaics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.contact-a.am|publisher=Contact-A, LLC|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are set tariffs for generating electricity using solar energy. In November 2016, Public Services Regulatory Commission of RA made a decision to set the price of electrical energy from photovoltaic systems to 42.645 [[Armenian dram|AMD]]/kWh. The public can use solar panels of up to 150 kWh power, and any surplus can be sold to [[Electric Networks of Armenia]] (ENA). In addition, there are no taxes nor licenses required. By doing so, the Armenian government is trying to encourage its citizens to use renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.am/arm/news/360517.html|title=Արեւային էներգիայի համար սահմանվել է սակագին|last=|first=|date=2 December 2016|website=news.am|publisher=NEWS.am|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal solar ==
[[File:Արևային ջեռուցիչ.jpg|thumb|Solar water heating system on the rooftop of American University of Armenia with maximum capacity of 35 kW]]
In Armenia, [[solar thermal collector]]s, or water-heaters, are produced in standard sizes (1.38-4.12 square meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/416|title=Արևային էներգետիկա - էներգետիկա - www.minenergy.am|last=|first=|date=|website=www.minenergy.am|publisher=Ministry Of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources Of The Republic Of Armenia|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar water-heaters can be used for space heating, solar cooling, etc. In order to generate heat, they use solar energy from the Sun. Modern solar water֊heaters can cause water to boil even in winter․&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Solar thermal collectors are used throughout the territory of Armenia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armeniasolar.com/arm/solar|title=Արևային ջրատաքացուցիչներ {{!}} Armenia Solar|last=|first=|date=|website=armeniasolar.com|publisher=|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One building using solar thermal collectors is AUA, which uses solar cooling and ventilation systems. The biggest solar water-heater in Armenia is located at Diana hotel in [[Goris]], which has 1900 vacuum tubes that provide hot water for a swimming pool with 180 cubic meter volume, and for 40 hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shtigen.com/%D5%A3%D5%B8%D6%80%D5%AB%D5%BD-%D5%A1%D6%80%D6%87%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%AB%D5%B6-%D5%BB%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%BF%D5%A1%D6%84%D5%A1%D6%81%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%B9/|title=Ամենախոշոր արևային ջրատաքացուցիչ Հայաստանում {{!}} Շտիգեն|last=|first=|date=|website=shtigen.com|publisher=SHTIGEN|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solar companies ==
The main companies that operate in this sector in Armenia are Arpi Solar Ltd, Simartek (in partnership with Solitek Armenia), ArtClima, General Electric Lighting Armenia (Rubinar LLC), Elips Technoline, Hatuk Santekhmontazh CJSC (SanHit Specialized Shop), Shtigen, Technoeco, Solaron (local PV panel manufacturer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.construction.am/suppliers.php?act=equipment&amp;miniact=Solar%20Energy%20Equipment|title=Armenia Construction Portal|last=|first=|date=|website=www.construction.am|publisher=Construction Portal Armenia|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
One of the main factors preventing the development of solar energy in Armenia is the installation cost. The price for a [[Photovoltaics|solar photo-voltaic]] power plant per 1&amp;nbsp;kW is very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/am/news/2013/07/11/s-manukyan/481239|title=Այլընտրանքային էներգետիկայի հեռանկարների մասին|last=|first=|date=11 July 2016|website=www.panorama.am|publisher=Panorama.am|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy''' (SACOME) is the industry body representing companies with interests in the South Australian minerals, energy, extractive, and oil &amp; gas sectors, including those who provide services to these companies. SACOME is a not-for-profit, non-government organisation founded in 1979, and comprises a small team serving the needs of approximately 200 member organisations. SACOME are governed by a council that oversees organisational priorities and policy direction and are guided by many committees that focus on specific aspects of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sacome.org.au/about-us.html|title=About Us |website=South Australian Chamber of Mines &amp; Energy |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years the organisation has published a number of regular periodicals  including the ''SA Mines and Energy journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/33719586 |title = SA Mines and Energy Journal |accessdate = 2015-01-21 |website = National Library of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been the subject of several feature articles in the resources sector magazine ''Australia's Paydirt'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=183902721742320;res=IELBUS |title = SACOME as you are |date = 2011-04-01 |accessdate = 2015-01-21 |website = Informit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=173039699498790;res=IELBUS |title = SACOME snapshot |date = 2011-06-01 |accessdate = 2015-01-21 |website = Informit }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently has released ''SACOME Priorities: State Election 2018''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/fullscreen/59753877/sacome-priorities-state-election-2018 |title= State Election Journal |website=National Library of Australia |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SACOME were founded in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sacome.org.au/about-us.html |title=About Us |website = South Australian Chamber of Mines &amp; Energy |access-date= 2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dirt TV awards ==
In 2014, SACOME launched Dirt TV, a competition to encourage school students in years 7 to 12 to produce short videos creatively promoting the resources sector. The inaugural award was won by high school students James Haskard and Daniel Blake of [[Concordia College (South Australia)|Concordia College]]. 14 entries were received and resource company sponsors provided a total prize pool of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/cheeky-mining-video-wins-concordia-students-inaugural-sacome-dirt-tv-award/story-fni6uma6-1227071173071|title = Cheeky mining video wins Concordia students inaugural SACOME Dirt TV award|last = Russell|first = Christopher|date = 2014-09-26|work = |access-date = 2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==

=== Port Bonython ===
SACOME believes that the growth of [[iron ore]] mining in South Australia has been limited by the state's lack of bulk commodities port infrastructure. In 2011, SACOME's CEO Jason Kuchel publicly supported the chosen location for a future 3&amp;nbsp;km iron ore export wharf at [[Port Bonython]], northeast of [[Whyalla]] in South Australia's upper [[Spencer Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/sacome-chief-jason-kuchel-says-failure-in-providing-necessary-port-infrastructure/story-e6fredel-1226038026016|title = SACOME chief Jason Kuchel says failure in providing necessary port infrastructure|last = England|first = Cameron|date = 2011-04-13|work = |access-date = 2015-01-22|newspaper = The Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location is controversial due to its close proximity to breeding reef for the Northern Spencer Gulf population of [[Sepia apama|giant Australian cuttlefish]]. The proposed port's potential environmental impact has been challenged by community groups including [[Save Point Lowly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/detailed-study-of-port-bonython-impact/story-e6fredel-1226446993766|title = Detailed study of Port Bonython impact|last = Changerathil|first = Valerina|date = 2012-08-10|work = |access-date = 2015-01-22|newspaper = The Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Alternative Port Working Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.whyallanewsonline.com.au/story/1519906/working-party-says-act-now/|title = Working party says 'act now'|last = Opie|first = Rebecca|date = 2014-05-22|work = |access-date = 2015-01-22|newspaper = Whyalla News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then other locations have been considered including the [[Iron Road Limited]] proposal at Cape Hardy on the [[Eyre Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-03/iron-road-project-approved-for-sas-eyre-peninsula/8492924 Iron Road project approved for South Australia's Eyre Peninsula] ''ABC News'', 3 May 2017. Retrieved 31 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear power ===
SACOME supports the future development of nuclear power in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sacome.org.au/images/stories/Nuclear_Series_SA_Mines__Energy_Journal.pdf|title = Nuclear series|date = 2012|accessdate = 2014-10-16|website = SA Mines &amp; Energy Journal|publisher = South Australian Chamber of Mines &amp; Energy|last = Brook|first = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/south-australian-s-positive-about-nuclear-power-sa|title = South Australians positive about nuclear power: SACOME|date = 2014-03-31|accessdate = 2014-10-16|website = Mining Australia|publisher = |last = Validakis|first = Vicky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its members are several companies actively involved in [[uranium mining]] and exploration.

'''''Synopses of the British Fauna''''' is a series of identification guides, published by [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] and [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]]. Each volume in the series provides and in-depth analysis of a group of animals and is designed to bridge the gap between the standard [[field guide]] and more specialised [[monograph]] or [[treatise]]. The series is now published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] on behalf of The Linnean Society and The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association. 

The series is designed for use in the field and is kept as user friendly as possible with [[technical terminology]] kept to a minimum and a glossary of terms provided, although the complexity of the subject matter makes the books more suitable for the more experienced practitioner.

[[File:Sea Spiders.gif|right|frame|Cover of Sea-Spiders (2010)]]

== History of the series ==

On 11 March 1943, at a meeting of [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] in Burlington House, TH Savoy presented his "Synopsis of the Opiliones" (Harvestmen). It was so well received that a decision was made there and then to publish it as the first of a series of "ecological fauna lists".

Re-launched by Dr Doris Kermack in the mid-1960s, the New Series of ''Synopses of the British Fauna'' went from strength to strength. From number 13, the series had been jointly sponsored by [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]] and Dr RSK Barnes became co-editor.

From 1993, the series has been published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] and benefits from association with the extensive testing undertaken as part of the [[AIDGAP]] project.

== Volumes ==

The series contains the following volumes, many of which are out of print. Many of the volumes have been updated and reprinted under slightly different names to reflect either [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] changes or advances in the understanding of a group.

It is used in the research laboratory to prepare lipophilic salts of inorganic anions.  Relative to [[tetraethylammonium]] derivatives, tetrabutylammonium salts are more lipophilic but crystallize less readily.

==Derivatives==
Some tetrabutylammonium salts of simple anions include:
*[[tetrabutylammonium fluoride]], a [[desilylation]] reagent.
*[[tetrabutylammonium bromide]], a precursor to other tetrabutylammonium salts via [[salt metathesis reaction]]s.
*[[tetrabutylammonium hydroxide]], a precursor to other tetrabutylammonium salts via acid-base reactions.
*[[tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate]], an electrolyte for nonaqueous electrochemistry.

[[File:Taschentuch.JPG|thumb|Tissue paper sheet]]

==Properties==
Key properties are absorbency, basis [[weight]], thickness, bulk (specific volume), brightness, stretch, appearance and comfort. Tissues are also napkins.

==Production==
{{Main article|Fourdrinier machine}}
Tissue paper is produced on a [[Fourdrinier machine|paper machine]] that has a single large steam heated drying cylinder ([[Yankee dryer]]) fitted with a hot air hood. The raw material is [[paper pulp]]. The Yankee cylinder is sprayed with [[adhesives]] to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's [[doctor blade]] that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the Yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 75–92|chapter= 3|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest water absorbing applications are produced with a [[through air drying]] (TAD) process. These papers contain high amounts of [[NBSK]] and CTMP. This gives a bulky paper with high wet tensile  strength and good water holding capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, WI, USA | pages = 44–46 | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TAD process uses about twice the energy compared with conventional drying of paper.

The properties are controlled by [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] quality, [[crêpe paper|crêping]] and additives (both in base paper and as coating). The [[wet strength]] is often an important parameter for tissue.

==Applications==
===Hygienic tissue paper===
[[File:ティッシュ配布 (1425231601).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tissue-pack marketing]]]]
Hygienic tissue paper is commonly used for facial tissue (paper handkerchiefs), [[napkins]], bathroom tissue and household towels. Paper has been used for hygiene purposes for centuries, but tissue paper as we know it today was not produced in the [[United States]] before the mid-1940s. In [[Western Europe]] large scale industrial production started in the beginning of the 1960s.

===Facial tissues===
{{Main article|Facial tissue}}
[[File:Tissues.JPG|thumb|200px|A box of facial tissues]]
Facial tissue (paper handkerchiefs) refers to a class of soft, absorbent, disposable paper that is suitable for use on the face. The term is commonly used to refer to the type of facial tissue, usually sold in boxes, that is designed to facilitate the expulsion of nasal mucus although it may refer to other types of facial tissues including napkins and wipes.

The first tissue handkerchiefs were introduced in the 1920s. They have been refined over the years, especially for softness and strength, but their basic design has remained constant. Today each person in Western Europe uses about 200 tissue handkerchiefs a year, with a variety of 'alternative' functions including the treatment of minor wounds, the cleaning of face and hands and the cleaning of spectacles.&lt;ref name=ETS1&gt;European Tissue Symposium. [http://www.europeantissue.com/tissueathome/innovations/ "Tissue Product Properties"], Retrieved on 2010-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the paper tissue on minimising the spread of an infection has been highlighted in light of fears over a swine flu epidemic. In the UK, for example, the Government ran a campaign called “Catch it, bin it, kill it”, which encouraged people to cover their mouth with a paper tissue when coughing or sneezing.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_080839 "Respiratory and hand hygiene guidance"], retrieved on 2009-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper towels===
{{Main article|Paper towel}}
Paper towels are the second largest application for tissue paper in the [[consumer sector]]. This type of paper has usually a basis weight of 20 to 24 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Normally such paper towels are two-ply. This kind of tissue can be made from 100% [[chemical pulp]] to 100% [[deinked pulp|recycled fibre]] or a combination of the two. Normally, some long fibre chemical pulp is included to improve strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 80 |pages= |chapter= 3|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrapping tissue===
{{Main article|Wrapping tissue}}
Wrapping tissue is a type of thin, translucent tissue [[paper]] used for wrapping/packing various articles &amp; cushioning fragile items.

Custom-printed wrapping tissue is becoming a popular trend for boutique retail businesses.{{fact|date=November 2018}} There are various on-demand custom printed wrapping tissue paper available online. Sustainably printed custom tissue wrapping paper are printed on [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified, acid-free paper; and only use soy-based inks.

===Toilet tissue===
{{Main article|Toilet paper}}
Rolls of toilet paper have been available since the end of the 19th century. Today, more than 20 billion rolls of toilet tissue are used each year in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=ETS1/&gt;

===Table napkins===
[[Napkin|Table napkins]] can be made of tissue paper. These are made from one up to four plies and in a variety of qualities, sizes, folds, colours and patterns depending on intended use and prevailing fashions. The composition of raw materials varies a lot from [[deinked pulp|deinked]] to [[chemical pulp]] depending on quality.

Colored paper napkins can be a source of [[carcinogenic]] primary [[aromatic amine]]s (''paA''s) when used as a wrapper for food as a result of degradation of [[Azo compound]]s used as paper dyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Azo compounds#European regulation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic disrupter ===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a sound recording engineer named [[Bob Clearmountain]] was said to have hung tissue paper over the tweeter of his pair of [[Yamaha NS-10]] speakers to tame the over-bright treble coming from it.&lt;ref name=20100915gizmodo&gt; Gardiner, Bryan (15 September 2010). [https://gizmodo.com/5637077/yamahas-ns+10-the-most-important-speaker-youve-never-heard-of "Yamaha's NS-10: The Most Important Speaker You've Never Heard Of"]. Gizmodo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mix1&gt;[http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/1977_yamaha_ns10M_speakers/ 1977 Yamaha NS-10M Speakers|Mix Inducts the Yamaha NS10M Speakers into the TECnology Hall of Fame]. ''Mix'' (28 August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;PR Newell, KR Holland &amp; JP Newell. [http://www.soundonsound.com/pdfs/ns10m.pdf "The Yamaha NS10M: Twenty Years a Reference Monitor. Why?"]. Report commissioned by ''Sound on Sound'', Institute of Acoustics (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon became the subject of hot debate and an investigation into the sonic effects of many different types of tissue paper.&lt;ref name=mix1/&gt;&lt;ref name=hodas&gt;Bob Hodas. [http://www.bobhodas.com/examining-the-yamaha-ns-10m.php "Examining the Yamaha NS-10M 'Tissue Paper Phenomenon' – An Analysis of the Industry-Wide Practice of Using a Tissue-Paper Layer to Reduce High-Frequency Output"]. ''Recording Engineer/Producer Magazine'', February 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of a study for ''Studio Sound'' magazine suggested that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter.&lt;ref name=twenty/&gt; Another tissue study found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as "[[comb filter]]ing", where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. The author derided the tissue practice as "aberrant behavior", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects, suggesting that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable.&lt;ref name = hodas/&gt;

===Road repair===
Tissue paper, in the form of standard single-ply [[toilet paper]], is commonly used in road repair to protect crack sealants. The sealants require upwards of 40 minutes to cure enough to not stick onto passing traffic. The application of toilet paper removes the stickiness and keeps the tar in place, allowing the road to be reopened immediately and increasing road repair crew productivity. The paper breaks down and disappears in the following days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aguilar |first=John |date=2016-11-03 |title=Littleton TP’s its own streets as a way to fill its cracks — single-ply only |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/03/littleton-tps-its-own-streets-as-a-way-to-fill-its-cracks-single-ply-only/ |work=The Denver Post |location=Denver, Colorado |access-date=2017-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Salter |first=Peter |date=2014-12-31 |title=City crews hitting the streets with single-ply toilet paper |url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/city-crews-hitting-the-streets-with-single-ply-toilet-paper/article_f4040a8a-dbc0-54e2-b8e8-76e0ef9153d0.html |work=Lincoln Journal-Star |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |access-date=2017-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use has been credited to [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] employee Fred Muellerleile, who came up with the idea in 1970 after initially trying standard office paper, which worked, but did not disintegrate easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ojanpa |first=Brian |date=2011-08-12 |title=Road T.P. was his idea that stuck |url=http://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/ojanpa-road-t-p-was-his-idea-that-stuck/article_e5c669e7-5405-5e7e-835f-0c499d442592.html |work=Mankato Free Press |location=Mankato, Minnesota |access-date=2017-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packing industry===
Apart from above, a range of speciality tissues are also manufactured to be used in the [[packing industry]]. These are used for wrapping/packing various items, cushioning fragile items, stuffing in shoes/bags etc. to keep shape intact or, for inserting in garments etc. while packing/folding to keep them wrinkle free and safe. It is generally used printed with the manufacturers brand name or, logo to enhance the look and aesthetic appeal of the product. It is a type of thin, translucent [[paper]] generally in the range of [[grammage]]s between 17 and 40 GSM, that can be rough or, shining, hard or soft, depending upon the nature of use.

==The industry==
In North America, people are consuming around three times as much tissue as in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;European Tissue Symposium [http://www.europeantissue.com/item.aspx?id=44 "Facts and Figures"]. Retrieved on 2009-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the world's estimated production of {{convert|21|e6t}} of tissue, Europe produces approximately {{convert|6|e6t}}.&lt;ref&gt;European Tissue Symposium [http://www.europeantissue.com/about/profile-of-ets/ "Profile of the ETS"]. Retrieved on 2010-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The European tissue market is worth approximately 10 billion Euros annually and is growing at a rate of around 3%. The European market represents around 23% of the global market. Of the total paper and board market tissue accounts for 10%. An analysis and market research in Europe, Germany was one of the top tissue-consuming countries in Western Europe while Sweden was on top of the per-capita consumption of tissue paper in Western Europe. 
Market Study.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://beirutlights.com/en/western-european-tissue-consumption-by-country Western European Tissue Consumption]'', 2010 - 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the industry is represented by the ''European Tissue Symposium'' (ETS), a [[trade association]]. The members of ETS represent the majority of tissue paper producers throughout Europe and about 90% of total European tissue production. ETS was founded in 1971 and is based in [[Brussels]] since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;European Tissue Symposium [http://www.europeantissue.com/about/ "ETS: About Us"]. Retrieved on 2010-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the tissue industry is organized in the [[AF&amp;PA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afandpa.org/our-products/tissue Tissue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tissue paper production and consumption is predicted to continue to [[economic growth|grow]] because of factors like [[urbanization]], increasing [[disposable income]]s and [[consumer spending]]. In 2015, the global market for tissue paper is growing at per annum rates between 8-9% (China, currently 40% of global market) and 2-3% (Europe).&lt;ref name=paperindustryworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperindustryworld.com/is-tissue-becoming-a-safe-haven-for-the-global-pulp-and-paper-industry/|title=Is tissue becoming a safe haven for the global pulp and paper industry?

==Sustainability==
{{further|Environmental impact of paper}}
{{see also|Toilet paper#Environmental considerations}}
The [[paper industry]] in general has a long history of accusations for being responsible for global [[deforestation]] through legal and [[illegal logging]]. The WWF has urged [[Asia Pulp &amp; Paper]] (APP), "one of the world's most notorious deforesters" especially in [[Sumatra]]n [[rain forest]]s, to become an environmentally responsible company; in 2012, the WWF launched a campaign to remove a brand of [[toilet paper]] known to be made from APP fiber from grocery store shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does your toilet paper cause rain forest destruction?|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/don-t-flush-tiger-forests|publisher=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], the world [[per capita]] consumption of toilet paper was 3.8 kilograms in 2005. The WWF estimates that "every day, about 270,000 trees are flushed down the drain or end up as garbage all over the world", a rate of which about 10% are attributable to toilet paper alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6403 Flushing Forests | Worldwatch Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/how_you_can_help/live_green/fsc/tissue_issues/ Don’t flush forests down the toilet | WWF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the paper tissue industry, along with the rest of the paper manufacturing sector, has worked to minimise its [[environmental impact|impact on the environment]]. Recovered fibres now represent some 46.5% of the paper industry's raw materials. The industry relies heavily on [[biofuel]]s (about 50% of its primary energy). Its specific primary energy consumption has decreased by 16% and the [[specific electricity consumption]] has decreased by 11%, due to measures such as improved process technology and investment in [[combined heat and power]] (CHP). Specific [[carbon dioxide emissions]] from [[fossil fuel]]s decreased by 25% due to process-related measures and the increased use of low-carbon and biomass fuels. Once consumed, most forest-based paper products start a new life as recycled material or biofuel&lt;ref&gt;Paper Online [http://www.paperonline.org/environment "Environmental Issues" ] Retrieved on 2010-02-04&lt;/ref&gt;

EDANA, the [[trade body]] for the non-woven absorbent hygiene products industry (which includes products such as household wipes for use in the home) has reported annually on the industry’s environmental performance since 2005. Less than 1% of all commercial wood production ends up as wood pulp in absorbent hygiene products. The industry contributes less than 0.5% of all solid waste and around 2% of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) compared with paper and board, garden waste and food waste which each comprise between 18 and 20 percent of MSW.&lt;ref&gt;European Disposables and Nonwoven Association [http://www.edana.org/content/default.asp?PageID=82 "Sustainability and Absorbent Hygiene Products" ]  Retrieved on 2009-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a great deal of interest, in particular, in the use of recovered fibres to manufacture new tissue paper products. However, whether this is actually better for the environment than using new fibres is open to question. A Life Cycle Assessment study indicated that neither fibre type can be considered environmentally preferable. In this study both new fibre and recovered fibre offer environmental benefits and shortcomings.

Total environmental impacts vary case by case, depending on for example the location of the tissue paper mill, availability of fibres close to the mill, energy options and waste utilization possibilities. There are opportunities to minimise environmental impacts when using each fibre type.

When using recovered fibres, it is beneficial to:
* Source fibres from integrated [[deinking]] operations to eliminate the need for thermal drying of fibre or long distance transport of wet pulp,
* Manage deinked sludge in order to maximise beneficial applications and minimise waste burden on society; and
* Select the recovered paper depending on the end-product requirements and that also allows the most efficient recycling process.
When using new fibres, it is beneficial to:
* Manage the raw material sources to maintain legal, sustainable forestry practices by implementing processes such as [[certified wood|forest certification]] systems and chain of custody standards; and
* Consider opportunities to introduce new and more renewable energy sources and increase the use of biomass fuels to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.
When using either fibre type, it is beneficial to:
* Improve energy efficiency in tissue manufacturing;
* Examine opportunities for changing to alternative, non fossil based sources, of [[energy]] for tissue manufacturing operations
* Deliver products that maximise functionality and optimize consumption; and
* Investigate opportunities for alternative product disposal systems that minimize the environmental impact of used products.&lt;ref&gt;European Tissue Symposium [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/081126-ETS%20PP%20sustainbable%20use%20New%20%20Recovered%20Fibre.pdf "Sustainable Use of New and Recovered Fibre Types"] Retrieved on 2009-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Confederation of European Paper Industries]] (CEPI) has published reports focusing on the industry’s environmental credentials. In 2002, it noted that “a little over 60% of the pulp and paper produced in Europe comes from mills certified under one of the internationally recognised [[eco-management]] schemes”.&lt;ref&gt;Paper Online [http://www.paperonline.org/environment/combating-climate-change "Environmental Reports"] Retrieved on 2010-02-04&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of ‘eco-labels’ designed to help consumers identify paper tissue products which meet such environmental standards. Eco-labelling entered mainstream environmental policy-making in the late seventies, first with national schemes such as the German Blue Angel programme, to be followed by the Nordic Swan (1989). In 1992 a European eco-labelling regulation, known as the EU Flower, was also adopted. The stated objective is to support sustainable development, balancing environmental, social and economical criteria.

===Types of eco-labels===
There are three types of [[eco-label]]s, each defined by ISO (International Organization for Standardization).

'''Type I: ISO 14024'''
This type of eco-label is one where the criteria are set by third parties (not the manufacturer). They are in theory based on life cycle impacts and are typically based on pass/fail criteria. The one that has European application is the EU Flower.

'''Type II: ISO 14021'''
These are based on the manufacturers or retailers own declarations. Well known amongst these are claims of “100% recycled” in relation to tissue/paper.

'''Type III: ISO 14025'''
These claims give quantitative details of the impact of the product based on its life cycle. Sometimes known as EPDs ([[Environmental Product Declaration]]s), these labels are based on an independent review of the life cycle of the product.
