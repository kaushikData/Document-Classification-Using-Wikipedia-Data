The '''2010 World Geothermal Congress''' took place between April 25-30, 2010 in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. It was called the world's biggest [[geothermal energy]] [[business conference|conference]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8643326.stm Karishma Vaswani:''Indonesia hosts world's biggest geothermal energy forum'', BBC News, 25 April 2010], retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The World Geothermal Congress is organized every five years by the [[International Geothermal Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/issue38_12.htm United Nations University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615003541/http://update.unu.edu/issue38_12.htm |date=2010-06-15 }}, retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The previous three conferences took place in [[Florence]], Italy (1995), Beppu-Morioka, Japan (2000) and [[Antalya]], Turkey (2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geothermal-energy.org/331,world_geothermal_congress_-_the_history.html International Geothermal Association: World Geothermal Congress - the history], retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bali Conference==
Attendees from 80 countries&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; were discussing better ways to develop [[geothermal power]] as an [[environmentally friendly]] [[energy source]] which can be harnessed in the future for less cost than it is today.

The Summit was opened by Indonesian president, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] at [[Westin Hotels|Westin Hotel]], [[Nusa Dua]], Bali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/ekbis/2010/04/26/brk,20100426-243273,uk.html Tempo], retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The opening was marked by the signing of 12 geothermal-related contracts worth in the range of US$5 billion. Among the contracts were agreements between the Indonesian state power firm [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara|PT PLN]] and PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) - a geothermal business branch of state oil and gas company [[Pertamina|PT Pertamina]] - to develop four geothermal power plants in [[Sulawesi]] and [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://embassyofindonesia.it/5-billion-of-deals-signed-at-world-geothermal-congress/ Indonesian Embassy, Rome], retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress concluded with over 2,500 participants signing the Bali Declaration "Geothermal Energy to Change the World" during the closing ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esdm.go.id/index-en/50-geothermal/3346-bali-declaration-geothermal-energy-to-change-the-world.html Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesian] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520232752/http://esdm.go.id/index-en/50-geothermal/3346-bali-declaration-geothermal-energy-to-change-the-world.html# |date=2010-05-20 }}, retrieved 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Althorpe Islands Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] occupying the [[Althorpe Islands]], [[Haystack Island]] and [[Seal Island (Investigator Strait)|Seal Island]] in [[Investigator Strait]] near the town of [[Stenhouse Bay, South Australia|Stenhouse Bay]].  The conservation park was proclaimed in 1972 following the enactment of the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' with the protection initially applying to the Western Islets in the Althorpe Islands, Haystack Island and Seal Island with Althorpe Island itself was not added until 1997.  The purpose of the conservation  park is ‘to protect important wildlife habitat, particularly for sea-bird populations’.  It is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ia — Strict Nature Reserve|Category Ia protected area]].&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite book |title= Management Plan - Althorpe Islands, Goose Island and Troubridge Island Conservation Parks |author= |year=2009 |series= |publisher= Department of Environment &amp; Heritage |location=Adelaide |isbn= 978-1-921466-76-2 |pages=1, 2 &amp; 4|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/3fbcb962-2f67-4e9b-ae0d-9e4f00b16923/cons-gen-althorpe-goose-troubridge-parkmgmtplan-adopted.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox americium}}

'''Americium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Am''' and [[atomic number]] 95. It is radioactive and a [[transuranic element|transuranic]] member of the [[actinide]] series, in the [[periodic table]] located under the [[lanthanide]] element [[europium]], and thus by analogy was named after the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|date = 1946|pages = 379–386|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184|jstor = 1675046|bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] from [[Berkeley, California]], at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the [[University of Chicago]], a part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Although it is the third element in the [[transuranic element|transuranic series]], it was discovered fourth, after the heavier [[curium]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] being bombarded with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial [[ionization chamber]] [[smoke detectors]], as well as in [[neutron source]]s and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].

Americium is a relatively soft [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metal with silvery appearance. Its  [[Isotopes of americium|common isotopes]] are &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am. In chemical compounds, americium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified by their characteristic [[optical absorption]] spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contain small intrinsic radiogenic defects, due to [[metamictization]] induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles, which accumulates with time; this can cause a drift of some material properties over time, more noticeable in older samples.

==History==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, [[University of California, Berkeley]], in August 1939.]]
[[File:Americium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide (Am(OH)&lt;sub id="cite_ref-3"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)), produced in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fchp4.html |title=Demobilized Physics|journal=LBL NEWS Magazine|volume=6|issue=3|date= Fall 1981|page= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. They used a 60-inch [[cyclotron]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Morgan/morgan.html Obituary of Dr. Leon Owen (Tom) Morgan (1919–2002)], Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) of the [[University of Chicago]]. Following the lighter [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], and heavier [[curium]], americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the [[periodic table]] had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the [[lanthanide]] one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after the [[Americas]]: "The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series."&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G. T.; James, R.A. and Morgan, L. O.: "The New Element Americium (Atomic Number 95)", THIN PPR ''(National Nuclear Energy Series, Plutonium Project Record)'', ''Vol 14 B The Transuranium Elements: Research Papers'', Paper No. 22.1, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York, 1949. [http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0046&amp;numPages=43&amp;fp=N Abstract]; [http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0046.pdf Full text] (January 1948), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Street|first1=K.|last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.|title=The Isotopes of Americium|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.530|date=1950|page=530|volume=79|journal=Physical Review|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7073&amp;context=lbnl|issue=3|bibcode = 1950PhRv...79..530S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g1252"&gt;Greenwood, p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;

The new element was isolated from its [[oxide]]s in a complex, multi-step process. First [[plutonium]]-239 nitrate (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;PuNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]], and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]]. Further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]], yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Robert E. Krebs| title = The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide| edition = Second| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA322| date = 2006| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-33438-2| page = 322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pandemonium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|delirium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Am. [[Americium-241]] was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of two neutrons. It decays by emission of a [[alpha particle|α-particle]] to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np; the [[half-life]] of this decay was first determined as {{val|510|20}} years but then corrected to 432.2 years.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi |first1=G. |doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X |title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |date=1997 |page=1 |volume=624 |issue=1 |journal=Nuclear Physics A |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

: &lt;small&gt; The times are [[half-life|half-lives]]&lt;/small&gt;

The second isotope &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Upon rapid [[Beta-decay|β-decay]], &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts into the isotope of curium &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (which had been discovered previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which was close to the presently accepted value of 16.02 h.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]]; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children ''[[Quiz Kids]]'' five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate =7 July 2010| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of americium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, Glenn T. {{US patent|3156523}} "Element", Filing date: 23 August 1946, Issue date: 10 November 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity.

[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Americium was detected in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.

Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium;  but due to military secrecy, this result was not published until later, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.

In other regions, the average radioactivity of surface soil due to residual americium is only about 0.01&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|picocuries]]/g (0.37&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|mBq]]/g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name="am"&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Americium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716164652/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of various americium isotopes, mostly &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Klaus ''Kann man Gold machen?

Americium has been produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s for decades, and kilograms of its &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotopes have been accumulated by now.&lt;ref name="g1262"&gt;Greenwood, p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 [[United States dollar|USD]] per gram of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.&lt;ref name="smoke"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf57.html Smoke detectors and americium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112082137/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf57.html |date=12 November 2010 }}, World Nuclear Association, January 2009, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The heavier isotope &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;Hammond C.

Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

: &lt;chem&gt;^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{(n,\gamma)}] ^{239}_{92}U -&gt;[\beta^-][23.5 \ \ce{min}] ^{239}_{93}Np -&gt;[\beta^-][2.3565 \ \ce{d}] ^{239}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;

The capture of two neutrons by &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am:

: &lt;chem&gt;^{239}_{94}Pu -&gt;[\ce{2(n,\gamma)}] ^{241}_{94}Pu -&gt;[\beta^-][14.35 \ \ce{yr}] ^{241}_{95}Am&lt;/chem&gt;

The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref name="smoke"/&gt; However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu decays to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am after about 15 years, and the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bredl.org/sapc/Pu_ReportI.htm BREDL Southern Anti-Plutonium Campaign], Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The obtained &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a [[light water reactor]] (LWR), 79% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 10% to its [[nuclear isomer]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am:&lt;ref group=note&gt;The "metastable" state is marked by the letter m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3327/jnst.41.448 |author=Sasahara, A. |title=Neutron and Gamma Ray Source Evaluation of LWR High Burn-up UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MOX Spent Fuels |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |date=2004 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=448–456 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/41/4/448/_pdf |display-authors=etal |doi-access=free |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101119071142/http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/41/4/448/_pdf |archivedate=19 November 2010 }} [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/ article/200410/000020041004A0333355.php Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124010256/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/ |date=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
[[Americium-242]] has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu captures four neutrons under high [[neutron flux]]:

=== Metal generation ===
Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium can be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) is dissolved in [[nitric acid]], and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a [[PUREX]]-type extraction ('''P'''lutonium–'''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a [[hydrocarbon]]. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a [[diamide]]-based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatography|chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt; with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the [[solvent extraction]] of americium. For example, a 2003 [[European Union|EU]]-funded project codenamed "EUROPART" studied [[triazine]]s and other compounds as potential extraction agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Dalton Trans.]]|date = 2003|pages = 1675–1685|doi = 10.1039/b301178j|title = The coordination chemistry of 1,2,4-triazinyl bipyridines with lanthanide(III) elements – implications for the partitioning of americium(III)|author = Hudson, M.

==Physical properties==
[[File:Closest packing ABAC.png|thumb|Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red).]]

In the [[periodic table]], americium is located to the right of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide [[europium]], with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); but has a higher density than europium (5.264&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower [[bulk modulus]] than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu.&lt;ref name=pressure/&gt; Its melting point of 1173&amp;nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639&amp;nbsp;°C) and europium (826&amp;nbsp;°C), but lower than for curium (1340&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="AM_METALL2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=W.|title=Preparation and some properties of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=29|page=2577|date=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(67)80183-0|issue=10|last2=Wolf|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM_METALL2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AM_METALL4"/&gt;

At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal symmetry]], and a [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc with lattice parameters ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 346.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and ''c''&amp;nbsp;= 1124&amp;nbsp;pm, and four atoms per [[unit cell]]. The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium.&lt;ref name="Gmelin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AM_METALL4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McWhan|first1=D.

When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and lattice constant ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 489&amp;nbsp;pm. This ''fcc'' structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC.&lt;ref name="Gmelin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AM_METALL4"/&gt; Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa.&lt;ref name="pressure"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U.|title=Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=100|page=153|date=1984|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770&amp;nbsp;°C it changes into an ''fcc'' phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075&amp;nbsp;°C it converts to a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, [[praseodymium]] and [[neodymium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Young |first1= D. A. | title = Phase diagrams of the elements| url = https://books.google.com/?id=F2HVYh6wLBcC&amp;pg=PA226| date = 1991| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-91148-2| page = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced [[Interstitial defect|lattice defects]] is relatively low, by broadening of [[X-ray diffraction]] peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical [[resistivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U.|last2=Dufour|first2=C.|title=Low temperature lattice expansion of americium dioxide|journal=Physica B+C|volume=102|issue=1|page=303|date=1980|doi=10.1016/0378-4363(80)90178-3|bibcode = 1980PhyBC.102..303B }}&lt;/ref&gt; So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm to 10&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at [[liquid helium]] to 69&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and [[protactinium]], but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60&amp;nbsp;K followed by saturation.

Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in [[acid]]s. The most common [[oxidation state]] for americium is +3,&lt;ref name="p4"&gt;Penneman, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], [[iodate]], [[hydroxide]], [[phosphate]] and other salts.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|+}}; (yellow), Am&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|2+}} (brown) and Am&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|6|5-}} (dark green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie-master.de/FrameHandler.php?loc=http://www.chemie-master.de/pse/pse.php?modul=Am Americium], Das Periodensystem der Elemente für den Schulgebrauch (The periodic table of elements for schools) chemie-master.de (in German), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g1265"&gt;Greenwood, p. 1265&lt;/ref&gt; All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amoh4/&gt;&lt;ref name=carbonate/&gt; For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811&amp;nbsp;nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715&amp;nbsp;nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=haxav/&gt;

Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the [[permanganate]] ion ({{chem|MnO|4|-}}) in acidic solutions.&lt;ref name = "HOWI_1956"&gt;Wiberg, p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as [[americium dioxide]] (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[americium(IV) fluoride]] (AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

All [[pentavalent]] and [[hexavalent]] americium compounds are complex salts such as KAmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Three americium oxides are known, with the oxidation states +2 (AmO), +3 (Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and +4 (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the chemical formula Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240&amp;nbsp;°C and starts decomposing into AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 300&amp;nbsp;°C, the decomposition completes at about 470&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25&amp;nbsp;g/L.&lt;ref name="p5"&gt;Penneman, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is an artificial element of recent origin, and thus does not have a [[dietary element|biological requirement]].&lt;ref&gt;Toeniskoetter, Steve; Dommer, Jennifer and Dodge, Tony [http://umbbd.ethz.ch/periodic/elements/am.html The Biochemical Periodic Tables – Americium], University of Minnesota, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=2439|author=Dodge, C.J.|title=Role of Microbes as Biocolloids in the Transport of Actinides from a Deep Underground Radioactive Waste Repository|journal=Radiochim.

==Fission==
The isotope &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am (half-life 141 years) has the largest cross sections for absorption of thermal neutrons (5,700 [[Barn (unit)|barns]]),&lt;ref name = "Karlsruhe"&gt;Pfennig, G.; Klewe-Nebenius, H and Seelmann Eggebert, W.

The critical mass for a bare &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am sphere is about 9–14&amp;nbsp;kg (the uncertainty results from insufficient knowledge of its material properties). It can be lowered to 3–5&amp;nbsp;kg with a metal reflector and should become even smaller with a water reflector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dias, H. |author2=Tancock, N. |author3=Clayton, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Critical Mass Calculations for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am |journal=Nippon Genshiryoku Kenkyujo JAERI |date=2003 |pages=618–623 |url=http://typhoon.jaea.go.jp/icnc2003/Proceeding/paper/6.5_022.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105207/http://typhoon.jaea.go.jp/icnc2003/Proceeding/paper/6.5_022.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-22 }} [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200403/000020040303A0828431.php Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313120209/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200403/000020040303A0828431.php |date=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such small critical mass is favorable for portable [[nuclear weapon]]s, but those based on &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am are not known yet, probably because of its scarcity and high price.

==Isotopes==
{{See also|Isotopes of americium}}
About 19 [[isotope]]s and 8 [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370&amp;nbsp;years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a long half-life of 141&amp;nbsp;years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64&amp;nbsp;microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;245m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am to 50.8&amp;nbsp;hours for &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.&lt;ref name = "nubase"/&gt;

[[Americium-241]] decays to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486&amp;nbsp;MeV (85.2%) and 5.443&amp;nbsp;MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit [[gamma ray]]s with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://87.139.25.178:81/eng/theory.htm|title=α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am.

[[Americium-242]] is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02&amp;nbsp;h.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt; It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, but also by [[electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (17.3%). Both &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu down to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.

Nearly all (99.541%) of &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays by [[internal conversion]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np. The latter subsequently decays to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and then to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

[[Americium-243]] transforms by α-emission into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, which converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, and the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu changes into &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by emitting an α-particle.

===Ionization-type smoke detector===
{{Main|Smoke detector#Ionization}}

Americium is used in the most common type of household [[smoke detector]], which uses &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020911070229/http%3A//www%2Euic%2Ecom%2Eau/nip35%2Ehtm |archivedate= 11 September 2002 |title=Smoke Detectors and Americium |work=Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper |volume=35 |date=May 2002 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope is preferred over &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[radium|Ra]] because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. Element collector [[Theodore Gray]] mentions in his book ''The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe'':
{{quote|You might think that a synthetic radioactive element that follows plutonium (94)—and has a significantly shorter half-life—would be some kind of superbomb material, available only to scientists in secret laboratories. Perhaps a mad scientist is studying americium in a lair somewhere, but if you want some yourself you can simply walk into any neighborhood hardware store, supermarket, or Wal-Mart and buy some, no questions asked.

The reason is not that americium is fundamentally less dangerous than the elements around it. In fact, the commonly available isotope, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, is significantly ''more'' radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and at least as toxic. No, the difference is simply that there is a useful application for americium that requires only a very tiny amount, and for which a company was prepared to go through the effort required to carve out and get a regulatory exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOY-8hxTJVAC&amp;pg=PT220|date=3 April 2012|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-1-57912-895-1|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|microcurie]] (37&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|kBq]]) or 0.29 [[microgram]]. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into [[neptunium]]-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% [[neptunium]] after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an [[ionization chamber]], an air-filled space between two [[electrode]]s, and permits a small, constant [[Electric current|current]] between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to [[Type I and type II errors|false alarms]].&lt;ref&gt;Residential Smoke Alarm Performance, Thomas Cleary.

===Radionuclide===
As &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a roughly similar half-life to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft.&lt;ref name="RTG"&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)&lt;/ref&gt; Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 6.31&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am&lt;ref name=res/&gt; (cf. 390&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu)&lt;ref name="RTG"/&gt; – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the [[European Space Agency]] is considering using americium for its space probes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/09rtg/ Space agencies tackle waning plutonium stockpiles], Spaceflight now, 9 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles.&lt;ref name="rocket"&gt;{{cite news|title = Extremely Efficient Nuclear Fuel Could Take Man To Mars In Just Two Weeks|publisher = [[ScienceDaily]]|date = 3 January 2001|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm|accessdate =22 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120211/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm| archivedate= 17 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title = An americium-fueled gas core nuclear rocket|booktitle = AIP Conf.

One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining "cathode". A single 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am charge of such battery could provide about 140&amp;nbsp;kW of power over a period of 80 days.&lt;ref&gt;Genuth, Iddo [http://thefutureofthings.com/3015-americium-power-source/ Americium Power Source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507103250/http://thefutureofthings.com/articles.php?itemId=26%2F64%2F |date=7 May 2010 }}, The Future of Things, 3 October 2006, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even with all the potential benefits, the current applications of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this particular [[nuclear isomer]].&lt;ref name=mprice/&gt;

===Neutron source===
The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am pressed with [[beryllium]] is an efficient [[neutron source]]. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;chem&gt;^{241}_{95}Am -&gt; ^{237}_{93}Np + ^{4}_{2}He + \gamma&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;^{9}_{4}Be + ^{4}_{2}He -&gt; ^{12}_{6}C + ^{1}_{0}n + \gamma&lt;/chem&gt;

The most widespread use of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;AmBe neutron sources is a [[neutron probe]] – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in [[neutron radiography]], tomography and other radiochemical investigations.&lt;ref name="Binder"/&gt;

===Production of other elements===
Americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and [[transactinide]]s – for example, 82.7% of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 17.3% to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. In the nuclear reactor, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which transforms by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:

: &lt;chem&gt;^{243}_{95}Am -&gt;[\ce{(n,\gamma)}] ^{244}_{95}Am -&gt;[\beta^-][10.1 \ \ce{h}] ^{244}_{96}Cm&lt;/chem&gt;

Irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am by &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne ions yields the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Es ([[einsteinium]]) or &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Db ([[dubnium]]), respectively.&lt;ref name="Binder"&gt;{{cite book| author = Binder, Harry H. | title = Lexikon der chemischen Elemente: das Periodensystem in Fakten, Zahlen und Daten : mit 96 Abbildungen und vielen tabellarischen Zusammenstellungen| date = 1999| isbn = 978-3-7776-0736-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the element [[berkelium]] (&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, [[nobelium]] was produced at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for [[lawrencium]], discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt;

===Spectrometer===
Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409&amp;nbsp;keV gamma ray emissions from &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in [[radiography]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed [[nuclear density gauge]]s and [[nuclear densometer]]s. For example, the element has been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt; Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/indx_dec.jsp Nuclear Data Viewer 2.4], NNDC&lt;/ref&gt; Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.

==Health concerns==
As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=809&amp;tid=158 Public Health Statement for Americium] Section 1.5., Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, April 2004, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

If consumed, most of the americium is excreted within a few days, with only 0.05% absorbed in the blood, of which roughly 45%  goes to the [[liver]] and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and [[trabecula]]r surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs23am241.pdf|author=Division of Environmental Health, Office of Radiation Protection|title=Fact Sheet # 23.

Americium often enters landfills from discarded [[smoke detector]]s. The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old [[David Hahn]] extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors in an attempt to build a breeder nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="Silverstein2005"&gt;[[Ken Silverstein]], [http://www.harpers.org/archive/1998/11/0059750 The Radioactive Boy Scout: When a teenager attempts to build a breeder reactor].

'''''Battletruck''''' (also known as '''''Warlords of the 21st Century''''' and '''''[[:it:Destructors|Destructors]]''''' in [[Italy]]) is a 1982 [[apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] co-written and directed by [[Harley Cokeliss|Harley Cokliss]] and starring [[Michael Beck]], [[Annie McEnroe]], [[James Wainwright]], [[John Ratzenberger]], and [[Bruno Lawrence]]. 

Set in the aftermath of a devastating [[thermonuclear war]], the plot futuristic tale of collapsed governments and bankrupt countries heralding a new lawless age. A co-production between New Zealand and the United Kingdom, it was filmed on location in New Zealand and starring a number of local actors, and was part of a wave of similarly-themed films made in the wake of the success of the ''[[Mad Max]]'' series.

== Plot ==
In the near future, Earth has been devastated by a thermonuclear war over the depleting [[petroleum]] reserves. What little petrol remains has become a precious commodity fought over by vicious warlords and mercenaries. A war party led by Straker ([[James_Wainwright_(actor)|James Wainwright]]) find a vast supply of [[diesel fuel]] in a compound once thought to be radioactive. When his daughter Corlie ([[Annie McEnroe]]) refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from her father's base camp. Fleeing through the open desert, she runs into Hunter ([[Michael Beck]]), an ex-soldier armed with a high-tech motorbike, who takes her to shelter at his farm.

After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in the walled city of Clearwater Farm, governed by a strict old-fashioned [[democracy]], where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by her father's men, who move to attack the Clearwater community.  In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout.

The mercenaries terrorise and pillage the city. Straker tortures the resident mechanic Rusty ([[John Ratzenberger]]) into giving him the location of Hunter's secret hideout. Straker moves to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike and Straker, in a rage, plows through Hunter's residence with his truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's "battletruck".  While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, one of the residents turns traitor and knocks out Coralie, putting her in a wagon and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow.  Believing that he has killed Hunter, he appears at Straker's headquarters with Corlie in the wagon. 

Meanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike.  While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact that he is wounded.  He attacks Straker's HQ, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 litre diesel supply.  He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him.  In the process, he forces the driver to overdo it in the truck, overheating the turbines.  This stresses out the driver, (who loves the truck), and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter meanwhile gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's HQ was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush.  The Clearwater people are at the high place waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the movie.  Hunter fires a couple of rockets at the truck, one causes slight damage and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is uselessly destroying the truck, Straker kills the driver, who slumps over the wheel and now the truck, throttles set to full, is more or less out of control.

Back on the bike again, Hunter manages to jump onto the truck through a hole in the top that one of his rockets had made.  A battle ensues, the truck still careening wildly back and forth while Corlie tries to control it with the body of the driver slumped over the wheel and Straker furiously shouting commands to everybody. Eventually, Hunter fights his way to the front, temporarily stuns Straker, grabs Corlie, and jumps with her from the back of the still wildly out of control battle truck before it crashes and explodes.

Hunter and Corlie end up back at Clearwater, where Corlie apparently settles for good as part of the community. Ever the loner, Hunter rides off into the sunset on a horse, promising Corlie that he'll be back "sometime".

== Production notes ==
Battletruck was filmed on the Central Otago plains in New Zealand. Despite being produced by a Hollywood studio and being considered a Hollywood release, the film largely used New Zealand crew and actors. It followed the success of films such as ''[[Mad Max]]'' and was made in New Zealand in part due to the [[List of Hollywood strikes#Hollywood strikes|1981 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref name=nzonscreen&gt;{{cite web|title=Battletruck|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/battletruck-1982|publisher=nzonscreen.com|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|300px|Boiling water]]The '''boiling point''' of a substance is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the [[liquid]] equals the [[pressure]] surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldberg, David E. |title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1988|isbn=0-07-023684-4 |at= section 17.43, p. 321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Theodore, Louis |editor2=Dupont, R.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure.  A liquid in a partial [[vacuum]] has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at [[atmospheric pressure]].  A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at {{convert|100|C|F}} at sea level, but at {{convert|93.4|C|F}} at {{convert|1905|m|ft}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-points-water-altitude-d_1344.html&lt;/ref&gt; altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will [[boiling|boil]] at different temperatures. 

The '''normal boiling point''' (also called the '''atmospheric boiling point''' or the '''atmospheric pressure boiling point''') of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/gloss/normalbp.html General Chemistry Glossary] [[Purdue University]] website page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reel, Kevin R. |author2=Fikar, R. M. |author3=Dumas, P.

The '''standard boiling point''' has been defined by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cox, J. D. |date=1982 |title=Notation for states and processes, significance of the word standard in chemical thermodynamics, and remarks on commonly tabulated forms of thermodynamic functions |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1239 |doi=10.1351/pac198254061239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heat of vaporization]] is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of [[evaporation]]. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as [[vapor]]. On the other hand, [[boiling]] is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

==Saturation temperature and pressure==
[[File:11. Температурата и вриењето на течност.ogv|thumb|right|280px|Demonstration of the lower boiling point of water at lower pressure, achieved by using a [[vacuum pump]].]]
{{Main|Vapor–liquid equilibrium}}
A ''saturated liquid'' contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a ''saturated vapor'' contains as little thermal energy as it can without [[Condensation|condensing]]).

'''Saturation temperature''' means ''boiling point''. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its [[Gas|vapor phase]]. The liquid can be said to be saturated with [[thermal energy]]. Any addition of thermal energy results in a [[phase transition]].

If the pressure in a system remains constant ([[Isobaric process|isobaric]]), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy ([[heat]]) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.

The boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST, USA]] [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]] of 101.325 [[kilopascal|kPa]] (or 1 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]), or the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the [[triple point]] is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.

If the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature are known, the boiling point can be calculated by using the [[Clausius–Clapeyron equation]], thus:

:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{B} = \Bigg(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{R\,\ln \frac{P}{P_0}}{\Delta H_\text{vap}}\Bigg)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; is the boiling point at the pressure of interest,
:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ideal gas constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] of the liquid at the pressure of interest,
:&lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is some pressure where the corresponding &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is known (usually data available at 1&amp;nbsp;atm or 100&amp;nbsp;kPa),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{vap}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat of vaporization]] of the liquid,
:&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is the boiling temperature,
:&lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural logarithm]].

'''Saturation pressure''' is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature.

If the temperature in a [[system]] remains constant (an ''[[isothermal]]'' system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to [[condensation|condense]] into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to [[Flash evaporation|flash]] into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.

There are two conventions regarding the ''standard boiling point of water'': The ''normal boiling point'' is {{convert|99.97|°C|°F|1|lk=on}} at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa). The IUPAC recommended ''standard boiling point of water'' at a standard pressure of 100 kPa (1 bar)&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05921.html Standard Pressure] IUPAC defines the "standard pressure" as being 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (which amounts to 1 bar).&lt;/ref&gt; is {{convert|99.61|°C|°F|1|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=iupac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073529214/395307/appdxs1_2.pdf Appendix 1: Property Tables and Charts (SI Units)], Scroll down to Table A-5 and read the temperature value of 99.61 °C at a pressure of 100 kPa (1 bar). Obtained from McGraw-Hill's Higher Education website.&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, on top of [[Mount Everest]], at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}} elevation, the pressure is about {{convert|34|kPa|torr|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=West, J. B. |date=1999 |title=Barometric pressures on Mt. Everest: New data and physiological significance |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=1062–6 |pmid=10066724|doi=10.1152/jappl.1999.86.3.1062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the boiling point of water is {{convert|71|°C|°F|0|lk=on}}.
The Celsius temperature scale was defined until 1954 by two points: 0&amp;nbsp;°C being defined by the water freezing point and 100&amp;nbsp;°C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.

==Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids ==

[[Image:vapor_pressure_chart.svg|thumb|right|A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Perry, R.H. |editor2=Green, D.W. |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of a liquid is the highest temperature (and pressure) it will actually boil at.

See also [[Vapour pressure of water]].

== Properties of the elements ==
{{further|List of elements by boiling point}}
The element with the lowest boiling point is [[helium]]. Both the boiling points of [[rhenium]] and [[tungsten]] exceed 5000 [[kelvin|K]] at [[standard pressure]]; because it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, both have been cited in the literature as having the higher boiling point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=DeVoe, Howard |title=Thermodynamics and Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=2000|isbn=0-02-328741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boiling point as a reference property of a pure compound==

As can be seen from the above plot of the logarithm of the vapor pressure vs. the temperature for any given pure [[chemical compound]], its normal boiling point can serve as an indication of that compound's overall [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]].  A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound's normal boiling point and [[melting point]] can serve as characteristic [[Physical property|physical properties]] for that compound, listed in reference books.  The higher a compound's normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound's normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall.  Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point.  For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its [[triple point]] to its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], depending on the external pressure.  Beyond its triple point, a compound's normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point.  Beyond the critical point, a compound's liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas.  At any given temperature, if a compound's normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure.  If the compound's normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained.   If a compound's vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.

[[File:Boiling point vs molar mass graph.png|thumb|350px|Boiling points of [[alkane]]s, [[alkene]]s, [[ether]]s, [[halogenoalkane]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[alcohol]]s and [[carboxylic acid]]s as a function of molar mass]]
In general, compounds with [[ionic bond]]s have high normal boiling points, if they do not decompose before reaching such high temperatures.  Many [[metal]]s have high boiling points, but not all.  Very generally—with other factors being equal—in compounds with covalently bonded [[molecule]]s, as the size of the molecule (or [[molecular mass]]) increases, the normal boiling point increases.  When the molecular size becomes that of a [[macromolecule]], [[polymer]], or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached.  Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the [[Polarity (chemistry)|polarity]] of its molecules.  As the polarity of a compound's molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal.  Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form [[hydrogen bond]]s (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound.  Simple [[carboxylic acid]]s dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules.  A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule.  Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.

Most volatile compounds (anywhere near ambient temperatures) go through an intermediate liquid phase while warming up from a solid phase to eventually transform to a vapor phase.  By comparison to boiling, a [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] is a physical transformation in which a solid turns directly into vapor, which happens in a few select cases such as with [[carbon dioxide]] at atmospheric pressure.  For such compounds, a [[sublimation point]] is a temperature at which a solid turning directly into vapor has a vapor pressure equal to the external pressure.

==Impurities and mixtures==
In the preceding section, boiling points of pure compounds were covered.  Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities ([[Solution|solutes]]) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds.  The presence of non-volatile impurities such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] or compounds of a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] far lower than the main component compound decreases its [[mole fraction]] and the [[Solution (chemistry)|solution's]] volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the [[concentration]] of the solutes.  This effect is called '''[[boiling point elevation]]'''.  As a common example, [[Saline water|salt water]] boils at a higher temperature than pure water.

In other mixtures of miscible compounds (components), there may be two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure.  The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and [[dew point]]s of all the components in the mixture. The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor [[Condensation|condenses]] into a liquid.   Furthermore, at any given temperature, the composition of the vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases.  In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a '''boiling point diagram''' is commonly used.  [[Distillation]] is a process of boiling and [usually] condensation which takes advantage of these differences in composition between liquid and vapor phases.

'''Bulky waste''' or '''bulky refuse''' is a technical term taken from [[waste management]] to describe  [[waste types]] that are too large to be accepted by the regular [[waste collection]]. It is usually picked up regularly in many countries from the [[street]]s or [[Sidewalk|pavements]] of the area. This service is provided free of charge in many places, but often a fee has to be paid.

Bulky waste items include discarded furniture ([[couch]]es, [[recliner]]s, [[Table (furniture)|tables]]), large appliances ([[refrigerator]]s, [[oven]]s, [[TV]]s), and plumbing fixtures ([[bathtub]]s, [[toilet]]s, sinks). A large amount (30-60%, depending on area) of bulky waste is picked up by scavengers before it is collected. Branches, brush, logs and other [[green waste]] are also categorized as bulky waste, although they may be collected separately for shredding and/or [[composting]].

[[Grapple truck]]s, also known as knuckleboom loaders, are often used to collect bulky waste. In the UK, refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) or crushers are being increasingly phased out as more bulky waste is diverted for re-use and recycling.

'''Continuous track''', also called '''tank tread'''&lt;ref name="stith" /&gt; or '''caterpillar track''', is a system of [[vehicle propulsion]] in which a continuous band of treads or track plates is driven by two or more wheels. This band is typically made of modular steel plates in the case of [[military vehicles]] and [[heavy equipment]], or [[synthetic rubber]] reinforced with steel wires in the case of lighter [[Agricultural machinery|agricultural]] or [[Heavy equipment|construction vehicles]].

The large surface area of the tracks distributes the weight of the vehicle better than steel or rubber tyres on an equivalent vehicle, enabling a continuous tracked vehicle to traverse soft ground with less likelihood of becoming stuck due to sinking. The prominent treads of the metal plates are both hard-wearing and damage resistant, especially in comparison to rubber tyres. The aggressive treads of the tracks provide good traction in soft surfaces but can damage paved surfaces, so some metal tracks can have rubber pads installed for use on paved surfaces.

Continuous tracks can be traced back as far as 1770 and today are commonly used on a variety of vehicles including [[bulldozer]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[tank]]s, and [[tractor]]s, but can be found on any vehicle used in an application that can benefit from the added traction, low ground pressure and durability inherent in continuous track [[propulsion systems]].

== History ==
[[Polish mathematician]] and inventor [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński]] conceived of the idea in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="wronski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wronski.html|title=Josef-Maria Hoëné de Wronski|accessdate=2009-05-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811014108/http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wronski.html|archivedate=2009-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[polymath]] Sir [[George Cayley]] patented a continuous track, which he called a "universal railway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_roAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA225 |journal=Mechanics Magazine |title=Sir George Cayley's patent universal railway |volume=5 |issue=127 |pages=225–227 |date=1826-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313211633/https://books.google.com/books?id=_roAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA225 |archivedate=2017-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, a [[Russia]]n inventor [[Dmitry Zagryazhsky]] designed a "carriage with mobile tracks" which he patented the same year, but due to a lack of funds and interest from manufacturers he was unable to build a working prototype, and his patent was voided in 1839.

=== Dreadnaught wheel ===
{{Main article|Dreadnaught wheel}}
Although not a continuous track in the form encountered today, a [[dreadnaught wheel]] or "endless railway wheel" was patented by the British Engineer [[James Boydell]] in 1846. In Boydell's design, a series of flat feet are attached to the periphery of the wheel, spreading the weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/8/86/Im1862EnV13-p284.jpg |title=Burrell's traction engine with Boydell's endless railway |work=Grace's Guide |year=1857 |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002130241/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/8/86/Im1862EnV13-p284.jpg |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of horse-drawn wagons, carts and gun carriages were successfully deployed in the Crimean War, waged between October 1853 and February 1856, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich manufacturing dreadnaught wheels. A letter of recommendation was signed by Sir William Codrington, the General commanding the troops at Sebastopol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The story of the St. Nicholas Works: A History of Charles Burrell and Sons |first=Michael R. |last=Lane |year=1994 |publisher=Unicorn Press |location=London |isbn=978-0906290071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boydell artillery wheel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Boydell%20Artillery%20Wheel.pdf |title=Boydell Artillery Wheel |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002145418/http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Boydell%20Artillery%20Wheel.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boydell patented improvements to his wheel in 1854 (No. 431) – the year his dreadnaught wheel was first applied to a steam engine – and 1858 (No. 356), the latter an impracticable palliative measure involving the lifting one or other of the driving wheels to facilitate turning.

A number of manufacturers including Richard Bach, [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]], [[Charles Burrell &amp; Sons]] and [[Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth]] applied the Boydell patent under licence. The British military were interested in Boydell's invention from an early date. One of the objectives was to transport [[Mallet's Mortar]], a giant 36&amp;nbsp;in weapon which was under development, but, by the end of the Crimean war, the mortar was not ready for service. A detailed report of the tests on steam traction, carried out by a select Committee of the Board of Ordnance, was published in June 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0vghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |title=Governments Experiments with Boydell's Traction-Engine |journal=The Farmer's Magazine |location=London |volume=45 |issue=1 |date=1856-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032113/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0vghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by which date the Crimean War was over, consequently the mortar and its transportation became irrelevant. In those tests, a Garrett engine was put through its paces on Plumstead Common. The Garrett engine featured in the Lord Mayor's show in London, and in the following month that engine was shipped to Australia. A [[steam tractor]] employing dreadnaught wheels was built at Bach's Birmingham works, and was used between 1856 and 1858 for ploughing in Thetford; and the first generation of Burrell/Boydell engines was built at the St. Nicholas works in 1856, again, after the close of the Crimean war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Boydell's%20Wheels%20Tuxford.pdf |title=Tuxford's Boydell Traction Engine |year=1857 |work=Science&amp;amp; Society: Picture Library |location=UK |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194723/http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Boydell's%20Wheels%20Tuxford.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between late 1856 and 1862 Burrell manufactured not less than a score of engines fitted with dreadnaught wheels. In April 1858, "The Engineer" gave a brief description of a Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth engine fitted with dreadnaught wheels, which was supplied not to the Western Allies, but to the Russian government for heavy artillery haulage in the Crimea, in the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;op. cit. Michael R.

In August 1858, more than two years after the end of the Crimean War, [[John Fowler (agricultural engineer)|John Fowler]] filed British Patent No. 1948 on another form of "Endless Railway". In his illustration of the invention, Fowler used a pair of wheels of equal diameter on each side of his vehicle, around which pair of toothed wheels ran a 'track' of eight jointed segments, with a smaller jockey/drive wheel between each pair of wheels, to support the 'track'. Comprising only eight sections, the 'track' sections are essentially 'longitudinal', as in Boydell's initial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Burrell-Boydell%20Tractor.pdf |title=Burrell-Boydell Tractor |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140930/http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Burrell-Boydell%20Tractor.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler's arrangement is a precursor to the multi-section caterpillar track in which a relatively large number of short 'transverse' treads are used, as proposed by Sir George Caley in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Sir%20George%20Caley's%20Continuous%20Track.pdf |title=Patent No. 5260 A New Locomotive Apparatus |first=Georg |last=Caley |year=1825 |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121194507/http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond/Sir%20George%20Caley's%20Continuous%20Track.pdf |archivedate=2017-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a small number of relatively long 'longitudinal' treads.

Further to Fowler's patent of 1858, in 1877, a Russian, [[Fyodor Blinov]], created a tracked vehicle called "[[wagon]] moved on endless rails" (caterpillars).&lt;ref name=blinov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ricolor.org/history/eng/prm/blinov/ |title=Изобретатель трактора (Ф. Блинов) |trans-title=The inventor of the tractor (F.Blinov) |first1=D. |last1=Lozovoi |first2=A. |last2=Lozova |work=Russia in Colours |language=Russian |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215339/http://ricolor.org/history/eng/prm/blinov/ |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lacked self-propulsion and was pulled by horses. Blinov received a patent for his "wagon" in 1878. From 1881 to 1888 he developed a steam-powered caterpillar-tractor. This self-propelled crawler was successfully tested and featured at a farmers' exhibition in 1896.&lt;ref name=blinov/&gt;

[[Steam traction engines]] were used at the end of the 19th century in the [[Boer War]]s. But neither dreadnaught wheels nor continuous tracks were used, rather "roll-out" wooden plank roads were thrown under the wheels as required.&lt;ref&gt;''The Implement and Machinery Review'', 1901-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In short, whilst the development of the continuous track engaged the attention of a number of inventors in the 18th and 19th centuries, the general use and exploitation of the continuous track belonged to the 20th century.

=== 20th century ===
A little-known American inventor, Henry T. Stith, developed a continuous track prototype which was, in multiple forms, patented in 1873, 1880, and 1900. The last was for the application of the track to a prototype off-road bicycle built for his son.&lt;ref name="stith"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Tank Tread Was His Baby |journal=Popular Science |year=1944 |issue=June |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313131943/https://books.google.com/books?id=mCYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |archivedate=2017-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1900 prototype is retained by his surviving family.

Frank Beamond, a less-commonly known but significant British inventor, designed and built caterpillar tracks, and was granted patents for them in a number of countries, in 1900 and 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.waitrose.com/~rogerbeamond/INVENTION.pdf|title=Invention of the Caterpillar Track: Frank Beamond and his Patents|accessdate=2014-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721184346/http://www.users.waitrose.com/~rogerbeamond/INVENTION.pdf|archivedate=2015-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lombard steam log hauler.jpg|thumb|left|Lombard Steam Log Hauler (Designed, patented 1901)]]

=== Commercial success ===
An effective continuous track was invented and implemented by [[Alvin Orlando Lombard]] for the [[Lombard Steam Log Hauler]]. He was granted a patent in 1901 and built the first steam-powered log hauler at the Waterville Iron Works in Waterville, Maine, the same year. In all, 83 Lombard steam log haulers are known to have been built up to 1917, when production switched entirely to internal combustion engine powered machines, ending with a Fairbanks diesel-powered unit in 1934. Undoubtedly, Alvin Lombard was the first commercial manufacturer of the [[tractor crawler]].

At least one of Lombard's steam-powered machines apparently remains in working order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allroutes.to/modeltandlombard/ |title=Lombard Log Hauler and Model T Snowmobile Show Route 175 Thornton, NH |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814215748/http://www.allroutes.to/modeltandlombard/ |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gasoline-powered Lombard hauler is on display at the Maine State Museum in Augusta. In addition, there may have been up to twice as many Phoenix Centipeed versions of the steam log hauler built under license from Lombard, with vertical instead of horizontal cylinders. In 1903, the founder of Holt Manufacturing, [[Benjamin Holt]], paid Lombard $60,000 for the right to produce vehicles under his patent.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Roberts tracked steam tractor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Hornsby]] tracked, [[paraffin (fuel)|paraffin]]-powered tractor, {{circa|lk=no|1908}}]]
[[File:Hornsby.jpg|thumb|right|Hornsby tractor, 1909]]

At about the same time a British agricultural company, [[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Hornsby]] in [[Grantham]], developed a continuous track which was patented in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;British Patent No. 16,345 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; The design differed from modern tracks in that it flexed in only one direction, with the effect that the links locked together to form a solid rail on which the road wheels ran. Hornsby's tracked vehicles were given trials as [[artillery tractor]]s by the [[British Army]] on several occasions between 1905 and 1910, but not adopted. The Hornsby tractors featured a track-steer clutch arrangement, which is the basis of the modern crawler operation. The patent was purchased by Holt.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Military application ===
Continuous track was first applied to a military vehicle on the British prototype tank [[Little Willie]]. British Army officers, Colonel Ernest Swinton and Colonel Maurice Hankey, became convinced that it was possible to develop a fighting vehicle that could provide protection from machine gun fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWwillie.htm |title=Little Willie Tank |first=John |last=Simkin |publisher=Spartacus Educational |location=UK |accessdate=2016-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109021734/http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWwillie.htm |archivedate=2016-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caterpillar ===

The name came from a soldier during the tests on the Hornsby crawler, "trials began at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] in July 1907. The soldiers immediately christened the 70bhp No.2 machine the 'caterpillar'."&lt;ref&gt;''The Devil's Chariot'', John Glanfield&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt adopted that name for his "crawler" tractors. Holt began moving from steam to gasoline-powered designs, and in 1908 brought out the 40 horsepower "Holt Model 40 Caterpillar". Holt incorporated the Holt Caterpillar Company, in early 1910, later that year trademarked the name "Caterpillar" for his continuous tracks.&lt;ref name=acmoc2&gt;

In a memorandum of 1908, Antarctic explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Scott (1908). ''The Sledging Problem in the Antarctic, Men versus Motors''&lt;/ref&gt; Snow vehicles did not yet exist however, and so his engineer [[Reginald Skelton]] developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Huntford (2003) ''Scott and Amundsen. Their Race to the South Pole. The Last Place on Earth.'' Abacus, London, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; These tracked motors were built by the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company]] in Birmingham, tested in Switzerland and Norway, and can be seen in action in [[Herbert Ponting]]'s 1911 documentary film of Scott's Antarctic [[Terra Nova Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Scott died during the expedition in 1912, but expedition member and biographer [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] credited Scott's "motors" with the inspiration for the British World War I tanks, writing: "Scott never knew their true possibilities; for they were the direct ancestors of the 'tanks' in France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cherry-Garrard | first = Apsley | authorlink = Apsley Cherry-Garrard| title = [[The Worst Journey in the World]] chapter 9 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = London| year = 1970| origyear = 1922| isbn = 978-0-14-009501-2 | oclc = 16589938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Holt tractors were used by the British and Austro-Hungarian armies to tow heavy artillery and stimulated the development of [[tanks]] in several countries. The first tanks to go into action, the [[British heavy tanks of World War I|Mark I]], built by Great Britain, were designed from scratch and were inspired by, but not directly based on, the Holt. The slightly later French and German tanks were built on modified Holt running gear.

== Patent history ==
A long line of patents disputes who was the "originator" of continuous tracks. There were a number of designs that attempted to achieve a track laying mechanism, although these designs do not generally resemble modern tracked vehicles.&lt;!--

The two earliest patent applications of which I am aware are those of Sir George Cayley for an 'Universal Railway' in 1826, written up in the Mechanic's Magazine of Saturday, January 24, 1826, and Edward Heathcoat's design of 1837 for a 'Steam Plough'. Heathcoat's invention apparently worked and was worked on and modified over several years before being dismantled and the steam engine shipped elsewhere. This machine is mentioned several times in a rather lengthy thread on the Practical Machinist web site under, 'O.T. Crawler Tractor'. (I would post a link to it but the site appears to be having issues just at the moment.) There appears to be a note scrawled across the front page of the copy that I have saying: "[Letters Patent No 6267 of 1832.]"

=== Blinov ===
[[File:Blinov.jpg|220px|thumb|The draft of [[Fyodor Blinov|Blinov]]'s steam-powered continuous track [[tractor]]]]

In 1877 Russian inventor [[Fyodor Blinov|Fyodor Abramovich Blinov]] created a tracked vehicle called "[[wagon]] moved on endless rails" (caterpillars).&lt;ref name=blinov/&gt; It lacked self-propelling and was horse-drawn. Blinov got a patent for his "wagon" the next year. Later, in 1881-1888 he created a steam-powered caterpillar-tractor. This self-propelled crawler was successfully tested and showed at a farmers' exhibition in 1896.&lt;ref name=blinov/&gt;

=== Dinsmoor ===
According to ''[[Scientific American]]'', it was [[Charles Dinsmoor]] of [[Warren, Pennsylvania]] that invented a "vehicle" that was on endless tracks. The article gives a detailed description of the endless tracks and the illustration looks much like today's tracked vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American, December 18, 1886, Vol. LV, No. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The invention has been patented as No. 351,749 on November 2, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Joseph Nathan, ''Famous First Facts'', H.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lombard ===

Alvin O. Lombard of [[Waterville, Maine]] was issued a patent in 1901 for the [[Lombard Steam Log Hauler]] that resembles a regular railroad steam [[locomotive]] with sled steerage on front and crawlers in rear for hauling logs in the Northeastern United States and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The [[wikt:hauler|hauler]]s allowed pulp to be taken to rivers in the winter. Prior to then, horses could be used only until snow depths made hauling impossible. Lombard began commercial production which lasted until around 1917 when focus switched entirely to [[gasoline]] powered machines. A gasoline-powered hauler is on display at the Maine State Museum in [[Augusta, Maine]].

===Hornsby/Holt/Phoenix===
[[File:Ruston crawler tractor working model.JPG|thumb|A Model of the Hornsby tractor]]

After Lombard began operations, [[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Hornsby]] in England manufactured at least two full length "track steer" machines, and their patent was later purchased by Holt in 1913, allowing Holt to claim to be the "inventor" of the crawler tractor.&lt;ref name=lehman_deals&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the "tank" was a British concept it is more likely the Hornsby, which had been built and unsuccessfully pitched to their military, was the inspiration.

In a patent dispute involving rival crawler builder Best, testimony was brought in from people including Lombard, that Holt had inspected a Lombard log hauler shipped out to a western state by people who would later build the Phoenix log hauler in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, under license from Lombard.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Phoenix Centipeed typically had a fancier wood cab, steering wheel tipped forward at a 45 degree angle and vertical instead of horizontal [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]].

=== Linn ===
{{Main article|Linn tractor}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

In the meantime, a gasoline-powered [[motor home]] was built by Lombard for Holman Harry (Flannery) Linn of [[Old Town, Maine]] to pull the equipment wagon of his dog &amp; pony show, resembling a [[tram|trolley]] car only with wheels in front and Lombard crawlers in rear. Linn had experimented with gasoline and steam-powered vehicles and six-wheel drive before this, and at some point entered Lombard's employment as a demonstrator, mechanic and sales agent. This resulted in a question of proprietorship of patent rights after a single rear-tracked gasoline-powered road engine of tricycle arrangement was built to replace the larger motor home in 1909 on account of problems with the old picturesque wooden bridges. This dispute resulted in Linn departing Maine and relocating to Morris, New York, to build an improved, contour following flexible lag tread or crawler with [[independent suspension]] of [[halftrack]] type, gasoline and later [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powered. Although several were delivered for military use between 1917 and 1946, Linn never received any large military orders. Most of the production between 1917 and 1952, approximately 2500 units, was sold directly to highway departments and contractors. Steel tracks and payload capacity allowed these machines to work in terrain that would typically cause the poorer quality rubber tyres that existed before the mid-1930s to spin uselessly, or shred completely.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Linn was a pioneer in snow removal before the practice was embraced in rural areas, with a nine-foot steel v-plow and sixteen foot adjustable leveling wings on either side. Once the highway system became paved, [[snow plow|snowplowing]] could be done by [[four wheel drive]] trucks equipped by improving tyre designs, and the Linn became an off highway vehicle, for [[logging]], [[mining]], dam construction, [[arctic exploration]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Engineering ==

=== Steering ===
{{Main|Differential steering}}
Continuous track vehicle [[steering|steer]] by applying more or less drive torque to one side of the vehicle than the other, and this can be implemented in a variety of ways.

=== Construction and operation ===
[[File:Tracks (diagram).png|thumb|right|Diagram of tracked suspension.(1=rear drive wheel (rear wheel drive), 2=track, 3=return rollers, 4=front drive wheel (front wheel drive), 5=road wheels, 6=idler)]]
[[File:Leclerc p1040882.jpg|thumb|A [[sprocket]] wheel on a tank]]

Modern tracks are built from modular chain links which together compose a closed chain. The links are jointed by a hinge, which allows the track to be flexible and wrap around a set of wheels to make an endless loop. The chain links are often broad, and can be made of manganese alloy steel for high strength, hardness, and abrasion resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=69 |title=Austenitic Manganese Steels |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308160132/http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=69 |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Track construction and assembly is dictated by the application. Military vehicles use a track shoe that is integral to the structure of the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely [[Unsprung mass|unsprung]], reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a track with shoes that attach to the chain with bolts and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows track shoes to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle.

The vehicle's weight is transferred to the bottom length of track by a number of road wheels, or sets of wheels called [[bogie]]s. Road wheels are typically mounted on some form of suspension to cushion the ride over rough ground. Suspension design in military vehicles is a major area of development; the very early designs were often completely unsprung. Later-developed road wheel suspension offered only a few inches of travel using springs, whereas modern hydro-pneumatic systems allow several feet of travel and include [[shock absorber]]s. [[Torsion-bar suspension]] has become the most common type of military vehicle suspension. Construction vehicles have smaller road wheels that are designed primarily to prevent track derailment and they are normally contained in a single bogie that includes the [[idler-wheel]] and sometimes the sprocket.

Transfer of power to the track is accomplished by a [[drive wheel]], or ''drive [[sprocket]]'', driven by the motor and engaging with holes in the track links or with pegs on them to drive the track. In military vehicles, the drive wheel is typically mounted well above the contact area on the ground, allowing it to be fixed in position. In agricultural crawlers it is normally incorporated as part of the bogie. Placing suspension on the sprocket is possible, but is mechanically more complicated. A non-powered wheel, an ''idler'', is placed at the opposite end of the track, primarily to tension the track, since loose track could be easily thrown (slipped) off the wheels. To prevent throwing, the inner surface of the track links usually have vertical guide horns engaging grooves, or gaps between the doubled road and idler/sprocket wheels. In military vehicles with a rear sprocket, the idler wheel is placed higher than the road wheels to allow it to climb over obstacles. Some track arrangements use return rollers to keep the top of the track running straight between the drive sprocket and idler. Others, called ''slack track'', allow the track to droop and run along the tops of large road wheels. This was a feature of the [[Christie suspension]], leading to occasional misidentification of other slack track-equipped vehicles.

==== Overlapping road wheels ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-28, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|left|Overlapped and interleaved road wheels of a German [[Tiger I]] heavy tank]]

Many World War II German military vehicles, initially (starting in the late 1930s) including all vehicles originally designed to be half-tracks and all later tank designs (after the [[Panzer IV]]), had slack-track systems, usually driven by a front-located drive sprocket, the track returning along the tops of a design of overlapping and sometimes interleaved large diameter road wheels, as on the suspension systems of the [[Tiger I]] and [[Panther tank|Panther]] tanks, generically known by the term ''Schachtellaufwerk'' in German, for both half-track and fully tracked vehicles. There were suspensions with one (sometimes double) wheel per axle, alternately supporting the inner and outer side of the track, and interleaved suspensions with two or three road wheels per axle, distributing the load over the track.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Chamberlain and Hilary Doyle, ''Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War II'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-750-0001A-05A, Bau von Zugkraftwagen 3t (Sd.Kfz. 11).jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Sd.Kfz. 11]]'s half-track units, showing the rims of its six ''Schachtellaufwerk'' overlapped/interleaved roadwheel sets for each track unit per side]]

The choice of overlapping/interleaved road wheels allowed the use of slightly more [[torsion bar]] suspension members, allowing any German tracked military vehicle with such a setup to have a noticeably smoother ride over challenging terrain, leading to reduced wear and more accurate fire. There were some major disadvantages with this though, one being on the Russian front, mud would get stuck in-between the overlapping wheels, and would freeze, immobilizing the vehicle. As a tracked vehicle moves, the load of each wheel moves over the track, pushing down and forward that part of the earth, snow, etc. under it, similarly to a wheeled vehicle but to a lesser extent because the tread helps distribute the load. Apparently, on some surfaces, this consumes enough energy to slow the vehicle down significantly, so overlapped and interleaved wheels improve performance (including fuel consumption) by loading the track more evenly. It also must have extended the life of the tracks and possibly of the wheels{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. The wheels also better protect the vehicle from enemy fire, and mobility is improved when some wheels are missing. But this complicated approach has not been used since World War II ended. This may be related more to maintenance than to original cost. The torsion bars and bearings may stay dry and clean, but the wheels and tread work in mud, sand, rocks, snow and so on. In addition, the outer wheels (up to 9 of them, some double) had to be removed to access the inner ones. In WW II, vehicles typically had to be maintained a few months before being destroyed or captured{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}, but in peacetime vehicles must train several crews, over a period of decades.

=== Advantages ===
[[File:ГТ-СМ at Vankorskoe oilfield.jpg|thumb|left|A Russian tracked vehicle designed to operate on snow and swamps]]

Tracked vehicles have better mobility over rough terrain than those with wheels. They smooth out the bumps, glide over small obstacles and are capable of crossing trenches or breaks in the terrain. Riding in a fast tracked vehicle feels like riding in a boat over heavy swells. Tracks cannot be punctured or torn. Tracks are much less likely to get stuck in soft ground, mud, or snow since they distribute the weight of the vehicle over a larger contact area, decreasing its [[ground pressure]]. In addition, the larger contact area, coupled with the cleats, or [[grouser]]s, on the track shoes, allows vastly superior traction that results in a much better ability to push or pull large loads where wheeled vehicles would dig in. [[Bulldozer]]s, which are most often tracked, use this attribute to rescue other vehicles, (such as [[wheel loader]]s) which have become stuck in, or sunk into, the ground. Tracks can also give higher maneuverability, as tracked vehicles can turn in place without forward or backward movement by driving the tracks in opposite directions. In addition, should a track be broken, assuming the correct tools are available, it can be repaired without the need for special facilities; something which is crucial in a combat situation.

The seventy-ton [[M1 Abrams]] tank has an average ground pressure of just over {{convert|15|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Since tyre air pressure is approximately equal to average ground pressure, a typical car will have an average ground pressure of {{convert|28|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} to {{convert|33|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}.

=== Disadvantages ===
[[File:Caterpillar Tracks On Seal Machine.jpg|thumb|Small tracks on a roadworks machine, note the rubber pads to reduce wear on the carriageway.]]

The disadvantages of tracks are lower top speed, much greater mechanical complexity, shorter life and the damage that their all-steel versions cause to the surface on which they pass. They are assumed to severely damage hard terrain such as asphalt pavement, but actually have significantly lower ground pressures than equivalent or lighter wheeled vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, they often cause damage to less firm terrain such as lawns, gravel roads, and farm fields, as the sharp edges of the track easily rout the turf. Accordingly, vehicle laws and local ordinances often require rubberised tracks or track pads. A compromise between all-steel and all-rubber tracks exists: attaching rubber pads to individual track links ensures that continuous track vehicles can travel more smoothly, quickly, and quietly on paved surfaces. While these pads slightly reduce a vehicle's cross-country traction, in theory they prevent damage to any pavement.

[[File:JGSDF type10 Tank higashi fuji Firing Space accident.JPG|thumb|left|A tank with a thrown track]]

Additionally, the loss of a single segment in a track immobilizes the entire vehicle, which can be a disadvantage in situations where high reliability is important. Tracks can also ride off their guide wheels, idlers or sprockets, which can cause them to jam or to come completely off the guide system (this is called a 'thrown' track). Jammed tracks may become so tight that the track may need to be broken before a repair is possible, which requires either explosives or special tools. Multi-wheeled vehicles, for example, [[8 X 8]] military vehicles, may often continue driving even after the loss of one or more non-sequential wheels, depending on the base wheel pattern and drive train.

[[File:USMC-12197.jpg|thumbnail|right|Worn and new track pads on an M1 Abrams battle tank.]]

Many manufacturers provide rubber tracks instead of steel, especially for agricultural applications. Rather than a track made of linked steel plates, a reinforced rubber belt with chevron treads is used. In comparison to steel tracks, rubber tracks are lighter, make less noise, create less maximal [[ground pressure]] and do not damage paved roads. The disadvantage is that they are not as solid as steel tracks. Previous belt-like systems, such as those used for [[half-track]]s in World War II, were not as strong, and during military actions were easily damaged. The first rubber track was invented and constructed by [[Adolphe Kégresse]] and patented in 1913; rubber tracks are often called [[Kégresse track]]s.

Prolonged use places enormous strain on the drive [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] and the mechanics of the tracks, which must be overhauled or replaced regularly. It is common to see tracked vehicles such as bulldozers or tanks transported long distances by a wheeled carrier such as a [[tank transporter]] or [[train]], though technological advances have made this practice less common among tracked military vehicles than it once was{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

=== "Live" and "dead" track ===

Tracks may be broadly categorized as "live" or "dead" track. "Dead" track is a simple design in which each track plate is connected to the rest with hinge-type pins. These dead tracks will lie flat if placed on the ground; the drive sprocket pulls the track around the wheels with no assistance from the track itself. "Live" track is slightly more complex, with each link connected to the next by a bushing which causes the track to bend slightly inward. A length of live track left on the ground will curl upward slightly at each end. Although the drive sprocket must still pull the track around the wheels, the track itself tends to bend inward, slightly assisting the sprocket and somewhat conforming to the wheels.

'''''Creatures 3''''' is the third game in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' [[artificial life|a-life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]]. In this installment, the [[Shee (Creatures)|Shee]] have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order.

There are 6 main "[[Closed ecological system|metarooms]]" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The [[Norn (Creatures)|Norn]] Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the [[Grendel]] mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the [[Ettin (Creatures)|Ettin]] mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world.

Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original ''Creatures'' Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in ''[[Creatures 2]]'', love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert.

Creatures 3 runs on the CAOS engine, making it highly moddable, but now it is retired and outdated.

The '''Dalrymple ESCRI battery''' (Energy Storage for Commercial Renewable Integration) is a 30MW / 8MWh grid-connected battery array on [[Yorke Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]]. Its role is to provide improved reliability and stability to the electricity network on Yorke Peninsula and South Australia.

The battery is installed adjacent to the Dalrymple [[Electrical substation|substation]], which is at the end of a 275kV power line into the peninsula, and feeds 33kV lines to various towns across the lower end of the peninsula. The substation is also where the [[Wattle Point Wind Farm]] feeds electricity into the grid. It is seven kilometres southwest of [[Stansbury, South Australia|Stansbury]].

The battery was constructed by [[Consolidated Power Projects]] with [[ABB]] and [[Samsung]] components. It was part-funded by a grant from the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.electranet.com.au/electranet-awards-contract-to-build-yorke-peninsula-battery/ |title=ElectraNet awards contract to build Yorke Peninsula battery |date=3 October 2017 |publisher=[[ElectraNet]] |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned in June and July 2018.

'''Danske Commodities''' (DC) is an independent energy trading house. The company is an international trader of energy-related [[commodities]] such as [[Electric power|power]], [[gas]] and climate market products with activities in 37 European countries. 

== History ==

Danske Commodities was founded in September 2004 by Henrik Lind.&lt;ref name="CVR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvr.dk/Site/Forms/PublicService/DisplayCompany.aspx?cvrnr=28113951 |title=Danish company registration database |accessdate=29 August 2011 |publisher=Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005080527/http://cvr.dk/Site/Forms/PublicService/DisplayCompany.aspx?cvrnr=28113951 |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company started off with trading electricity across the border between [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]], with the first trade implemented on 1 November 2004.

Building its foundation on trading on the ‘Day Ahead’ power market, Danske Commodities expanded into the intraday power trading market in 2007. 

In 2009, gas trading and wholesale services, such as energy procurement for supply companies and management of volume and balancing risks, were added to the company’s business activities.
In 2011 the company added renewable services optimising the variable output from wind and solar. Today, the company has 6000 MW of renewables under management. 

In 2018, Danske Commodities is present in 37 power markets and in 16 gas markets with a 24/7 trading setup. The company employs approx. 300 employees and is domiciled in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]].

[[File:dihedral.airliner.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The upward tilt of the wings and tailplane of an aircraft, as seen on this [[Boeing 737]], is called dihedral angle.]]

'''Dihedral angle''' is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]].  "Anhedral angle" is the name given to negative dihedral angle, that is, when there is a ''downward'' angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a fixed-wing aircraft.

[[File:Dihedral and anhedral angle (aircraft wing).svg|thumb|Schematic of dihedral and anhedral angle of an aircraft wing]]

Dihedral angle (or anhedral angle) has a strong influence on '''dihedral effect''', which is named after it. Dihedral effect is the amount of [[roll moment]] in a direction produced by the amount of side slip in the opposite direction. Dihedral effect is a critical factor in the stability of an aircraft about the roll axis (the [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)#Spiral mode|spiral mode]]). It is also pertinent to the nature of an aircraft's [[Dutch roll]] oscillation and to maneuverability about the [[roll (flight)|roll]] axis.

[[File:Aircraft dihedral angle.svg|thumb|Measuring the dihedral angle]]

'''Longitudinal dihedral''' is a comparatively obscure term related to the [[pitch (flight)|pitch]] axis of an airplane.  It is the angle between the [[zero-lift axis]] of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail.  Longitudinal dihedral can influence the nature of controllability about the pitch axis and the nature of an aircraft's [[phugoid]]-mode oscillation.

When the term "dihedral" (of an aircraft) is used by itself it is usually intended to mean "dihedral ''angle''".  However, context may otherwise indicate that "dihedral ''effect''" is the intended meaning.

==Dihedral angle and dihedral effect==
Dihedral angle is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], or of any paired nominally-horizontal surfaces on any [[aircraft]].  The term can also apply to the wings of a [[bird]]. Dihedral angle is also used in some types of kites such as box kites. Wings with more than one angle change along the full span are said to be ''polyhedral''.

Dihedral angle has important stabilizing effects on flying bodies because it has  a strong influence on the dihedral effect.

Dihedral effect&lt;ref name=Roskam_ch4.1.7&gt;{{cite book|last=Roskam|first=Jan|title=Airplane Flight Dynamics and Automatic Flight Controls|publisher=Roskam Aviation and Engineering Corporation|location=Ottawa, Kansas|year=1979|volume=1|pages=139|chapter=4.1.7}}  Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 78-31382&lt;/ref&gt; of an aircraft is a rolling moment resulting from the vehicle having a non-zero [[angle of sideslip]].  Increasing the dihedral angle of an aircraft increases the dihedral effect on it. However, many other aircraft parameters also have a strong influence on dihedral effect. Some of these important factors are: [[wing sweep]], vertical [[center of gravity]], and the height and size of anything on an aircraft that changes its sidewards force as [[sideslip]] changes.

==Longitudinal dihedral==
Dihedral angle on an aircraft almost always implies the angle between two ''paired'' surfaces, ''one on each side of the aircraft''. Even then, it is almost always between the left and right ''wings''. However, mathematically [[Dihedral angle|dihedral]] means the angle between ''any'' two planes. So, in aeronautics, in one case, the term "dihedral" is applied to mean the difference in angles between two ''front-to-back'' surfaces:

Longitudinal dihedral is the difference between the [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] of the wing [[Chord (aircraft)|root chord]] and angle of incidence of the horizontal tail root chord.

Longitudinal dihedral can also mean the angle between the [[zero-lift axis]] of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces. This is the more meaningful usage because the directions of zero-lift are pertinent to longitudinal trim and stability while the directions of the root chords are not.

==History==
In geometry, dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. Aviation usage differs slightly from usage in geometry. In aviation, the usage "'''di'''hedral" evolved to mean the positive, up angle between the left and right wings, while usage with the prefix "an-" (as in "'''an'''hedral") evolved to mean the negative, down angle between the wings.

The aerodynamic stabilizing qualities of a dihedral angle were described in an influential 1810 article by [[Sir George Cayley]].&lt;ref&gt;''"This angular form, with the apex downward, is the chief basis of stability in aerial navigation . . . and this most effectively prevents any rolling of the machine from side to side."'' George Cayley. On Aerial Navigation. (part II). ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts.'', vol. 25 (Feb, 1810), pp. 81-87. As reprinted in [[Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith|Gibbs-Smith, Charles H.]] ''Sir George Cayley's Aeronautics, 1796-1855''. [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|HMSO]]. 1962. page 223 has the quote.

==Uses of dihedral angle and dihedral effect==

===Aircraft stability analysis===
In analysis of aircraft stability, the dihedral effect is also a [[stability derivatives|stability derivative]] called '''C&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;ref group=note &gt;Pronounced "See-ell-beta".&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the change in rolling moment coefficient (the "'''C&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'''")&lt;ref group=note &gt;A rolling moment ''coefficient'' is a "normalization" of the rolling moment.  Rolling moment has units of force times length.  The rolling moment coefficient is normalized so it has no units.  This is done by dividing the moment by wing area and by wing span and by [[dynamic pressure]].&lt;/ref&gt; per degree (or radian) of change in [[sideslip angle]] (the "&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;").

===Provision of stability===
The purpose of dihedral effect is to contribute to stability in the roll axis.  It is an important factor in the stability of the ''[[Flight dynamics (aircraft)#Spiral mode|spiral mode]]'' which is sometimes called "roll stability".&lt;ref group=note &gt;"Roll Stability" is an ambiguous term requiring context to discern the intended meaning of the user.  It usually means "Spiral Mode Stability", but it is also often misused to mean dihedral effect or dihedral angle, both of which are not "stability" themselves, though they contribute to spiral mode stability.&lt;/ref&gt; The dihedral effect does not contribute directly to the restoring of "wings level", but it indirectly helps restore "wings level" through its effect on the spiral mode of motion described below.

===Wing clearance===
Aircraft designers may increase dihedral angle to provide greater clearance between the wing tips and the runway. This is of particular concern with [[swept-wing]] aircraft, whose wingtips could hit the runway on rotation/touchdown. In military aircraft dihedral angle space may be used for mounting [[materiel]] and [[drop tank|drop-tanks]] on wing hard points, especially in aircraft with low wings. The increased dihedral effect caused by this design choice may need to be compensated for, perhaps by decreasing the dihedral angle on the horizontal tail.

==Using dihedral angle to adjust dihedral effect==
During  design of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] (or any aircraft with horizontal surfaces), changing dihedral angle is usually a relatively simple way to adjust the overall dihedral effect.  This is to compensate for other design elements' influence on the dihedral effect.  These other elements (such as wing sweep, vertical mount point of the wing, etc.) may be more difficult to change than the dihedral angle.  As a result, differing amounts of dihedral angle can be found on different types of fixed-wing aircraft.  For example, the dihedral angle is usually greater on low-wing aircraft than on otherwise-similar high-wing aircraft.  This is because "highness" of a wing (or "lowness" of vertical [[center of gravity]] compared to the wing)  naturally creates ''more'' dihedral effect itself.  This makes it so less dihedral angle is needed to get the amount of dihedral effect needed.

==Common confusions==
Dihedral effect is defined simply to be the rolling moment caused by sideslip and nothing else.  Rolling moments caused by other things that may be related to sideslip have different names.

Dihedral effect is not caused by ''[[yaw rate]]'', nor by the ''rate of sideslip change''.  Since dihedral effect is noticed by pilots when "rudder is applied", many pilots and other near-experts explain that the rolling moment is caused by one wing moving more quickly through the air and one wing less quickly.  Indeed, these are actual effects, but they are not the dihedral effect, which is caused by being ''at'' a sideslip angle, not by getting to one.  These other effects are called "rolling moment due to yaw rate" and "rolling moment due to sideslip rate" respectively.

Dihedral effect is not [[roll stability]] in and of itself. Roll stability is less-ambiguously termed "spiral mode stability" and dihedral effect is a contributing factor to it.

==How dihedral angle creates dihedral effect and stabilizes the spiral mode==
The dihedral angle contributes to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft.  In turn, the dihedral effect contributes to stability of the ''[[Flight dynamics (aircraft)#Spiral mode|spiral mode]]''.  A ''stable'' spiral mode will cause the aircraft to eventually return to a nominally "wings level" bank angle when the angle of the wings is disturbed to become off-level.&lt;ref group=note &gt;In the spiral mode, if it is unstable, the aircraft will slowly, then more rapidly, ''diverge'' from "nominal wings-level" if the pilot makes no control inputs.  If the spiral mode is ''stable'' and the pilot makes no inputs, when the aircraft starts from a ''banked'' attitude, it will return close to wings-level by itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

If a disturbance causes an aircraft to roll away from its normal wings-level position as in Figure 1, the aircraft will begin to move somewhat sideways toward the lower wing.&lt;ref&gt;Etkin, Bernard; ''Dynamics of Flight'' ;Section 3.10; 1982; {{ISBN|0-471-08936-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Figure 2, the airplane's flight path has started to move toward its left while the nose of the airplane is still pointing in the original direction.  This means that the oncoming air is arriving somewhat from the left of the nose. The airplane now has ''sideslip'' angle in addition to the bank angle.  Figure 2 shows the airplane as it presents itself to the oncoming air.

===How dihedral effect creates rolling moment from sideslip (induced roll)===
In Figure 2, the sideslip conditions produce greater [[angle of attack]] on the forward-yawed wing and smaller angle of attack on the rearward-yawed wing. This alteration of angle of attack by sideslip is visible in Figure 2. As greater angle of attack produces more lift (in the usual case, when the wing is not near stalling), the forward wing will have more lift and the rearward wing will have less lift. This difference in lift between the wings is a rolling moment, and since it is caused by sideslip, it is dihedral effect (or more correctly, it is a ''contribution'' to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft).

===How dihedral effect stabilizes the spiral mode===
The rolling moment created by the sideslip (labeled as "P") ''tends'' to roll the aircraft back to wings level.  More dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the "leveling" direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the "leveling" direction less strongly.  Dihedral effect helps stabilize the spiral mode by ''tending'' to roll the wings toward level in proportion to the amount of sideslip that builds up.  It's not the whole picture however.  At the same time that [[angle of sideslip]] is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of sideslip that can be present.  If there is no sideslip, there can be no restoring rolling moment.  If there is less sideslip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability created by the vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect to roll the wings back level by limiting sideslip.

The spiral mode is the tendency to slowly diverge from, or the tendency to slowly return to wings level.  If the spiral mode is stable, the aircraft will slowly return to wings-level, if it is unstable, the aircraft will slowly diverge from wings-level.  Dihedral effect and yaw stability are the two primary factors that affect the stability of the spiral mode, although there are other factors that affect it less strongly.

==Other factors contributing to dihedral effect==
[[File:TegelbergParaglider gobeirne.jpg|thumb|The [[center of gravity|CG]] of a [[paraglider]] is very low, making a strong contribution to dihedral effect]]
Factors of design other than dihedral angle also contribute to dihedral effect. Each increases or decreases total aircraft dihedral effect to a greater or lesser degree.

===Sweepback===
Wing [[Swept wing|sweepback]] also increases dihedral effect. This is one reason for anhedral configuration on aircraft with high sweep angle, as well as on some airliners, even on low-wing aircraft such as the [[Tu-134]] and [[Tu-154]], with the small German 1930s-1945 biplanes of the [[Bücker Flugzeugbau]], the [[Bucker Jungmann]] two-seat trainer and more famous [[Bücker Jungmeister]] aerobatic competition biplane, both having approximately 11º of wing sweepback giving both designs a degree of dihedral effect, beyond the small amount of dihedral both biplanes' designs also  featured.

===Vertical position of the center of mass===
The [[center of mass]], usually called the [[center of gravity]] or "CG", is the balance point of an aircraft.  If suspended at this point and allowed to rotate, a body (aircraft) will be balanced.  The front-to-back location of the CG is of primary importance for the general stability of the aircraft, but the vertical location has important effects as well.

The vertical location of the CG changes the amount of dihedral effect.  As the "vertical CG" moves lower, dihedral effect increases.  This is caused by the center of lift and drag being further above the CG and having a longer moment arm.  So, the same forces that change as sideslip changes (primarily sideforce, but also lift and drag) produce a larger moment about the CG of the aircraft.  This is sometimes referred to as the [[Keel effect|pendulum effect]].&lt;ref group=note name=pendulumkeel&gt;The "pendulum effect" is also less commonly called the "keel effect".&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example of the effect of vertical CG on dihedral effect is a [[paraglider]].  The dihedral effect created by the very low vertical CG more than compensates for the negative dihedral effect created by the strong anhedral&lt;ref group=note&gt;The downward curve of a paraglider wing could be termed "continuous polyanhedral".&lt;/ref&gt; of the necessarily strongly downward curving wing.

==Effects of too much dihedral effect==
A side effect of too much dihedral effect, caused by excessive dihedral angle among other things, can be yaw-roll coupling (a tendency for an aircraft to [[Dutch roll]]). This can be unpleasant to experience, or in extreme conditions it can lead to loss of control or can overstress an aircraft.

==Anhedral and polyhedral==
[[File:anhedral on harrier arp.jpg|thumb|Anhedral on the wings and tailplane of an [[RAF]] [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier GR7A]]]]

===Anhedral===
Military [[fighter aircraft]] often have near zero or even anhedral angle reducing dihedral effect and hence reducing the stability of the spiral mode. This increases maneuverability which is desirable in fighter-type aircraft.

Anhedral angles are also seen on aircraft with a high mounted wing, such as the very large [[Antonov An-124]] and [[Lockheed Galaxy]] cargo aircraft. In such designs, the high mounted wing is above the [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|aircraft's center of gravity]] which confers extra dihedral effect due to the [[pendulum]] effect (also called the [[keel effect]]) and so additional dihedral angle is often not required. Such designs can have excessive dihedral effect and so be excessively  stable in the spiral mode, so anhedral angle on the wing is added to cancel out some of the dihedral effect so that the aircraft can be more easily maneuvered.

===Polyhedral===
[[File:Mc Donnell Douglas F4-F Phantom v.jpg|thumb|McDonnell Douglas [[F-4 Phantom II]] showing polyhedral wing and anhedral tail]]
Most aircraft have been designed with planar wings with simple dihedral (or anhedral). Some older aircraft such as the [[F4U Corsair|Vought F4U Corsair]] and the [[Beriev Be-12]] were designed with [[gull wing]]s bent near the root.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Modern polyhedral wing designs generally bend upwards near the wingtips (also known as ''tip dihedral''), increasing dihedral effect without increasing the angle the wings meet at the root, which may be restricted to meet other design criteria.

Polyhedral is seen on [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s and some other aircraft. The [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] is one such example, unique among jet fighters for having dihedral wingtips. This was added after flight testing of the flat winged prototype showed the need to correct some unanticipated spiral mode instability – angling the wingtips, which were already designed to fold up for carrier operations, was a more practical solution than re-engineering the entire wing.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David and Jon Lake, eds.

The '''Embalse Nuclear Power Station''' ({{lang-es|Central Nuclear Embalse}}) is one of three operational [[nuclear power plant]]s in [[Argentina]]. It is located on the southern shore of a [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the Río Tercero, near the city of [[Embalse, Córdoba|Embalse]], [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]], 110&amp;nbsp;km south-southwest of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba City]].

The plant is a [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR). It employs [[natural uranium]] (that is, with 0.72% of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U) and uses [[heavy water]] for cooling and neutron moderation. It has a thermal power of 2,109&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]], and generates 648&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] of electricity, with a net output of about 600&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, supplying nearly 4.5% of the production of the [[Argentine Interconnection System]] (2005).

Additionally, Embalse produces the [[cobalt-60]] radioisotope, which is employed in medicine (cancer therapy) and industrial applications. Argentina is one of the largest producers and exporters of this isotope in the world,&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Canada]] and [[Russia]].

Embalse was started in 1974 and began operation in 1983 (first criticality 13 March 1983, declared commercial 20 January 1984). It was built by an [[Italy|Italian]]-Canadian consortium formed by [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]], acting as the [[Turnkey|"turn-key"]] supplier of the nuclear portion, and [[:it:Italimpianti|Italimpianti]], the "turn-key" supplier of the conventional portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 31 December 2015, the plant was taken offline, having completed its first operating cycle of about 30 years.

On 1 September 2016, the plant received the last two of four [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]], fundamental elements for the life extension of the plant. The plant is being reconditioned to deliver power for another 30 years: the replacement of the four steam generators is one of the key steps.

==Definitions==

===[[Energy]] in general===

[[European Commission]] definitions of energy efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/32/EC&lt;/ref&gt; are given below: 
* '''[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]]''': a ratio between an output of performance, service, goods or energy, and an input of energy; 
* '''Energy efficiency improvement''': an increase in energy end-use efficiency as a result of technological, behavioral and/or economic changes;
* '''Energy savings''' : an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of one or more energy efficiency improvement measures, whilst ensuring normalization for external conditions that affect energy consumption;

According to article 2(d) of the Regulation (EC) No1099/2008 on energy statistics:

* '''Energy''' means all forms of energy products (combustible fuels, heat, renewable energy, electricity, or any other form of energy)
* '''Primary energy consumption''' means gross inland consumption, excluding non-energy uses 
* '''Final energy consumption''' means all energy supplied to industry, transport, households, services and agriculture. It excludes deliveries to the energy transformation sector and the energy industries themselves.

===Energy in [[agriculture]]===
* '''Primary [[energy consumption]] (PEC) in agriculture''' &lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/32/EC&lt;/ref&gt; is the energy consumed in an agricultural production system (within the farm limits) including the energy for the production of all indirect inputs.
* '''Energy efficiency in agriculture improvement''' &lt;ref&gt;Energy Efficiency in Agriculture (AGREE), project, FP7-KBBE-2011-5-289139, http://www.agree.aua.gr&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the decrease of primary energy consumption for the production of a unit of agricultural product (expressed in weight or volume units), within the farm boundaries.

==European Union policies on energy efficiency==
European Commission requirements regarding energy use across the EU (Directive 2012/27/EU) establish a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the European Union to:
* Ensure the achievement of the Union’s 2020 20% headline target on energy efficiency 
* Pave the way for further energy efficiency improvements beyond that date
The directive also:
* Lays down rules designed to remove barriers in the energy market and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy.

Provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency targets for 2020Key measures with implications for the agricultural sector:
* Energy companies are requested to reduce energy sales by 1.5% every year among their customers. This can be achieved via improved heating systems, fitting double-glazed windows or insulating roofs. Measures to achieve higher energy efficiency should be applied in agricultural buildings too (e.g. greenhouses, animal housing, etc.).
* The public sector is required to renovate 3% of buildings "owned and occupied" by the central government in each country. Buildings need to have a useful area larger than 500 m2 in order to be covered by this requirement (lowered to 250 m2 as of July 2015). In many EU member states there are public sector (general government or regional or municipal) agricultural buildings (e.g. in some countries for agricultural product storage) that could be included in the measures taken by the national government.
* EU countries are requested to draw up a roadmap to make the entire buildings sector more energy efficient by 2050 (commercial, public and private households included). Making farm buildings more energy efficient contributes to this aim. Measures regarding existing agricultural buildings should be carried out and new legislation regarding new installations need to be adopted in the direction of improving their energy efficiency.
* Energy audits and management plans are required for large companies, with cost-benefit analyses for the deployment of combined heat and power generation (CHP) and public procurement. This has implications for large farm companies and large farmers associations and their buildings, storage rooms and greenhouses.
* Each country has to present national indicative targets by April 2013. If the European Commission estimates that those are insufficient to meet the EU's overall 2020 goal, then it can request member states to re-assess their plans.
* In the first semester of 2014, the Commission will review the progress towards the 20% energy-efficiency target, report on it and assess whether further measures are needed.
* If Europe is off track, the Commission intends to come back with a proposal for further legislation. Including agricultural activities in the general planning of each member state would help in covering the targets and avoid re-assessing on behalf of the European Commission. This comment applies to the last 3 remarks of the Directive.

==Recent developments and trends on energy efficiency in agriculture==
In the framework of the AGREE project [3], several state of the art studies on the energy efficiency of specific agricultural production systems of different types (arable crops, agro-forest, greenhouses, and animal husbandry) were executed in 2012-13 in Europe based on existing data from six countries and were combined in one [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Agree_State.pdf  report].

A stakeholder and driver analysis on energy efficiency in agriculture in all six countries and separate reports [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/D2.2%20Finland%20country%20report.pdf  Finland], [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/D2.2%20Germany%20country%20report.pdf  Germany], [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/EL%20NSM_template.pdf  Greece], [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/NL%20NSM_template.pdf Netherlands], [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/P%20NSM_template.pdf Poland], [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/PL%20NSM_template.pdf Portugal]) are available.

Energy efficiency measures were proposed for each agricultural system and presented in an  [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/D2.3%20Energy%20Efficiency%20Measures%20in%20Agr.pdf overview report]. A [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/D2.4%20Synthesis%20and%20Summary%20Reort.pdf synthesis and summary report]   on state of the art, drivers and stakeholders of energy efficiency in agriculture, and potential of energy saving hours is also available.

The most directly effective measures were taken into account in reporting their effect on energy consumption per unit of product in certain case studies in all seven countries taking into account trade-offs regarding GHG emissions and final farm cost. The results are presented in a [http://www.agree.aua.gr/Files/Publications/D3.1_Econ+enviro_analysis_of_EE_measures_in_Agr.pdf report] named Economic and environmental analysis of energy efficiency measures in agriculture – Case Studies and trade-offs.

An intensive stakeholder process, by organising national stakeholders meetings in six countries, revealed the opportunities and drawbacks for a future energy efficient agriculture in Europe. The results of this process are presented for six countries at special reports, one for each country (Finland, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal). The results of all reports are summarized in a synthesis report on transnational value of national stakeholders meetings.

The integration of the perspectives of representatives of different EU regions to achieve a future energy efficient agriculture in Europe, an output of a European transnational stakeholder meeting, is summarized in the [http://www.agree.aua.gr/.partnersarea/Files/Deliverables/AGREE%20D4.5%20Agenda%20for%20Transnational%20Cooperation_%20final.pdf Agenda] for transnational collaboration. This represents the shared views on how to improve energy efficiency in European agriculture.

==A new perspective on the energy efficiency in agriculture==
According to the work done in AGREE, suggestions were given on the definition of energy efficiency in agriculture

* Energy efficiency is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. The general term "energy efficiency in agriculture" reflects changes in technology, government policies, weather patterns, and farming management practices. 
* There is not a single measure to describe, ensure, and improve energy efficiency in agriculture. Instead, in the energy balance for a given production process, different indicators may serve and support energy efficiency analysis. 
* The AGREE results are based on the specific input of primary energy per cultivation area (GJ/ha) and on the specific input of primary energy per tonne of agricultural product (GJ/t). All measures that are suitable to reduce the specific energy input per unit of product improve energy efficiency (energy efficiency improvement measures). 
* Improving energy efficiency of agricultural production contributes directly to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

In [[supergravity]] theories combining [[general relativity]] and [[supersymmetry]], the '''gravitino''' ({{SubatomicParticle|Gravitino}}) is the gauge fermion  [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partner of the hypothesized [[graviton]].  It has been suggested as a candidate for [[dark matter]].

If it exists, it is a [[fermion]] of [[spin (physics)|spin]] {{sfrac|3|2}} and therefore obeys the [[Rarita-Schwinger equation]]. The gravitino field is conventionally written as ''ψ&lt;sub&gt;μα&lt;/sub&gt;'' with {{nowrap|1=''μ'' = 0, 1, 2, 3}} a [[four-vector]] index and {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 1, 2}} a [[spinor]] index.
For {{nowrap|μ {{=}} 0}} one would get negative norm modes, as with every massless particle of [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1 or higher. These modes are unphysical, and for [[unitarity (physics)|consistency]] there must be a [[gauge symmetry]] which cancels these modes: {{nowrap|1=''δψ&lt;sub&gt;μα&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''∂&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where ''ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is a [[spinor]] function of spacetime. This gauge symmetry is a local [[supersymmetry]] transformation, and the resulting theory is [[supergravity]].

Thus the gravitino is the fermion mediating supergravity interactions, just as the [[photon]] is mediating [[electromagnetism]], and the [[graviton]] is presumably mediating [[gravitation]]. Whenever supersymmetry is broken in supergravity theories, it acquires a mass which is determined by the scale at which supersymmetry is [[Supersymmetry breaking|broken]].  This varies greatly between different models of supersymmetry breaking, but if supersymmetry is to solve the [[hierarchy problem]] of the [[Standard Model]], the gravitino cannot be more massive than about 1 [[TeV]]/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Gravitino cosmological problem==
If the gravitino indeed has a mass of the order of TeV, then it creates a problem in the [[Lambda-CDM model|standard model of cosmology]], at least naïvely.&lt;ref&gt;T. Moroi, H. Murayama [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TVN-470W2Y9-3MP&amp;_user=48161&amp;_coverDate=04%2F15%2F1993&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005078&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=48161&amp;md5=7ec28111a55460b3dcc64b96a68a29de Cosmological constraints on the light stable gravitino] Phys.Lett.B303:289–294,1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Okada, O. Seto [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0407235 A brane world cosmological solution to the gravitino problem] Phys. Rev. D 71:023517,2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. de Gouvea, T. Moroi, H. Murayama [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9701244 Cosmology of Supersymmetric Models with Low-energy Gauge Mediation] Phys. Rev. D 56:1281–1299,1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Endo [http://susy06.physics.uci.edu/talks/5/endo.pdf Moduli Stabilization and Moduli-Induced Gravitino Problem] talk given at SUSY’06, 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One option is that the gravitino is stable. This would be the case if the gravitino is the [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle|lightest supersymmetric particle]] and [[R-parity]] is conserved (or nearly so). In this case the gravitino is a candidate for [[dark matter]]; as such gravitinos will have been created in the very early universe. However, one may calculate the density of gravitinos and it turns out to be much higher than the observed [[dark matter]] density.

The other option is that the gravitino is unstable. Thus the gravitinos mentioned above would decay and will not contribute to the observed [[dark matter]] density. However, since they decay only through gravitational interactions, their [[Mean lifetime|lifetime]] would be very long, of the order of {{nowrap|''M&lt;sub&gt;pl&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∕ ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in [[natural units]], where ''M&lt;sub&gt;pl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Planck mass]] and ''m'' is the mass of a gravitino. For a gravitino mass of the order of TeV this would be {{val|e=5|u=seconds}}, much later than the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|era of nucleosynthesis]]. At least one possible channel of decay must include either a [[photon]], a charged [[lepton]] or a [[meson]], each of which would be energetic enough to destroy a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] if it strikes one. One can show that enough such energetic particles will be created in the decay as to destroy almost all the nuclei created in the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|era of nucleosynthesis]], in contrast with observations. In fact, in such a case the universe would have been made of [[hydrogen]] alone, and [[star formation]] would probably be impossible.

One possible solution to the cosmological gravitino problem is the [[split supersymmetry]] model, where the gravitino mass is much higher than the TeV scale, but other fermionic supersymmetric partners of standard model particles already appear at this scale.

Another solution is that [[R-parity]] is slightly violated and the gravitino is the lightest [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particle. This causes almost all [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particles in the early Universe to decay into Standard Model particles via [[R-parity]] violating interactions well before the synthesis of primordial nuclei; a small fraction however decay into gravitinos, whose half-life is orders of magnitude greater than the age of the Universe due to the suppression of the decay rate by the [[Planck scale]] and the small [[R-parity]] violating couplings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0005214 F. Takayama and M. Yamaguchi, Phys. Lett. B 485 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Development Markup Language''' ('''IDML''') is an [[XML]]-based standard for the exchange of information on [[aid]] activities. It is used by a number of donors to provide information to the [[AidData]] database of [[aid|development finance]].

IDML was developed from 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huesemann|first=Stefan|title=Information exchange between humanitarian organizations: Using the XML Schema IDML|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Systems|year=2002|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; onwards, building on a previous text-file format for exchanging development information, CEFDA (Common Format for Exchange of Development Information).

Ideas from IDML were also fed into the development of the XML format used in the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative]] (IATI).

'''It’s on the Meter – World Taxi Challenge''' was a round-the-world motoring expedition that broke the [[Guinness World Record]]s for the longest ever journey by [[taxicab|taxi]] and the highest altitude ever reached by taxi.  The expedition’s three-man team used a 1992 [[Austin FX4|Fairway Driver London Black Cab]] to drive  43,319.5  miles (69,716.12&amp;nbsp;km) around the world.

The expedition officially began at the [[London Transport Museum]] on 17 February 2011 and finished at the same point on 11 May 2012 having circumnavigated the globe. 
The team raised £20,000 for the [[British Red Cross]]; the nominal meter fee for the finished journey was £79,006.80.&lt;ref name="justgiving1"&gt;{{cite web|author=The British Red Cross Society |url=http://www.justgiving.com/itsonthemeter |title=Johno Ellison is fundraising for The British Red Cross Society |publisher=Justgiving.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18025836 | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Black cab trio set longest taxi journey world record | date=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The expedition was conceived of in 2008 when the participants were travelling by taxi and wondered how high a taxi meter fee had ever been.

The team researched the previous record which stood at 21,691 miles (34,908&amp;nbsp;km)  and was set in 1994.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-12478784 |title=BBC News – London to Sydney taxi ride aims to break world record |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then planned a new route from [[London]] to [[Sydney]] with an estimated distance of 32,000 miles, bought a taxi for £1500 on [[eBay]] and began securing sponsorship.

The expedition departed from the [[London Transport Museum]] on 17 February 2011 with support from [[Boris Johnson]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and [[Sir Ranulph Fiennes]].

The team broke the previous record in August 2011 in [[Tibet]] having travelled through 34 countries.

The expedition arrived in Sydney, Australia, nine months after setting off from London having travelled through forty-one countries and three continents.

Upon arrival in Sydney the team announced that they had secured a sponsorship partnership with [[Smartphone]] Taxi ordering-[[Mobile apps|app]] company [[GetTaxi]] and would be extending the expedition back to London via the United States, Israel, Russia and [[Europe]].

The vehicle was shipped from Sydney to [[San Francisco]] over the [[Christmas]] of 2011 and the team continued the journey from [[California]] to [[New York (state)|New York]] before [[air-freighting]] the car to Israel in March 2012.

The expedition then shipped from Israel to Greece before continuing back through Russia, Europe and Spain and finishing in London on 11 May 2012.

==Route==
The route was designed to take ''“the longest route ever, because taxi drivers always take all the longest way around,”'' and encompassed over fifty countries.

[[File:It's on the Meter team and car in Turkey.jpg|thumb|It's on the Meter team in Cappadocia, Turkey]]

The expedition started in Covent Garden, London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/londonnews/8866378.London_to_Sydney_taxi_ride_aims_to_break_world_record_and_raise_cash_to_pay_the_meter/ |title=London to Sydney taxi ride aims to break world record and raise cash to pay the meter (From This Is Local London) |publisher=Thisislocallondon.co.uk |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before driving to Dover, England and ferrying over to France. The expedition then passed through Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and into Finland where the team drove to the [[Arctic Circle]] and saw the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Northern Lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gilroydispatch.com/news/community/their-fare-lady-world-travelers-stop-in-south-county/article_61b57c96-ec65-5279-9b82-90441977a7bc.html |title=Their fare lady; world travelers stop in South County – Gilroy Dispatch: Community |publisher=Gilroy Dispatch |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition then travelled through Russia (where the team were arrested in Moscow), Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, France, Monaco, Italy and San Marino. The original route took the team down to Sicily to catch a ferry to Tunisia but due to the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|conflict in Libya]] the route was revised to instead pass through the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsonthemeter.com/route.html |title=Route &amp;#124; It's on the Meter – World Taxi Challenge |publisher=Itsonthemeter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team passed through Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia and Greece before arriving in Turkey in April 2011. Due to the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian civil war|demonstrations in Syria]] the team further modified the route and next travelled to Georgia and Armenia before heading back into Turkey and down into Iraq. Whilst in northern Kurdistan their radiator burst but a replacement was built in [[Arbil]] auto bazaar and the team continued into Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://foxnomad.com/2011/04/19/catching-up-with-its-on-the-meter-the-worlds-longest-taxi-ride/ |title=Catching Up With It's On The Meter: The World's Longest Taxi Ride |publisher=foXnoMad |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the Iranian city of [[Qom]] the team were detained and questioned by the [[secret police]] after mistakenly camping next to an [[artillery|artillery installation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3761084/Three-pals-are-driving-from-London-to-Sydney-in-a-black-cab.html |title=Three pals are driving from London to Sydney – in a black cab &amp;#124; The Sun &amp;#124;News |publisher=The Sun |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |first=Gary |last=O'Shea}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Archer and Purnell travelled by air to Dubai in order to obtain Pakistani visas and Ellison (who had already secured a visa in the UK) continued through the [[Baluchistan|Baluchistan desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2029232/Dodging-Taliban-Afghanistan-driving-sheep-Armenia-Three-pals-travel-London-Sydney--black-cab.html |title=Dodging Taliban in Afghanistan and driving with sheep in Armenia: Three pals travel from London to Sydney... in a black cab &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=[[Dailymail.co.uk]] |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team was reunited in Pakistan and continued through India, Nepal, Tibet (where the previous record's distance was broken) and China, arriving in Laos in September 2011. The journey then continued through Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia before the vehicle was shipped from Singapore to Darwin, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Loten |first=Angus |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304636404577293500656646434?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_RIGHTTopCarousel_1#articleTabs%3Darticle |title=How to Run Up a $100K Cab Fare? Exit British Pub, Turn Left in Mumbai – WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival in Australia the vehicle was subject to strict [[quarantine]] fines but upon its release travelled through the [[Northern Territory]] and down the East Coast, arriving at the intended destination on 10 December 2011.

At this point the team announced that they had partnered with a new sponsor, [[GetTaxi]] and now intended to drive the vehicle back to London having circumnavigated the world. The car was shipped from Sydney to San Francisco and the team returned to the UK for a Christmas break.

After lengthy delays the car was released from [[Port of Oakland|Oakland Port]] in February 2012 and the team drove across the USA, arriving at New York in March 2012. The car was then air-freighted to Israel from where it will be shipped to Greece before continuing north to Moscow.

The final leg headed through the Baltics and Eastern Europe before passing through Germany, Luxembourg and France. The car was then taken back to the United Kingdom via the Channel Tunnel and arrived back at the start point in London on 11 May 2012.

The mileage of the entire journey was 43,208.4 miles (69,537.18&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/5/%C2%A380000-fare-for-the-worlds-longest-taxi-journey%E2%80%8E-41649&lt;/ref&gt; more than double the previous record.  The nominal taxi fare reached £79,006.80.

==Vehicles==
The expedition vehicle was an extensively modified 1992 [[Austin FX4]] taxi named Hannah, after the song [[Hard Hearted Hannah]] which tells of a woman who ''hates men and loves to see them suffer''.&lt;ref name="morganhilltimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.morganhilltimes.com/news/community/a-taxi-heard-around-the-world/article_663386d8-61a9-11e1-a0e7-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=story |title=A taxi heard around the world – Morgan Hill Times: Community |publisher=Morgan Hill Times |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was powered by a Nissan 2.7 litre Turbo Diesel engine which the team claimed was the only part of the car not to have broken stating that this is because it is ''"Japanese-made whereas the rest of the car was made in England"''.&lt;ref name="morganhilltimes1"/&gt;

[[File:It's on the Meter vehicles in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|It's on the Meter expedition vehicles "Hannah" and "Skinny Margarita" with team members at the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco.]]
 
The car was purchased for £1500 on eBay and modifications include the addition of winch, snorkel, roof rack and roof box. The car's brakes, suspension, cooling and electric systems were also overhauled and updated. Inside the partition between the driver and passengers was removed, a front passenger seat was added, the rear-facing rear seats were removed and a sound system was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/three-friends-have-run-up-a-world-93515 |title=Three friends have run up a world record £54,000 on a taxi meter on a charity trip to Australia – Mirror Online |publisher=[[Mirror.co.uk]] |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mileage of the car when purchased was estimated at 300,000 miles and the team states that it broke down, ''"every other day"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer |first=Paul |url=http://www.gapyear.com/articles/151027/its-on-the-meter |title=It’s on the Meter |publisher=Gap Year |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team did not have a support vehicle but was joined for the USA leg of the expedition by a United States [[Yellow Taxi]]. The team met Jon Anders, previously a resident of Texas, in Pakistan and joked, ''"If you buy a Yellow Cab you can join us for the US section"''. The driver took the team up on the offer and purchased a [[Ford Crown Victoria]] which was named ''Skinny Margarita'' after an old advertisement attached to the roof.

==Team==
The expedition was conceived and organised by Leigh Purnell, Johno Ellison and Paul Archer, three friends who met whilst studying at [[Aston University]].

==Charity==
The expedition raised both awareness and funds for the [[British Red Cross]]. The team decided to choose the Red Cross due to the fundraising work they carry out both in the UK and Worldwide as well as the worldwide support they could offer the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/Get-involved/Get-fundraising/Fundraise-for-us/Our-fantastic-fundraisers/Johno-Leigh-and-Pauls-story-raising-10000-on-the-meter |title=Johno, Leigh and Paul’s story: raising £10,000 on the meter |publisher=Redcross.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The expedition raised £20,000 for the charity.&lt;ref name="justgiving1"/&gt;

==Book==
A book, ''It's on the Meter: One Taxi, Three Mates and 43,000 Miles of Misadventures around the World'', is due to be released on 10 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Its-Meter-Three-Misadventures-around/dp/1849538255&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has also contributed articles to various magazines and blogs and Johno Ellison's account of the team's arrest in Russia was published in upcoming travel book ''From the Grand Canyon to the Great Wall'' released in Summer 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40237">'''Semiconductor materials''' are nominally small [[band gap]] [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. The defining property of a [[semiconductor]] material is that it can be [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with impurities that alter its electronic properties in a controllable way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-3818-9_12|chapter=Control of Semiconductor Conductivity by Doping|author=Jones, E.D.|title=Electronic Materials|editors=Miller, L. S., and Mullin, J. B.|publisher=Plenum Press|place=New York|year=1991|pages=155–171|isbn=978-1-4613-6703-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Or is that what makes it useful for semiconduàawaaactor devices ? --&gt;

Because of their application in the [[computer]] and [[photovoltaic]] industry—in devices such as [[transistor]]s, [[laser]]s, and [[solar cell]]s—the search for new semiconductor materials and the improvement of existing materials is an important field of study in [[materials science]].

Most commonly used semiconductor materials are [[crystalline]] inorganic solids. These materials are classified according to the [[Group (periodic table)|periodic table groups]] of their constituent [[atoms]].

Different semiconductor materials differ in their properties.  Thus, in comparison with [[silicon]], [[compound semiconductor]]s have both advantages and disadvantages. &lt;!-- This is a rather lenghy excursion into GaAs --&gt; For example, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) has six times higher [[electron mobility]] than silicon, which allows faster operation; wider [[band gap]], which allows operation of power devices at higher temperatures, and gives lower [[thermal noise]] to low power devices at room temperature; its [[direct band gap]] gives it more favorable [[optoelectronic]] properties than the [[indirect bandgap|indirect band gap]] of silicon; it can be alloyed to ternary and quaternary compositions, with adjustable band gap width, allowing light emission at chosen wavelengths, and allowing [[e.g.]] matching to wavelengths with lowest losses in optical fibers. GaAs can be also grown in a semi-insulating form, which is suitable as a lattice-matching insulating substrate for GaAs devices. Conversely, silicon is robust, cheap, and easy to process, whereas GaAs is brittle and expensive, and insulation layers can not be created by just growing an oxide layer; GaAs is therefore used only where silicon is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Ohring [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxSyMjosCwcC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=semiconductor+failure+microphotograph&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=32#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Reliability and failure of electronic materials and devices] Academic Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-12-524985-3}}, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

By alloying multiple compounds, some semiconductor materials are tunable, e.g., in [[band gap]] or [[lattice constant]]. The result is ternary, quaternary, or even quinary compositions. Ternary compositions allow adjusting the band gap within the range of the involved binary compounds; however, in case of combination of direct and indirect band gap materials there is a ratio where indirect band gap prevails, limiting the range usable for optoelectronics; e.g. AlGaAs [[light emitting diode|LEDs]] are limited to 660&amp;nbsp;nm by this. Lattice constants of the compounds also tend to be different, and the lattice mismatch against the substrate, dependent on the mixing ratio, causes defects in amounts dependent on the mismatch magnitude; this influences the ratio of achievable radiative/nonradiative recombinations and determines the luminous efficiency of the device. Quaternary and higher compositions allow adjusting simultaneously the band gap and the lattice constant, allowing increasing radiant efficiency at wider range of wavelengths; for example AlGaInP is used for LEDs. Materials transparent to the generated wavelength of light are advantageous, as this allows more efficient extraction of photons from the bulk of the material. That is, in such transparent materials, light production is not limited to just the surface. Index of refraction is also composition-dependent and influences the extraction efficiency of photons from the material.&lt;ref name="handopto"&gt;John Dakin, Robert G. W.

==Compound semiconductors==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
A ''compound semiconductor'' is a semiconductor [[Chemical compound|compound]] composed of [[chemical element]]s of at least two different species. These semiconductors typically form in [[Group (periodic table)|periodic table groups]] 13–15 (old groups III–V), for example of elements from the [[Boron group ]] (old group III, [[boron]], [[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]) and from [[Nitrogen group|group 15]] (old group V, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]]). The range of possible formulae is quite broad because these elements can form binary (two elements, e.g. [[gallium(III) arsenide]] (GaAs)), ternary (three elements, e.g. [[indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs)) and quaternary (four elements, e.g. [[aluminium gallium indium phosphide]] (AlInGaP)) alloys.

===Fabrication===
[[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOVPE) is the most popular deposition technology for the formation of compound semiconducting thin films for devices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} It uses ultrapure [[metalorganics]] and/or [[hydride]]s as [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] source materials in an ambient gas such as [[hydrogen]].

Other techniques of choice include:

* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE)
* [[Hydride vapour phase epitaxy]] (HVPE)
* [[Liquid phase epitaxy]] (LPE)
* [[Metal-organic molecular beam epitaxy]] (MOMBE)
* [[Atomic layer deposition]] (ALD)

[[Image:Mainspring Chinese uncoiled.jpg|thumb|An uncoiled modern watch mainspring.]]
[[Image:Clock Mainspring.png|thumb|Clock mainspring]]
[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]

A '''mainspring''' is a spiral [[torsion spring]] of metal ribbon—commonly [[spring steel]]—used as a power source in [[mechanical watch]]es, some [[clock]]s, and other [[clockwork]] mechanisms. ''Winding'' the timepiece, by turning a knob or key, stores [[energy]] in the mainspring by twisting the spiral tighter. The force of the mainspring then turns the clock's wheels as it unwinds, until the next winding is needed. The adjectives '''wind-up''' and '''spring-powered''' refer to mechanisms powered by mainsprings, which also include kitchen [[timer]]s, [[music box]]es, wind-up [[toy]]s and [[clockwork radio]]s.

== Modern mainsprings ==
[[Image:watch mainsprings.png|thumb|left|Elgin pocketwatch mainsprings from around 1910, showing the three types (l-r): spiral, semi-reverse, reverse.]]
A modern watch mainspring is a long strip of hardened and blued steel, or specialised steel alloy, 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm long and 0.05-0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The mainspring in the common 1-day movement is calculated to enable the watch to run for 36 to 40 hours, i.e. 24 hours between daily windings with a power-reserve of 12 to 16 hours, in case the owner is late winding the watch.   This is the normal standard for hand-wound as well as [[Automatic watch|self-winding watch]]es. 8-Day movements, used in clocks meant to be wound weekly, provide power for at least 192 hours but use longer mainsprings and bigger [[Barrel (horology)|barrel]]s. Clock mainsprings are similar to watch springs, only larger.

Since 1945, [[carbon steel]] [[alloys]] have been increasingly superseded by newer special alloys ([[iron]], [[nickel]] and [[chromium]] with the addition of [[cobalt]], [[molybdenum]], or [[beryllium]]), and also by [[Cold rolling|cold-rolled]] alloys ('structural hardening'). Known to watchmakers as 'white metal' springs (as opposed to blued carbon steel), these are [[stainless steel|stainless]] and have a higher [[elastic limit]]. They are less subject to permanent bending (becoming [[#'Tired' or 'set' mainsprings|'tired']]) and there is scarcely any risk of their breaking. Some of them are also practically non-[[magnetic]].

In their relaxed form, mainsprings are made in three distinct shapes:
*''Spiral coiled'': These are coiled in the same direction throughout, in a simple spiral.
*''Semi-reverse'': The outer end of the spring is coiled in the reverse direction for less than one turn (less than 360°).
*''Reverse'' (resilient): the outer end of the spring is coiled in the reverse direction for one or more turns (exceeding 360°).
The semi-reverse and reverse types provide extra force at the end of the running period, when the spring is almost out of energy, in order to keep the timepiece running at a constant rate to the end.

[[Image:Alarm clock mainspring.JPG|thumb|Mainspring in a 1950s alarm clock. The end of the spring is attached to the frame post at lower right.]]
[[Image:Going barrel.png|thumb|Cross section of a going barrel in a watch (mainspring fully wound).]]
[[Image:Dscf3997 FederhausKleinuhr.jpg|thumb|Going barrel of a watch, opened.]]
The mainspring is coiled around an axle called the arbor, with the inner end hooked to it. In many clocks, the outer end is attached to a stationary post. The spring is wound up by turning the arbor, and after winding its force turns the arbor the other way to run the clock. The disadvantage of this ''open spring'' arrangement is that while the mainspring is being wound, its drive force is removed from the clock movement, so the clock may stop. This type is often used on [[alarm clock]]s, [[music box]]es and kitchen [[timer]]s where it doesn't matter if the mechanism stops while winding. The winding mechanism always has a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] attached, with a [[Ratchet (device)|pawl]] (called by clockmakers the ''click'') to prevent the spring from unwinding.

In the form used in modern watches, called the ''[[Barrel (horology)|going barrel]]'', the mainspring is coiled around an arbor and enclosed inside a cylindrical box called the [[Barrel (horology)|barrel]] which is free to turn. The spring is attached to the arbor at its inner end, and to the barrel at its outer end. The attachments are small hooks or tabs, which the spring is hooked to by square holes in its ends, so it can be easily replaced.

The mainspring is wound by turning the arbor, but drives the watch movement by the barrel; this arrangement allows the spring to continue powering the watch while it is being wound. Winding the watch turns the arbor, which tightens the mainspring, wrapping it closer around the arbor. The arbor has a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] attached to it, with a click to prevent the spring from turning the arbor backward and unwinding. After winding, the arbor is stationary and the pull of the mainspring turns the barrel, which has a ring of gear teeth around it. This meshes with one of the clocks gears, usually the ''center wheel'' [[pinion]] and drives the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The barrel usually rotates once every 8 hours, so the common 40-hour spring requires 5 turns to unwind completely.

===Hazards===
The mainspring contains a lot of energy. Clocks and watches have to be disassembled periodically for maintenance and repair, and if precautions are not taken the spring can release suddenly, causing serious injury. Mainsprings are 'let down' gently before servicing, by pulling the click back while holding the winding key, allowing the spring to slowly unwind. However, even in their 'let down' state, mainsprings contain dangerous residual tension. [[Watchmaker]]s and [[clockmaker]]s use a tool called a "mainspring winder" to safely install and remove them. Large mainsprings in clocks are immobilized by "mainspring clamps" before removal.

== History ==
Mainsprings appeared in the first spring-powered clocks, in 15th-century Europe. It replaced the weight hanging from a cord wrapped around a pulley, which was the power source used in all previous mechanical clocks. Around 1400 coiled springs began to be used in locks,&lt;ref name="White1966" &gt;{{cite book

The first mainsprings were made of steel without [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]] or [[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardening]] processes. They didn't run very long, and had to be wound twice a day. Henlein was noted for making watches that would run 40 hours between windings.

=== Constant force from a spring ===

}}

A problem throughout the history of spring-driven clocks and watches is that the force ([[torque]]) provided by a spring is not constant, but diminishes as the spring unwinds (see graph). However, timepieces have to run at a constant rate in order to keep accurate time. Timekeeping mechanisms are never perfectly [[isochronous]], meaning their rate is affected by changes in the drive force. This was especially true of the primitive [[verge and foliot]] type used before the advent of the [[balance spring]] in 1657. So early clocks slowed down during their running period as the mainspring ran down, causing inaccurate timekeeping.  

Two solutions to this problem appeared in the early spring-powered clocks in the 15th century; the ''[[stackfreed]]'' and the ''[[fusee (horology)|fusee]]'':

====Stackfreed====
{{main|Stackfreed}}
The stackfreed was an eccentric [[cam]] mounted on the mainspring arbor, with a spring-loaded roller that pressed against it. The cam was shaped so that early in the running period when the mainspring was pushing strongly, the stackfreed would provide an opposing force, while later when the mainspring was almost run down and pushing weakly, it would provide a helping force. The stackfreed added a lot of friction and probably reduced a clock's running time substantially; it was rarely used and was abandoned after about a century.

====Fusee====
{{main|Fusee (horology)}}
The [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] was a much longer-lasting innovation. This was a cone-shaped [[pulley]] that was turned by a chain wrapped around the mainspring barrel. Its curving shape continuously changed the [[mechanical advantage]] of the linkage to even out the force of the mainspring as it ran down. Fusees became the standard method of getting constant torque from a mainspring. They were used in most spring-driven clocks and watches from their first appearance until the 19th century when the going barrel took over, and in [[marine chronometer]]s until the 1970s.

====Stopwork====
Another early device which helped even out the spring's force was ''stopwork'' or ''winding stops'', which prevented the mainspring from being wound up all the way, and prevented it from unwinding all the way. The idea was to use only the central part of the spring's 'torque curve', where its force was more constant. The most common form was the [[Geneva stop]] or 'Maltese cross'. Stopwork isn't needed in modern watches.

====Remontoire====
{{main|Remontoire}}
A fourth device used in a few precision timepieces was the [[remontoire]]. This was a small secondary spring or weight which powered the timepiece's [[escapement]], and was itself rewound periodically by the mainspring. This isolated the timekeeping element from the varying mainspring force.

}}

====Going barrel====
The modern ''[[Barrel (horology)|going barrel]]'', invented in 1760 by [[Jean-Antoine Lépine]], produces a constant force by simply using a longer mainspring than needed, and coiling it under tension in the barrel. In operation, only a few turns of the spring at a time are used, with the remainder pressed against the outer wall of the barrel. Mathematically, the tension creates a 'flat' section in the spring's 'torque curve' (see graph at right) and only this flat section is used. In addition, the outer end of the spring is often given a 'reverse' curve, so it has an 'S' shape. This stores more tension in the spring's outer turns where it is available toward the end of the running period. The result is that the barrel provides approximately constant [[torque]] over the watch's designed running period; the torque doesn't decline until the mainspring has almost run down.

The built-in tension of the spring in the going barrel makes it hazardous to disassemble even when not wound up.

== Broken mainsprings ==
Because they are subjected to constant [[Cyclic stress|stress cycles]], up until the 1960s mainsprings generally broke from [[metal fatigue]] long before other parts of the timepiece. They were considered expendable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Why do mainsprings break?| work =Technical Note TD105| publisher =Hamilton Watch Co.| url =http://vmuseum.ehorology.com/albums/images01/2411062521_Technical_DataTD_105-1.txt| doi =| accessdate =2007-10-08}} on [http://vmuseum.ehorology.com/index.php NAWCC eHorology Virtual Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827183727/http://vmuseum.ehorology.com/index.php |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This often happened at the end of the winding process, when the spring is wound as tightly as possible around the arbor, with no space between the coils.  When manually winding, it is easy to reach this point unexpectedly and put excessive pressure on the spring. Another cause was temperature changes. If a watch was fully wound in the evening and the temperature dropped at night, without any slack between the coils the thermal contraction of the long spring could break it loose from its attachments at one end. In earlier times, watch repairers noted that changes in the weather brought in a rash of watches with broken mainsprings. Broken mainsprings were the largest cause of watch repairs until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html
|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the improvements in spring [[metallurgy]] mentioned above have made broken mainsprings rare.

==='Knocking' or 'banking'===
Even if the mainsprings were not prone to breakage, too much force during winding caused another problem in early watches, called 'knocking' or 'banking'.&lt;ref name="DeCarle"&gt;{{cite book
|last=De Carle
|first=Donald
|title=Practical Watch Repairing, 3rd Ed.

|location=London
|isbn=0-7198-0030-7 }}, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; If very little slack was left in the spring after winding ('overwinding"), the pressure of the last turn of the winding knob put the end of the spring under excessive tension, which was locked in by the last click of the ratchet. So the watch ran with excessive drive force for several hours, until the extra tension in the end of the spring was relieved. This made the [[balance wheel]] rotate too far in each direction, causing the impulse pin on the wheel to knock against the back of the fork horns. This caused the watch to gain time, and could break the impulse pin. In older watches this was prevented with 'stopwork'. In modern watches this is prevented by designing the 'click' with some 'recoil' ([[backlash (engineering)|backlash]]), to allow the arbor to rotate backward after winding by about two ratchet teeth, enough to remove excess tension.

===Motor or safety barrel===
Around 1900, when broken watchsprings were more of a problem, some pocketwatches used a variation of the going barrel called the ''motor barrel'' or ''safety barrel''. Mainsprings usually broke at their attachment to the arbor, where bending [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] are greatest. When the mainspring broke, the outer part recoiled and the [[momentum]] spun the barrel in the reverse direction. This applied great force to the delicate [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]] and [[escapement]], often breaking pivots and jewels.

In the motor barrel, the functions of the arbor and barrel were reversed from the going barrel. The mainspring was wound by the barrel, and turned the arbor to drive the wheel train. Thus if the mainspring broke, the destructive recoil of the barrel would be applied not to the wheel train but to the winding mechanism, which was robust enough to take it.

===Safety pinion===
A ''safety pinion'' was an alternate means of protection, used with the going barrel. In this, the centre wheel [[pinion]], which the barrel gear engages, was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread. If the spring broke, the reverse recoil of the barrel, instead of being passed on to the gear train, would simply unscrew the pinion.

==The myth of 'overwinding'==
Watches and clocks are often found stopped with the mainspring fully wound, which led to a myth that winding a spring-driven timepiece all the way up damages it.&lt;ref name="Gainey"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Gainey

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several problems can cause this type of breakdown, but it is almost never due to "overwinding", as timepieces are designed to handle being wound up all the way.&lt;ref name="Gainey" /&gt; Watch movements, in particular, require regular cleaning and lubrication, and the normal result of neglecting to get a watch cleaned is a watch stopped at full wind. As the watch movement collects dirt and the oil dries up, friction increases, so that the mainspring doesn't have the force to turn the watch at the end of its normal running period, and it stops prematurely. If the owner continues to wind and use the watch without servicing, eventually the friction force reaches the 'flat' part of the torque curve, and quickly a point is reached where the mainspring doesn't have the force to run the watch even at full wind, so the watch stops with the mainspring fully wound. The watch needs service, but the problem is caused by a dirty movement or other defect, not "overwinding".

==Self-winding watches and 'unbreakable' mainsprings==
[[Image:Watch automatic mainspring.jpg|thumb|The mainspring of an automatic watch. The spring isn't firmly mounted on the left side, and will slip when fully wound.]]
Self-winding or [[automatic watch]]es, introduced widely in the 1950s, use the natural motions of the wrist to keep the mainspring wound. A semicircular weight, pivoted at the center of the watch, rotates with each wrist motion. A winder mechanism uses rotations in both directions to wind the mainspring.

In automatic watches, motion of the wrist could continue winding the mainspring until it broke. This is prevented with a slipping [[clutch]] device.&lt;ref&gt;De Carle 1969, p.90-91&lt;/ref&gt; The outer end of the mainspring, instead of attaching to the barrel, is attached to a circular expansion spring called the ''bridle'' that presses against the inner wall of the barrel, which has serrations or notches to hold it.  During normal winding the bridle holds by friction to the barrel, allowing the mainspring to wind. When the mainspring reaches its full tension, its pull is stronger than the bridle. Further rotation of the arbor causes the bridle to slip along the barrel, preventing further winding. In watch company terminology, this is often misleadingly referred to as an 'unbreakable mainspring'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=='Tired' or 'set' mainsprings==
After decades of use, mainsprings in older timepieces are found to deform slightly and lose some of their force, becoming 'tired' or 'set'. This condition is mostly found in springs in barrels. It causes the running time between windings to decrease. During servicing the mainspring should be checked for 'tiredness' and replaced if necessary. The British Horological Institute suggests these tests:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop hints: mainsprings|publisher=[http://www.bhi.co.uk/oldindex.htm British Horological Institute website]|year=1997|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/aHints/msprhnts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a mainspring barrel, when unwound and relaxed, most of a healthy spring's turns should be pressed flat against the wall of the barrel, with only 1 or 2 turns spiralling across the central space to attach to the arbor. If more than 2 turns are loose in the center, the spring may be 'tired'; with 4 or 5 turns it definitely is 'tired'.
* When removed from the barrel, if the diameter of the relaxed spring lying on a flat surface is less than 2½ times the barrel diameter, it is 'tired'.

==Power reserve indicator==
{{Main|Power reserve}}
[[File:Orient SFD0H001B.jpg|thumb|The power reserve is at the 6 position on this automatic watch. Here it is indicating that 25 out of 40 hours remain]]

Some high grade watches have an extra dial on the face indicating how much power is left in the mainspring, often graduated in hours the watch has left to run. Since both the arbor and the barrel turn, this mechanism requires a [[differential gear]] that measures how far the arbor has been turned, compared to the barrel.

==Unusual forms of mainspring==
A mainspring is usually a coiled metal spring, however there are exceptions:
* The wagon spring clock: During a brief time in American clockmaking history, coilable spring steel was not available in the United States, and inventive clockmakers built clocks powered by a stack of [[leaf spring]]s, similar to what has traditionally served as a suspension spring for wagons.
* Other spring types are conceivable and have been used occasionally on experimental timepieces, such as torsion springs.
* Occasionally one finds an odd clock with a spring made of material other than metal, such as synthetic elastic materials.

'''Malabo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|b|oʊ}}; {{IPA-es|maˈlaβo}}; formerly '''Santa Isabel''') is the capital of [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[provinces of Equatorial Guinea|province]] of [[Bioko Norte]]. It is located on the north coast of the island of [[Bioko]], formerly known by the [[Bubi people|Bubis]], its indigenous inhabitants, as ''Etulá'', and as ''Fernando Pó'' by the Europeans. The city has a population of approximately 187,302 inhabitants.{{when|date=November 2016}}

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of the city and of the country as well. Spanish is the most-spoken language and practically the only one used, except some French and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Malabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. Many buildings in the city are built in a [[colonial architecture|colonial]] style, dating from the times of Spanish rule, coexisting with modern buildings built since independence. The downtown streets have a square design, with pedestrian areas. This phenomenon causes a feeling of architecture attenuated by the low height of buildings in a combination of architectural Westernization and Africanism.

[[Ciudad de la Paz]] is a [[planned city]] currently under construction in mainland Equatorial Guinea which was designed to replace Malabo as the capital. The institutions of governance of Equatorial Guinea began the process of locating to Oyala in February 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38911573|title=E Guinea government moves into forest HQ|date=8 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Discovery and Portuguese conquest===
[[File:Isla de Fernando Poo – Vista de la playa y ciudad de Santa Isabel.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
In 1472, in an attempt to find a new route to [[India]], the Portuguese navigator [[Fernão do Pó]],  encountered the island of Bioko, which he called "Formosa". Later the island was named after its discoverer, Fernando Pó. At the beginning of the 16th century, specifically in 1507, the Portuguese Ramos de Esquivel made a first attempt at colonization on the island of Fernando Pó. He established a factory in ''[[Riaba|Concepción]]'' (current Riaba) and developed plantations of [[sugarcane]], but the hostility of the insular Bubi people and diseases ended this experience quickly.

With the treaties of San Ildefonso in 1777 and [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|El Pardo]] in 1778, during the reign of the Spanish King Carlos III the Portuguese gave to the Spanish island of Fernando Pó, Annobón and the right to conduct trade in the mainland, an area of influence approximately of 800&amp;nbsp;000 [[Square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] in Africa, in exchange for the [[Colonia del Sacramento]] in the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] and the Santa Catalina Island off the Brazilian coast (occupied by the Spaniards). The area stretching from the [[Niger Delta]] to the mouth of [[Ogooué River|Ogüé River]] -in the current [[Gabon]]- and included, besides the islands of Fernando Pó and [[Annobon]], the islets of Corisco and Elobeyes. Failed its various unsuccessful attempts to colonize these lands, Spain for its internal problems, lost interest in Spanish Guinea in 1827 and authorized the British use the island as a base for the work of suppression of the slave trade.

===British presence===
In 1821, the British captain Nelly approached the island of [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]]. He found it abandoned and founded the establishments of ''[[Riaba|Melville Bay]]'' (Riaba) and "San Carlos" (now [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]]). Some years later, another British captain, [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]], decided to colonize the island and in the north of it -on the site of the present capital- erected a base for British ships hunting European dealers in [[African slave trade|slaves]]. Thus arose, on 25 December 1827, ''Port Clarence'' on the ruins of a previous Portuguese settlement. The name was chosen in honor of the Duke of Clarence, who later became King [[William IV of Great Britain|William IV]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubis]] indigenous to the island called it "''Ripotó'' (''place of the foreigners''). The population of the capital was increased by the arrival of slaves freed by the British. These [[freedmen]] were settled in Port Clarence before the establishment of [[Sierra Leone]] as a colony for freed slaves. The descendants of these freed slaves remained on the island. They joined other migrants who arrived as free workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and became the population group called [[Creole peoples|Creole]] or [[fernandino peoples|fernandinos]], whose language was a [[Pidgin]] Bantu-English with some Spanish elements.

During the British period, the British consul automatically became the governor of the colony, including Governor [[John Beecroft]], a British [[mulatto]] sailor who modernized the capital, and whose work was later recognized by Spain with a monument in [[Punta Fernanda]].

In 1844, when Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] ruled after the regency of her mother Maria Cristina and [[Baldomero Espartero]], in an attempt to modernize Spain and rescue its heritage, Spain let the UK know its desire to regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions which were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.

Spain again took control of the island in 1855 and the capital, Port Clarence, was renamed ''Santa Isabel'', in honor of Queen [[Isabel II of Spain|Isabel II]]. The capital of the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] became the capital of Equatorial Guinea.

Its present name was given to the town in 1973 as part of the campaign of President [[Francisco Macías Nguema|Macías Nguema]] to replace [[place name]]s of European origin with African names, in this case honoring [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka]], the last [[Bubi language|Bubi]] king. Malabo, the son of King [[Moka]], surrendered to the Spaniards. His uncle [[Sas Ebuera]], head of the Bubi warriors, claimed to represent legitimate Bubi rule and continued resisting, confronting the Spanish openly in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the Spanish killed Sas Ebuera, Malabo did become king unopposed, but with no authority. Bubi clans and settlements were slow to accept Spanish sovereignty over the island, and the full conquest and pacification of the island was not achieved until 1912.

===Reign of Terror===
During the so-called ''Reign of Terror'' of [[Francisco Macías Nguema|Macías Nguema]], the dictator suppressed much of the intelligentsia of the country, initiating the process of taking over the positions of the public administration by part of the natives of Mongomo and clan Esangui. Many city residents had to leave. In the last years of his mandate, almost a fifth of the population fled. At that time (1968–1979), Equatorial Guinea received money from the Soviet Union in return for, inter alia, affording port facilities for Soviet naval craft, particularly submarines.

The infamous [[Black Beach Prison]] also known as ''Blay Beach prison'' (or Playa Negra prison) sits at the mouth of the Cónsul River, beside the black beach and behind the Governor's Palace and barracks. Several people have been jailed there in the over the 35 years of dictatorship. Among those imprisoned and tortured are many political leaders such as [[Rafael Upiñalo]] (Movimiento), Fabián Nsue (UP), Felipe Ondo Obiang (FDR), Martín Puye of [[Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island]] (MAIB) or [[Plácido Micó]] of the Social Democratic [[Convergence for Social Democracy]] (CPDS).

A group of mercenaries was also jailed at Black Beach for an attempted coup against President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Klimadiagramm-Malabo-Aequatorial-Guinea-metrisch-deutsch.png|thumb|250px|right|Climatological diagram of Malabo]]
Malabo is situated north of the island of Bioko, at coordinates 3° 45' 7.43" North and 8° 46' 25.32" East. The south of Malabo is limited by the Cónsul River and just across the river, south-west, is the hospital. West of the city, located about 9&amp;nbsp;km from the center of Malabo, is renewed [[Malabo International Airport]]. In the coastal region north of the city are the [[bay]]s and [[cape (geography)|capes]]. The elder is the punta de la Unidad Africana located just behind the [[Presidential Palace]] of Malabo and which occupies the entire eastern part of the Bay of Malabo. Another cape of importance is punta Europa located in the west of the city near to the airport.

===Climate===
Malabo features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am). Malabo receives on average 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year. The city has a pronounced, albeit short, sunnier (but still cloudy) [[dry season]] from December through February. February is normally its driest with 33&amp;nbsp;mm (0.2&amp;nbsp;in) of rain falling on average. It also has a very long cloudy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining nine months (March–November). On average, the months hit hardest by the wet season are from September to October, with receiving {{convert|500|mm|in|0}} of [[rain]] and showers between them.

Daytime temperatures do not vary at all day to day, and only vary a few degrees throughout the entire year. At night, the average low temperature is 20–21°C in every month of the year but January to April have a slightly higher diurnal range because it is clearer. Nonetheless, with only 1,020 hours of sunshine per year, Malabo is one of the cloudiest, wettest and [[thunderstorm|lightning-prone]] capitals of the world and experiences much [[fog]] and haze even when it's not raining in the driest months.

This trade also comes from the presence of other Americans, [[Latin American]]s, Nigerians, Cameroonians, Spanish and other Central Africans; the headquarters of [[Bank of Central African States]] (BEAC) is in Malabo. The building that houses it was originally built by the [[Banco Popular Español]], but after independence became the seat of Banco de Guinea Ecuatorial.

Malabo has been significantly affected by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]]'s growing co-operation with the [[oil industry]].  The country's production has reached {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d}} {{As of|2005|lc=y}}, an increase which led to a doubling of the city's population, but for the vast majority, very little of that wealth has been invested in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A '''motor–generator''' (an '''M–G set''') is a device for converting [[electricity|electrical power]] to another form. Motor–generator sets are used to convert [[frequency]], [[voltage]], or [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of power.  They may also be used to isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor–generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor–generators (such as the one shown in the picture) were used to convert [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power to higher DC voltages.

While a motor–generator set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit '''dynamotor''' (for [[dynamo]]–motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore share the same outer field coils or magnets.&lt;ref name=arrl1976&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RadioAmateurHandbook1976 Radio Amateur's Handbook 1976, pub. [[ARRL]], p331-332]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one end of the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.

Low-powered consumer devices such as [[vacuum tube]] vehicle radio receivers did not use expensive, noisy and bulky motor–generators. Instead, they used an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] circuit consisting of a [[vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]] (a self-exciting relay) and a [[transformer]] to produce the higher voltages required for the vacuum tubes from the vehicle's 6 or 12V battery.&lt;ref name=vib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioremembered.org/vpwrsup.htm |title=Vibrator Power Supplies |newspaper=Radioremembered.org |date=  |author= |accessdate= 18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical power handling==
In the context of [[electric power]] generation and large fixed electrical power systems, a motor–generator consists of an [[electric motor]] mechanically coupled to an [[electric generator]] (or [[alternator]]). The motor runs on the electrical input current while the generator creates the electrical output current, with power flowing between the two machines as a mechanical [[torque]]; this provides electrical isolation and some buffering of the power between the two electrical systems.

One use is motor–generator is to eliminate spikes and variations in "dirty power" ([[power conditioning]]) or to provide phase matching between different electrical systems.

===Flywheel-generator===
Another use is to buffer extreme loads on the power system.  For example, [[tokamak]] fusion devices impose very large peak loads, but relatively low average loads, on the electrical grid.  The [[DIII-D (tokamak)|DIII-D tokamak]] at [[General Atomics]], the [[Princeton Large Torus]] (PLT) at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], and the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod synchrotron]] at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] each used large [[flywheel]]s on multiple motor–generator rigs to level the load imposed on the electrical system:  the motor side slowly accelerated a large [[Flywheel energy storage|flywheel to store energy]], which was consumed rapidly during a fusion experiment as the generator side acted as a [[brake]] on the flywheel.  Similarly, the next generation U.S. Navy aircraft carrier [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System#Energy storage subsystem|Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS)]] will use a flywheel motor–generator rig to supply power instantaneously for aircraft launches at greater than the ship's installed generator capacity.

==Conversions==
[[Image:Large-mg-set.jpg|thumb|222px|An MG set used to provide a variable three phase AC voltage for an [[Electron beam welding|Electron Beam Welding Machine]] high voltage power supply.]]
Motor–generators may be used for various conversions including:
* [[Alternating current]] (AC) to [[direct current]] (DC)
* DC to AC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TSG.2012.2217512 | volume=3 | title=Retrofitted Hybrid Power System Design With Renewable Energy Sources for Buildings | journal=IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid | pages=2174–2187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DC at one [[voltage]] to DC at another voltage. (Also called a dynamotor, short for dynamo-motor)
* Creating or balancing a [[three-wire DC system]].
* AC at one [[frequency]] to AC at another [[harmonic]]ally-related frequency
* AC at a fixed voltage to AC of a variable voltage
* AC [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] to AC [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]]

==Variable AC voltage power supply==
Before solid state AC voltage regulation was available or cost effective, motor generator sets were used to provide a variable AC voltage. The DC voltage to the generators armature would be varied manually or electronically to control the output voltage. When used in this fashion, the MG set is equivalent to an isolated variable transformer.

==High-frequency machines==
An [[Alexanderson alternator]] is a motor-driven, high-frequency alternator which provides [[radio frequency]] power. In the early days of radio communication, the high frequency [[carrier wave]] had to be produced mechanically using an [[Alternator]] with many poles driven at high speeds. The Alexanderson alternator produced upward of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz with power outputs upward of 200&amp;nbsp;kW. While electromechanical converters were regularly used for [[long wave]] transmissions in the first three decades of the 20th century, electronic techniques were required at higher frequencies. The Alexanderson alternator was largely replaced by the vacuum tube oscillator in the 1920s.

==Motor–generators used to increase ''ride-through''==
{{main article|Uninterruptible power supply#Rotary}}
Motor–generators have even been used where the input and output currents are essentially the same. In this case, the mechanical inertia of the M–G set is used to filter out transients in the input power. The output's electric current can be very clean (noise free) and will be able to ''ride-through'' brief blackouts and switching transients at the input to the M–G set.  This may enable, for example, the flawless cut-over from mains power to AC power provided by a [[Diesel engine|diesel]] generator set.

The motor–generator set may contain a large [[flywheel]] to improve its ride-through; however, consideration must be taken in this application as the motor–generator will require a large amount of current on re-closure, if prior to the pull-out torque{{clarify|date=December 2015}} is achieved, resulting in a shut down. The in-rush current during re-closure will depend on many factors, however. As an example, a 250 kVA motor generator operating at 300 ampere of full load current will require 1550 ampere of in-rush current during a re-closure after 5 seconds. This example used a fixed mounted flywheel sized to result in a 1/2&amp;nbsp;Hz per second [[slew rate]]. The motor–generator was a vertical type two-bearing machine with oil-bath bearings.

Motors and generators may be coupled by a non-conductive shaft in facilities that need to closely control electromagnetic radiation,&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Security Standard for Construction of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities '', DIANE Publishing, 1994 {{ISBN|0-941375-87-0}}, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; or where high isolation from transient surge voltages is required.

==The motor–generator today==
Motor–generator sets have been replaced by [[semiconductor devices]] for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets were in [[elevator]]s. Since accurate speed control of the hoisting machine was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC [[variable-frequency drive]]s and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Another use for MG sets was on the southern region of [[British Rail]]. They were used to convert the 600 VDC - 850 VDC line supply voltage from the third rail into 70 VDC to power the controls of the EMU stock in use. These have since been replaced with solid state converters on new rolling stock.

On the other hand, in industrial settings where harmonic cancellation, frequency conversion, or line isolation is needed, MG sets remain a popular solution.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} A useful feature of the motor–generator is that they can handle large short-term overloads better than semiconductor devices of the same average load rating. Consider that the thermally current-limited components of a large semiconductor inverter are solid-state switches massing a few grams with a thermal time constant to their heat sinks of likely more than 100 ms, whereas the thermally current limited components of an MG are copper windings massing some hundreds of kilos which are intrinsically attached to their own large thermal mass. They also have inherently excellent resistance to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).

==Modern use of the term==
In the context of [[hybrid vehicles]] and other lightweight power systems, the term "motor–generator" can be used to describe a single power [[transducer]] that can be used as either an [[electric motor]] or a [[electrical generator|generator]], converting between electrical power and [[mechanical energy|mechanical power]]. In principle, any [[electrical generator]] can also serve as an electric motor, or vice versa.  The literature distributed by [[Toyota]] to describe the [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] is an example of this newer usage.

From the 2014 season, Formula 1 racing cars will have what are described as 2 motor-generator units (MGU),{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} single units which can act as ''either'' a generator or a motor. This  makes the cars more fuel-efficient by harvesting energy from the turbocharger and [[Regenerative braking|under braking]]. They can be used to provide an additional 160 BHP to the wheels to aid acceleration and overtaking, or can be used to spin the turbo to increase boost pressure faster, thereby reducing [[turbo lag]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12276">'''Nitrile anions''' are [[nitriles]] lacking a proton at the position α to the nitrile group. They undergo nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions with various [[electrophile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Addition and Substitution Reactions of Nitrile-Stabilized Carbanions|last1=Arseniyadis |first1=S. |last2=Kyler |first2=K. S. |last3=Watt |first3=D. S. |journal=Org. React. |date=1984 |volume=31 |pages=1–71|doi=10.1002/0471264180.or031.01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nitrile anions are functionally similar to [[enolates]], the extra multiple bond in nitrile anions provides them with a unique [[ketene]]-like geometry. Additionally, deprotonated [[cyanohydrin]]s can act as masked acyl anions, giving products impossible to access with enolates alone. The mechanisms of nitrile addition and substitution are well understood; however, strongly basic conditions are usually required, limiting the reaction's synthetic usefulness.

==Mechanism and stereochemistry==
===Generation of nitrile anions===
Nitrile anions are most often generated through the action of an appropriate base. However, the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;s of nitriles span a wide range—at least 20 p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; units. Thus, the proper choice of base is usually substrate dependent. Acetonitriles containing an extra stabilizing electron-withdrawing group (such as an aromatic ring) can usually be deprotonated using hydroxide or alkoxide bases. Unstabilized nitriles, on the other hand, usually require either alkali metal amide bases (such as [[sodium amide|NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or metal alkyls (such as [[n-Butyllithium|butyllithium]]) for effective deprotonation. In the latter case, competitive addition of the alkyl group to the nitrile takes place.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrileGen.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
[[IR spectroscopy]] studies have demonstrated the existence of at least two tautomeric forms of the nitrile anion (see above).

Polyanions of nitriles can also be generated by multiple deprotonations, and these species produce polyalkylated products in the presence of alkyl electrophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organometallic derivatives. V. The lithiation of ferrocenylmethyl cyanide|first1=G. |last1=Marr |first2=J. |last2=Ronayne |journal=J. Organomet. Chem. |volume=47 |page=417 |date=1973|doi=10.1016/S0022-328X(00)81753-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods to produce nitrile anions include conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated nitriles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organic electrosynthesis ambident substitution reactivity of cyano-alkanes: electrochemically-directed αC-alkylation by bromo-alkanes|first1=G.

===Reactions of nitrile anions===
The mechanisms of reactions involving nitrile anions depend primarily on the nature of the [[electrophile]] involved. Simple alkylations take place by [[bimolecular nucleophilic substitution|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] displacement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Alkylation of Esters and Nitriles|first1=A. C.|last1=Cope |first2=H. L. |last2=Holmes |first3=H. O. |last3=House |journal=Org. React. |volume=9 |page=107 |date=1957|doi=	10.1002/0471264180.or009.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to the usual stereoelectronic requirements of the process. [[Phase-transfer catalysis]] has been employed in alkylations of arylacetonitriles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heterogeneous ethylation of phenylacetonitrile|first1=R. |last1=Solaro |first2=S. |last2=D'Antone |first3=E. |last3=Chiellini |journal=J. Org. Chem. |volume=45 |page=4179 |date=1980|doi=10.1021/jo01309a023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Makosza|first1=M.|last2=Jonczyk|first2=A.|title=Phase-Transfer Alkylation of Nitriles: 2-Phenylbutyronitrile|journal=Organic Syntheses|date=1976|volume=55|page=91|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.055.0091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrile anions can also be involved in [[Michael reaction|Michael]]-type additions to activated double bonds and vinylation reactions with a limited number of polarized, unhindered acetylene derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reactions of organic anions. XII. Vinylation of phenylacetonitrile derivatives|first=M. |last=Makosza |journal=Tetrahedron Lett. |date=1966|volume=1966|page=5489|doi=10.1016/S0040-4039(00)70128-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrilePTC.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
Arylation of nitrile anions is also possible, and can take place through different mechanisms depending on the substrates and reaction conditions. Aryl halides lacking electron-withdrawing groups react through an addition-elimination mechanism involving [[benzyne]] intermediates. Aryl phosphates and ammoniums react through the [[Radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution|S&lt;sub&gt;RN&lt;/sub&gt;1]] pathway, which involves the generation of an aryl radical anion, fragmentation, and bond formation with a nucleophile. Electron transfer to a second molecule of arene carries on the radical chain.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrileSRN1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
Electron-poor aromatic compounds undergo [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] in the presence of nitrile anions.

==Scope and limitations==
The primary difficulty for alkylation reactions employing nitrile anions is over-alkylation. In the alkylation of acetonitrile, for instance, yields of monoalkylated product are low in most cases. Two exceptions are alkylations with [[epoxide]]s (the nearby negative charge of the opened epoxide wards off further alkylation) and alkylations with cyanomethylcopper(I) species. Side reactions may also present a problem; concentrations of the nitrile anion must be high in order to mitigate processes involving self-condensation, such as the [[Thorpe–Ziegler reaction]]. Other important side reactions include elimination of the alkyl cyanide product or alkyl halide starting material and [[amidine]] formation.

The cyclization of ω-epoxy-1-nitriles provides an interesting example of how stereoelectronic factors may override steric factors in intramolecular substitution reactions. In the cyclization of '''1''', for instance, only the cyclopropane isomer '''2''' is observed. This is attributed to better orbital overlap in the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 transition state for cyclization. 1,1-disubstituted and tetrasubstituted epoxides also follow this principle.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrileCollin.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Conjugated nitriles containing γ hydrogens may be deprotonated at the γ position to give resonance-stabilized anions. These intermediates almost always react with α selectitivity in alkylation reactions, the exception to the rule being anions of ''ortho''-tolyl nitriles.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Tolunitrile.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
Formation of cyanohydrins from carbonyl compounds renders the former carbonyl carbon acidic. After protection of the hydroxyl group with an acyl or silyl group, cyanohydrins can function essentially as masked acyl anions. Because ester protecting groups are base labile, mild bases must be employed with ester-protected cyanohydrins. α-(Dialkylamino)nitriles can also be used in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''N'',''N''-diethylaminoacetonitrile: a generally useful latent acyl carbanion|first1=G. |last1=Stork |first2=A. A. |last2=Ozorio |first3=A. Y. W. |last3=Leong |journal=Tetrahedron Lett. |date=1978|volume=1978|page=5175|doi=10.1016/S0040-4039(01)85842-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of arylation and acylation reactions are shown below. Although intermolecular arylations using nitrile anions result in modest yields, the ''intramolecular'' procedure efficiently gives four-, five-, and six-membered benzo-fused rings. Acylation can be accomplished using a wide variety of acyl electrophiles, including carbonates, chloroformates, [[ester]]s, [[anyhdride]]s, and [[acid chloride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Isolation of primary decomposition products of azides. II. Azidopyrazoles|first1=P. A. S. |last1=Smith |first2=G. J. W. |last2=Breen |first3=M. K. |last3=Hajek |first4=D. V. C. |last4=Awang |journal=J. Org. Chem. |volume=35 |page=2215 |date=1970|doi=10.1021/jo00832a024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these reactions, two equivalents of base are used to drive the reaction towards acylated product—the acylated product is more acidic than the starting material.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrileScope.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Synthetic applications==
Alkylation of a nitrile anion followed by reductive decyanation was employed in the novel synthesis of (2)-9-dotlecen-1-yl acetate, the sex pheromone of ''[[Paralobesia viteana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potassium on Alumina as a Reagent for Reductive Decyanation of Alkylnitriles.|first1=D. |last1=Savoia |first2=E. |last2=Tagliavini |first3=C. |last3=Trombini |first4=A. |last4=Umani-Ronchi |journal=J. Org. Chem. |volume=45 |page=3227 |date=1980|doi=10.1021/jo01304a016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[File:NitrileSynth.png|500px]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Experimental conditions and procedure==
===Typical conditions===
The most common bases used to deprotonate nitriles are the alkali metal amides, substituted amides, and hydrides. These reagents require inert, anhydrous conditions and careful handling. Polyalkylation is a significant problem for primary or secondary nitriles; however, a number of solutions to this problem exist. Alkylation of cyanoacetates followed by decarboxylation provides one solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indirect Methods of Preparation of Pure Monoalkylphenylacetonitriles|first1=E. M. |last1=Kaiser |first2=C. R. |last2=Hauser |journal=J. Org. Chem. |volume=31 |page=3873 |date=1966|doi=10.1021/jo01349a525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acylation of primary or secondary nitriles provides a convenient entry to the starting materials for this sequence. Distillation and chromatography are only practical for the separation of mono- and di-alkylated material when the molecular weight difference between the two is large.

Acylation is much more straightforward, as the resulting α-cyanocarbonyl compounds are much more acidic (and less nucleophilic) than corresponding starting materials. Monoacylated products can be obtained easily.

===Example procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes. Selected Phenyl-2-methylhexanes|first1=G. L. |last1=Goerner |first2=H. L. |last2=Muller |first3=J. L. |last3=Corbin |journal=J. Org. Chem.|volume=24|page=1561|date=1959|doi=10.1021/jo01092a044}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
To a suspension of 24.4&amp;nbsp;g (1.017&amp;nbsp;mol) of [[sodium hydride]] in 200&amp;nbsp;mL of anhydrous [[toluene]] was added a mixture of 122&amp;nbsp;g (1.043&amp;nbsp;mol) of phenylacetonitrile and 150&amp;nbsp;g (1.095&amp;nbsp;mol) of isobutyl bromide. The mixture was heated at 65&amp;nbsp;°C, at which temperature the reaction commenced. The heating mantle was removed, and the flask was cooled in order to keep the reaction from becoming too vigorous during the initial 0.5-hour reaction period. The reaction mixture was refluxed for an additional 5&amp;nbsp;hours and permitted to stand overnight. [[Ethanol]] (40&amp;nbsp;mL) was cautiously added dropwise, followed by the dropwise addition of 200&amp;nbsp;mL of water. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with [[benzene]]. The combined organic layers were washed successively with dilute acid, water, [[sodium carbonate]] solution, and water. After filtration through a layer of [[sodium sulfate]], the benzene was evaporated and the product was [[fractional distillation|fractionally distilled]] to afford 115&amp;nbsp;g (66%) of 2-phenyl-4-methylvaleronitrile, [[boiling point|bp]] 130–134&amp;nbsp;°C (10&amp;nbsp;mm) [lit. (540) [[boiling point|bp]] 136–138&amp;nbsp;°C (15&amp;nbsp;mm)].

[[File:Plasma globe 60th.jpg|thumb|A plasma globe with filaments extending between the inner and outer spheres]]
A '''plasma globe''' or '''plasma lamp''' (also called '''plasma ball''', '''dome''', '''sphere''', '''tube''' or '''orb''', depending on shape) is a clear glass container filled with a mixture of various [[noble gas]]es with a [[high-voltage]] [[electrode]] in the center of the container.

When voltage is applied, a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is formed within the container. [[Plasma (physics)#Filamentation|Plasma filaments]] extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of multiple constant beams of colored light (see [[corona discharge]] and [[electric glow discharge]]). Plasma globes were most popular as [[novelty item]]s in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt;

The [[plasma lamp]] was invented by [[Nikola Tesla]], during his experimentation with high-frequency [[electric current|currents]] in an evacuated glass [[vacuum tube|tube]] for the purpose of studying [[high voltage]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art05.html |title=Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency |first=Nikola |last=Tesla |year=1892 |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302125234/http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art05.html |archivedate=March 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla called his invention an "[[inert gas]] [[Gas discharge tube|discharge tube]]".&lt;ref name=powerlabs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerlabs.org/plasmaglobes.htm#%C2%A0PRINCIPLE%20OF%20OPERATION: |title=PowerLabs Plasma Globes Page |first=Sam |last=Barros |year=2002 |accessdate=November 16, 2009 |7=&lt;!--  section=Principle of operation --&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203054631/http://www.powerlabs.org/plasmaglobes.htm#%C2%A0PRINCIPLE%20OF%20OPERATION: |archivedate=December 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern plasma lamp design was subsequently developed by [[Bill Parker (MIT)|Bill Parker]], a student at [[MIT]].&lt;ref name=Gache&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-do-Plasma-Lamps-Work-77633.shtml |title=How do plasma lamps work? |first=Gabriel |last=Gache |date=January 31, 2008 |website=Softpedia |accessdate=November 16, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210232935/http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-do-Plasma-Lamps-Work-77633.shtml |archivedate=February 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Plasma lamp touching.jpg|thumb|The effect of a conducting object (a hand) touching the plasma globe]]
Although many variations exist, a plasma lamp is usually a clear glass sphere filled with a mixture of various gases (most commonly [[neon]], sometimes with other [[noble gas]]es such as [[argon]], [[xenon]] and [[krypton]]) at nearly atmospheric pressure. They are driven by high-frequency (approximately {{nowrap|35 [[hertz|kHz]]}}) [[alternating current]] at {{nowrap|2–5 [[volt|kV]]}}.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt; The drive circuit is essentially a specialized [[power inverter]], in which current from a lower-voltage DC supply powers a high-frequency [[electronic oscillator]] circuit whose output is stepped up by a high-frequency, high-voltage [[transformer]]. The radio-frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an [[electrode]] when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio-frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by [[capacitive coupling]] right through the glass. [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the globe (see [[corona discharge]] and [[electric glow discharge]]).

Some globes have a control knob that varies the amount of power going to the center electrode. At the very lowest setting that will light or "strike" the globe, a single tendril is made. This single tendril's plasma channel engages enough space to transmit this lowest striking energy to the outside world through the glass of the globe. As the power is increased, this single channel's capacity is overwhelmed and a second channel forms, then a third, and so on. The tendrils each compete for a footprint on the inner orb as well. The energies flowing through these are all of the same polarity so they repel each other as like charges: a thin dark boundary surrounds each footprint on the inner electrode.

Placing a finger tip on the glass creates an attractive spot for the energy to flow, because the conductive human body (having [[non-ohmic resistance]] of about 1000 ohms at room temperature) is more easily polarized than the dielectric material around the electrode (i.e. the gas within the globe) providing an alternative discharge path having less resistance. Therefore, the capacity of the large conducting body to accept radio frequency energy is greater than that of the surrounding air. The energy available to the filaments of plasma within the globe will preferentially flow toward the better acceptor. This flow also causes a single filament, from the inner ball to the point of contact, to become brighter and thinner.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt; The filament is brighter because there is more current flowing through it and into the 150&amp;nbsp;pF capacity, or [[capacitance]], presented by an object, a conducting body, the size of a human. The filament is thinner because the magnetic fields around it, augmented by the now-higher current flowing through it, causes a [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic effect]] called [[self-focusing]]: the plasma channel's own magnetic fields create a force acting to compress the size of the plasma channel itself.

[[File:WLANL - petertf - Teslabol.jpg|thumb|left|A "Tesla ball" at the [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO science museum]] in Amsterdam]]
Much of the movement of the filaments is due to heating of the gas around the filament. When gas along the filament is heated, it becomes more buoyant and rises, carrying the filament with it. If the filament is discharging into a fixed object (like a hand) on the side of the globe, it will begin to deform into a curved path between the central electrode and the object. When the distance between the electrode and the object becomes too great to maintain, the filament will break and a new filament will reform between the electrode and the hand. (See also [[High voltage traveling arc#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]], which exhibits a similar behavior.)

An electric current is produced within any conductive object near the orb. The glass acts as a [[dielectric]] in a [[capacitor]] formed between the ionized gas and the hand.

The globe is prepared by pumping out as much air as is practical. The globe is then back-filled with neon to a pressure similar to one atmosphere. If the radio-frequency power is turned on, if the globe is "struck" or "lit", now, the whole globe will glow a diffuse red. If a little argon is added, the filaments will form. If a very small amount of xenon is added, the "flowers" will bloom at the ends of the filaments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The neon available for purchase for a neon-sign shop often comes in glass flasks at the pressure of a partial vacuum. These cannot be used to fill a globe with a useful mixture. Tanks of gas, each with its specific, proper, pressure regulator and fitting, are required: one for each of the gases involved.

Of the other noble gases, [[radon]] is [[radioactive]], [[helium]] escapes through the glass relatively quickly, and krypton is quite expensive. Other gases can be used, such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. Molecular gases may be dissociated by the plasma.

==History==
[[File:Plasma globe 23s.webm|thumb|Video of plasma globe]]
In {{US patent|0514170}} ("Incandescent Electric Light", 1894 February 6), [[Nikola Tesla]] describes a plasma lamp. This patent is for one of the first high-intensity discharge lamps. Tesla used an incandescent-type lamp globe with a single internal conductive element and excited the element with high voltage currents from a [[Tesla coil]], thus creating the brush discharge emanation. He gained patent protection on a particular form of the lamp in which a light-giving small body or button of refractory material is supported by a conductor entering a very highly exhausted globe or receiver. Tesla called this invention the single terminal lamp, or, later, the "Inert Gas Discharge Tube".&lt;ref name=powerlabs/&gt;

The Groundstar style of plasma globe was created by [[James Falk]] and marketed to collectors and science museums in the 1970s and 1980s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1984 praised Orb Corporation's Omnisphere as "the most fabulous object in the entire world" and "magnificent ... a new kind of art object", stating "you can't buy mine for any price".&lt;ref name="pournelle198404"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-04/1984_04_BYTE_09-04_Real-World_Interfacing#page/n57/mode/2up | title=The Most Fabulous Object in the Entire World | work=BYTE | date=April 1984 | accessdate=2 March 2016 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=57 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325205606/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-04/1984_04_BYTE_09-04_Real-World_Interfacing#page/n57/mode/2up | archivedate=25 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The technology needed to formulate gas mixtures used in today's plasma spheres was not available to Tesla.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Modern lamps typically use combinations of [[xenon]], [[krypton]] and [[neon]], although other gases can be used as well.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt;&lt;ref name=powerlabs/&gt; These gas mixtures, along with different glass shapes and integrated-circuit-driven electronics, create the vivid colors, range of motions and complex patterns seen in today's plasma spheres.

==Applications==
Plasma globes are mainly used as curiosities or toys for their unique lighting effects and the "tricks" that can be performed on them by users moving their hands around them. They might also form part of a school's laboratory equipment for demonstration purposes. They are not usually employed for general lighting. However, as of recent years, some novelty stores have begun selling a miniature plasma lamp [[nightlight]] that can be mounted on a standard light socket.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/327065/plasma-ball-night-light-makes-us-nostalgic-for-bed-wetting Plasma Ball Night Light Makes Us Nostalgic For Bed Wetting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908155122/https://gizmodo.com/327065/plasma-ball-night-light-makes-us-nostalgic-for-bed-wetting |date=2017-09-08 }}, gizmodo.com, 2007-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4physics.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/28/products_id/364 Plasma Night Light] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201083238/http://www.4physics.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/28/products_id/364 |date=2010-12-01 }}, 4physics.com, 2010-02-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Plasma globes can be used for experimenting with high voltages. If a conductive plate or wire coil is placed on the globe, [[capacitive coupling]] can transfer enough voltage to the plate or coil to produce a small [[electric arc|arc]] or energize a [[high voltage]] [[electrical load|load]]. This is possible because the plasma inside the globe and the conductor outside it act as plates of a capacitor, with the glass in between as a dielectric. A step-down transformer connected between the plate and the globe's electrode can produce lower-voltage, higher-current radio frequency output. Careful earth grounding is essential to prevent injury or damage to equipment.

==Hazards==
Bringing conductive materials or electronic devices close to a plasma globe may cause the glass to become hot. The high voltage radio frequency energy coupled to them from within the globe may cause a mild electric shock to the person touching, even through a protective plastic casing. The [[radio frequency]] field produced by plasma lamps can interfere with the operation of touch-pads used on [[laptop computer]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[cell phones]], and other similar devices.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt; Some types of plasma globes can radiate sufficient [[radio frequency interference]] (RFI) to interfere with [[cordless telephone]]s and [[Wi-Fi]] devices several feet or some meters away.

If an electrical conductor touches the outside of the globe, [[capacitive coupling]] can induce enough potential on it to produce a small [[electric arc|arc]]. This is possible because the globe's glass acts as a capacitor [[dielectric]]: the inside of the lamp acts as one plate, and the conductive object on the outside acts as the opposite capacitor plate.&lt;ref name=powerlabs/&gt;  This is a dangerous action which can damage the globe or other electronic devices, and presents a fire ignition hazard.&lt;ref name=Gache/&gt;

'''Plasma speakers''' or '''ionophones''' are a form of [[loudspeaker]] which varies air pressure via a high-energy electrical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] instead of a solid [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. Connected to the output of an [[audio amplifier]], plasma speakers vary the size{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} of a plasma [[glow discharge]], [[corona discharge]] or [[electric arc]] which then acts as a massless radiating element, creating the [[compression wave]]s in air that listeners perceive as [[sound]]. The technique is an evolution of [[William Duddell]]'s "singing arc" of 1900, and an innovation related to [[ion thruster]] spacecraft propulsion.

The term '''ionophone''' can also be used to describe a [[transducer]] for converting acoustic vibrations in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] into an electrical signal.

The effect takes advantage of two unique principles:{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Firstly, [[ionization]] of gases causes their [[electrical resistance]] to drop significantly, making them extremely efficient [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], which allows them to vibrate sympathetically with [[magnetic field]]s. 
Secondly, the involved plasma, itself a field of [[ion]]s, has a relatively negligible mass. Thus as current frequency varies, more-resistant air remains mechanically coupled with and is driven by vibration of the  more conductive and essentially{{Specify|date=July 2016}} massless plasma, radiating a potentially ideal reproduction of the sound source.

==Comparison to conventional loudspeakers==
''Conventional'' loudspeaker [[transducer]] designs use input electrical frequencies to vibrate a significant mass: This [[transducer|driver]] is coupled to a stiff [[loudspeaker#loudspeaker cone|speaker cone]] — a diaphragm which pushes air at respective frequencies. But the [[inertia]] inherent in its mass resists [[acceleration]] — and all changes in cone position. Additionally, speaker cones will eventually suffer tensile [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] from the repeated shaking of sonic vibration.{{Citation needed|date = February 2017}}

Thus conventional speaker output, or the [[fidelity]] of the device, is distorted by physical limitations inherent in its design. These distortions have long been the limiting factor in commercial reproduction of strong high frequencies. To a lesser extent [[square wave]] characteristics are also problematic; the reproduction of square waves most stress a speaker cone.

In a plasma speaker, as member of the family of [[massless speaker]]s, these limitations do not exist. The low-inertia driver has exceptional transient response compared to other designs.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The result is an even, [[Linear amplifier|linear]]{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} output, accurate even at extreme frequencies beyond any audible range. Such speakers are notable for accuracy and clarity, but not tremendous power because plasmas composed of tiny particles are unable to move large volumes of air.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} So these designs are more effective as [[tweeters]].

==Practical considerations==
Early plasma-speaker designs ionized ambient [[air]] containing the gases [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. In an intense electrical field these gases can produce reactive by-products, and in closed rooms these can reach a hazardous level.

[[Plasmatronics]] produced a commercial plasma speaker that used a [[helium]] tank to provide the ionization gas. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the ''Plasmatronics Hill Type I'', a commercial helium-plasma tweeter.&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi&gt;[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described. Retrieved March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoided the [[ozone]] and nitrogen oxides produced by [[radio frequency]] decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters. Theirs is also the only design relying on the quieter [[glow discharge]] mode instead of the more common [[electric arc|arc]] and [[corona discharge]]s. But the operation of such speakers requires a continuous supply of helium.

In the 1950s, the pioneering DuKane Corporation produced the air-ionizing ''Ionovac'', marketed in the UK as the ''Ionophone''. Currently there remain manufacturers in Germany who use this design, as well as a do-it-yourself design available on the Internet.

To make the plasma speaker a more widely available product, ExcelPhysics, a Seattle-based company, and Images Scientific Instruments, a New York-based company, both offered their own variant of the plasma speaker as a [[DIY]] kit. The ExcelPhysics variant uses a [[flyback transformer]] to step up voltage, a [[555 timer IC|555 timing chip]] to provide modulation and a 44&amp;nbsp;kHz [[carrier signal]], and an audio amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/kickstarter-project-empowers-students-plays-the-mario-theme-with-plasma/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flame speaker''' uses a flame for the driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/feb98/888372043.Ot.r.html Re: Could You Please Find Research Re:Sound Reproduction Via Gas Flame &amp; Electric]&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs dating to the 1950s use combustion of natural gas or candles{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to produce a plasma through which current is then passed. These combustion designs do not require high voltages to generate a plasma field.

A similar effect is occasionally observed in the vicinity of high-power [[amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] radio transmitters when a [[corona discharge]] (inadvertently) occurs from the transmitting antenna, where voltages in the tens of thousands are involved. The ionized air is heated in direct relationship to the modulating signal with surprisingly high fidelity over a wide area. Due to the destructive effects of the (self-sustaining) discharge this cannot be permitted to persist, and automatic systems momentarily shut down transmission within a few seconds to quench the "flame".

Despite offering an aspect of ideal sound-reproduction, plasma speaker designs tend not to be used in practical musical systems nor any performing instruments. Due to investment costs, limits in frequency range,{{Specify|date=July 2016}} and the many practical considerations in safely maintaining any air-coupled plasma, they remain experiments and curiosities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">A '''Renewable Identification Number''' (or '''RIN''') is a serial number assigned to a batch of [[biofuel]] for the purpose of tracking its production, use, and trading as required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Renewable Energy Certificates (United States)|Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)]] implemented according to the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] and the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]].

==RIN components==
As defined in the regulation:&lt;ref&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 80 [EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161; FRL-XXXX-X] RIN 2060-A081 Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Changes to Renewable Fuel Standard Program&lt;/ref&gt;
Under RFS2, each batch-RIN generated will continue to uniquely identify not only a specific batch of renewable fuel, but also every gallon-RIN assigned to that batch. Thus the RIN will continue to be defined as follows:

RIN: KYYYYCCCCFFFFFBBBBBRRDSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEE

Where:
* K = Code distinguishing assigned RINs from separated RINs
* YYYY = Calendar year of production or import
* CCCC = Company ID
* FFFFF = Facility ID
* BBBBB = Batch number
* RR = Code identifying the Equivalence Value
* D = Code identifying the renewable fuel category
* SSSSSSSS = Start of RIN block
* EEEEEEEE = End of RIN block

==Authorizing legislation==
Under the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the EPA is authorized to set annual quotas dictating what percentage of the total amount of motor fuels consumed in the US must be represented by biofuel blended into [[fossil fuel]]s.  Companies that refine, import or blend fossil fuels are obligated to meet certain individual RFS quotas based on the volume of fuel they introduce into the market.  By fulfilling these requirements, the EPA projects that the industry will collectively satisfy the overall national quota they set. To ensure compliance, obligated parties are periodically required to demonstrate they have met their RFS quota by submitting a certain amount of RINs to the EPA.  Because each of these RINs represent an amount of biofuel that has been blended into fossil fuels, the RINs submitted to the EPA by obligated parties are a quantitative representation of the amount of biofuel that has been blended into the fossil fuels used in America.&lt;ref name="CRS1"/&gt;

==Registration and trading==
Anyone who owns RINs must register with the EPA on an annual basis and obey mandated record-keeping requirements. RINs are only granted if the registered fuel was made in accordance with EISA rules. These regulations are enforced against both domestic and foreign producers. All RINs are reported to the EPA after creation.&lt;ref name="CRS1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schnepf |first1=Randy |last2=Yacobucci |first2=Brent |date=14 October 2010 |title=Renewable Fuel Standard: Overview and Issues |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=ZJcjNprDS3EC&amp;printsec=https://books.google.gr/books?id=ZJcjNprDS3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=renewable%20fuel%20standard&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=renewable%20fuel%20standard&amp;f=false |location=United States |publisher=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blog1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.platts.com/2016/04/19/rin-generation-biofuel/ |title=RIN generation is up, but more biofuels mandates are on the way |last1=Swift |first1=Wes |date=19 April 2016 |website=The Barrel: The essential perspective on global commodities |publisher=PLATTS McGraw-Hill Financial |access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud===
Renewable Identification Numbers can be sold and traded separately from the biofuels that created them. This has given rise to instances of "RIN fraud", where improperly created RINs have been sold without any manufacture of corresponding biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/blog/article/2012/07/green-diesel-offices-raided-absolute-fuels-ceo-remains-in-custody |title=Green Diesel offices raided, Absolute Fuels CEO remains in custody |accessdate=Aug 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AT-Guess"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Geuss |first1=Megan |title=Ohio man is latest to be sentenced for millions in biofuel credit fraud |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/ohio-man-is-latest-to-be-sentenced-for-millions-in-biofuel-credit-fraud/ |website=Ars Technica |publisher=Condé Naste |accessdate=31 August 2018 |date=Aug 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silicon dioxide''', also known as '''silica''', '''silicic acid''' or '''silicic acid anydride''' is an [[oxide]] of [[silicon]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{Silicon}}{{Oxygen|2}}, most commonly found in nature as [[quartz]] and in various living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iler, R.

Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product. Notable examples include [[fused quartz]], [[fumed silica]], [[silica gel]], and [[aerogel]]s. It is used in structural materials, microelectronics (as an electrical insulator), and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica is toxic  and can lead to severe inflammation of the [[lung]] tissue, [[silicosis]], [[bronchitis]], [[lung cancer]], and [[systemic autoimmune disease]]s, such as [[lupus]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].

Uptake of [[amorphous]] silicon dioxide, in high doses, leads to non-permanent short-term inflammation, where all effects heal.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnston, CJ et al. (2000),'' Toxicol Sci, 56(2): 405-413&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:SiO2repeat.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Structural motif found in α-quartz, but also found in almost all forms of silicon dioxide]]
[[File:Quartzrn.PNG|thumb|Relationship between refractive index and density for some SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;]]
In the majority of [[silicate]]s, the silicon atom shows [[tetrahedral coordination geometry|tetrahedral coordination]], with four oxygen atoms surrounding a central Si atom. The most common example is seen in the quartz [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s.

For example, in the unit cell of α-quartz, the central tetrahedron shares all four of its corner O atoms, the two face-centered tetrahedra share two of their corner O atoms, and the four edge-centered tetrahedra share just one of their O atoms with other SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. This leaves a net average of 12 out of 24 total vertices for that portion of the seven SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra that are considered to be a part of the unit cell for silica ([http://www.mindat.org/min-3337.html see 3-D Unit Cell]).

SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a number of distinct crystalline forms ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s) in addition to amorphous forms. With the exception of [[stishovite]] and fibrous silica, all of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. Silicon–oxygen bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms; for example in α-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it is in the range 154–171 pm. The Si-O-Si angle also varies between a low value of 140° in α-tridymite, up to 180° in β-tridymite. In α-quartz, the Si-O-Si angle is 144°.&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

Fibrous silica has a structure similar to that of [[Silicon sulfide|SiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] with chains of edge-sharing SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. Stishovite, the higher-pressure form, in contrast, has a [[rutile]]-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate. The density of stishovite is 4.287&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which compares to α-quartz, the densest of the low-pressure forms, which has a density of 2.648&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt; The difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest Si-O bond lengths in stishovite (four Si-O bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm) are greater than the Si-O bond length (161 pm) in α-quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wells A. F. |year=1984|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Oxford Science Publications|isbn=978-0-19-855370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The change in the coordination increases the ionicity of the Si-O bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108767301010698|title=Electron-density distribution in stishovite, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: a new high-energy synchrotron-radiation study|year=2001|author=Kirfel, A.|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica A]] |volume=57|page=663|last2=Krane|first2=H. G.|last3=Blaha|first3=P.|last4=Schwarz|first4=K.|last5=Lippmann|first5=T.|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, any deviations from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or variations, which represent an approach to an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]], vitreous, or glassy solid.

The only stable form under normal conditions is [[alpha quartz]], in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered. In nature, impurities in crystalline α-quartz can give rise to colors (see list).  The high-temperature minerals, [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]], have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz. Since the composition is identical, the reason for the discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high-temperature minerals. As is common with many substances, the higher the temperature, the farther apart the atoms are, due to the increased vibration energy.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The transformation from α-quartz to [[beta-quartz]] takes place abruptly at 573&amp;nbsp;°C. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceramic Technology for Potters and Sculptors|last1=Hutchinson Cuff|first1=Yvonne|pages=93–95|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|isbn=9780812213775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-pressure minerals, [[seifertite]], [[stishovite]], and [[coesite]], though, have higher densities and indices of refraction than quartz. This is probably due to the intense compression of the atoms occurring during their formation, resulting in more condensed structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Silica Stories|last1=De La Rocha|first1=Christina|last2=Conley|first2=Daniel J.|pages=50–55|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319540542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faujasite]] silica is another form of crystalline silica. It is obtained by [[wikt:dealumination|dealumination]] of a low-sodium, ultra-stable Y [[zeolite]] with combined acid and thermal treatment. The resulting product contains over 99% silica, and has high crystallinity and surface area (over 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g). Faujasite-silica has very high thermal and acid stability. For example, it maintains a high degree of long-range molecular order or [[crystallinity]] even after boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=fau&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scherzer, J. |title=Dealuminated faujasite-type structures with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ratios over 100|journal=Journal of Catalysis |volume=54|page=285|year=1978|doi=10.1016/0021-9517(78)90051-9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molten silica]] exhibits several peculiar physical characteristics that are similar to those observed in liquid [[water (properties)|water]]: negative temperature expansion, density maximum at temperatures ~5000&amp;nbsp;°C, and a heat capacity minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/papers/2002_PRE_silica.pdf|last=Shell|first=Scott M. |author2=Debenedetti, Pablo G. |author3=Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z. |title=Molecular structural order and anomalies in liquid silica|journal=Physical Review E |year=2002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.66.011202 |pmid=12241346|volume=66 |issue=1|page=011202 |bibcode=2002PhRvE..66a1202S| arxiv = cond-mat/0203383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its density decreases from 2.08&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 1950&amp;nbsp;°C to 2.03&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~cml/assets/pdf/7962aksay.pdf |title=Densities of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Melts |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1979.tb19071.x |journal=[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]] |volume =62 |issue =7–8 |pages =332–336 |year=1979 |author1=Aksay, I.

Molecular SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a linear structure is produced when molecular [[silicon monoxide]], SiO, is condensed in an argon matrix cooled with helium along with oxygen atoms generated by [[microwave discharge]]. 
Dimeric silicon dioxide, (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been prepared by reacting O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with matrix isolated dimeric silicon monoxide, (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In dimeric silicon dioxide there are two oxygen atoms bridging between the silicon atoms with an Si-O-Si angle of 94° and bond length of 164.6 pm and the terminal Si-O bond length is 150.2 pm. The Si-O bond length is 148.3&amp;nbsp;pm, which compares with the length of 161&amp;nbsp;pm in α-quartz. The bond energy is estimated at 621.7 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name="Jutzi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jutzi, Peter  |author2=Schubert, Ulrich  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003|title=Silicon chemistry: from the atom to extended systems|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-30647-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iRNDUz0F0rwC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
===Geology===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Silica with the [[chemical formula]] {{Silicon}}{{Oxygen|2}} is most commonly found in nature as [[quartz]], which comprises more than 10% by mass of the earth's crust.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt; Quartz is the only polymorph of silica stable at the Earth's surface. Metastable occurrences of the high-pressure forms [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]] have been found around [[impact structure]]s and associated with [[eclogite]]s formed during [[ultra-high-pressure metamorphism]]. The high-temperature forms of [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] are known from silica-rich [[volcanic rock]]s. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of [[sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience|last1=Berslien|first1=Elisa|page=138|year=2012|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405160544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
Even though it is poorly soluble, silica occurs in many plants. Plant materials with high silica [[phytolith]] content appear to be of importance to grazing animals, from chewing insects to [[ungulate]]s. Silica accelerates tooth wear, and high levels of silica in plants frequently eaten by herbivores may have developed as a defense mechanism against predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01082.x |title=Silica in grasses as a defence against insect herbivores: Contrasting effects on folivores and a phloem feeder |year=2006 |last1=Massey |first1=Fergus P. |last2=Ennos |first2=A.

Silica is also the primary component of [[rice husk ash]], which is used, for example, in filtration and cement manufacturing.

For well over a billion years, [[silicification]] in and by cells has been common in the biological world. In the modern world it occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates).
Prominent examples include:
*[[Test (biology)|Tests]] or [[frustule]]s (i.e. shells) of [[diatom]]s, [[Radiolaria]] and [[testate amoebae]].&lt;ref name=Fern/&gt;
*Silica [[phytolith]]s in the cells of many plants, including [[Equisetaceae]], practically all grasses, and a wide range of [[dicotyledon]]s.
*The spicules forming the skeleton of many [[sponge]]s.

Crystalline minerals formed in the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g., strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0–40&amp;nbsp;°C).

Formation of the mineral may occur either within the cell wall of an organism (such as with phytoliths), or outside the cell wall, as typically happens with tests.{{clarify|reason=what are tests, and where might one find them?|date=February 2016}} Specific biochemical reactions exist for mineral deposition. Such reactions include those that involve lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.

It is unclear in what ways silica is important in the nutrition of [[animals]]. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem that it is hard to create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pmid=3743227|year=1986|last1=Carlisle|first1=EM|title=Silicon as an essential trace element in animal nutrition|volume=121|pages=123–39|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|doi=10.1002/9780470513323.ch8|series=Novartis Foundation Symposia|isbn=978-0-470-51332-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Structural use===
An estimated 95% of silicon dioxide produced is consumed in the construction industry, e.g. for the production of [[Portland cement]].&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

Silica, in the form of sand is used as the main ingredient in [[sand casting]] for the manufacture of metallic components in engineering and other applications. The high melting point of silica enables it to be used in such applications.

Crystalline silica is used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] of formations which contain [[tight oil]] and [[shale gas]].&lt;ref name=NYT82313&gt;{{cite news|title=New Rules Would Cut Silica Dust Exposure|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/business/new-rules-would-cut-silica-dust-exposure.html|accessdate=August 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 23, 2013|author=Greenhouse, Steven }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to glass and silicon===
Silica is the primary ingredient in the production of most [[glass]]. The [[glass transition]] temperature of pure SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is about 1475 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1134/1.1790021 |title=Glass formation in amorphous SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a percolation phase transition in a system of network defects |year=2004 |last1=Ojovan |first1=M. I. |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=632–634 |bibcode =2004JETPL..79..632O }}&lt;/ref&gt; When molten silicon dioxide SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is rapidly cooled, it does not crystallize, but solidifies as a glass.

The structural geometry of silicon and oxygen in glass is similar to that in quartz and most other crystalline forms of silicon and oxygen with silicon surrounded by regular tetrahedra of oxygen centers. The difference between the glass and crystalline forms arises from the connectivity of the tetrahedral units: Although there is no long range periodicity in the glassy network ordering remains at length scales well beyond the SiO bond length. One example of this ordering is the preference to form rings of 6-tetrahedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/354445a0 |title=Medium-range structural order in covalent amorphous solids |year=1991 |last1=Elliott |first1=S. R. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=354 |issue=6353 |pages=445–452 |bibcode = 1991Natur.354..445E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fumed silica===
[[Fumed silica]] also known as pyrogenic silica is a very fine particulate or [[colloidal]] form of silicon dioxide.  It is prepared by burning [[silicon tetrachloride|SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a "smoke" of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=393–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 HCl.

The majority of [[optical fiber]]s for [[telecommunication]] are also made from silica. It is a primary raw material for many ceramics such as [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]].

Silicon dioxide is used to produce elemental [[silicon]]. The process involves [[carbothermic reduction]] in an [[electric arc furnace]]:&lt;ref&gt;Shriver and Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry (5th Edition). [[W. H. Freeman and Company]], New York, 2010, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 C   →   Si  +  2 CO

===Food and pharmaceutical applications===
Silica is a common additive in food production, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to [[adsorption|adsorb]] water in [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] applications. It is used as an anti-caking agent in powdered foods such as spices and non-dairy coffee creamer. It is the primary component of [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Colloid]]al silica is also used as a wine, beer, and juice [[fining agent (wine)|fining agent]].&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Flörke, Otto W. |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Silica |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Weinheim: Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3 |page=455 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3 |accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass.

==Production==
Silicon dioxide is mostly obtained by mining, including [[sand mining]] and purification of [[quartz]]. 
Quartz is suitable for many purposes, while chemical processing is required to make a purer or otherwise more suitable (e.g. more reactive or fine-grained) product.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Silica fume===
[[Silica fume]] is obtained as byproduct from hot processes like [[ferrosilicon]] production. It is less pure than fumed silica and should not be confused with that product. The production process, particle characteristics and fields of application of fumed silica are all different from those of silica fume.

===Precipitated silica===
Precipitated silica or amorphous silica is produced by the acidification of solutions of [[sodium silicate]]. The gelatinous precipitate or [[silica gel]], is first washed and then dehydrated to produce colorless microporous silica.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;  The idealized equation involving a trisilicate and [[sulfuric acid]] is:
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Approximately one billion kilograms/year (1999) of silica were produced in this manner, mainly for use for polymer composites – tires and shoe soles.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

===On microchips===
Thin films of silica grow spontaneously on [[silicon wafer]]s via [[thermal oxidation]], producing a very shallow layer of about 1 [[nanometre|nm]] or 10 [[angstrom|Å]] of so-called native oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doering, Robert  |author2=Nishi, Yoshio  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Handbook of Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-57444-675-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qi98H-iTgLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher temperatures and alternative environments are used to grow well-controlled layers of silicon dioxide on silicon, for example at temperatures between 600 and 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, using so-called dry or wet oxidation with [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The native oxide layer is beneficial in [[microelectronics]], where it acts as [[electric insulator]] with high chemical stability. It can protect the silicon, store charge, block current, and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow.&lt;ref&gt;Riordan, Michael (2007) [http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-silicon-dioxide-solution "The Silicon Dioxide Solution: How physicist Jean Hoerni built the bridge from the transistor to the integrated circuit"] [[IEEE Spectrum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory or special methods===

====From silicate esters====
Many routes to silicon dioxide start with silicate esters, the best known being [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS).  Simply heating TEOS at 680–730&amp;nbsp;°C gives the dioxide:
::Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 O(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Similarly TEOS combusts around 400&amp;nbsp;°C:

TEOS undergoes [[hydrolysis]] via the so-called [[sol-gel process]].  The course of the reaction and nature of the product are affected by catalysts, but the idealized equation is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nandiyanto | first1 = A. B.

====Other methods====
Being highly stable, silicon dioxide arises from many methods. Conceptually simple, but of little practical value, combustion of [[silane]] gives silicon dioxide.  This reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane:
::SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
However the [[chemical vapor deposition]] of silicon dioxide onto crystal surface from silane had been used using nitrogen as a '''carrier gas''' at 200-500&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name="Morgan&amp;Board2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=D. V.|last2=Board|first2=K.|title=An Introduction To Semiconductor Microtechnology|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0471924784|page=27|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical reactions==
[[File:Kieselsaeure380m2prog.jpg|thumb|Manufactured silica fume at maximum surface area of 380 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g]]

Silica is converted to silicon by reduction with carbon.

Fluorine reacts with silicon dioxide to form SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whereas the other halogen gases (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are essentially unreactive.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

Silicon dioxide is attacked by [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to produce [[hexafluorosilicic acid]]:&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HF → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
HF is used to remove or pattern silicon dioxide in the semiconductor industry.

Silicon dioxide acts as a [[Acid–base reaction#Lux–Flood definition|Lux–Flood acid]], being able to react with bases under certain conditions. As it does not contain any hydrogen, it cannot act as a [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted–Lowry acid]]. While not soluble in water, some strong bases will react with glass and have to be stored in plastic bottles as a result.&lt;ref name="Rodgers2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glen E. Rodgers|title=Descriptive Inorganic, Coordination, and Solid State Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BY8IAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA421|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-17248-2|pages=421–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon dioxide dissolves in hot concentrated alkali or fused hydroxide, as described in this idealized equation:&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
Silicon dioxide will neutralise basic metal oxides (e.g. [[sodium oxide]], [[potassium oxide]], [[lead(II) oxide]], [[zinc oxide]], or mixtures of oxides, forming [[silicate]]s and glasses as the Si-O-Si bonds in silica are broken successively).&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; As an example the reaction of sodium oxide and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce sodium orthosilicate, sodium silicate, and glasses, dependent on the proportions of reactants:&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;
:2 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;;

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;;

:(0.25–0.8)Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → glass.

Examples of such glasses have commercial significance, e.g. [[soda-lime glass]], [[borosilicate glass]], [[lead glass]]. In these glasses, silica is termed the network former or lattice former.&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; The reaction is also used in [[blast furnace]]s to remove sand impurities in the ore by neutralisation with calcium oxide, forming [[calcium silicate]] [[slag]].

Silicon dioxide reacts in heated [[reflux]] under [[dinitrogen]] with [[ethylene glycol]] and an [[alkali metal]] base to produce highly reactive, [[Hypervalent molecule#Pentacoordinated silicon|pentacoordinate]] silicates which provide access to a wide variety of new silicon compounds.&lt;ref name=Laine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laine|first1=Richard M.|last2=Blohowiak|first2=Kay Youngdahl|last3=Robinson|first3=Timothy R.|last4=Hoppe|first4=Martin L.|last5=Nardi|first5=Paola|last6=Kampf|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Uhm|first7=Jackie|title=Synthesis of pentacoordinate silicon complexes from SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=353|date=17 October 1991|issue=353|pages=642–644|doi=10.1038/353642a0|bibcode=1991Natur.353..642L|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62810/1/353642a0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silicates are essentially insoluble in all polar solvent except methanol.

Silicon dioxide reacts with elemental silicon at high temperatures to produce SiO:&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Si   →   2 SiO

===Water solubility===
The solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystalline form and is three-four times higher for silica than quartz; as a function of temperature, it peaks around 340&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The solubility of amorphous silica in water at high temperatures and high pressures |author1=Fournier R. O. |author2=Rowe J. J. |journal=[[American Mineralogist]] |year=1977|volume=62|pages=1052–1056|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM62/AM62_1052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is used to grow single crystals of quartz in a hydrothermal process where natural quartz is dissolved in superheated water in a pressure vessel that is cooler at the top. Crystals of 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;kg can be grown over a period of 1–2 months.&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crystals are a source of very pure quartz for use in electronic applications.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

==Health effects==
[[File:Piasek kwarcowy.jpg|thumb|Quartz sand (silica) as main raw material for commercial glass production]]
Silica ingested orally is essentially nontoxic, with an {{LD50}} of 5000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (5&amp;nbsp;g/kg).&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt; A 2008 study following subjects for 15 years found that higher levels of silica in water appeared to decrease the risk of [[dementia]]. An increase of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day of silica in drinking water was associated with a decreased risk of dementia of 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/aje/kwn348 |title=Aluminum and Silica in Drinking Water and the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease or Cognitive Decline: Findings from 15-Year Follow-up of the PAQUID Cohort |year=2008 |last1=Rondeau |first1=V. |last2=Jacqmin-Gadda |first2=H. |last3=Commenges |first3=D. |last4=Helmer |first4=C. |last5=Dartigues |first5=J.-F. |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=169 |issue=4 |pages=489–96 |pmid=19064650 |pmc=2809081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to [[silicosis]], [[bronchitis]], or [[lung cancer]], as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates the tissue, reducing lung capacities.&lt;ref&gt;CPWR-Center for Construction Research and Training&amp;nbsp;— Work Safely with Silica: [http://www.silica-safe.org "What are the Health Effects?]&lt;/ref&gt; When fine silica particles are inhaled in large enough quantities (such as through occupational exposure), it increases the risk of [[systemic autoimmune disease]]s such as [[lupus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/about_us/Mission_and_Purpose/lupus_plan.asp The Future Directions of Lupus Research]. niams.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] compared to expected rates in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Armando Meyer, Dale P.

===Occupational hazard===

Silica is an occupational hazard for people who do [[Abrasive blasting|sandblasting]], or work with products that contain powdered crystalline silica. Amorphous silica, such as fumed silica, may cause irreversible lung damage in some cases, but is not associated with development of silicosis. Children, asthmatics of any age, those with allergies, and the elderly (all of whom have reduced lung capacity) can be affected in less time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1648030 |year=1991 |last1=Reuzel |first1=P. G. |last2=Bruijntjes |first2=J. P. |last3=Feron |first3=V. J. |last4=Woutersen |first4=R.

Crystalline silica is an occupational hazard for those working with stone [[countertop]]s, because the process of cutting and installing the countertops creates large amounts of airborne silica.&lt;ref name=Hazard&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2015-106/pdfs/2015-106.pdf |title = Worker Exposure to Silica during Countertop Manufacturing, Finishing and Installation |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) |date = February 2015 |accessdate = 26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystalline silica used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] presents a health hazard to workers.&lt;ref name=NYT82313/&gt;

===Pathophysiology===
In the body, crystalline silica particles do not dissolve over clinically relevant periods. Silica crystals inside the lungs can activate the NLRP3 [[inflammasome]] inside macrophages and dendritic cells and thereby result in production of [[interleukin]], a highly [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]] in the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18604214 |year=2008 |last1=Hornung |first1=Veit |last2=Bauernfeind |first2=Franz |last3=Halle |first3=Annett |last4= et al |first4= |title=Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=847–856 |journal=[[Nature Immunology]] |doi=10.1038/ni.1631 |pmc=2834784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH (1986) Occupational respiratory diseases.

===Regulation===
Regulations restricting silica exposure 'with respect to the silicosis hazard' specify that they are concerned only with silica, which is both crystalline and dust-forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/crystalline-factsheet.pdf|title=Crystalline Factsheet|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/silicacrystalline/|accessdate=3 August 2017|title=Silica, Crystalline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silica-safe.org/ask-a-question/faq|accessdate=3 August 2017|title=Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.uconn.edu/Word%20Docs/Silica%20fact%20sheet.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2017|title=If It's Silica, It's Not Just Dust!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osha.oregon.gov/OSHAPubs/3301.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2017|title=What you should know about crystalline silica, silicosis, and Oregon OSHA silica rules.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szymendera|first1=Scott D.|title=Respirable Crystalline Silica in the Workplace: New Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards|date=January 16, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44476.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] reduced the exposure limit to 50 [[micrograms|µg]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air. Prior to 2013, it had allowed 100 &amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and in construction workers even 250&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=NYT82313 /&gt;
In 2013, OSHA also required "green completion" of fracked wells to reduce exposure to crystalline silica besides restricting the limit of exposure.&lt;ref name=NYT82313/&gt;

==Crystalline forms==
SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, more so than almost any material, exists in many crystalline forms. These forms are called [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]].

The '''Solar Sharing''' is an innovative form of [[Finance|financing]], based on the participation of the people. target is to develop new [[solar energy]] and at the same time, share the economic benefits among those who contributed to the realization of the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ucilia Wang |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/07/03/get-ready-for-solar-sharing-communities/ |title=Get ready for solar sharing communities |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new model represents an advance guard for the [[renewable energy commercialization|photovoltaic industry]] which, however, could soon be greatly revolutionized especially in a period in which development incentives are gradually running out in the world and the traditional possibilities financing projects are reduced at both because of the decline in attractiveness of the sector, that the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007-08|global economic crisis]] which led to a general difficulty of access to credit for businesses.

==How it works==
The Solar Sharing model is based on the idea of sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/news/opinion/editorial/editorial-sharing-in-a-solar-future/article_6920ce76-28b3-5b10-a7b1-ba9f792d1b81.html |title=Editorial, 7/28: Sharing in a solar future : Opinion |publisher=Journalstar.com |date=2014-07-27 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A group of people comes together to build a solar power plant, medium or large, and distributes construction costs within the group. When the plant begins to produce energy, the proceeds from the sale of energy are redistributed within the group, in proportion to the contribution made to the project. The application of this model reduces both initial and maintenance costs, due to economies of scale that arise compared to the creation of many small domestic installations.

==Benefits of solar sharing==
The solar sharing is achieving resounding success, although it is a recent model of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54570.pdf |accessdate=April 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306024907/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54570.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is due to its own specific characteristics that enable individuals, even ordinary citizens to become energy producers and enjoy the economic returns that flow from it. All this even in the absence of a space just where achieve a common solar home.
For many people it is difficult to achieve a domestic installation due to: 
*lack of space; 
*architectural constraints / urban / landscaped areas and buildings; 
*geographical location and / or territorial unfavorable; 
*bureaucratic complications related to permissions and the network connection.

More and more people deem it most advantageous to purchase a share of a medium or large solar plant. This choice may in fact lead not only to cover the economic costs of domestic energy, but also to generate additional earnings.

==Examples of solar sharing==
There are several companies around the world that are contributing to the realization of solar sharing and producing clean energy for the planet. Some models involve installing solar panels at ground level, in large open spaces. Other companies install the panels on rooftops.

There are also numerous examples of cooperatives and associations that offer local financing or a few individual plants. These are actually operating in Italy, Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Close |first=Curt |url=http://permaculturenews.org/2013/10/16/japanese-farmers-producing-crops-solar-energy-simultaneously/ |title=Japanese Farmers Producing Crops and Solar Energy Simultaneously |publisher=Permaculturenews.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collier |first=Steven |url=http://energyblog.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/21/solar-gardens-let-communities-share-renewable-power/ |title=Solar ‘Gardens’ Let Communities Share Renewable Power – The Great Energy Challenge Blog |publisher=Energyblog.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spearfish''' ([[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''Hočhápȟe''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ullrich |first=Jan F. |title=New Lakota Dictionary |url=http://www.lakotadictionary.org/nldo.php |edition=2nd |year=2014 |publisher=Lakota Language Consortium |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-0-9761082-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a city in [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence County]], [[South Dakota]], United States. The population was 10,494 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Before the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] of 1876, the area was used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s (primarily bands of [[Sioux]] but others also ranged through the area). Once the gold rush started, the city was founded in 1876 at the mouth of [[Spearfish Canyon]], and was originally called Queen City.&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitspearfish.com/aboutspearfish/history/ |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=History |date= |website=Visit Spearfish, South Dakota |publisher= |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010403/http://www.visitspearfish.com/aboutspearfish/history/ |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spearfish grew as a supplier of foodstuffs to the [[Gold mining|mining]] camps in the hills. Even today, a significant amount of [[truck farming]] and [[market gardening]] still occurs in the vicinity.

In 1887, the accepted history of gold mining in the Black Hills was thrown into question by the discovery of what has become known as the [[Thoen Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30299 "The Thoen Stone"]. – ''Black Hills Visitor Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovered by Louis Thoen on the slopes of Lookout Mountain, the stone purports to be the last testament of Ezra Kind who, along with six others, entered the Black Hills in 1833 (at a time when whites were forbidden by law and treaty from entering the area), "got all the gold we could carry" in June 1834, and were subsequently "killed by Indians beyond the high hill."  While it may seem unlikely that someone who has "lost my gun and nothing to eat and Indians hunting me" would take the time to carve his story in sandstone, there is corroborating historical evidence for the Ezra Kind party.&lt;ref&gt;Tallent, Annie D., (1899). – ''The Black Hills, Or, The Last Hunting Ground of the Dakotahs''. – St. Louis, Missouri: Nixon-Jones. – pp.10–11. {{OCLC search link|191327730}}.&lt;br&gt;—Peattie, Roderick (1952). – ''The Black Hills''. – New York, New York: Vanguard Press. – p.58. – {{OCLC search link|490448}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the history of Spearfish was tied very closely to mining and tourism. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who visited Spearfish Canyon in 1935, later called the area "unique and unparalleled elsewhere in our country," and wondered, "How is it that I've heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of the Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spearfishcanyon.com/vegetation.htm "Vegetation-Wright Chronicles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421063806/http://www.spearfishcanyon.com/vegetation.htm |date=2005-04-21 }}. – Spearfish Canyon Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Homestake Sawmill (previously part of Pope and Talbot, now owned by Neimen Forest Products) was built to supply timbers for the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] (closed January 2002). In 1938, Joseph Meier brought the Luenen [[Passion Play]] to settle permanently in Spearfish and become the Black Hills Passion Play, drawing thousands of visitors every year during the summer months. After Meier's death in 2007, the amphitheater and {{convert|23|acre|m2}} surrounding it were put up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/articles/2007/10/11/news/latest_news/54f39a5c4712d279862573710041f45f.txt "Passion Play property for sale"]. – [[Associated Press]]. – (c/o ''[[Sioux City Journal]]''. – October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spearfish Creek is a fast-moving creek that emerges from [[Spearfish Canyon]] at Spearfish. It runs roughly south to north through the center of town (parallel to Canyon Street), year round. The creek freezes from the bottom up instead of icing over. This unusual phenomenon occurs due to the very fast rate at which the creek flows. This speed prevents ice from forming except along the bottom of the creek bed where friction and turbulence allow the water to slow down long enough to freeze. Since the creek continues to flow atop this ice, the water level of the creek gradually rises as more ice accumulates on the bottom, in some cases causing flooding on the north side of town where the channel is not as deep.&lt;ref name="visitck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitspearfish.com/thingstodo/outdooractivities/spearfishcreek/ |title=Spearfish Creek |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Visit Spearfish, South Dakota |publisher= |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spearfish has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] 57783 and the [[FIPS place code]] 60020. [[Black Hills State University]] has its own ZIP code, 57799.

==Climate==
Given its location at the base of the [[Black Hills]] and its proximity to the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the climate in Spearfish is highly variable at any time of the year. This is especially true in the winter months. According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] Spearfish is in a transition zone between [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] and [[humid continental climate|continental]]. Due to January being just above the {{convert|26.6|F|C}} isotherm for continental (according to NOAA figures) it slightly leans towards subtropical, in spite of the cold winter nights. According to Weatherbase’s figures, the climate is instead firmly within the continental zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=288793&amp;cityname=Spearfish-South-Dakota-United-States-of-America|title=Spearfish, South Dakota Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow depth is limited: even in winter half of all days have no snow on the ground, although on average {{convert|48.0|in|m|2|disp=or}} of fresh snow falls.

===World record temperature change===
Spearfish holds the world record for the fastest recorded temperature change.  On January 22, 1943 at about 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MST]], the temperature in Spearfish was −4°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (−20°[[Celsius|C]]).  The [[Chinook wind]] picked up speed rapidly, and two minutes later (7:32&amp;nbsp;a.m.) the temperature was +45&amp;nbsp;°F (+7&amp;nbsp;°C) above zero. The {{convert|49|F-change|C-change|disp=or}} rise in two minutes set a world record that still holds.  By 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the temperature had risen to 54&amp;nbsp;°F (12&amp;nbsp;°C). Suddenly, the chinook died down and the temperature tumbled back to {{convert|−4|°F|°C|disp=or}}. The {{convert|58|F-change|C-change|1|disp=or}} drop took only 27 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia01 "South Dakota Weather History and Trivia January"]. – [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Weather Service]].&lt;br&gt;—Appendix I: – [http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/research/Guide/weatherextremes.pdf "Weather Extremes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528065516/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/research/Guide/weatherextremes.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}. – [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. – (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Watson (1981). – ''Deadwood: The Golden Years''. – Lincoln, Nebraska: The University of Nebraska. – p.158. – {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8702-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sudden change in temperatures caused glass windows to crack and windshields to instantly frost over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/unr/?n=01-22-43-spearfish-temperatures|title=Rapid City, SD|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme winter maxima in the district are remarkably warm for its latitude and on January 19, 1921 Spearfish reached a remarkable {{convert|79|F|C|1|disp=or}}, not only the hottest January temperature in South Dakota on record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0930254.html|title=South Dakota: Temperature Extremes|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but almost certainly the hottest temperature recorded in or near mid-winter anywhere so far from the equator.

[[File:Sonnengewehr.jpg|thumb|Sun gun]]
The '''sun gun''' or '''heliobeam''' is a theoretical [[orbital weapon]], which makes use of a [[concave mirror]] mounted on a [[satellite]], to shoot [[sun balls]] to a small area of the Earth's surface, destroying targets or killing through heat.

==History==
The Scottish mathematician [[John Napier]] proposed such a device. In his book ''Secrete Inventionis'' (1596), he published details of a giant mirror to burn enemy ships by focusing the sun's rays on them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1929, the German physicist [[Hermann Oberth]] developed plans for a space station from which a 100-metre-wide concave mirror could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the earth.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 9, 1945|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852344-1,00.html|title=Science: Sun Gun|journal = [[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during [[World War II]], a group of German scientists at the German Army Artillery proving grounds at [[Hillersleben]] began to expand on Oberth's idea of creating a superweapon that could utilize the sun's energy. This so-called "sun gun" (''Sonnengewehr'') would be part of a space station {{convert|8200|km}} above Earth. The scientists calculated that a huge reflector, made of metallic [[sodium]] and with an area of {{convert|9|sqkm|ha mi2}}, could produce enough focused heat to make an ocean boil or burn a city.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; After being questioned by officers of the United States, the Germans claimed that the sun gun could be completed within 50 or 100 years.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 23, 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The German Space Mirror|journal = [[Life Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in popular culture==
In the film ''[[Die Another Day]]'', the twentieth installment in the [[James Bond series]] of films, the primary antagonist of the film, fictional British billionaire Gustav Graves (in reality the alias of the assumed-to-be-dead North Korean Colonel Tan Sun-Moon), constructs an orbital sun gun code-named "[[Icarus]]" for the use of cutting a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] and allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea. The device was disabled after its control console is destroyed.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A similar concept is used in the ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]'' video game. In the game, a special satellite code-named Regia Solis is used to provide a city with clean energy but at full capacity it is powerful enough to destroy said city or other targets.

In the TV series ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' episode "Sun of a Gun", [[Walter O'Brien (character)|Walter O'Brien's fictional alter ego]] and his team are sent alongside their friend Sylvester Dodd's estranged father to an African dictator's country to investigate his discovery of a Nazi World War II sun gun project.

In the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' book ''[[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)#Wedge's Gamble|Wedge's Gamble]]'', Rogue Squadron commandeers an orbital solar reflector (used for power generation) is used to boil ocean water in an effort to generate a large enough storm to knock out power on the planet (Coruscant) below.

In [[Wolfenstein: The New Order|Wolfenstein: The New Order]], there is a similar mechanism called the “Sonnengewehr” that is featured in the newspapers.

In the science fiction novel by [[René Barjavel]] ''The Ice People (French: la Nuit des temps)'' the doomsday device build by the gondas looks mostly inspired by the concept of the sun gun.

In an episode of Futurama, one of these is the result of a failed attempt to reverse global warming with a giant mirror.

A '''tactile sensor''' is a device that measures information arising from physical interaction with its environment. Tactile sensors are generally modeled after the biological sense of [[cutaneous receptor|cutaneous touch]] which is capable of detecting stimuli resulting from mechanical stimulation, temperature, and pain (although pain sensing is not common in artificial tactile sensors). Tactile [[sensor]]s are used in [[robotics]], [[computer hardware]] and [[security systems]]. A common application of tactile sensors is in [[touchscreen]] devices on [[mobile phones]] and [[computing]].

Tactile sensors may be of different types including [[piezoresistive]], [[piezoelectric]], capacitive and elastoresistive sensors.&lt;ref name="A4"&gt;. Tactile sensors also come in the form of pressure indicating films that reveal pressure distribution and magnitude between contacting surfaces by virtue of an immediate and permanent color change. These pressure indicating films are one-time use sensor that capture the maximum pressure they were exposed to. Pressure indicating films are activated by chemical reaction and are non-electronic sensors.  [https://www.springer.com/engineering/robotics/book/978-94-007-0578-4 Robotic Tactile Sensing - Technologies and System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Tactile sensors appear in everyday life such as elevator buttons and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base. There are also innumerable applications for tactile sensors of which most people are never aware.

Sensors that measure very small changes must have very high sensitivities. Sensors need to be designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. Tactile sensors can be used to test the performance of all types of applications. For example, these sensors have been used in the [[manufacturing]] of [[automobiles]] (brakes, clutches, door seals, [[gasket]]), [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] lamination, bolted joints, [[fuel cell]]s etc.

[[Tactile imaging]], as a medical imaging modality, translating the sense of touch into a digital image is based on the tactile sensors. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern.

[[Robot]]s designed to interact with objects requiring handling involving precision, [[dexterity]], or interaction with unusual objects, need sensory apparatus which is functionally equivalent to a human's tactile ability. Tactile sensors have been developed for use with robots. Tactile sensors can complement visual systems by providing added information when the robot begins to grip an object. At this time vision is no longer sufficient, as the mechanical properties of the object cannot be determined by vision alone. Determining weight, texture, [[stiffness]], [[center of mass]], [[coefficient of friction]], and [[thermal conductivity]] require object interaction and some sort of tactile sensing.
 
Several classes of tactile sensors are used in robots in warfare and engineering

==Pressure Sensor Arrays==
Pressure sensor arrays are large grids of tactels. A "tactel" is a ‘tactile element’. Each tactel is capable of detecting normal forces. Tactel-based sensors provide a high resolution ‘image’ of the contact surface. Alongside spatial resolution and force sensitivity, systems-integration questions such as wiring and signal routing are important.&lt;ref name="A0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5339133|title=Tactile Sensing—From Humans to Humanoids - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure sensor arrays are available in [[thin-film]] form. They are primarily used as analytical tools used in the [[manufacturing]] and [[R&amp;D]] processes by engineers and technicians, and have been adapted for use in robots. Examples of such sensors available to consumers include arrays built from [[conductive rubber]],&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1331366|title=A tactile sensor sheet using pressure conductive rubber with electrical-wires stitched method - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT), [[polyvinylidene fluoride]](PVDF), PVDF-TrFE,&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5887375|title=Towards Tactile Sensing System on Chip for Robotic Applications - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field-effect transistor|FET]],&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;[http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v95/i3/p034105_s1 Piezoelectric oxide semiconductor field effect transistor touch sensing devices]&lt;/ref&gt; and metallic [[capacitive sensing]] elements.

==Strain Gauge Rosettes==
Strain gauges rosettes are constructed from multiple [[strain gauge]]s, with each gauge detecting the force in a particular direction. When the information from each strain gauge is combined, the information allows determination of a pattern of forces or torques.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://www.schunk.com/schunk_files/attachments/FT-Nano_43_EN.pdf Data sheet for Schunk FT-Nano 43, a 6-axis force torque sensor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biologically Inspired Tactile Sensors==
A variety of biologically inspired designs have been suggested ranging from simple whisker-like sensors which measure only one point at a time &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Evans2/publication/221116457_Tactile_Discrimination_Using_Template_Classifiers_Towards_a_Model_of_Feature_Extraction_in_Mammalian_Vibrissal_Systems/links/0deec516be39482f27000000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; through more advanced fingertip-like sensors,&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4762917|title=A robust micro-vibration sensor for biomimetic fingertips - IEEE Conference Publication|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5174720|title=Development of a tactile sensor based on biologically inspired edge encoding - IEEE Conference Publication|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/4591408/4600290/04600304.pdf?arnumber=4600304&amp;authDecision=-203|title=A biologically inspired tactile sensor array utilizing phase-based computation - IEEE Conference Publication|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to complete skin-like sensors as on the latest [[iCub]](citation needed). Biologically inspired tactile sensors often incorporate more than one sensing strategy. For example, they might detect both the distribution of pressures, and the pattern of forces that would come from pressure sensor arrays and strain gauge rosettes, allowing [[two-point discrimination]] and force sensing, with human-like ability.

Advanced versions of biologically designed tactile sensors include [[vibration]] sensing which has been determined to be important for understanding interactions between the tactile sensor and objects where the sensor slides over the object. Such interactions are now understood to be important for human tool use and judging the texture of an object.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; One such sensor combines force sensing, vibration sensing, and heat transfer sensing.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

==DIY and Open-Hardware Tactile Sensors==
Recently, a sophisticated tactile sensor has been made [[Open-source hardware|open-hardware]], enabling enthusiasts and hobbyists to experiment with an otherwise expensive technology.&lt;ref name="D1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takktile.com/main:plans|title=Building It - TakkTile|author=|date=|website=www.takktile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, with the advent of cheap optical cameras, novel sensors have been proposed which can be built easily and cheaply with a 3D printer.&lt;ref name="D2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Exhor/bathtip|title=Exhor/bathtip|author=|date=|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trianel Windpark Borkum''' (formerly '''Borkum West II''') is an offshore wind farm near [[Borkum]]. Its first phase of 40 turbines rated at a total power of 200&amp;nbsp;MW is operational, with a planned, additional 200&amp;nbsp;MW in a second phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.power-technology.com/projects/borkum-farm/ | title =  Borkum West II Offshore Wind Farm, Germany | publisher = power-technology.com | accessdate = 24 January 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was approved for construction in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berkenhagen | first1 = J.

Originally known as '''Borkum West II''' the name was changed to '''Trianel Windpark Borkum''' in early 2013.

Phase 1 of the installation was completed in the 4th quarter of 2014 and consist of 40 Areva M5000-116 turbines (5&amp;nbsp;MW turbines) on [[Tripod (foundation)|Tripod foundations]].&lt;ref name=trianel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trianel-borkum.de/en/wind-farm/facts-and-figures.html |title= Facts and figures |website= trianel-borkum.de |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was connected to the grid in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/germany-adds-lots-of-offshore-wind/150/435/89907/|title=Germany adds lots of offshore wind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the six months before March 2016 the wind farm produced 452.33&amp;nbsp;[[GWh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.presseportal.de/pm/67884/3280198 |title= Trianel Windpark Borkum halbes Jahr in Betrieb Erster rein kommunaler Offshore-Windpark erfüllt positive Erwartungen |website= presseportal.de |date= 2016-03-18 |accessdate= 2017-03-05 |language= de |trans-title=Trianel Windpark Borkum half year in operation First purely municipal offshore wind farm fulfills positive expectations}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a [[capacity factor]] of 51.6%&lt;!-- 452,330 MWh/ (1/2 year) / ( 200 MW * 365 days/year * 24h/day) = 0.516 --&gt;.

Founded in 1985, UVLT helps landowners and communities in its region protect lands that have important natural resource values and help define the rural character of the Upper Valley.  UVLT works with willing landowners to protect working farms, forest lands, river and stream frontage, wildlife habitat, scenic landscapes, and recreational resources from future development.  The primary tool that UVLT uses to conserve land is a legal document known as a [[conservation easement]] which runs with the land in perpetuity.

'''Uranium dioxide''' or '''uranium(IV) oxide ({{Uranium}}{{Oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''', also known as '''urania''' or '''uranous oxide''', is an [[oxide]] of [[uranium]], and is a black, [[radioactivity|radioactive]], [[crystal]]line powder that naturally occurs in the mineral [[uraninite]]. It is used in [[nuclear fuel]] rods in [[nuclear reactors]]. A mixture of uranium and [[plutonium]] dioxides is used as [[MOX fuel]]. Prior to 1960, it was used as yellow and black color in [[ceramic]] [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]s and [[glass]].

==Production==
Uranium dioxide is produced by [[Redox|reducing]] [[uranium trioxide]] with [[hydrogen]].

:UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at 700&amp;nbsp;°C (973&amp;nbsp;K)

This reaction plays an important part in the creation of [[nuclear fuel]] through [[nuclear reprocessing]] and [[uranium enrichment]].

==Chemistry==

===Structure===
The solid is [[isostructural]] with (has the same structure as) [[fluorite]] ([[calcium fluoride]]), where each U is surrounded by eight O nearest neighbors in a cubic arrangement. In addition, the dioxides of [[Cerium(IV) oxide|cerium]], [[plutonium]] and [[neptunium]] have the same structures.  No other elemental dioxides have the fluorite structure. Upon melting, the measured average U-O coordination reduces from 8 in the crystalline solid (UO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cubes), down to 6.7±0.5 (at 3270 K) in the melt.&lt;ref name = "Skinner2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1259709 |pmid=25414311 |title=Molten uranium dioxide structure and dynamics |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6212 |pages=984–7 |year=2014 |last1=Skinner |first1=L.

B. |bibcode=2014Sci...346..984S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Models consistent with these measurements show the melt to consist mainly of UO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and UO&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; polyhedral units, where roughly {{frac|2|3}} of the connections between polyhedra are corner sharing and {{frac|1|3}} are edge sharing.&lt;ref name = "Skinner2014"/&gt;

===Oxidation===
Uranium dioxide is [[oxidized]] in contact with [[oxygen]] to the [[triuranium octaoxide]].

:3 UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; at 700&amp;nbsp;°C (970&amp;nbsp;K)

The [[electrochemistry]] of uranium dioxide has been investigated in detail as the [[galvanic corrosion]] of uranium dioxide controls the rate at which used [[nuclear fuel]] dissolves. See [[spent nuclear fuel]] for further details. [[Water]] increases the oxidation rate of [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]] metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756904-DrPADO/webviewable/756904.pdf| title =Reactions of Plutonium Dioxide with Water and Oxygen-Hydrogen Mixtures: Mechanisms for Corrosion of Uranium and Plutonium| accessdate=2009-06-06|year=1999|last1=Haschke|first1=John M|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas H|last3=Morales|first3=Luis A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0925-8388(00)01222-6 |title=Reactions of plutonium dioxide with water and hydrogen–oxygen mixtures: Mechanisms for corrosion of uranium and plutonium |journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds |volume=314 |issue=1–2 |pages=78–91 |year=2001 |last1=Haschke |first1=John M |last2=Allen |first2=Thomas H |last3=Morales |first3=Luis A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbonization===
Uranium dioxide is [[carbonized]] in contact with [[carbon]], forming [[uranium carbide]] and [[carbon monoxide]].

UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 C → UC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 CO

This process must be done under an [[inert gas]] as [[uranium carbide]] is easily oxidized back into [[uranium oxide]].

==Uses==

===Nuclear fuel===

UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used mainly as [[nuclear fuel]], specifically as UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or as a mixture of UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[plutonium dioxide]]) called a mixed oxide ([[MOX fuel]]), in the form of [[fuel rod]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Note that the [[thermal conductivity]] of uranium dioxide is very low when compared with [[uranium]], [[uranium nitride]], [[uranium carbide]] and [[zirconium]] cladding material. This low thermal conductivity can result in localised overheating in the centres of fuel pellets. The graph below shows the different temperature gradients in different fuel compounds. For these fuels the thermal power density is the same and the diameter of all the pellets are the same.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Color for glass ceramic glaze===
[[File:FiestaWare Velleman-K2645 GeigerCounter.ogv|thumb|right|Geiger counter (kit without housing) audibly reacting to an orange Fiestaware shard.]]
Uranium oxide (urania) was used to color glass and ceramics prior to World War II, and until the applications of radioactivity were discovered this was its main use. In 1958 the military in both the USA and Europe allowed its commercial use again as depleted uranium, and its use began again on a more limited scale. Urania-based ceramic glazes are dark green or black when fired in a reduction or when  UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used; more commonly it is used in oxidation to produce bright yellow, orange and red glazes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.uranglasuren.com/|title=Uran in der Keramik. Geschichte - Technik - Hersteller|last=Örtel|first=Stefan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orange-colored [[Fiestaware]] is a well-known example of a product with a urania-colored glaze.  [[Uranium glass]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is pale green to yellow, and often has strong fluorescent properties. Urania has also been used in formulations of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[porcelain]]. It is possible to determine with a [[Geiger counter]] if a glaze or glass produced before 1958 contains urania.

===Other use===
Prior to the realisation of the harmfulness of radiation, uranium was included in false teeth and dentures, as its slight fluorescence made the dentures appear more like real teeth in a variety of lighting conditions.

[[Depleted uranium|Depleted]] UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (DUO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be used as a material for [[radiation shielding]]. For example, [[DUCRETE]] is a "heavy [[concrete]]" material where [[gravel]] is replaced with uranium dioxide aggregate; this material is investigated for use for [[cask]]s for [[radioactive waste]]. Casks can be also made of DUO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[steel]] [[cermet]], a [[composite material]] made of an [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] of uranium dioxide serving as radiation shielding, [[graphite]] and/or [[silicon carbide]] serving as [[neutron radiation]] absorber and moderator, and steel as the matrix, whose high thermal conductivity allows easy removal of decay heat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Depleted uranium dioxide can be also used as a [[catalyst]], e.g. for degradation of [[volatile organic compound]]s in gaseous phase, [[oxidation]] of [[methane]] to [[methanol]], and removal of [[sulfur]] from [[petroleum]]. It has high efficiency and long-term stability when used to destroy VOCs when compared with some of the commercial [[catalyst]]s, such as [[precious metal]]s, [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[cobalt oxide|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] catalysts. Much research is being done in this area, DU being favoured for the uranium component due to its low radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/384341a0 |title=Uranium-oxide-based catalysts for the destruction of volatile chloro-organic compounds |journal=Nature |volume=384 |issue=6607 |pages=341–3 |year=1996 |last1=Hutchings |first1=Graham J. |last2=Heneghan |first2=Catherine S. |last3=Hudson |first3=Ian D. |last4=Taylor |first4=Stuart H. |bibcode=1996Natur.384..341H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of uranium dioxide as a material for [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] is being investigated. The batteries could have high [[power density]] and potential of 4.7 V per cell. Another investigated application is in [[photoelectrochemical cell]]s for solar-assisted hydrogen production where UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a [[photoanode]]. In earlier times, uranium dioxide was also used as heat conductor for current limitation (URDOX-resistor), which was the first use of its semiconductor properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Uranium dioxide is also the strongest known piezomagnet in the antiferromagnetic state observed at cryogenic temperatures below 30 [[kelvin]]s. UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays a linear magnetostriction that changes sign with the sign of the applied magnetic field, and magnetoelastic memory switching at magnetic fields near 180,000 Oe.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jaime et al. (2017), Piezomagnetism and magnetoelastic memory in uranium dioxide. ''Nature Communications'' '''8''', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiconductor properties===
The [[band gap]] of uranium dioxide is comparable to these of [[silicon]] and [[gallium arsenide]], near the optimum for efficiency vs band gap curve for absorption of solar radiation, suggesting its possible use for very efficient [[solar cell]]s based on [[Schottky diode]] structure; it also absorbs at five different wavelengths, including infrared, further enhancing its efficiency. Its intrinsic conductivity at room temperature is about the same as of [[single crystal]] silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.207402 |pmid=21668262 |title=Ultrafast Hopping Dynamics of 5''f'' Electrons in the Mott Insulator UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Studied by Femtosecond Pump-Probe Spectroscopy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=106 |issue=20 |pages=207402 |year=2011 |last1=An |first1=Yong Q. |last2=Taylor |first2=Antoinette J. |last3=Conradson |first3=Steven D. |last4=Trugman |first4=Stuart A. |last5=Durakiewicz |first5=Tomasz |last6=Rodriguez |first6=George |bibcode=2011PhRvL.106t7402A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dielectric constant]] of uranium dioxide is about 22, which is almost twice as high as of silicon (11.2) and GaAs (14.1). This is an advantage over Si and GaAs in construction of [[integrated circuit]]s, as it may allow higher density integration with higher [[breakdown voltage]]s and with lower susceptibility to the [[CMOS]] [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] breakdown.

The [[Seebeck coefficient]] of uranium dioxide at room temperature is about 750 µV/K, a value significantly higher than the 270 µV/K of [[thallium tin telluride]] (Tl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnTe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[thallium germanium telluride]] (Tl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and of [[bismuth]]-[[tellurium]] alloys, other materials promising for [[thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric power generation]] applications and [[Peltier element]]s.

The [[radioactive decay]] impact of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U on its semiconducting properties was not measured {{as of|2005|lc=on}}. Due to the slow decay rate of these isotopes, it should not meaningfully influence the properties of uranium dioxide solar cells and thermoelectric devices, but it may become an important factor for [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chips. Use of [[depleted uranium]] oxide is necessary for this reason. The capture of alpha particles emitted during radioactive decay as helium atoms in the crystal lattice may also cause gradual long-term changes in its properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[stoichiometry]] of the material dramatically influences its electrical properties. For example, the electrical conductivity of UO&lt;sub&gt;1.994&lt;/sub&gt; is orders of magnitude lower at higher temperatures than the conductivity of UO&lt;sub&gt;2.001&lt;/sub&gt;.

Uranium dioxide, like U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[ceramic]] material capable of withstanding high temperatures (about 2300&amp;nbsp;°C, in comparison with at most 200&amp;nbsp;°C for silicon or GaAs), making it suitable for high-temperature applications like thermophotovoltaic devices.

Uranium dioxide is also resistant to [[radiation]] damage, making it useful for [[radiation hardening|rad-hard]] devices for special military and [[aerospace]] applications.

A [[Schottky diode]] of [[yellowcake|U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] and a [[p-n-p transistor]] of UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were successfully manufactured in a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2008.04.005 |title=Semiconductor devices fabricated from actinide oxides |journal=Vacuum |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=226–8 |year=2008 |last1=Meek |first1=Thomas T. |last2=von Roedern |first2=B. |bibcode=2008Vacuu..83..226M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uranium tetrachloride''' (UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is compound of [[uranium]] in [[oxidation state]] +4. It was used in the electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] (EMIS) process of [[uranium enrichment]].  It is one of the main starting materials for organouranium chemistry.

== Synthesis ==
Uranium tetrachloride is synthesised generally by the reaction of [[uranium trioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hexachloropropene]].  Solvent UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adducts can be formed by a simpler reaction of UI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with [[hydrogen chloride]] in organic solvents.

== Chemical properties ==

Uranium tetrachloride is a [[hygroscopic]], dark green solid, which sublimes in a high vacuum at ca. 500&amp;nbsp;°C. The [[crystal structure]] shows the uranium to be surrounded by eight chlorine atoms, four at 264 pm and the other four at 287pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.C.|author2=Wilson, P.W. |year=1973|title=A neutron-diffraction study of anhydrous uranium tetrachloride|journal=Acta Crystallogr. B |volume=29|pages=1942–1944|doi=10.1107/S0567740873005790|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecule UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Lewis acid]] and dissolves in solvents that can act as non-protic [[Lewis base]]s.

Dissolution in protic solvents is more complicated. When UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is added to water the uranium [[Metal ions in aqueous solution|aqua ion]] is formed.
:UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|x}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; [U(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The aqua ion [U(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, (x is 8 or 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=F.|year=1986|title=Thermodynamic properties of lanthanide and actinide ions in aqueous solution|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=121|pages=27–42|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is strongly hydrolyzed. 
:[U(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} [U(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;{{math|''x''−1}}&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
The [[acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] for this reaction is ca. 1.6,&lt;ref name=scdb&gt;[http://swww.acadsoft.co.uk/scdbase/scdbase.htm IUPAC SC-Database]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} A comprehensive database of published data on equilibrium constants of metal complexes and ligands&lt;/ref&gt; so hydrolysis is absent only in solutions of acid strength 1&amp;nbsp;mol dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or stronger (pH &lt; 0). Further hydrolysis occurs at pH &gt; 3. Weak chloro complexes of the aqua ion may be formed. Published estimates of the log K value for the formation of [UCl]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) vary from −0.5 to +3 because of difficulty in dealing with simultaneous hydrolysis.&lt;ref name=scdb/&gt;

With alcohols, partial [[solvolysis]] may occur.
:UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|x}}ROH {{eqm}} UCl&lt;sub&gt;{{math|4−''x''}}&lt;/sub&gt;(OR)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|x}}HCl

Uranium tetrachloride dissolves in non-protic solvents such as [[tetrahydrofuran]], [[acetonitrile]], [[dimethyl formamide]] etc. that can act as [[Lewis base]]s. Solvates of formula UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; are formed which may be isolated. The solvent must be completely free of dissolved water, or hydrolysis will occur, with the solvent, S, picking up the released proton.
:UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + S {{eqm}} UCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH) + SH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The solvent molecules may be replaced by other ligand in a reaction such as 
:UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; [UCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.
The solvent is not shown, just as when complexes of other metal ions are formed in aqueous solution.

Solutions of UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are susceptible to oxidation by air, resulting in the production of complexes of the [[uranyl]] ion.

== Applications ==
Uranium tetrachloride is produced commercially by the reaction of [[carbon tetrachloride]] with pure [[uranium dioxide]] UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 370&amp;nbsp;°C. It has been used as feed in the electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] (EMIS) process of [[uranium enrichment]]. Beginning in 1944, the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant]] converted UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; feed for the [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]'s [[calutron|Alpha Calutrons]]. Its major benefit being the uranium tetrachloride used in the calutrons is not as corrosive as the [[uranium hexafluoride]] used in most other enrichment technologies This process was abandoned in the 1950s. In the 1980s, however, [[Iraq]] unexpectedly revived this option as part of its nuclear weapons program. In the enrichment process, uranium tetrachloride is ionized into a uranium [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

The uranium ions are then accelerated and passed through a strong [[magnetic field]]. After traveling along half of a circle the beam is split into a region nearer the outside wall which is depleted and a region nearer the inside wall which is enriched in U-235. The large amounts of energy required in maintaining the strong magnetic fields as well as the low recovery rates of the uranium feed material and slower more inconvenient facility operation make this an unlikely choice for large scale enrichment plants.

Work is being done in the use of molten uranium chloride-alkali chloride mixtures as reactor fuels in [[molten salt reactor]]s. Uranium tetrachloride melts dissolved in a [[lithium chloride]]-[[potassium chloride]] eutectic have also been explored as a means to recover [[actinides]] from irradiated [[nuclear fuel]]s through pyrochemical [[nuclear reprocessing]].&lt;ref&gt;Olander, D. R. and Camahort, J. L. (1966), Reaction of chlorine and uranium tetrachloride in the fused lithium chloride-potassium chloride eutectic. AIChE Journal, 12: 693–699. {{doi|10.1002/aic.690120414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other meanings|Uranus (disambiguation)}}

'''Uranous''' is the [[chemical]] term for the [[Redox|reduced]] tetrapositive [[cation]] of [[uranium]] that exhibits the valence U&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. It is one of the two common ionic states of uranium found in nature, the other being the [[Redox|oxidised]] hexapositive ion called [[uranyl]]. Uranous compounds are usually unstable; they revert to the oxidised form on exposure to air.

Examples of these compounds include [[uranium tetrachloride]] (UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[uranium tetrafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which are important in [[molten salt reactor]] applications, and [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a common form of [[nuclear fuel]].

The solvated U&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is normally not present in water. Most of the compounds like UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are better described with the [[covalent bond]] than an [[ionic bond]].

Minerals containing the uranous [[ion]] are more subdued in colour, typically brown or black, and occur in reducing environments. Common uranous minerals include: [[uraninite]]; [[pitchblende]] (a crystalline variant of uraninite); and [[coffinite]] ''(Smith,Hutchinson and Blackwell, 1984)''

The '''Waag''' (''Waegh'') is a former [[Weigh house]] in [[Haarlem]] that today serves as a café catering to tourists.

==History==
The building was designed by [[Lieven de Key]] around 1597 and is built with ''Namense steen'' from [[Namur, Belgium]]. It is the only building in Haarlem that was built this way, and was designed in its day as a landmark that befits an authority. The weigh house masters needed to be able to judge the correct measure of a shipload of grain that was delivered in Haarlem. Inside the large cast iron balance can still be seen. The location of the weigh house was strategically located where the [[Spaarne]] river joins the ''beek'', a small canal that according to tradition was used to carry fresh water from the dunes to serve the brewers of Haarlem. Haarlem was known for its beer brewing in the 15th-17th centuries. A large wooden crane operated by wheels driven by manpower was used to hoist the grain on ships into the Waag building and back into other ships or carts for further transport. The wooden crane can be seen on most historic pictures of the Spaarne up until 1872.

In 1821 the top floor of the Waag was rented to the artist club [[Kunst zij ons doel]] for drawing classes gathered around a live model. The room is still used for this function, though fewer drawing classes are held nowadays and the rooms are often used for exhibitions. The entrance to the artist club is via the small staircase on the Spaarne side.

'''Woodfree uncoated paper''' ('''WFU''') or '''uncoated fine papers''' are manufactured using wood that has been processed into a [[Pulp (paper)|chemical pulp]] that removes the [[lignin]] from the wood fibers and may also contain 5–25% [[Filler (materials)|fillers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperonweb.com/grade11.htm The paper made without using mechanical pulp]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[softwood]] and [[hardwood]] chemical pulps are used and a minor part of [[Pulp (paper)#Mechanical pulp|mechanical pulp]] might be added (often of [[aspen]] or [[Populus|poplar]]). These paper grades are [[Calender|calendered]].

==Properties==
Woodfree uncoated papers are of high quality and have a natural look and feel. The properties are good strength, high [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Paper brightness|brightness]] and good archival characteristics.&lt;ref name=WFU&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 35–37 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide a non-glare surface suitable for reading and writing.

==Special types==
''Offset paper'' is a WFU paper with ISO brightness &gt; 80% and a basis weight of 40–300 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Surface strength and low linting are the main parameters, but brightness and opacity are also important.

''Lightweight offset paper'', also called [[onionskin]], has a basis weight of 25–40 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and are normally used for [[bible]]s (hence the name [[Bible paper]]) and [[Dictionary|dictionaries]].
