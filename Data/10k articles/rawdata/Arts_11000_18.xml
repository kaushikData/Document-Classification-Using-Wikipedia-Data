This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1649'''.

==Events==
*[[January 1]] – Local authorities raid the four remaining London theatres (the [[Salisbury Court Theatre|Salisbury Court]], [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]], [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]], and [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]]) to suppress clandestine play-acting. The actors found are arrested &amp;ndash; except for the Red Bull company, who manage to escape.
*[[February 9]] – ''[[Eikon Basilike]]: the Pourtrature of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings'', purporting to be the spiritual autobiography of King [[Charles I of England]], is published ten days after his execution, and becomes an enormous popular success. [[John Gauden]] later claims to have written it.
*[[March 24]] (Saturday) – The authorities damage the [[Cockpit Theatre]] to inhibit continued attempts to use it for plays. (The building is not destroyed, however, and in [[1660 in literature|1660]], when drama resumes in England with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], the theatre is fixed and used again.)
*[[April 23]] – [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]] a [[Diggers|Digger]] issues "The Declaration and Standard of the Levellers of England."
* October – [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Eikonoklastes]]: in Answer to a Book Intitl'd Eikon Basilike'', a defence of the execution of Charles I, is published.
*With the London theatres remaining closed since [[1642 in literature|1642]], the trend toward [[closet drama]] (often highly politicized) continues &amp;ndash; and is accentuated by the January 30 execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In the play ''Newmarket Fair'', [[Oliver Cromwell]] and other Parliamentary leaders commit suicide when they learn of the accession of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (an event that, in actuality, still lies eleven years in the future).
* [[Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant|Antoine Girard]]'s poem ''Rome Ridicule'' starts a fashion for burlesque poetry.
* Sir [[William Davenant]] is appointed treasurer of the colony of Virginia.

==Plot==
Raymond Ding, a middle-aged [[Chinese American]] college professor, and Aurora Crane, his younger ''[[Hapa]]'' (half-Asian) girlfriend, have just split, but continue to drift in and out of each other's lives. Unable to fully let go, Raymond visits the apartment they once shared, during the day while Aurora is away. Aurora is haunted by flashbacks of moments from their relationship.

Encouraged by their best friends to move on, Raymond and Aurora each begin new relationships.  Aurora dates Steve, a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] man closer to her age (and also her best friend's ex).  Raymond dates Betty, a [[Vietnamese American]] colleague, who he soon discovers is haunted by her own past. Race and identity issues begin to surface as Raymond and Aurora try to start new lives, but remain drawn to their past.

==Critical reception==
''Americanese'' was met with generally positive reviews. The film has a score of 67% with a certified "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 9 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/americanese/|title=Americanese|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed film critic [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and wrote of the film, saying "Byler deals with characters who have lived their years, learned from them, and try to apply their values to their lives. Their romances are not heedless but wary, and involve a lot of negotiation," and finished by calling the film "...uncommonly absorbing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Americanese|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/americanese-2006|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in his review stated that ''Americanese'' had "fine, understated performances and the self-assured way that Byler lets the film find its own rhythms, rather than setting into some template, result in a mature film of subtle complexity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crust|first=Kevin|title=A modern love story|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/11/news/wk-screen11|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation Memling.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Annunciation'', 76.5 × 54.6 cm (30 1/8 × 21 1/2 in.), [[Hans Memling]], c.&amp;nbsp;1480s, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]
The '''''Annunciation''''' is an oil-on-oak panel painting attributed to the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]]. Completed c.&amp;nbsp;1482, it was partially [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] in the 1920s and is today held in the [[Robert Lehman]] collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. The panel shows the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] in a domestic interior, two attendant angels, the archangel [[Gabriel]] dressed in ecclesiastical robes, and a hovering dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]]. It expands upon the Annunciation wing of [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s c.&amp;nbsp;1455 ''[[Saint Columba altarpiece]]''. According to the art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a "startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper".&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; 

The iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her [[Swoon of the Virgin|swoon]] foreshadows the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], and the panel emphasises her role as mother, bride and [[Queen of Heaven]]. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians suggested the number's final digit was a nine, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] described it as one of Memling's "finest and most original works".&lt;ref name = "Sterling81"&gt;Sterling (1998), 81&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902 it was exhibited in [[Bruges]] at the ''[[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges]]'', after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. [[Philip Lehman]] bought it in 1920 from the [[Radziwiłł]] family who may have had it in their family since the 16th century; [[Antoni Radziwiłł]] discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.

===Annunciation===

The Annunciation was a popular theme in late medieval European art,&lt;ref name = "Met2"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/437490 "The Annunciation"]. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved April 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary acts as [[Theotokos]], the God-bearer as affirmed in 431 at the [[Council of Ephesus]]; two decades later the [[Council of Chalcedon]] affirmed the doctrine of [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]&amp;nbsp;– that Christ was of two natures ([[Hypostatic union|God and Man]])&amp;nbsp;– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the [[Lateran Council]] of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia.&lt;ref name = "Blum52"&gt;Blum (1992), 52&lt;/ref&gt; In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.&lt;ref name = "Blum53"&gt;Blum (1992), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden 008.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Left panel of [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Saint Columba altarpiece]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1455, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich. Rays of light stream through the open window toward the Virgin]]

In [[Early Netherlandish art]] the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by [[Robert Campin]], and followed by [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber,&lt;ref name = "Blum52"/&gt; although the motif is found in van der Weyden's c.&amp;nbsp;1435 Louvre ''[[Annunciation Triptych (Rogier van der Weyden)|Annunciation]]'' and c.&amp;nbsp;1455 ''[[Saint Columba altarpiece]]'' in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments.&lt;ref name = "Blum43"/&gt;  Memling's depiction is nearly identical to van der Weyden's ''Columba Altarpiece''.&lt;ref name = "Snyder38"&gt;Snyder (1987), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures===
The archangel [[Gabriel]] appears before [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] to announce that she will bear the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name = "Howard353"&gt;Howard (2000), 353&lt;/ref&gt;  He is shown standing in a three-quarter view&lt;ref name = "Blum55" /&gt; wearing a small jeweled [[diadem]] and dressed in [[vestment]]s. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade [[cope]], edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white [[alb]] and [[amice]]. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin.&lt;ref name = "Blum49"&gt;Blum (1992), 49&lt;/ref&gt; He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and [[Queen of Heaven]],&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118" /&gt; and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.&lt;ref name = "Blum50"&gt;Blum (1992), 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virgin is in a frontal view;&lt;ref name = "Blum55" /&gt; directly behind her the red-curtained bed acts as a framing device, similar to the traditional canopy-of-honor or [[baldachin]].&lt;ref name = "Blum43"/&gt; Unlike Memling's predecessors whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple underdress peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status.&lt;ref name = "Blum53"&gt;Blum (1992), 53&lt;/ref&gt; Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to Blum the scene is rendered with a great sense of naturalism and successfully depicts "the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer."&lt;ref name = "Blum50"/&gt; 

[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Mary of the Annunciation - WGA07679.jpg|260px|thumb|[[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''Annunciation'', from the 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', has an inscription streaming towards the Virgin and the dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] hovers above.]]

The Virgin holds an innovative and unusual position. She seems to be either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes "one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels of the fifteenth century of a Virgin positioned as she is here".&lt;ref name = "Blum43"&gt;Blum (1992), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece]]'', where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'', in which [[Mary Magdalen]] bends and crouches&amp;nbsp;– similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his ''[[:File:Hans Memling - Lamentation - WGA14858.jpg|Lamentation]]''.&lt;ref name = "Jolly40ff"&gt;Jolly (2014), 40, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, "soliciting our response", according to Ainsworth.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"&gt;Ainsworth (1998), 118&lt;/ref&gt; Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood "comparable to that of Gabriel."&lt;ref name = "Blum54"&gt;Blum (1992), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.&lt;ref name = "Blum52"/&gt;

===Objects===
The dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] hovers inside a rainbow-hued circle of light directly above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'s''  Annunciation panel.&lt;ref name = "Blum49"&gt;Blum (1992), 49&lt;/ref&gt; Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems in keeping with the domestic interior.&lt;ref name = "Blum52"&gt;Blum (1992), 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary's left hand rests on an open prayer-book, which she has propped open on a ''[[prie-dieu]]'', with the letter "D" visible&amp;nbsp;– perhaps for ''Deus tecum'' ("the Lord be with you"), according to Ainsworth.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118" /&gt; Blum speculates the passage is from Isaiah 7:14, "Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son."&lt;ref name = "Blum50"/&gt; A vase containing white [[Lilium candidum|lilie]]s and a single blue [[Iris (plant)|iris]] is next to it on the floor.&lt;ref name = "Blum48"&gt;Blum (1992), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A curtain sack, commonly found on beds of the period, hangs in the central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel.&lt;ref name = "Blum44"&gt;Blum (1992), 44&lt;/ref&gt;  A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from the window to the left.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118" /&gt; The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's ''Columba altarpiece''; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the end of the bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting "like an open stage for the holy figures".&lt;ref name = "Blum55"&gt;Blum (1992), 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The iconography is not overly labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism.&lt;ref name = "Blum50"/&gt;  Many elements emphasize Mary's role as the Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on the sideboard are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her.&lt;ref name = "Howard353"&gt;Howard (2000), 353&lt;/ref&gt; White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or [[Gladiolus|sword lilies]] were used as metaphors for her suffering.&lt;ref name = "Blum48"/&gt; Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, and "introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning."&lt;ref name = "Blum50"/&gt; [[Charles Sterling]] describes the work as "one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with a heightened sense of emotion and narrative complexity."&lt;ref name = "Sterling80"/&gt;

===Light===
[[File:Annunciation Memling - detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail showing the light shining on the sideboard, a flask of clear water, a ropewick light, a candlestick, and a curtain-sack]]
From the 9th century Light became associated with Mary and the Incarnation. [[Millard Meiss]] notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass to the passage of the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin.&lt;ref name = "Meiss177"&gt;Meiss (1945), 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb."&lt;ref name = "Meiss176"&gt;Meiss (1945), 176&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three objects on the bedside cabinet represent the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light.  The light passing through the glass of the womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light,&lt;ref name = "Blum46"/&gt; its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception,&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; a device found also in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity.&lt;ref name = "Meiss175" /&gt; The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".&lt;ref name = "Blum46"/&gt;

[[File:Bouts, Dieric - The Annunciation - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dieric Bouts]]' ''Annunciation'', c.&amp;nbsp;1450s, [[Getty Center]], Los Angeles, omits rays of light.]]

Light represented by candles was then often used to symbolise the Virgin and Christ; both Campin and van Eyck placed hearths or candles in their annunciation scenes.&lt;ref name = "Meiss175"&gt;Meiss (1945), 175&lt;/ref&gt;  The candleholder without a candle and the ropewick without flame symbolize the world before Christ's [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the presence of his divine light, according to Ainsworth.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt;

The challenge for painters of the Annunciation was how to visually represent the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]''.&lt;ref name = "Koslow10"&gt;Koslow (1989), 10&lt;/ref&gt; They often showed rays of light emanating from Gabriel or a nearby window entering Mary's body to depict the concept of Christ "who inhabited and passed through her body". The light rays might sometimes include an inscription,&lt;ref name = "Blum46"&gt;Blum (1992), 46&lt;/ref&gt;  and were sometimes shown entering her ear, in the belief that it was thus the Word became flesh.&lt;ref name = "Meiss178" /&gt; 

Memling did not depict the light as distinct rays, nor had [[Dieric Bouts]]'s Getty ''Annunciation''. Yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a ''fenestra incarnationis'', which would have been an adequate symbol for the contemporary viewer.&lt;ref name = "Blum47"&gt;Blum (1992), 47&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light.&lt;ref name = "Meiss178"&gt;Meiss (1945), 178&lt;/ref&gt; Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, is a most "decorous sign of Mary's chastity", according to Blum.&lt;ref name = "Blum47"&gt;Blum (1992), 47&lt;/ref&gt; There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.&lt;ref name = "Sterling83"&gt;Sterling (1998), 83&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===Mother of Christ===
[[File:Boucicaut hours visitation (2).jpg|left|260px|thumb|The [[Boucicaut Master]]'s "Visitation" (c.&amp;nbsp;1405) is a rare example of Mary with attendant angels who touch her garments]]
The Virgin birth is indicated by the red bed and red womb-shaped curtain-sack. During the early-15th century hanging beds or curtain-sacks became symbols of the Incarnation, and "served to affirm [Christ's] humanity". Blum notes that at a time "when artists did not hesitate to depict the breast of the Virgin, Memling did not shun her womb".&lt;ref name = "Blum44"/&gt; Christ's humanity was a source of fascination, and it was only in Netherlandish art that a solution was found for visualizing his embryonic state with curtain-sacks draped to suggest the shape of a womb.&lt;ref name = "Koslow11ff"&gt;Koslow (1989), 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mary's body becomes the tabernacle holding the [[Sacramental bread|Host]] made flesh.&lt;ref name = "Blum49"&gt;Blum (1992), 49&lt;/ref&gt; She becomes an object of devotion, a "monstrance containing the Host".&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; Her full belly and the presence of the dove indicate the moment of Incarnation has occurred. Viewers would have been reminded of the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] with the [[Swoon of the Virgin|swoon]], "thus anticipating Christ's sacrifice for the salvation of mankind at the moment of his conception."&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; According to theologians, Mary stood with dignity at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], but in 15th-century art she is depicted swooning, according to Jolly, "in agony at the sight of her dying son&amp;nbsp;… assuming the pose of a mother in the throes of the pain of childbirth". At the cross she felt the pain of his death; pain which at his birth she had not experienced.&lt;ref name = "Jolly40ff"/&gt;

[[File:Stefan Lochner The Virgin Crowned by Angels, c. 1450.jpg|240px|thumb|[[Stefan Lochner]], ''The Virgin Crowned by Angels'', c.&amp;nbsp;1450, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], depicts the Virgin as [[Queen of Heaven]] with two barely visible attendant angels hovering above her crown.]]

The painting's domestic setting belies its liturgical meaning. The dove is a reminder of the [[Eucharist]] and Mass. [[Lotte Brand Philip]] observes how throughout the 15th century "eucharistic vessels made in the form of doves and suspended over altars&amp;nbsp;… were lowered at the moment of transubstantiation"; here it suggests that in the same way the Holy Spirit gives life to the bread and wine, it gave life to the Virgin's womb.&lt;ref name = "Blum49"/&gt;  She carries the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]], and is attended by three priestly angels.&lt;ref name = "Blum49"/&gt;  Mary's function is to bear "the Savior of the World"; the angels' role is to "support, present and protect her sacred being".&lt;ref name = "Blum53"/&gt; With the birth of Christ her "miraculous womb passed its final test" to become an object of veneration.&lt;ref name = "Blum52" /&gt;

===Bride of Christ===
Memling presents the Virgin as the Bride of Christ about to assume her role as Queen of Heaven, with attendant angels indicating her royal status.&lt;ref name = "Sterling83" /&gt; These kind of angels are usually shown hovering above the Virgin, holding her crown, and some German painters showed them hovering close in Annunciation scenes, but angels rarely approach or touch the Virgin.&lt;ref name = "Sterling82"&gt;Sterling (1998), 82&lt;/ref&gt; Only a single previous version of such attendant angels has been found: in the [[Boucicaut Master]]'s early 15th-century illuminated manuscript version of the "Visitation", the pregnant Virgin's long mantle is held by attendant angels, about which Blum notes that "her queenly appearance surely commemorates the moment when Mary is first addressed as Theotokos, the Mother of the Lord."&lt;ref name = "Blum53"/&gt; Memling often depicted pairs of angels dressed in vestments attending the Virgin, but these two, dressed in simple amices and albs, were never repeated in his art. Their dual function is to "present the eucharistic offering and proclaim the Virgin bride and queen".&lt;ref name = "Blum53"&gt;Blum (1992), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
[[File:Clugny Annunciation.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Clugny Annunciation'' c. 1465–75, Workshop of [[Rogier van der Weyden]] or by [[Hans Memling]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]

The ''Annunciation'' draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre ''Annunciation'', his c.&amp;nbsp;1455  ''Saint Columba altarpiece'', and the ''Clugny Annunciation'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in [[Brussels]] until setting up his own workshop in [[Bruges]] sometime after 1465.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87"&gt;Borchert (2008), 87&lt;/ref&gt; Memling's ''Annunciation'' is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; According to [[Till-Holger Borchert]], not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87"/&gt; The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the ''Columba'' triptych's "Annunciation".&lt;ref name = "Blum43"/&gt; 

A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's "serpentine" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow.&lt;ref name = "Sterling80"&gt;Sterling (1998), 80&lt;/ref&gt; Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in "icy" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems "bleached by light", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, "this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber."&lt;ref name = "Blum55"&gt;Blum (1992), 55&lt;/ref&gt; The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a "startling" juxtaposition, an effect that is "unsteadying" and contradictory.&lt;ref name = "Blum56"&gt;Blum (1992), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Annunciation - WGA25591.jpg|300px|thumb|Center panel, ''[[Annunciation Triptych (Rogier van der Weyden)|Annunciation Triptych ]]'', Rogier van der Weyden, c.&amp;nbsp;1430s, [[Louvre]], Paris]]

Scholars have not established if the panel was meant to be a single devotional work, or part of a larger, and now broken up, [[polyptych]]. According to Ainsworth, its size and "the sacramental nature of its subject would have been appropriate for a family chapel in a church or monastery for the chapel of a guild corporation."&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; An intact, inscribed frame is unusual for a wing panel, indicating that it was probably intended as a single piece,&lt;ref name = "Sterling81"/&gt; but scholars are unsure because the slight left-to-right axis of the tiles tend to suggest it could have been the left-hand wing of a larger piece.&lt;ref name = "Sterling80"/&gt; There is no information about the panel's reverse, which has not survived.&lt;ref name = "Sterling81"/&gt;

Technical analysis shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed in a [[Charcoal (art)|dry medium]] except for the dove and the flask and candles on the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.&lt;ref name = "Sterling78"&gt;Sterling (1998), 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The only person to question  [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]]'s 1847 attribution to Memling is [[William Henry James Weale|W. H. J. Weale]], who in 1903 declared Memling "would never have dreamt of introducing into the representation of this mystery these two sentimental and affected angels."&lt;ref&gt;Weale (1903), 35&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Provenance and condition==

The painting's known provenance begins in the 1830s when it was in the possession of the [[Radziwiłł]] family.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; According to art historian [[Sulpiz Boisserée]], who saw the painting in 1832, [[Antoni Radziwiłł]] found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to [[Mikołaj Krzysztof "the Orphan" Radziwiłł|Mikolai Radziwill]] (1549–1616) who might have inherited it from his brother [[Jerzy Radziwiłł (1556–1600)|Jerzy Radziwill]], (1556–1600), who was a cardinal.&lt;ref name = "Sterling84"&gt;Sterling (1998), 84&lt;/ref&gt; The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the [[Duveen Brothers]] in Paris.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt; [[Philip Lehman]] bought it in October 1920; it is now held in the [[Robert Lehman]] collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt;

Generally the condition is good. Memling painted the work on two panels of about 28&amp;nbsp;cm each. The dated and inscribed frame, probably the original, was discarded in 1830.&lt;ref name = "Sterling78"/&gt; There have been three documented restorations. The painting had been pierced by an arrow when Anton Radziwill found it; he had it restored and the damage repaired. At that time the Virgin's mantle and the flesh tones sustained heavy overpainting. The original frame was discarded, but its inscription was inserted into the new frame.&lt;ref name = "Sterling83"&gt;Sterling (1998), 83&lt;/ref&gt; A description of the original frame suggests it carried a coat-of-arms, perhaps belonging to Jerzy Radziwill.&lt;ref name = "Sterling84"/&gt; The second restoration was after its [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|exhibition in Bruges]] in 1902; and the third when Lehman had it restored and [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] sometime after 1928. The painting survived the transfer without significant damage.  A late-19th century photograph shows wood on all four sides of the painted surface, which suggests the edges may have been extended during the transfer. Areas that suffered paint loss and overpainting are Gabriel's cope and the vase holding the flowers.&lt;ref name = "Sterling78"&gt;Sterling (1998), 78&lt;/ref&gt;

When Boisserée saw the painting he recorded the inscription's date as 1480. The last digit of the inscription was faded and difficult to read and had become illegible by 1899.  Waagen suggested the date could have been 1482, and art historian Dirk de Vos suggested 1489.&lt;ref name = "Sterling81"/&gt;
Memling's style does not lend itself well to assigning dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date is easily accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'',&lt;ref name = "Sterling81"/&gt; whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more in keeping with the mature style of the late 1480s.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth118"/&gt;

'''Dhundiraj Govind Phalke''', popularly known as '''Dadasaheb Phalke''' ({{audio|Ma-Dadasaheb Phalke.ogg|pronunciation}}) (30 April 1870&amp;nbsp;– 16 February 1944), was an Indian producer-director-screenwriter, known as ''the Father of [[Indian cinema]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vilanilam|first=J. V.|title=Mass Communication in India: A Sociological Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7829-515-6|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBU6pN7toHsC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=dadasaheb+phalke+father+indian+cinema#v=onepage&amp;q=dadasaheb%20phalke%20father%20indian%20cinema&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut film, [[Raja Harishchandra]], which was the first [[Marathi cinema]], was the first Indian movie in 1913, and is now known as India's first full-length feature. He made 95 feature-length films and 27 short films in his career, spanning 19 years, until 1937, including his most noted works: ''Mohini Bhasmasur'' (1913), ''Satyavan Savitri'' (1914), ''Lanka Dahan'' (1917), ''Shri Krishna Janma'' (1918) and ''Kaliya Mardan'' (1919).
The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]], for lifetime contribution to cinema, was instituted in his honour by the [[Government of India]] in 1969. The award is one of the most prestigious awards in [[Indian cinema]] and is the highest official recognition for film personalities in our country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/pran-chosen-for-dada-saheb-phalke-award/article4610293.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Pran chosen for Dada Saheb Phalke award | date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A postage stamp bearing his likeness was released by [[India Post]] to honour him in 1971. An honorary award from the ''Dadasaheb Phalke Academy Mumbai'' was introduced in the year 2001, for lifetime achievement in Indian cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Dadasaheb-Phalke-Academy-Award-for-Yash-Chopra-Rajesh-Khanna/articleshow/19738934.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Dadasaheb Phalke Academy Award for Yash Chopra, Rajesh Khanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===1870–1892: Early life and education===
Dhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at [[Trimbak]], [[Maharashtra]] (then [[Bombay Presidency]]) into a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking [[Chitpavan]] [[Brahmin]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/google-doodle-marks-dadasaheb-phalke-birth-anniversary-amitabh-bachchan-pays-homage/story-ZNhVILAzrnJD5PmuBjKbbJ.html|title=Google doodle marks Dadasaheb Phalke birth anniversary, Amitabh Bachchan pays homage|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=30 April 2018|accessdate=11 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502083645/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/google-doodle-marks-dadasaheb-phalke-birth-anniversary-amitabh-bachchan-pays-homage/story-ZNhVILAzrnJD5PmuBjKbbJ.html|archivedate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Kajri|title=Gods in the Bazaar: The Economies of Indian Calendar Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl8No2_PJ8AC&amp;pg=PA151|date=16 March 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8973-8|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Govind Sadashiv alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit scholar and worked as a priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a housewife. The couple had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Shivrampant, the eldest, was twelve years elder than Phalke and worked in [[Baroda]]. He briefly worked as the ''[[Dewan#In India|Dewan]]'' (Chief Administrator) of the [[princely state]] of [[Jawhar State|Jawhar]] and died in 1921, at the age of 63. Phalke's second brother, Raghunathrao, also worked as priest and died at a young age of 21. Dajishastri taught Phalke to conduct religious rituals like [[yajna]] and dispensing of medicines. When he was appointed as a professor of Sanskrit in the [[Wilson College, Mumbai]], the family shifted its base to Mumbai (then Bombay). Phalke completed his primary education in Trimbakeshwar and [[Matriculation#India|matriculation]] was done in Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=13}}

Phalke joined the [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], Mumbai in 1885 and completed a one-year course in drawing.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=14}} At the beginning of 1886, he accompanied his elder brother, Shivrampant, to Baroda where he got married to a girl from [[Marathe]] family. Later, he joined Faculty of Fine Arts at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]] and completed a course in [[Oil painting]] and [[Watercolor painting]] in 1890. He also achieved proficiency in architecture and [[Physical model|modelling]]. In the same year, Phalke bought a film camera and started experimenting with photography, [[Photographic processing|processing]], and [[Photographic printing|printing]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=15}}&lt;ref name="TribuneGM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000430/spectrum/main2.htm|title=Great Minds: Dadasaheb Phalke (1870–1944)|newspaper=Tribune (India)|date=30 April 2000|accessdate=17 November 2012|first=Kuldip|last=Dhiman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816191830/tribuneindia.com/2000/20000430/spectrum/main2.htm|archivedate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a gold medal for creating a model of an ideal theatre at the 1892 Industrial Exhibition of Ahmedabad. While his work was much appreciated, one of his fans presented him a "costly" camera, used for [[still photography]]. In 1891, Phalke did a six-months course to learn the techniques of preparing [[Halftone|half-tone blocks]], [[Photolithography|photo-lithio]], and three-colour ceramic photography.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=16}} Principal Gajjar of Kala Bhavan sent Phalke to [[Ratlam]] to learn three-colour blockmaking, photolitho transfers, colotype and [[darkroom]] printing techniques under the guidance of Babulal Varuvalkar.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=109}}

===1893–1910: Early career===
In 1893, Gajjar allowed Phalke to use the photo studio and laboratory of Kala Bhavan where he started his work under the name of "Shri Phalke's Engraving and Photo Printing". Despite his proficiency in various skills, he did not have a stable family life and had difficulties in making a living. Thus, in 1895, he decided to become a professional [[photographer]] and relocated to [[Godhra]] for doing business. His business did not do well in Godhra and he lost his wife and a child in the 1900 plague epidemic in the city.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sachin|last=Sharma|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-28/vadodara/32456429_1_godhra-dadasaheb-phalke-father-of-indian-cinema|title=Godhra forgets its days spent with Dadasaheb Phalke|newspaper=the Times of India|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|location=Vadodara|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714184940/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/Godhra-forgets-its-days-spent-with-Dadasaheb-Phalke/articleshow/14444404.cms?referral=PM|archivedate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phalke returned to Baroda and started photography business. It did not run well because of the myth spread across the city that the camera sucks up the energy from a person's body which leads to their death.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=17}} He faced similar resistance from the Prince of Baroda who refused to take photographs with the assumptions that it would shorten his life. Though, the Prince was later convinced by Phalke who went on to advocate the benefits of photography in his court, it did not help Phalke's business.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=110}} He started the business of painting the stage curtains for the drama companies. This got him some basic training in drama production and fetched him a few minor roles in the plays.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=17}}

Phalke learned magic tricks from a German magician who was on a tour in Baroda that time. This helped him use trick photography in his filmmaking. At the end of 1901, Phalke began to hold the public performances of magic using professional name of Professor Kelpha with letters of his last name in reverse order.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=109}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=18}} In 1902, Phalke remarried to Saraswati Karandikar, niece of proprietor of [[Annasaheb Kirloskar#Marathi theater companies|Kirloskar Natak Mandali]]. In 1903, he got a job as a photographer and draftsman at the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. However, not satisfied with the job, Phalke resigned in 1906 and set up a printing press at [[Lonavla]] under the name of "Phalke Engraving and Printing Works" with [[R. G. Bhandarkar]] as a partner.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=110}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=19}}

The press majorly worked for making photo-litho transfers for [[Raja Ravi Varma#Raja Ravi Varma Press|Ravi Verma Press]], owned by painter Raja Ravi Varma. Later, it also started the work of halftone blockmaking and printing and tri-colour printing. With the growing business, the press was shifted to Dadar, Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}} Later in 1908,{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=23}} Purushottam Mavji replaced Bhandarkar as a partner and the press was renamed as "Laxmi Art Printing Works". Phalke went to Germany in 1909 to buy the necessary colour printing machinery.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}}{{efn|name=purification|According to the prevalent society mores,&lt;ref name="Mukherjee2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sumita|last=Mukherjee|title=Nationalism, Education and Migrant Identities: The England-returned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmePAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44|date=16 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-27112-1|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phalke had to undergo a purification ceremony, having returned from a foreign country.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=33}}}} Though the printing business grew exponentially, the partners had increasing differences about the running of the press. Soon, Phalke decided to abandon the partnership, without availing any monetary benefits.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=21}}

After quitting "Laxmi Art Printing Works", Phalke received multiple offers from various financiers to start another printing press but he did not accept any offers.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=21}} On 14 April 1911, Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, ''Amazing Animals'', at the America India Picture Palace,{{sfn|Kosambi|2017|p=320}} [[Girgaon]], Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}} Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience earlier that day. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his family to see the film the next day. As it was [[Easter]], the theatre screened a film about Jesus, ''The Life of Christ'' (1906) by the French director [[Alice Guy-Blaché]] instead.&lt;ref name="Dharap"&gt;{{cite book|first=B. V.|last=Dharap|title=Indian films|year=1985|publisher=National Film Archive of India|pp=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}} While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] instead and decided to start in the business of "moving pictures".{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}}

For the next one year, Phalke started collecting various film related material like catalogues, books, and movie making equipment from Europe. He bought a small film camera and reels and started showing movies at night, by focusing candle light on a lens and projecting the pictures on the wall. He watched movies every evening for four to five hours and was deprived of sleep. This put strain on his eyes and he developed [[cataract]] in both eyes. He continued working against the advice of taking rest and lost his sight completely. [[Ophthalmology|Ophthalmologist]] Dr. Prabhakar treated Phalke with the aid of three or four pairs of spectacles which helped him restore the eye sight.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=29}} Phalke wished to go to London to get technical knowledge of filmmaking but had difficulties getting finances for his trip. With the help of Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Abasaheb Chitnis, he secured a sum of ten thousands by mortgaging his insurance policies worth twelve thousands. On 1 February 1912, he boarded a ship for London.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=30–31}}{{efn|name=purification}}

At London, Phalke saw a nameboard of "Bioscope Cine-Weekly" near [[Piccadilly Circus]]. He was a subscriber of the weekly in India. He met its editor, Mr. Kepburn, and explained the purpose of his visit. Kepburn advised Phalke against the idea of filmmaking in India based on the unsuccessful attempts in England and suggested that the Indian climate might not be suitable as well. However, he was impressed with Phalke's dedication and introduced him to the film director, producer, and screenwriter [[Cecil Hepworth]] of [[Walton Studios]]. Hepworth allowed Phalke to visit all the departments of the studio and their workings along with the demonstration of filming. At the advice of Kepburn and Hepworth, he bought Williamson camera for fifty pounds and placed an order for [[Kodak]] raw film and a perforator. Phalke stayed in London for two weeks and returned to India on 1 April 1912. He founded "Phalke Films" on the same day.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=32–33}}&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|first1=K.

====Film debut with ''Raja Harishchandra''====

After coming back from London, Phalke started looking for a spacious place for shooting the films. Soon, the family shifted from Ismail Building, [[Charni Road]] to Mathura Bhavan Bungalow, [[Dadar]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=34}} He constructed a small glass room at the compound of the bungalow and prepared a dark room and arrangements for processing the film. Imported filmmaking equipment reached Mumbai in May 1912 and Phalke set it up within four days with the help of sketch provided. He also taught his family to perforate and develop the film. To test the working of camera and projector, Phalke filmed the boys and girls in the surroundings to the satisfactory results.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=35}}&lt;ref name="dhanurdhari1946"&gt;{{cite news|title=मुलाखत: सरस्वतीबाई धुंडिराज फाळके|trans-title=Interview: Saraswatibai Dhundiraj Phalke|language=Marathi|newspaper=Dhanurdhari|date=16 February 1946|location=Nashik}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the filmmaking techniques and get financier for the feature film, Phalke decided to make a short film. He planted some peas in a pot and placed a camera in front of it. He shot one frame a day for over a month producing a film just over one minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. The short film titled ''Ankurachi Wadh'' (''Growth of a Pea Plant'') and was showed selective individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kesari1913"&gt;{{cite news|title=मुलाखत: धुंडिराज गोविंद फाळके|trans-title=Interview: Dhundiraj Govind Phalke|language=Marathi|newspaper=Kesari|date=19 August 1913|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phalke decided to make a film based on the legends of [[Harishchandra]] and wrote the script for it.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=36}} He published advertisements in various newspapers like ''[[Induprakash]]'' calling for the cast and crew required for the film.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=37}} As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/15jha.htm|title=10 pre-release big ones|author=Jha, Subhash K.|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=8 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620044728/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/15jha.htm|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. D. Dabke|Dattatraya Damodar Dabke]] played the lead role of King [[Harishchandra]] and [[Anna Salunke]] as Queen Taramati. Phalke's elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role, Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=38–39}} He was in-charge of the [[scriptment]], [[Film director|direction]], [[Production designer|production design]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Film editing|editing]], and [[Photographic processing|film processing]] and [[Trymbak B. Telang]] handled the camera.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=41}} The filming was completed in six months and 27 days producing a film of 3,700 feet, about four [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reels]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=43}}

The film [[premiere]]d at the Olympia Theatre, Mumbai on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on Saturday, 3 May 1913 at the [[Coronation Cinema]], [[Girgaon]], Mumbai. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the [[Cinema of India|film industry in the country]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=46}}{{sfn|Gulzar|Nihalani|Chatterjee|2003|p=29}} The film is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film with its status debated with historians considering [[Dadasaheb Torne]]'s silent film ''[[Shree Pundalik]]'', released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Melissa U.

;Hindustan films
Phalke formed a film company, Hindustan Films in partnership with five businessmen from [[Mumbai]], in the hope that by having the financial aspect of his profession handled by experts in the field, he would be free to pursue the creative aspect. He set up a model studio and trained technicians and actors but, very soon, he ran into insurmountable problems with his partners. In 1920, Phalke resigned from Hindustan Films, made his first announcement of retirement from cinema, and he wrote ''Rangbhoomi'', an acclaimed play. Without him in charge, Hindustan Films ran into deep financial losses, and he was finally persuaded to return. However, Phalke felt constrained by the business and, after directing a few films for the company, he withdrew from it.

;Sound film
The times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent film ''Setubandhan'' was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936–1938, he produced his last film ''Gangavataran'' (1937) which was the only talking movie directed by Phalke, before retiring to [[Nashik]], where he died on 16 February 1944.

The '''Dunvegan Cup''' is a wooden ceremonial cup, decorated with silver plates, which dates to 1493. It was created at the request of Caitríona, wife of John Maguire, [[Maguire of Fermanagh|lord of Fermanagh]].&lt;ref name="R1-573574"&gt;[[#R1|Rigby 2003]]: p. 573–574.&lt;/ref&gt; The cup is an [[heirloom]] of the [[Clan MacLeod|Macleods]] of Dunvegan, and is held at their [[Family seat|seat]] of [[Dunvegan Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Skye, Dunvegan Castle|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/10835/details/skye+dunvegan+castle/|work=[[CANMORE]]|accessdate=10 August 2009}} The text cited is from ''Western Seaboard: An Illustrated Architectural Guide'', by Mary Miers, published in 2008 by the Rutland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several traditions attributed to the cup, describing how the Macleods obtained it. However, it is thought more likely that the cup passed into the possession of the clan sometime in the 16th or 17th centuries. The Macleod chiefs have several other notable heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle—such as the [[Fairy Flag]] and [[Sir Rory Mor's Horn]] (''all three pictured right'').

==Description==
[[File:Dunvegan Cup (engraving, sometime before 1851).jpg|thumb|180px|right|A 19th century [[engraving]] of the Dunvegan Cup.]]
The Dunvegan Cup is a wooden ceremonial cup, made of wood and elaborately decorated with silver.&lt;ref name="R1-573574"/&gt; It is square shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom, and stands on four legs.&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt; Sir [[Walter Scott]] examined the cup and, in 1815 in ''[[The Lord of the Isles]]'', gave its measurements as: {{convert|10.5|in|cm}} in height on the outside, {{convert|9.75|in|cm}} in depth in the inside, {{convert|4.5|in|cm}} the extreme breadth over the mouth.&lt;ref name="S1-308311"/&gt; In around the 1850s, Alexander Nesbitt gave similar measurements, and added that it was {{convert|5.5|in|cm}} at the broadest point of the cup, which is somewhat below the middle.&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt;

The cup is constructed mostly of wood. Scott thought it was possibly [[oak]],&lt;ref name="S1-308311"/&gt; and later Nesbitt considered it to be either [[Taxus|yew]] or [[alder]].&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt; The cup is covered with mountings of silver, wrought in [[filigree]] and decorated with [[niello]] and [[gilding]].&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;[[#F1|Finlay 1999]]: p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The mouth of the cup has a rim of solid [[silver-gilt]], {{convert|2|in|cm}} in depth. On the outside of the rim is an engraved inscription in black lettering in two lines. The spaces between the letters are [[Hatching|hatched]] with fine lines, which intersect diagonally. The angels of the rim have strips ornamented with [[niello]]. The inside of the rim is plain by comparison; except for the letter ''I.H.S.'' repeated on all four sides.&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt; Each side of the cup has its own designs of triangles and circles. R.C. MacLeod considered these to be representations of the [[Trinity]] and [[Eternity]].&lt;ref name="M1-4243"/&gt; Ian Finlay described the circled, six-pointed stars as not unlike those on the outer-side of the [[Domnach Airgid]], which is held in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="F1"/&gt; Empty sockets on the outside of the cup are thought to have once held stones, or glass. Several somewhat smaller sockets hold beads of [[coral]]. The silver legs are in the form of human legs; and are ornamented with a twisted wire which runs down the front. The feet have shoes, which are covered in niello, the legs being gilt.&lt;ref name="U1-7982"/&gt; Everywhere except the rim, the silver is very thin, and in consequence has suffered a great deal of damage over the years. The cup has been classified as a ''[[mether]]'', a communal drinking cup used at ceremonial events, as it is square-shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom.

==History==

===Earliest references to the cup===
According to F.T. MacLeod, the first published accounts of the cup were made by Sir [[Walter Scott]], and [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Sir Daniel Wilson]] in the early 19th centuries. F.T. MacLeod noted that it is singular that three earlier visitors to Dunvegan Castle—[[Samuel Johnson]], [[James Boswell]], and [[Thomas Pennant]]—made no mention of having seen the cup. Scott mentioned the cup within the explanatory note on the following lines, in ''The Lord of the Isles''.&lt;ref name="M2-102109"/&gt;
{{cquote|
"Fill me the mighty cup!" he said,&lt;br&gt;
"Erst own'd by the royal [[Somerled]]:&lt;br&gt;
Fill it, till on the studded brim&lt;br&gt;
In burning gold and bubbles swim,&lt;br&gt;
And every gem of varried shine&lt;br&gt;
Glow doubly bright in rosy wine!&lt;ref&gt;[[#S1|Scott 1857]]: p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;|30px||Sir [[Walter Scott]]|''The Lord of the Isles''}}

&lt;/center&gt;

Scott attempted to transcribe the Latin inscription on the silver rim of the cup. His early attempt at transcribing the inscription differs significantly from later attempts by others. Scott's transcription and translation is as follows.

|}

Scott's rendering of the cup's inscription made him believe that it was a [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] drinking cup, dating from the year 993. Scott also declared that Macleod tradition had it that the cup had once belonged to "Neil Ghlune-Dhu, or Black-knee. But who this Neil was, no one pretends to say".&lt;ref name="S1-308311"/&gt; In about 1851, [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Sir Daniel Wilson]] documented the cup in his ''The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland'', following along the same lines as Scott. Wilson made only a few minor edits to Scott's rendering of the Latin inscription, but at the time he had not seen the cup.&lt;ref&gt;[[#W1|Wilson 1851]]: pp. 669–671.&lt;/ref&gt; After certain correspondence and the aid of [[William Forbes Skene]], Wilson was able to examine the cup in person and later amended his analysis.&lt;ref name="W2-89"/&gt; His subsequent rendering of the inscription was vastly different from Scott's, and Wilson concluded that the cup was a product of Irish craftsmanship, rather than of Scottish origin. Wilson's new rendering of the inscription had the cup belonging to a "Katharina nig Ryneill"; and he considered that the John, son of the Maguire, who was mentioned in the transcription, was the same as the one mentioned in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] in the year 1484. Wilson stated that this John died in 1511, and that his wife was unknown; but that a Catherine, who was the daughter of MacRannal, was married to a Maguire, and her death is mentioned in the year 1490.&lt;ref name="W2-89"&gt;[[#W2|Wilson 1851–54]]: pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, [[Eugene O'Curry]], of the Brehon Law Commission, examined the cup and transcribed the inscription. Alexander Nesbitt noted O'Curry's transcription and pointed out that the last part of the inscription was from the fifteenth verse of the 145th [[Psalm]]. O'Curry's rendering of the woman's name was "Katherina ingen ui Neill"—making her an O'Neill, rather than a MacRannal. Nesbitt noted that John Maguire is recorded several times in the Annals of the Four Masters; and that he became one of the chiefs of the Maguires in 1484. Nesbitt stated that John Maguire died in 1503; and that he could not find the Katharine O'Neill, within the annals.&lt;ref name="U1-7982"&gt;[[#U1|''The Archaeological Journal'']]: p. 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Later, Roderick Charles MacLeod transcribed the inscription; giving the woman's name as "Katharina Nig Ry Neil"—Katharina, daughter of King Neil. R.C. MacLeod declared that Macleod legend assigned the cup to [[Niall Glúndub]], and that the cup might have passed down to her from him, or that the cup was attributed to him by his descendants.&lt;ref name="M2-102109"/&gt; R.C. MacLeod later claimed that it was traditionally given that the wooden bowl dated from the 10th century, and that it was the property of Niall Glúndub, the 10th century Irish king of [[Cenél nEógain]],&lt;ref name="M1-4243"/&gt; R.C. MacLeod does not rule out the possibility of the ornamentation having been added to the cup at a later date; the silver work dates, at the earliest, from the 14th century and the dated inscription puts it at 1493.

{| class="wikitable" width=100%

In about 1913, Fred T. MacLeod stated that he could find no reference to the cup in the Dunvegan records. He continued, that Macleod tradition was that it came into the possession of the Macleods through the fairies, of which there are one or two legends.&lt;ref name="M2-102109"/&gt;

F.T. MacLeod stated that it is impossible to determine exactly when the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods of Dunvegan. However, he thought it likely that the cup entered into the possession of the clan in the 16th or 17th centuries. During this era several Macleod chiefs took part in warring in Ireland. He considered it likely that the cup may have been a prize of war, or a gift for services.&lt;ref name="M2-102109"&gt;[[#M2|MacLeod, F.T. 1912–1913]]: p. 102–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, R.C. MacLeod stated that a Lady O'Neill claimed in 1925 letter, that an O'Neill tradition told how the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods. The tradition runs that one of their chiefs was a close friend of a Macleod chief. When this O'Neill chief visited his friend at Dunvegan he took with him the cup and gave it to Macleod as a present.&lt;ref name="M1-4243"/&gt;

Historically, during the 1590s, a Macleod chief lent support to certain Irish forces rebelling against those supporting [[Elizabeth I]] in Ireland. In the summer of 1594, Dòmhnall Gorm Mòr MacDhòmhnaill (chief of the [[Clan Macdonald of Sleat|Macdonalds of Sleat]]) and [[Sir Roderick Macleod of Macleod, 15th Chief|Ruairidh Mòr MacLeòid]] (chief of the [[Clan MacLeod|Macleods of Harris and Dunvegan]]) both sailed for [[Ulster]] at the head of 500 men each. Their force was intended to support [[Hugh Roe Ó Donnell|Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill]] who was [[Siege|besieging]] [[Enniskillen Castle]]. After landing at Loch Foyle, the Hebridean chieftains were entertained by Ó Domhnaill for three days and three nights. MacDhòmhnaill then returned to the Hebrides and left his men behind in Ireland, however, MacLeòid stayed and was present at the fall of Enniskillen Castle in October 1594. He was still in Ireland the next year at the head of 600 Hebrideans, alongside Ó Domhnaill at the siege of MacCostello's Castle, in [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref name="R2-106"&gt;[[#R2|Roberts 1999]]: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of Ruairidh Mòr's participation in activities in Ireland at the end of the 16th century, R.C. MacLeod concluded that the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods through the O'Neill chieftain [[Shane Ó Neill]]; and that the two chieftains were the friends mentioned in the traditional tale related by Lady O'Neill in 1925.&lt;ref name="M1-4243"&gt;[[#M1|MacLeod, R.C. 1927]]: p. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
{{also|Fairy cup legend}}
In 1927, R.C. MacLeod gave two abridged versions of traditions said to be attributed to the Dunvegan Cup, although it was R.C. MacLeod's opinion that these traditions were un-historical.&lt;ref name="M1-4446"&gt;[[#M1|MacLeod, R.C. 1927]]: p. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions are supposed to relate events which took place during the tenure of Malcolm, the third chief of Clan Macleod, who lived about 1296–1370.&lt;ref name="M1-4446"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macleodgenealogy.org-I7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0027/I7.html |title=Malcolm Gillecaluim MACLEOD (III Chief) |accessdate=20 March 2009 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727053728/http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0027/I7.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|In the time of Malcolm, the third Chief, the lands of Luskintyre were possessed by two brothers who were at mortal feud with one another. Their cattle were herded in common, in charge of a man named Lurran Casinreach or swift-footed. This man's mother had nursed one of the brothers — she was considered a [[witch]], and lived with her son in a small cottage near her foster-son's house. Lurran folded the cows every night in Buaille Rossinish, where during the harvest season it was customary to have them watched. On the first night of the season it was Lurran's turn to watch, and as the place was considered to be a resort of fairies, Lurran's mother took the precaution to charm all her foster-son's cows, as well as her son Lurran on whom she uttered a spell, proof against the devil himself. About midnight Lurran saw the Bruthach (or mound) open, and an immense concourse of people issue from it. They proceeded towards the fold where they began to converse and examine the cattle. They found the cows of one brother all charmed, but those of the other not so fortunate. Of the latter they immediately killed two of the best and fattest and carried away the carcases, leaving the hides filled with froth and slime, resembling bad carrion. In the morning the two cows were found dead, and conjectured to have been killed by lightning. The same thing however occurred for several nights — the cows of the same brother always being selected. Watch was set but none possessed the power of seeing the fairies, while Lurran kept what he had seen a secret from all but his mother. When it again came to Lurran's turn to watch he saw the same thing happen, but this time he joined the crowd and entered the Bruthach unobserved, and found himself in a spacious hall where was prepared a feast of which all partook. Lurran took care to get a place next the door. After the feast wine was handed round in a beautiful cup, out of which each one drank and then handed it to his neighbour. At last it came to Lurran's turn, who, pitching out the contents, made a dash for the door and escaped, carrying the cup with him, before the company were aware of what he was about. He was hotly pursued but succeeded in reaching his mother's hut, which she immediately charmed so as to prevent the ingress of any spirits, good or bad. Lurran, however, was eventually killed by the fairies for stealing their cup, which his mother then gave to her foster-son, Neil Glundubh. Neil was soon after murdered by his brother, who seized the cup with other property.
When the Chief heard of this outrage he had the murderer arrested and put to death at [[Rodel|Rowdell]]. The cup was then taken to Dunvegan, and there it has ever since remained.&lt;ref name="M3-4850"&gt;[[#M3|MacLeod, R.C. 1906]]: p. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;|30px||R.C. MacLeod|''The Macleods''}}
The second story also mentions the two brothers, but differs in all other details. It relates how the chief held a great banquet at Rowdell in [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]].
{{cquote|... the son of one of these same brothers having been insulted at a feast by Magnus, (the Chief's fifth son) rose from the table to leave the room, muttering threats of vengeance. Magnus sprang up and opposed his exit, on which the offended vassal drew his dirk and stabbed Magnus to the heart. A rush was made by the assembled vassals to seize the murderer, who succeeded in escaping to the top of a rock, which is still shown, where he was brought to bay. He had twelve arrows in his quiver and with each of these he killed one of the Chief's followers. He was then captured and flayed alive; his kindred were outlawed or put to death and all their property confiscated to the Chief who in this way became possessed of the cup.&lt;ref name="M3-4850"/&gt;|30px||R.C.

'''Edward Bullough''' (28 March 1880 – 17 September 1934) was an English [[aesthetics|aesthetician]] and scholar of [[modern language]]s, who worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He did experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]], and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of [[psychical distance]]: that which "appears to lie between our own self and its affections" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in 1933.

==Life and work==

===Early life to "Psychical Distance," 1880&amp;ndash;1914===

Edward Bullough was born in [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlein.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Trayes, ed., ''Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College'', vol. 5, ''Admissions from 1911 to 1932'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1948), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;M. O. [Michael Oakeshott], "Edward Bullough," ''Caian'' 43, no. 1 (1934): 1. It was a convention at the time that articles in the ''Caian'' were signed with initials only. Oakeshott is identified in Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', by Edward Bullough (London: Bowes and Bowes, 1957), xii.&lt;/ref&gt; At seventeen Bullough moved to England,&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1899 matriculated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Rouse Ball and J. A. Venn, eds., ''Admissions to Trinity College, Cambridge'', vol. 5, ''1851 to 1900'' (London: Macmillan, 1913), 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Ball and Venn, ''Admissions to Trinity'', 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time Bullough became interested in [[aesthetics]], and "prepared himself to deal with [its] problems … by a study of [[physiology]] and general [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. See also Edward Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1934), 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as ''The Modern Conception of Aesthetics''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. Bullough mistakenly says the year was 1906 in ''Italian Perspectives'', 8. The lectures are first announced, to begin on 14 October 1907, in the ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 37, no. 39 (1907): 1018.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the course annually "until shortly before his death".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]] in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the ''British Journal of Psychology'': "The Apparent Heaviness of Colours" (1907), "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours" (1908), and "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations" (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough also had an interest in [[parapsychology]], and was a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor [[Eleonora Duse]]), with whom he would have a son and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough, Italian Studies at Cambridge," ''The Times'', 18 September 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle". [[Psychical distance]] (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, "appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle," ''British Journal of Psychology'' 5, no. 2 (1912): 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Psychical Distance] has a ''negative'', inhibitory aspect—the cutting-out of the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them—and a ''positive'' side—the elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by the inhibitory action of Distance.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relation between [[self]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]] remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in [[science|scientific]] observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a "concordance" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 91&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt; However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of ''[[Othello]]'', who "will probably do anything but appreciate the play".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[antinomy]] of Distance"&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 92.&lt;/ref&gt; leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, "both in appreciation and production", is "the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 94. In the source, the second quotation is mostly italicised.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War service to death, 1915&amp;ndash;1934===

In the [[First World War]], Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the [[Admiralty]]'s [[cryptanalysis|cryptoanalysis]] section, [[Room 40]]. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He published in the ''British Journal of Psychology'' two more papers on aesthetic theory, "The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology" (1919) and "Mind and Medium in Art" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in [[modern language]]s and University Lecturer in German,&lt;ref&gt;P. Giles, "Appointment of a University Lecturer in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 50, no. 31 (1920): 758.&lt;/ref&gt; and he edited the anthology ''Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Bullough resigned his university post,&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Pearce, "University Lectureship in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 53, no. 41 (1923): 1042.&lt;/ref&gt; wishing to concentrate instead on Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he joined the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] as a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|Dominican Tertiary]], and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade he published translations of [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Karl Adam (theologian)|Karl Adam]], and [[Pope Pius XI|Achille Ratti]] (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies "all went into his lectures and teaching", rather than research for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted anonymously in Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132. No reference has been located in the ''Cambridge University Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullough was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Will Spens, "Professorship of Italian: Election," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 63, no. 29 (1933): 830.&lt;/ref&gt; In his printed inaugural lecture, titled ''Italian Perspectives'', he claims that the Italian "perspective" is one of "continuity of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] with [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]] times",&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt; so that tradition is treated "with the easy familiarity of a family possession".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, "the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In illustration, Bullough proposes [[Roman law]], the [[Renaissance]], and the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] as "three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the contemporary [[Italian Fascism|fascist movement]] as a tentative fourth:&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 62&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt; a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was "no doubt" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Uberto Limentani, "Leone and Arthur Serena and the Cambridge Chair of Italian, 1919&amp;ndash;1934," ''Modern Language Review'' 92, no. 4 (1997): 891.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short illness&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from an internal operation,&lt;ref&gt;H. O. Evennett, "Edward Bullough," ''Dublin Review'' 196, no. 392 (1935): 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough died in a nursing home in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on 17 September 1934. He was buried at Woodchester Priory in [[Stroud]].&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Michael Oakeshott]], a colleague at Caius, wrote Bullough's obituary for their college record.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', xii. Bullough's influence on Oakeshott's aesthetics is discussed in Efraim Podoksik, ''In Defence of Modernity: Vision and Philosophy in Michael Oakeshott'' (Exeter: Imprint Academic, 2003), 109&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family home on Buckingham Road, Cambridge was offered to the Dominican Order by his widow and is now [[Cambridge Blackfriars]].

'''Environmental sculpture''' is sculpture that creates or alters the environment for the viewer, as opposed to presenting itself figurally or monumentally before the viewer. A frequent trait of larger environmental sculptures is that one can actually enter or pass through the sculpture and be partially or completely surrounded by it. Also, in the same spirit, it may be designed to generate shadows or reflections, or to color the light in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Britannica]] Online: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9032735/environmental-sculpture]  '''"20th-century art form intended to involve or encompass the spectators rather than merely to face them; the form developed as part of a larger artistic current that sought to break down the historical dichotomy between life and art."'''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture as environment ==

Julia M. Bush emphasizes the nonfigurative aspect of such works: "Environmental sculpture is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer."&lt;ref&gt;(Busch, p.&amp;nbsp;27)."A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s" (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian-born [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Louise Nevelson]] is a pioneer of environmental sculpture in this sense. Busch (p.&amp;nbsp;27) also places the sculptures of [[Jane Frank]], as well as some works by [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], in this category. Some environmental sculpture so encompasses the observer that it verges on architecture.

[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Duane Hanson]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Christo]], and [[Michael Heizer]] are well known practitioners of the genre, although Segal and Hanson's work is figural. Many figurative works of George Segal, for example, do qualify as environmental, in that—instead of being displayed on a pedestal as presentations to be gazed upon—they occupy and perturb the setting in which they are placed. A well known instance of this is the pair of Segal figures that sit on and stand next to one of the public benches in [[New York City]]'s Sheridan Square; anyone can sit amongst them.

A less known but more appropriate example is [[Athena Tacha]]'s {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} park ''Connections'' in downtown Philadelphia (between 18th St. and 19th St. two blocks north of Vine St.), created as a landscape art environment after her winning a competition in 1980 (where Segal was actually one of the finalists).  It was the first park designed entirely by an artist "sculpting the land" with planted terraces, rock clusters and paths (completed in 1992).

A second sense of the term "environmental sculpture", with a somewhat different emphasis, is sculpture ''created for'' a particular set of surroundings. Thus, contemporary sculptor Beth Galston writes: "An environmental sculptor plans a piece from the very beginning in relationship to its surroundings. The site is a catalyst, becoming part of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethgalston.com/AboutEnvSculpt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite different from a Nevelson sculpture, which can usually be moved from place to place, like a conventional sculpture, without losing its meaning and effectiveness.

By Galston's definition, an environmental sculpture is not merely [[site-specific art]] as many conventional, figurative, marble monuments were created for specific sites.  Galston stresses that environmental sculpture entails the idea that the piece also functions to alter or permeate the existing environment or even to create a new environment in which the viewer is invited to participate: "The finished sculpture and site become one integrated unit, working together to create a unified mood or atmosphere," she writes. Many of the large, site-specific, [[minimalist]] sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] also qualify as environmental sculpture, in both senses described here. Much of what is called "[[land art]]" or "[[earth art]]" could also be termed environmental sculpture under this definition. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]] and [[Alan Sonfist]] (which see) are among notable current practitioners of [[land art]].

Since the mid-seventies, French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]] worked with [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] structures, deconstructing and re-arranging the elements of surrounding architecture or including the site into the sculpture&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Suner,''Les sculptures de visées du Parc de La Villette'', Urbanisme no 215, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sculptures Bachelard]].

Since 1983 German artist [[Eberhard Bosslet]] makes interventions on ruins, so-called "Re/formations and side effects"; he refers to the conditions of industrial and residential buildings by white painted lines or black painted color fields. In 1999 the artist Elena Paroucheva created her concept for pylons, integrating energy networks with sculptures.http://www.art-elena.com/

==Site-specific art and environmental art==
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|right|''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' by [[Robert Smithson]] from atop Rozel Point, in mid-April 2005]]
The term "[[site-specific art]]" is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[environmental art]]".  [[Louise Nevelson]], for instance is a pioneer American environmental artist with sources disagreeing on classifying her work as "environmental sculpture". The terms "environment sculpture", "site-specific art", and "environmental art" have not yet completely stabilized in their meanings.

A reason for blurred definitions is that much of site-specific and environmental art was created from 1970 on for public spaces all over the United States, sponsored by federal (GSA and NEA) or state and city [[Percent for Art]] competitions, and many of the artists were women trying to succeed outside the established art-gallery world.  Younger art historians will have to sort out the development of this marginalized "movement" and the importance of artists such as [[Olga Kisseleva]], [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Athena Tacha]], Mary Miss, [[Alice Adams (artist)|Alice Adams]], [[Elyn Zimmerman]], [[Merle Temkin]] and others who, from the early 1970s on, won and executed large outdoor public art commissions with new formal, kinesthetic and social underpinnings. Many of these artists were also ecologically conscious and created works that could offer a further definition of "environmental sculpture": art that is environmentally friendly and cares for the natural environment.

==Hagiographic life==

According to the legend, Ephigenia was the daughter of [[Ethiopia]]n King Egippus. She was dedicated to God by Saint [[Matthew the Apostle]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine'', trans. and adapted by Ryan, Granger and Helmut Ripperger. (Arno Press: Longmans, Green &amp; Co) 1941. pp. 561–566.&lt;/ref&gt; who [[Christian headcovering|veiled]] her.&lt;ref name=ROCOR2004&gt;The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of Western Europe and the Americas (ROCOR). ''St. Hilarion Calendar of Saints for the year of our Lord 2004.'' St. Hilarion Press (Austin, TX). p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hirtacus succeeded the King, he promised the [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] half of his kingdom if he could persuade Ephigenia to marry him. Matthew thus invited the king to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the following Sunday where he explained that she was already espoused to the eternal King and thus could not be purloined by Hirtacus. The king thus sent a swordsman to kill Matthew who stood at the altar, making him a [[martyr]].

Not having managed to bend Ephigenia to his will, Hirtacus tried to destroy her home with fire. However, the apostle appeared and warded the flames from the house, turning them upon the royal palace. The king's son was seized by the [[devil]] and the king himself contracted [[leprosy]], eventually killing himself.

The people thus chose Ephigenia's brother as their king, who reigned for seventy years, leaving his kingdom to his son who filled [[Egypt]] with [[Christian]] churches.

The [[Bollandist]]s included an entry for Saint Iphigenia in their ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' for September 21. She is listed in a German language Bollandist-derived collection of saints of 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} "[http://www.zeno.org/Heiligenlexikon-1858/A/Iphigenia,+S.

Vollständiges Heiligen-Lexikon, I-L, Volume 3, 1869. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Roberto Sánchez in his paper '' 'The Black Virgin: Santa Efigenia, Popular Religion, and the African Diaspora in Peru' '' notes the following about the Bollandist account:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Bollandist]]s, whose work is to historicize and contextualize the lives of the saints, concede that there is some doubt as to whether St. Matthew even went to Ethiopia. They conclude however that the legend is consistent with other sources and apocryphal writings of the period. It is clear that the story of Santa Efígenia is written as a [[corollary]] to the keen interest in the martyrdom of St. Matthew. His martyrdom is a significant historical event that has been subject of different versions. In effect, the origins of Santa Efigenia are shrouded in myth, folklore, and a spirited ecclesiastical historical debate."&lt;ref name=SANCHEZ642&gt;Roberto Sánchez. "The Black Virgin: Santa Efigenia, Popular Religion, and the African Diaspora in Peru." ''Church History'' 81:3 (September 2012), 631–655. p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Austrian Jesuit missionary and author [[Francis Xavier Weninger]] ([[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]) included the life of Saint Ephigenia in his ''Lives of the Saints'' (1876), inscribed within the life of Saint Matthew on September 21:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...Incontestible writings prove that he preached the Gospel for twenty-three years, partly in Ethiopia, partly in other countries, at the same time founding almost innumerable Churches, and supplying them with priests and bishops, in order to preserve the faith he had taught... ...Iphigenia, the eldest daughter of the newly converted king of Ethiopia, had not only become a Christian, but also, with the knowledge and consent of the holy Apostle, had consecrated her virginity to the Almighty, after having frequently heard the Saint preach on the priceless value of purity, and exhort others to guard and preserve it. Her example was followed by many other virgins, who, choosing the princess as their superior, lived together and occupied their time in prayer and work..."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. [[Francis Xavier Weninger|F. X. Weninger]] ([[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]).

Her listing in the ''Roman Martyrology'' (1916 English edition) states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Ethiopia, St. Iphigenia, virgin, who being baptized and consecrated to God by the blessed apostle Matthew, ended her holy life in peace."&lt;ref name=ROMAN292/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Book of Saints'' (1921) compiled by the Benedictine Monks of [[St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate]] has the following entry for Saint Iphigenia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Virgin converted to Christianity and afterwards [[Religious vows|consecrated to God]] by St. Matthew the Evangelist, Apostle of Ethiopia. The extant [[Matthew the Apostle#Non-canonical or Apocryphal Gospels|Acts of St. Matthew]] are however so untrustworthy that no reliance can be placed on the particulars given therein of St Iphigenia and others of the first fruits of the Gospel in Ethiopia."&lt;ref name=RAMSGATE/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her name was Iphigenia and she is listed as a saint in the Martyrology. After her resurrection from the dead, with Saint Matthew’s approval, she took a vow of virginity. This so enraged the next king, Hirtacus, who wanted to marry her, that he had Matthew slain at the altar while offering Mass. The year was 68.

===Anglican Catholic Church===

The [[Anglican Catholic Church]] records the memory of Saint Ephigenia, contained within the ''Life'' of Saint Matthew, citing ''The Anglican Breviary'' (1955):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although many parts of Christendom have delighted to claim this Apostle as the founder of their Churches, the usual tradition is that '''he went into the regions south of the [[Caspian Sea]], (which same are in this instance called Ethiopia)''' where he preached the Gospel and confirmed the same by many wondrous deeds. The greatest of these is told on this wise: that he raised to life the king's daughter, Iphigenia, whereby the royal family was converted to Christ; that after the king died Hirtacus his successor demanded Iphigenia to wife; and that she (who through Matthew's teaching had vowed herself to God) rejected Hirtacus in pursuance of her vow; for which reason Matthew was by royal order put to death whilst celebrating the holy Mysteries, whereby he fulfilled his apostleship in martyrdom."&lt;ref name=ANG-BREVIARY-1955/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Orthodox Church===

Significantly, the ''Life'' of Saint [[Matthew the Apostle]] in traditional Orthodox [[Synaxaria]] does not directly mention Saint Ephigenia by name, although the Synaxaria do record Saint Matthew's travels to "Ethiopia", that he [[List of Eastern Orthodox saint titles|enlightened]] the area, and was martyred there. The Orthodox [[Synaxarion]] according to the tradition of [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]] (c. 1320), states that after being cruelly treated by the [[Parthia|Parthians]] and [[Medes]], St. Matthew then went to spread the Gospel to a certain city called "Mirmena / Myrmena",&lt;ref&gt;Hieromonk Makarios of [[Simonopetra|Simonos Petra]] (Ed.).

The source is most likely a ''local'' Greek account, which refers to this Saint Iphigenia as "''Saint Iphigenia the Virgin-Martyr of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]''", maytyred in 68 AD at the age of 15.&lt;ref name=ARCHIM-DOROTHEOS/&gt; This local account makes her a young virgin-martyr and places her in Pontus, which is apparently at odds with the account in the ''Golden Legend,'' which places her in "Ethiopia", includes Saint Matthew in the story and makes Ephigenia an abbess.

Therefore there are two possibilities: 1) either the details of her current ''Life'' are a confused [[conflation]] of these two different traditions, if indeed she was a single individual; or otherwise, 2) it is possible that there were two distinct Saints named "Iphigenia", both dating from the first century: one from Pontus who was martyred in 68 AD aged 15, based on the local Greek account; and a different one from "Ethiopia" (i.e. "Asiatic Ethiopia"), based on the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] account in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.

:* "They had multiple goals in mind when they petitioned the municipality to create an association and name her as patroness and protector of National Black Art. They seized upon an opportunity provided by a regional economic development project promoted by the Ministry of Industry and Tourism to market Afro-Peruvian culture through a series of festivals, including religious cultural expressions. Their need to authenticate their cultural ownership of Santa Efígenia required a historical explanation of her origins and diaspora. Their sketchy attempts contributed more to mystifying than to clarifying, yet their rewriting is part of an African diaspora that weaves tradition, fact, and fiction to serve more pragmatic aims."&lt;ref name=SANCHEZ648&gt;Roberto Sánchez.

In honor of Saint Ephigenia, a virgin-martyr of 1794 had taken her name. A professed religious of the Order of St. Benedict that was martyred during the French Revolution in 1794 was known as "Sister Iphigénie of Saint Matthew". Her name was Blessed Marie-Gabrielle-Françoise-Suzanne de Gaillard de Lavaldène (1761–1794), also known as "Francesca Maria Susanna", "Sister Iphigénie of Saint Matthew" or "Ifigenia di San Matteo de Gaillard de la Valdène", and she was one of the Martyrs of Orange who was guillotined on 7 July 1794 in [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange, Vaucluse, France]]. She was beatified 10 May 1925 by Pope Pius XI and she is commemorated on July 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} ''[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/61090 Beata Ifigenia di S.

'''Eugene de Blaas''', also known as '''Eugene von Blaas''' or '''Eugenio Blaas''' (24 July 1843 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1931), was an Italian painter in the school known as [[Academic art|Academic Classicism]].

==Life and career==

[[File:Eugen von Blaas - Two Venetian Women.jpg|thumbnail|Eugen von Blaas : Two Venetian Women]]
[[File:Eugen von Blaas In der Sakristei 1877.jpg|thumbnail| In the [[Sacristy]], 1877]]
He was born at [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], near [[Rome]], to [[Austria]]n parents. His father [[Karl von Blaas|Karl]], also a painter, was his teacher. The family moved to [[Venice]] when Karl became Professor at the [[Academy of Venice]].  He often painted scenes in Venice, but also portraits and religious paintings.

==Works==
Among his works are ''La forma nuziale in sacrestia''; ''La tombola in Campielo a Venezia''; ''Una scena di burattini in un educanciatu''; and ''La Ninetta''. The art critic [[Luigi Chirtani]], when the painting was displayed at the Mostra Nazionale di Venezia, described it as ''Beautiful, flattering, pretty, caressed, cleaned, polished, laundress in a painting by Mr. Blaas, the favorite portraitist of great Venetian aristocrats, dressed in gala satins, shining jewelry, hairstyles of the rich.'' &lt;ref&gt;''Bellina, lusinghiera, linda, accarezzata, pulita, forbita, questa lavandaia rappresenta benissimo la pittura del signor Blaas, il ritrattista prediletto delle gran signoro veneziane, in veste di gala di raso, splendenti per gioielli, compite nelle ricche acconciature.'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

His colorful and rather theatrical period images of Venetian society, e.g. ''On the Balcony'' (1877; Private Collection), were quite different compared to delicate pastels and etchings of the courtyards, balcony and canals of modern Venice.

Eugene de Blaas' paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy, Fine Art Society, New Gallery and Arthur Tooth and Sons Gallery in London, and also at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.favoritearts.info/Blaas-Eugene-de-Austria-Old-Oil-Painting-Masterpiece-Reproduction.html |title=Biography of old oil painting master Eugene de Blaas |publisher=Favoritearts.info |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517135715/http://www.favoritearts.info/Blaas-Eugene-de-Austria-Old-Oil-Painting-Masterpiece-Reproduction.html |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
Ho was an accomplished and acclaimed{{cn|date=March 2017}} Hong Kong film director and actor.

He joined [[Shaw Brothers]] in 1961 to develop his career in cinema. He started as a [[continuity editing|continuity assistant]] in the movie ''The Swallow'' (1961)&lt;ref name=HKFDG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hkfilmdirectors.com/en/director/ho-fan |title=何藩 / HO Fan |author= |date=2017 |publisher=Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild |website=The Ultimate Guide to HK Film Directors |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved on to act in several movies for Shaw. Ho won praise for his performance as the Monk, Tripitaka, in the lavish Shaw Brothers adaption of [[List of media adaptations of Journey to the West#Films|''Journey to the West'' four-picture cycle of films]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} Ho became disillusioned with Shaw's revenue-driven formula, and sought creative relief in photography and in other studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/2/9/15/n215710.htm |title=華藝攝影學會三十五週年華誕 |trans-title=The 30th Anniversary of The Chinatown Photographic Society |author=卞克 |date=15 September 2002 |newspaper=Epoch Times |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s he also produced a pioneering{{cn|date=July 2017}} series of independent short films, the first of which, ''Big City Little Man'' (大都市 小人物; 1963, 30 min), won the "Honor Award Certificate" from the Japan International Film Festival in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/en_US/web/hkfa/publications_souvenirs/pub/topicalvolumes/topicalvolumes_detail02.html |title=i-Generations: Independent, experimental and alternative creations from the 60s to now |editor=Fung, May |publisher=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]] |date=2001 |isbn=962-8050-13-3 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho left Shaw Brothers in 1969 to develop his career as a director, making over 20 films with various studios in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He has had three films in the "Official Selection" of the [[Cannes Film Festival|International Film Festivals of Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]] and [[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]]; and five of his films have been selected in the "Permanent Collection" of the National Film Archives of Taiwan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=HKFDG /&gt; As well as his independent film work he is acclaimed for pioneering the erotic field ([[Hong Kong motion picture rating system|Category III films]]) in cinema, with such cult{{cn|date=July 2017}} films as ''Adventure in Denmark'' (1973), ''The Girl with the Long Hair'' (1975) and the highly successful ''Temptation Summary'' (1990).

According to Mark Pinsukanjana, director of Modernbook Gallery in San Francisco, CA, his debut feature, ''Lost'' (1969), was Ho's favourite. As Pinsukanjana says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Lost'', one will see the chaotic life of one man in Hong Kong. The film follows him and finds the beauty that surrounds him; he is lost because he never saw it. I think that one can say that this is similar to Fan Ho's photographs in the sense that Hong Kong is crowded, busy and chaotic to many, but for Fan Ho, he was able to convert [what he found] and find beauty."&lt;ref name=studiointernational&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/stillness-in-motion-the-photographs-of-fan-ho/ |title=Stillness in Motion: The Photographs of Fan Ho |author=Di Marzo, Cindi |publisher=Studio-international.co.uk |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also served on the jury of the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]] Festival and [[Hong Kong Film Award]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Post-retirement career==
[[File:Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition view 2017.jpg|200px|thumb|Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition in 2017]]
Ho's wife and children emigrated to [[San Jose, California]] in 1979 to pursue a university education&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt; and he followed in 1995 after retiring from cinema.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/1979279/ho-fan-celebrated-1950s-hong-kong-street-photographer-dies |title=Ho Fan, celebrated 1950s Hong Kong street photographer, dies in California |author=Cheung, Rachel |date=22 June 2016 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restless in retirement, Ho's health began to decline until his family suggested that he pursue photography again. Rather than using modern equipment and taking photographs locally in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Ho went through his old negatives from Hong Kong and began showing his portfolio to local galleries.&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt;

He exhibited slides of his photographs, some of which were in the permanent collection at [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|SFMOMA]], at the 1998 New Asian Cinema Festival, which was screening his 1988 film ''Carnal Desire'' at the 4 Star Theater in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Carnal-Desire-spiritual-journeys-3089238.php |title="Carnal Desire," spiritual journeys |author=Johnson, G.

Modernbook went on to stage his vintage work at photoLA in January 2006, and upon seeing his photographs of Hong Kong, fellow gallery owner Laurence Miller was moved to acquire 26 prints and put on a solo exhibit for Ho in New York City later that year.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; Ho would go on to publish a new monograph, ''Hong Kong Yesterday'' in 2006 after receiving international attention for this early work.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; By compositing old negatives, Ho continued to produce new prints of scenes that have now vanished from modern Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=SCMP-140810 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN-131030 /&gt; Many of the resulting composited prints were published for the first time in his final monograph ''A Hong Kong Memoir'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=SCMP-141210&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1656431/inquisition-ho-fan-photographer |title=Ho Fan, Hong Kong photographer, on retrieving lost memories |interviewer=Edmund Lee |subject=Ho Fan |date=10 December 2014 |publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following exhibits of the same title at Modernbook in summer 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-hos-hong-kong-snapshots-bear-playful-theatricality/Content?oid=2178470 |title=Fan Ho's Hong Kong snapshots bear playful theatricality |author=Archer, Larissa |date=21 July 2011 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from December 2014 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-ho-photos-bring-mid-century-hong-kong-to-life/Content?oid=2915055 |title=Fan Ho photos bring mid-century Hong Kong to life |author=Katz, Anita |date=25 December 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of Hong Kong'' 《舊香港人的舊》 contains 153 new street photographs which were selected from 500 negatives chosen by Ho before he died in 2016. After his death, the surviving family members spent about a year completing the project, together with support from Sarah Greene (Blue Lotus Consultancy) and WE Press (香港人出版). 20 quotable excerpts from Ho's earliest book, ''Thoughts on Street Photography'' 《街頭攝影叢談》, were included. These 153 photographs provide not only glimpses of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s but also recall the indomitable spirit of the people at the time&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2098441/how-fan-ho-hong-kongs-poet-camera-found-his|title=How Fan Ho, Hong Kong's poet with a camera, found his calling - in his own words|last=Heaver|first=Stuart|date=June 20, 2017|work=Post Magazine, South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zolimacitymag.com/hong-kong-revisited-through-the-eyes-of-the-late-street-photographer-fan-ho/|title=Hong Kong Revisited Through the Eyes of the Late Street Photographer Fan Ho|last=Karacs|first=Sarah|date=June 13, 2017|work=Zolima Citymag|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of realistic street photographs were never highly recognized during 1950s and 1960s, despite being Ho's favorites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/hongkong/lifestyle/never-seen-snaps-old-hong-kong-legendary-photographer-fan-ho-go-show/|title=Never-seen-before snaps of 'old Hong Kong' from legendary photographer Fan Ho to go on show|last=Hong Kong|first=Coconuts|date=|website=Coconuts Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as quoted in Ho’s reply to Sarah Greene during one of her visits to Ho in early 2016.

The term '''''formalism''''' describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the [[arts]], [[literature]], or [[philosophy]]. A practitioner of formalism is called a '''''formalist'''''.  A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner.  For example, formalists within [[mathematics]] claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone.  This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth.  Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with "the rules of the game," as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules.  In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon [[axiomatic system]]s.

==Religion==
Formalism in religion means an emphasis on [[ritual]] and [[religious observance|observance]] over their meanings.  Within Christianity, the term [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==
{{Main|Legal formalism}}
Formalism is a school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms.  For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that "judges should apply the law, not make it."  To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, ''formalism'' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
{{Main|formalism (art)}}

Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it.  The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant.  Examples of formalist aestheticians are [[Clive Bell]], [[Jerome Stolnitz]], and [[Edward Bullough]].

===Literary criticism===
{{Main|formalism (literature)}}

In contemporary discussions of [[literary theory]], the school of criticism of [[I. A. Richards]] and his followers, traditionally the [[New Criticism]],  has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical [[rhetoric]]. 

[[Russian formalism]] was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on [[fairy tale]]s, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts&lt;!--Linked from 'Theory of art'--&gt;==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, ''Formalist poets'' may be considered as the opposite of writers of [[free verse]]. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.

See for example:
*''[[The Formalist]]'', a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*[[New Formalism]], a movement within the [[poetry of the United States]].

===Film===
{{Main| Formalist film theory}}
In [[film studies]], formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as [[editing]], shot [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise [[graphical]] (as opposed to [[diegetic]]) qualities of the image.  Strict formalism, condemned by [[Realism (arts)|realist]] film theorists such as [[André Bazin]], has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Sergei Parajanov|Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation.  These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].

==Mathematics==
{{Main|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]]. In common usage, ''a'' formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In [[economic anthropology]], formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of [[neoclassical economics]] can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

'''''Free to Be… You and Me''''' was a children's entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author [[Marlo Thomas]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]],&lt;ref name=NPR-MorningEdition-40th-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rachel|title=40 Years On, 'Free To Be' Still Resonates|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166735512/40-years-on-free-to-be-message-still-resonates|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]]|date=7 December 2012|format=Audio interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a [[record album]] and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as "[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends") including [[Alan Alda]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Jack Cassidy]], and [[Diana Ross]]. An ABC special, also created by [[Marlo Thomas]], using poetry, songs, and sketches followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s [[gender neutrality]], saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

== Overview ==
The original idea to create the album began with [[Marlo Thomas]],&lt;ref name=Makers-Birth-FTBYAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Marlo|title=Birth of 'Free to Be... You and Me'|url=http://www.makers.com/marlo-thomas/moments/birth-free-be%E2%80%A6-you-and-me|website=[[Makers: Women Who Make America|Makers]]|accessdate=19 October 2014|format=Video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children's books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told my sister Terre "it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it (stories featuring traditional gender roles) the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read" and she said "You go and find 'em." 

Well there weren't any. And not only weren't there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book - I'm Glad I'm a Boy! I'm Glad I'm a Girl! by [[Whitney Darrow, Jr.]]) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said "Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses." Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. 

So I said "I'll make a record for Dionne. I'll ask everybody to donate their talents and it'll be fun." [[Larry Uttal]] at [[Bell Records]] told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It's still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Produced by [[Carole Hart]], with music produced by [[Stephen J. Lawrence]] and [[Bruce Hart (songwriter)|Bruce Hart]], with stories and poems directed by [[Alan Alda]], the title has never been out of print.

Proceeds went to the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]]. The album was originally released on [[Bell Records]] in 1972 and since 1975 has been available on [[Arista Records]] cassettes and CDs. 

Well-known songs include "It's All Right to Cry," sung by football hero [[Rosey Grier]]; the title track by [[the New Seekers]]; "Helping," a Shel Silverstein poem performed by [[Tom Smothers]]; "Sisters and Brothers" by the [[Voices of East Harlem]]; and "When We Grow Up" performed by [[Diana Ross]] on the album and by [[Roberta Flack]] and a teenage [[Michael Jackson]] on the special.

Other sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include "Atalanta," co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] of [[Atalanta]]; "Boy Meets Girl" with Thomas and [[Mel Brooks]] providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by [[Wayland Flowers]], resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; "[[William's Doll]]", based on [[Charlotte Zolotow]]'s picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and "Dudley Pippin" with [[Robert Morse]] and [[Billy De Wolfe]], based on stories by Phil Ressner.

A number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although ''Housework'' was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its' description of domestic workers.

Marlo Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In among all the praise we got for the project as a whole, we kept getting all these letters and phone calls talking about the track sounding as if it wasn't normal to be fond of cooking and cleaning and caretaking etc. So we left that off the special for that reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], then editor of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' Most of the children attended Corlears School.

"[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends" followed ''Free to Be... You and Me'' with a 1988 sequel, ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]'', the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.

In her 2010 memoir, ''Growing Up Laughing'', [[Marlo Thomas]] reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Television special ==
The television special, produced by [[Marlo Thomas]] and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-[[Fred Wolf Films]], Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  It earned an 18.6 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]/27 share and went on to win an [[Emmy]]. Sixteen-mm prints of the special were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, in their school during that period.

The special appeared occasionally on [[HBO]] in the 1980s. It was released on VHS through [[Vestron Video]] subsidiary [[Children's Video Library]] in 1983.  It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land, yet has not been aired on any network since.

A [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] DVD of the television special was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7791">[[Image:Jean-Francois Leleu - Secretaire a abattant.JPG|thumb|''Secrétaire à abattant'' by [[Jean-François Leleu]], Paris, ca 1770 ([[Musée Nissim de Camondo]], Paris]]
'''French furniture''' comprises both the most sophisticated furniture made in [[Paris]] for king and court, aristocrats and rich upper bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and [[French provincial furniture]] made in the provincial cities and towns many of which, like [[Lyon]] and [[Liège]], retained cultural identities distinct from the metropolis. There was also a conservative artisanal rural tradition of '''French country furniture''' which remained unbroken until the advent of the railroads in the mid-nineteenth century.

==Provincial furniture==
Furniture made in provincial centers such as [[Blois]] and [[Orléans]] in the Loire valley, and at [[Lyon]] or [[Liège]] (Not part of France politically but within its cultural orbit), followed at some distance the design innovations that were initiated in the luxury trades of Paris, often with a time lag that could amount to decades.

Features typically associated with French Provincial furniture include [[cabriole leg]]s, and simple scalloped carving. Dining chairs often have a wheat pattern carving reflecting the country surroundings of the maker. The ladder back chair with a woven rush seat is the typical French Provincial dining chair. Finishes vary though common to all colours is the accumulation of polish or grime in the carving over time resulting in an aged patina and emphasis on the carving regardless of whether the furniture is painted or stained.

==Parisian furniture==
In the metropolitan [[culture of France]], ''French furniture'', connoting '''Parisian furniture''', embodies one of the mainstreams of design in the [[decorative arts]] of Europe, extending its influence from Spain to Sweden and Russia, from the late seventeenth century to the last craft traditions in workshops like [[Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann]], which came to an end only with the Second World War. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, French furniture of the classic period 1660-1815, has been collected as passionately by non-French ''amateurs'', with the English in the historical lead,&lt;ref&gt;Much of the French furniture in the Royal Collection was purchased by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], beginning with his furnishing of [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; and has set record prices consistently, since the Hamilton Palace sale of 1882,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonancestor.com/newspaper/1882/0715/hamilton-palace-sale.htm The Hamilton Palace Sale]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that it is represented in many national museums.

In Paris, an unbroken tradition of [[apprenticeship]], already fully formed when the design center for luxury furnishings shifted from [[Antwerp]] to Paris in the 1630s, was slowly disrupted by the [[Industrial Revolution]] after the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the last of the Parisian ''[[ébéniste]]s'' working from a traditional atelier was [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] (1879-1933).

==French royal furniture==
The grand tradition of '''French royal furniture''' received its impetus from the establishment of the ''[[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture royale des Gobelins]]'' under the organisation of the arts in the service of [[Louis XIV of France]] that was controlled and directed by his minister of finance, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]].  Favoured craftsmen would be eligible for premises in the galleries of the [[Palais du Louvre]], a practice that had been initiated on a small scale under [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]]. At the Gobelins, much more than [[tapestry]] was made for the furnishing of the royal palaces and the occasional ambassadorial gift: the celebrated silver furnishings for the ''[[Galerie des Glaces]]'' at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] was produced by silversmiths working to designs by [[Charles Le Brun]] at the Gobelins.

In Paris, the furniture trade was divided among [[Guild#European history|craft guild]]s with jealous regard for infringements. ''[[Menuisier]]s'' were solely occupied with carved furnishings, which included beds and all seat furniture, as they were for the carved ''[[boiserie]]s'' of the interiors they were destined to occupy. Carvers and [[gilding|gilders]] worked directly for them. ''[[Ébéniste]]s'', who drew their name from the [[ebony]] that they worked into cabinets that were carved in shallow relief and incorporated veneers of [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]] and [[ivory]], a specialty of Paris furniture in the mid-seventeenth century, retained their control over all carcase furniture that was intended to be veneered, often with elaborate [[marquetry]]. The bronze mounts that decorated these high-style case-pieces, from the 1660s to the abolition of guilds in the [[French Revolution]], was furnished, and even carried to the ébéniste's workshop by separate guilds of foundrymen.

French furniture of the [[Ancien Régime]], often characterised by dealers and collectors by reign-names, as "[[Louis Quinze]] furniture", etc., can be seen as representative, even formative, manifestations of broader European styles: French Gothic furniture, of which so little has survived; French Renaissance furniture of the sixteenth century; Early Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIII, comparable to what was produced at Antwerp; sculptural and tectonic High Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIV; Rococo furniture, associated with the [[Régence]] and the reign of Louis XV; and Neoclassical furniture, associated with Louis XVI.

French furniture of the Revolution and the [[First French Empire]] is imbued with a more severe, self-consciously archaeological phase of [[Neoclassicism]], which began to lose its grip on styles in the 1830s, with Gothic and Rococo revivals, leading to the eclecticism of the [[French Second Empire]]. [[Art Nouveau]] provided one form of reaction to the battle of the [[historicism (art)|historicist styles]], and [[Modernism]] marked a more rigorous break with the past. [[Art Deco]] offered a decorative version of Modernism.

Since the Second World War, the manufacture of furniture in France, devolved from the prominence of the capital itself, has been part of the increasingly international world of [[industrial design]].

== i Light Marina Bay 2016: In Praise of Shadows ==
The fourth edition of i Light Marina Bay, held from 4 to 27 March 2016, featured 25 innovative and environmentally sustainable light art installations by creative talents from around the world, including Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, United Kingdom and the USA. Beyond its spectacular showcase of visual art and urban space, the festival also offers a dynamic line-up of events and programmes over four weekends.

=== Theme &amp; Curatorial Team ===
The 2016 theme, “In Praise of Shadows”, challenges the obsession that brighter is better and seeks to reframe [[perception]]s of light and sustainability. The festival invites artists and visitors to re-imagine and reconsider sustainability issues in a new light, and to contemplate upon larger issues of light, beauty and the city in relation to the bigger community.

The curatorial direction was driven by Randy Chan, Principal Architect at Zarch Collaboratives, Singapore and Khairuddin Hori, Deputy Director of Artistic Programming at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

The "Switch Off, Turn Up" Campaign held since the inception of i Light Marina Bay garnered a greater response from buildings around Marina Bay and beyond, with key developments involved including [[Marina Bay Sands]] and [[Marina Bay Financial Centre]]s.

== i Light Marina Bay 2014: Light+HeART ==
The third edition of i Light Marina Bay, themed Light+HeART, returned to Marina Bay from 7 March to 30 March 2014.

In line with the theme, the festival showcased 28 innovative and environmentally sustainable light installations from around the world, transforming the Marina Bay waterfront into a magical space of light and color for the public to celebrate both public spaces and creativity. To promote an environmentally-responsible behavior for a sustainable future, participating artists have incorporated the use of recyclable materials and adopted energy-efficient lighting in the creation of their stunning light art installations.

=== Theme ===
The theme Light+HeART seeks to convey the message that “in the heart of the sustainability matters, is the matter of the heart”.  Through this edition, the festival hopes to create unique, happy and heart-felt installations to delight the audience while driving home the sustainability message.  This edition also saw a greater number of collaborations with the community and schools to form some of the art installations such as The Wishing! Tree and #WEHEARTLIGHT.

i Light Marina Bay 2014 attracted a total of 685,000 local and international visitors over the course of the three-week period.

=== Curatorial Team ===
The festival was curated by ONG&amp;ONG’s:
* Ms Ong Swee Hong
* Mr Andrew Lee
* Mr Tai Lee Siang

=== Programme ===
While art and sustainability take centre stage, i Light Marina Bay 2014 also featured a full array of complementary events and activities, such as free guided tours, educational talks and seminars, sporting activities, bazaars and culinary treats, to create a dazzling, diverse and more enriching experience for all.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch off, Turn up Campaign '' ====
i Light Marina Bay once again conducted the “Switch Off, Turn Up” Campaign, where stakeholders around Marina Bay were invited to switch off non-essential lighting and turn up [[air conditioning]] temperatures whenever possible during the festival period. The energy saving campaign was designed to offset the energy used by the light art installations and associated power use in Asia’s only sustainable light art festival which ran from 7 to 30 March.

52 buildings committed in this third edition to put in place measures to save energy during the festival period. Key developments involved include [[Marina Bay Sands]], [[Marina Bay Financial Centre]], and [[One Fullerton]]. Their participation signified their commitment to play a part in working towards a more sustainable future together. The campaign in 2014 achieved energy savings of 268,890 kWh.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch Off, Turn Up ''Campaign ====
In 2012, the initiative successfully extended its reach well beyond the Marina Bay precinct, with buildings across the island pledging their support.&lt;ref name="Switch Off, Turn Up Campaign"&gt;[http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html "Switch Off, Turn Up" Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414010255/http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html |date=14 April 2012 }} i Light Marina Bay. Retrieved 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign saved more than 200,000 kWh, four times the energy saved in 2010.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt; This equates to 100 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, enough to generate electricity for 762 4-bedroom HDB flats for three-weeks.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ i Light Marina Bay 2012 closed on a successful note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131200446/https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ |date=31 January 2016 }} Adlib Magazine Singapore. 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl.

With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him.

After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as "one of the guys". However, she is stunned when she turns in an article and her teacher still criticizes her work, making Terri realize her gender and looks were never the issue.

At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri "has tits" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.

Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boy's clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad.

Terri returns to her own school. When her article is printed in the newspaper, she receives high praise and finally earns her dream job at the newspaper. Nevertheless, she still finds herself yearning for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom. One day during the summer, Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile and make plans for another date. They decide to go for a drive in Terri's car, but before Buddy can join them, an attractive blonde on a motorcycle rides up and beckons to him with a smile. Buddy then climbs onto the back of her motorcycle, and both couples happily drive away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26079">This page contains a list of the members of the [[Utagawa school]] of Japanese artists, whose members designed paintings and [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] in the [[ukiyo-e]] style from the late [[Edo period]] to the end of the [[Meiji period]].

==Naming ==
The [[art-name]]s of the artists were not produced through a consistent scheme. 

The artists of the second generation generally formed their art-names by taking the first ''[[kanji]]'' of their teacher’s name, and adding a different second ''kanji'' (e.g. [[Utagawa Toyoharu|Toyoharu]], whose student was [[Utagawa Toyohiro|Toyohiro]]). Beginning with the third generation, the names were mainly created by starting with the second ''kanji'' of the teacher’s name, and adding another one to it (e.g. Toyokuni and his student [[Kunisada]]). However, in some cases during this stage the first kanji of the teacher's name was still used for the creation of name (e.g. Toyokuni and [[Utagawa Toyokuni II|Toyoshige]]). Another, rare, variant was the use of the second ''kanji'' of the teacher’s name as the second kanji of the pupil’s name (e.g. Toyohiro and Naohiro).

Occasionally the same art-name would be re-used by different, un-related artists at different times (e.g. Kunichika or Kunihisa). Equally possible was the use of homonymic names – ones which sound the same, but are written with different ''[[kanji]]'' (e.g. Hiromasa (広昌) and Hiromasa (広政)). 

After an event which left a teacher’s name unused, such as their death, retreat from artistic life, or a change in the art-name they used, the former name was often given to a preferred student. Therefore, some names continued to be used, with numbering to distinguish the various holders (e.g. Kuniteru I, II and III). Sometimes these numbers were used by the artists themselves, and sometimes they have been added much later, by people studying the field. 

An especially confusing case is the sequence of holders of the name "Toyokuni". After Toyokuni I's death, the name initially was taken over by his student and adoptive son Toyoshige I. It was not used again until Kunisada I started using it in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Laurance, "Kunisada", pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Kunisada I actually styled himself 'Toyokuni II', ignoring the fact that Toyoshige had already been the second user of the name; he is now uniformly known as 'Toyokuni III', however. His prior art-name, Kunisada, he gave to his son-in-law and adoptive son Kunimasa III, who became now Kunisada II from 1850 onwards. After Kunisada I's death, from about 1870 onwards Kunisada II called himself Toyokuni III (although we now label him Toyokuni IV – the numbering clash caused by Kunisada I's adoption of the name "Toyokuni II" continued to cause confusion), and he handed over the name Kunisada to Kunimasa IV (who thus became Kunisada III). The latter never used the name Toyokuni (although it sometimes alleged that he did so).&lt;ref&gt;Laurance, "Kunisada III", pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The literature now indicates the following consecutive holders of these names (with the names they used given in sequence for each one, and using modern numbering for the users of the name "Toyokuni"): 

* Toyokuni I 
* Toyoshige I / Toyokuni II 
* Kunisada I / Toyokuni III 
* Kunimasa III / Kunisada II / Toyokuni IV 
* Kunimasa IV / Kunisada III / Kōchōrō / Hōsai 

Some names used by Utagawa-school artists were also used by artists from other schools (e.g. Toyonobu, Shigenobu, Kunihiro e.a.), so the art-name alone is not sufficient for identification; the school name has to be added for an exact designation.

==Table explanation==

'''Founder''': Utagawa Toyoharu I (歌川 豊春; 1735–1814) 

The left column contains the names of Toyoharu I's students; below and to the right are the names of their students. This pattern is repeated in turn, for their students. For example, Toyohiro in the first column is the teacher of the artists Hirochika through Toyokuma in the second column, and Hiroshige I in the second column is the teacher of the artists Hirokage through Shigeyoshi in the third column; etc.

If known, lifetime dates are given; if those are not known, the period of artistic activity is given. No data will indicate that the names are listed in literature but no datable artwork has yet been found.

The list also includes the names of several female artists; their names are specially marked. In general they were daughters who were taught to draw by their fathers, and were occasionally allowed to design cartouche images for their fathers' works, which they then signed with her own names. 

This list is not totally complete: artists of the fifth generation are only partially listed, and artists of the sixth generation are omitted entirely. 

About half of the listed names cannot be found in Western literature; the list originates from a Japanese Internet-based project, the ''Ukiyo-e-shi sōran'' (浮世絵師総覧, 'Comprehensive Bibliography of Ukiyo-e Artists').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/kato/yoshio/frame.html ''Ukiyo-e-shi sōran'' (浮世絵師総覧), "Comprehensive Bibliography of Ukiyo-e Artists"] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original cast notes===
Anne Rodgers took part in several workshops for the part of Grandma, but for unknown reasons eventually turned down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3640223/All-singing-all-dancing-all-smoking.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=All-singing, all-dancing, all-smoking | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | date=11 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then offered to [[Ann Emery]], who previously auditioned, and performed it until 2014. On a similar note, [[Jackie Clune]] originally took part in a few workshops for Mrs Wilkinson, but became pregnant before casting was finalised. A few years later she was offered the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427201039/http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |archivedate=27 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of finding the three Billy's  took many months.&lt;ref&gt;West End Programme - Featured Article by Jessica Ronane (Children's Casting Director)&lt;/ref&gt;

(The "final show" dates for the four boys in the show at the end of the original London production are the dates of the "normal" show where their time in the show was celebrated. In the case of Brodie, it was the matinee on the last day, which went ahead as a "normal" show, prior to the magnificent "tag-team" extravaganza in the evening.)

'''Maggie Greenwald''' (born June 23, 1955 in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an American filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Film Directors: An International Bio-Critical Dictionary|last=Foster|first=Gwendolyn Audrey|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Wesport, CT, and London|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2001/06/interview-imagecatcher-the-ballad-of-maggie-greenwald-80923/|title=Interview: Imagecatcher; The Ballad of Maggie Greenwald|last=Feinstein|first=Howard|date=14 June 2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recognized as an independent writer and director, Greenwald’s most notable films include [[Sophie and the Rising Sun (film)|''Sophie and the Rising Sun'']] (2016), starring an ensemble cast that included [[Margo Martindale]], [[Julianne Nicholson]], [[Lorraine Toussaint]] and [[Diane Ladd]], ''[[Songcatcher]]'' (2000) starring [[Aidan Quinn]] and [[Janet McTeer]] and introducing [[Emmy Rossum]], and ''[[The Ballad of Little Jo]]'' (1993), starring Suzy Amis and Ian McKellan. She also directed an adaptation of [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]]'s ''[[The Kill-Off]]'' featuring an ensemble cast that included [[Cathy Haase]] and the film debut of [[Jorja Fox]].

== Career ==
Greenwald’s first feature film, ''Home Remedy'' (1987), from her original screenplay, premiered at the [[Filmfest München|Munich Film Festival]] before screening at the London and [[Torino Film Festival|Torino]] Film Festivals, and opening at the prestigious [[Film Forum]] in New York.

The next film she directed was ''The Kill-Off'' (1990), which she adapted from Jim Thompson’s noir novel of the same name. Acquired by Channel 4 in Britain, and released theatrically by Palace Filmed Entertainment, the film also appeared at film festivals around the world, including: [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] (in Dramatic Competition), Munich (opening night, American Independent section), London, Florence, [[Deauville American Film Festival|Deauville]], [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] and [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh]], before winning the Best Director Award at the Torino Film Festival before its release in the US. The film is listed in the BFI ([[British Film Institute]]) Screen Guides as one of the 100 best American Independent Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls002076513/|title=100 American Independent Films (BFI Screen Guide)|last=|first=|date=24 January 2012|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established Greenwald’s as a significant independent filmmaking voice.

Greenwald went on to write and direct her groundbreaking Western, ''The Ballad of Little Jo'' (1993), which was released worldwide by [[Fine Line Features]] and [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|Polygram Filmed Entertainment]]. Star [[Suzy Amis Cameron|Suzy Amis]] was nominated for an [[Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Award]] while co-star David Chung won the award for Best Supporting Actor. A great deal has been written about the film by scholars of the Western who consider ''The Ballad of Little Jo'' a landmark revisionist film within the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Barry Keith|date=Summer 2015|title=Anti-Oedipus: Feminism, the Western, and the Ballad of Little Jo|url=|journal=CineAction|volume=no. 96|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modleski|first=Tania|date=Winter 1995–96|title=Our Heroes Have Sometimes Been Cowgirls: An Interview with Maggie Greenwald|url=http://fq.ucpress.edu/content/49/2/2|journal=Film Quarterly|volume= 49| issue =  2|pages= 2–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, Jim (1998). “An Exemplary Post-Modern Western: The Ballad of Little Jo,” in ''The Western Reader'', Gregg Rickman and Jim Kitses, eds. New York: Limelight Editions, pp. 223-244.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also one of the primary subjects of Modleski’s ''Old Wives Tales and Other Women’s Stories'', which explores “the phenomenon of female authors and performers who ‘cross-dress’ - women, that is, who are moving into male genres and staking out territory declared off-limits by men and by many feminists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old Wives' Tales and Other Women's Stories|last=Modleski|first=Tania|publisher=NYU Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Greenwald wrote and directed ''Songcatcher'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJHxkRI9op4|title=Leonard Maltin Interviews Songcatcher (2000) director Maggie Greenwald|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unconventional, naturalistic musical, the film premiered in Dramatic Competition at the Sundance Film Festival, where it garnered a Special Jury Award for Ensemble Performance. The film received [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize|the first Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]], Deauville Film Festival Audience Award, two Independent Spirit Award nominations (for actors Emmy Rossum and [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]) and a [[GLAAD Media Award|GLAAD]] Award nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210299/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=Songcatcher (2000) Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwald’s most recent film, ''Sophie and the Rising Sun'' (2016), is based on [[Sophie and the Rising Sun|the novel by Augusta Trobaugh]]. She adapted, produced and directed the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/sundance-2016-women-directors-meet-maggie-greenwald-sophie-and-the-rising-sun-208726/|title=Sundance 2016 Women Directors: Meet Maggie Greenwald – ‘Sophie and the Rising Sun’|last=Martinez|first=Diana|date=20 January 2016|website=IndieWire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/101452-forget-sepia-its-garbage-maggie-greenwald-on-sophie-and-the-rising-sun/#.WME1Yk2Qy70|title="Forget Sepia, It’s Garbage": Maggie Greenwald on Sophie and the Rising Sun|last=Hemphill|first=Jim|date=26 January 2017|website=Filmmaker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival 2016, Salt Lake City Gala World Premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865646033/Sundances-Salt-Lake-City-gala-film-highlights-women-minorities.html|title=Sundance's Salt Lake City Gala Film Highlights Women, Minorities|last=Chen|first=Daphne|date=22 January 2016|website=Deseret News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career, Greenwald has shifted back and forth between directing feature films and directing television. Her numerous TV movies include ''[[What Makes a Family]]'', starring [[Brooke Shields]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Cherry Jones]]. It was produced by [[Barbra Streisand|Barbara Streisand]] and Whoopi Goldberg, with Academy Award winning producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]]. The [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television Channel]] movie went on to win a prestigious GLAAD Award for Outstanding Television Movie and a Humanitas Award. Other TV movies include [[Get a Clue|''Get A Clue'']], starring [[Lindsay Lohan]], ''Tempted'' starring [[Virginia Madsen]], [[Comfort and Joy (2003 film)|''Comfort and Joy'']]'','' Lifetime Television’s Christmas standard, and ''Good Morning, Killer,'' starring [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]], based on [[April Smith (writer)|April Smith]]’s Ana Grey novel.

Recent television episodic work includes Episode 15, Season 3, of [[Madam Secretary (TV series)|''Madam Secretary'']], titled “Break in Democracy,” which aired on March 12, 2017 on [[CBS]] in the US, and was banned in the Philippines for its controversial depiction of a fictional Filipino President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippines-madam-secretary-tv-portrayal-lecherous-leader-response-rodrigo-duterte-a7615716.html|title=Philippines Angered by TV portrayal of Lecherous Leader in Madam Secretary|last=Staff reporter|first=|date=7 March 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her episode of [[Nashville (2012 TV series)|''Nashville'']] will air during the show’s fifth season on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] in 2017.

Earlier forays in directing for episodic television expanded Greenwald’s work to include children’s television. For [[Nickelodeon]] she directed several episodes of [[The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete|''The Adventures of Pete and Pete'']], created the look of the show ''[[The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo]]'', for which she directed six episodes over two seasons. She also directed the non-air pilot for a show that evolved into [[The Backyardigans|''Backyardigans'']] and an episode of ''[[Wildfire]]'' for ABC Family (now [[Freeform (TV channel)#Sale to Disney and rebranding as ABC Family .282001.E2.80.932006.29|Freeform]]).

==Personal life==
Greenwald was formerly married to composer-musician [[David Mansfield]], who scored many of her films (1994-2017). They have two daughters, Maisie (born 1997) and Lulu (born 2000).

Her siblings include author [[Alison Leslie Gold|Alison Leslie Gold,]] poet Ted Greenwal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2016/06/remembering-ted-greenwald-1942-2016/|title=Remembering Ted Greenwald (1942–2016)|last=Staff|first=Harriet|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and garden designer Nancy Greenwald.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborbb.com/nancy|title=The Arbor Bed and Breakfast|last=|first=|date=11 November 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this case, there was another case before the Fourth Circuit, ''[[Washington Redskins|Pro-Football, Inc.]] v. [[Amanda Blackhorse|Blackhorse]]'', 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015) to decide the same issue of whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;DISPARAGING TRADEMARKS: The case of “in re Tam” and its current impact, Potente: A Professional Law Corporation, http://potentelaw.com/disparaging-trademarks-case-re-tam-current-impact/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government Can't Deny Trademarks Over Offensive Names, Appeals Court Rules, NPR, https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/22/460692655/government-cant-deny-trademarks-over-offensive-names-appeals-court-rules&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an attempt by Pro Football to merge the two cases, the Supreme Court refused to grant the motion. 

Section 2(a)'s ban on the federal registration of "immoral" or "scandalous" marks originated in the trademark legislation of the Lanham Act. A disparaging mark is a mark which "dishonors by comparison with what is inferior, slights, deprecates, degrades, or affects or injures by unjust comparison."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Geller'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3330786945440697276&amp;q=808+F.3d+1321&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,41&amp;as_vis=1 751 F.3d 1355], 1358 (2014)(alterations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] is the founder and bassist for the Asian-American dance-rock band [[The Slants]]. Tam named his band The Slants to "reclaim" and "take ownership" of Asian stereotypes. On March 5, 2010, Tam filed his first application to register THE SLANTS. After several appeals, the application was eventually abandoned. On November 14, 2011, Tam filed his second application (App. No. 85/472,044) seeking to register the mark THE SLANTS for "Entertainment in the nature of live performances by a musical band," based on his use of the mark since 2006. The examiner refused to register Tam's mark, finding it likely disparaging to "persons of Asian descent" under § 2(a). The examiner found that the mark likely referred to people of Asian descent in a disparaging way, explaining that the term "slants" had "a long history of being used to deride and mock a physical feature" of people of Asian descent. The examiner found that a substantial composite of persons of Asian descent might find the term offensive&lt;ref name="''id.''"&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; precisely because it was being used by an Asian American band, saying: “Here, the evidence is uncontested that applicant is a founding member of a band that is self described as being composed of members of Asian descent...Thus, the association of the term SLANTS with those of Asian descent is evidenced by how the applicant uses the work - '''as the name of an all Asian-American band.'''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ex-parte-appeal-brief-of-simon-tam-of-th-95764/|title=In re Simon Shiao Tam - Ex Parte Appeal Brief of Simon Tam of the PTO's Refusal to Register THE SLANTS Trademark {{!}} JD Supra|work=JD Supra|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevant Areas of Law ==

=== Lanham Act's Disparaging Provision ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1052|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Viewpoint Discrimination ===

Viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government is not only banning certain content or topics, but certain ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/502/105/case.html 502 U.S. 105], 116 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The test for viewpoint discrimination is “[o]ther things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.”&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/819/case.html 515 U.S. 819], 894 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, viewpoint discrimination involves intent to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Kokinda'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html 497 U.S. 720], 736 (1990) (citing ''Monterey County Democratic Cent. Comm. v. United States Postal Serv.'', [http://openjurist.org/812/f2d/1194/monterey-county-democratic-central-committee 812 F.2d 1194], 1198-1199 (9th Cir. 1987)).&lt;/ref&gt; The general concern being that the government will try to eradicate, not just content from the marketplace, but certain viewpoints—whether positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Tam'', 808 F.3d at 1334-35.&lt;/ref&gt; If something rises to the level of viewpoint-based discrimination, it is deemed to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Comm'r of the Va. Dept. of Motor Vehicles'', [http://openjurist.org/288/f3d/610/sons-of-confederate-veterans-incorporated-griffin 288 F.3d 610], 623 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content Discrimination ===

In ''[[Reed v. Town of Gilbert]]'', the court said that, “Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed v. Town of Gilbert'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-502_9olb.pdf 135 S. Ct. 2218], 2227 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further determined that, “This commonsense meaning of the phrase ‘content based’ requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed'', 135 S. Ct. at 2227 (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2663, 180 L. Ed. 2d
544-55).&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, content-based discrimination is presumptively invalid&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; and if something is found to be discriminating on the basis of content, it must survive strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Pleasant Grove City v. Summum]]'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/460/ 555 U.S. 460], 469 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny ===

According to Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor: “[t]o satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must establish three elements: (1) "the interests the government proffers in support" of the statute must be "properly characterized as 'compelling'"; (2) the statute must "effectively advance [] those interests"; and (3) the statute must be "narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interests asserted."&lt;ref&gt;''Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor'', 582 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing ''Blount v. SEC'', [https://openjurist.org/61/f3d/938 61 F.3d 938], 943, 314 U.S. App. D.C. 52 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Hudson (Intermediate Scrutiny) ===

For ''[[Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission|Central Hudson]]'' to apply, the court would have to determine that the statute at issue deals with commercial speech.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/557/).&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Central Hudson'', the Supreme Court developed a four-part test to determine whether a statute should pass muster.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; The test looks to see: (1) Whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment—for it to fall here, it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) whether the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest—there must be a “reasonable fit” between the government's ends and the means of achieving those ends.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

In order for something to be classified as government speech, the court looks at four factors: (1) the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the literal speaker; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14145695784392572141&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr 112 F. Supp. 3d 439], 460, (E.D. Va. 2015) (citing ''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Vehicles'', 288 F.3d at 618).&lt;/ref&gt;

The central issue before the Federal Circuit was to determine whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and should therefore be voided.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Under the case name ''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015), Circuit Judge Moore decided that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional for various reasons and that Tam should be granted trademark protection on THE SLANTS.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian-American band “The Slants” overturns USPTO rule on “disparaging” trademarks, ARS Technica, https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/federal-circuit-judges-say-rule-against-disparaging-trademarks-is-unconstitutional/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewpoint v. Content-Based Discrimination ===

The court determined that the Lanham Act was viewpoint-based discriminatory because whenever the government chooses to deny trademark protection to a mark, it is doing so because of the message the mark conveys.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government tried to defend their position before the Federal Circuit by saying that they should be able to deny protection to the most "vile" racial epithets and images; however, the Federal Circuit said that "When the government discriminates against speech because it disapproves of the message conveyed by the speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint."&lt;ref&gt;''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S.Ct. at 2664).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Circuit bolstered their stance that it is viewpoint discriminatory because the PTO refused to register "The Slants"; however, the PTO has registered marks such as "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency".&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit found the only difference between marks such as "The Slants" versus "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency" is the messages conveyed. The Slants could be seen as being derogatory towards those of Asian descent versus positive. Since the court determined that the disparaging provision is viewpoint discriminatory, then it is immediately unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

In the alternative, the Federal Circuit determined that the disparaging provision is content-based discriminatory, in addition to viewpoint-discriminatory.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Additionally, the Federal Circuit came to the determination that even though trademarks inherently deal more with commercial speech versus expressive speech, that when the government cancels a mark under the disparaging provision, it is affecting more of the expressive aspects of speech and not the commerciality of it.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit found that if the disparaging provision is not found to be viewpoint discriminatory (in light of a higher court potentially overturning parts of this case) that it must be content-based discriminatory and must survive strict scrutiny unless an exception applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal appeals court decides ‘The Slants’ case: excluding ‘disparaging marks’ from trademark registration violates the First Amendment, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/22/federal-appeals-court-decides-the-slants-case-excluding-disparaging-marks-from-trademark-registration-violates-the-first-amendment/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny v. Intermediate Scrutiny (Central Hudson) ===

The government raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny by way of the ''Central Hudson'' test, because the inherent nature of trademarks are commercial.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; However, the Federal Circuit determined that when the PTO chooses to cancel trademarks under the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, it is usually because of their expressive components and not their commercial components.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit went on to say that commercial speech mixed with expressive speech should be treated as expressive under deciding whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that strict scrutiny should be applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"&gt;Philip G. Hampton, II, Scott Benfield, &amp; Alexander B. Lutzky (January 5, 2016). "Federal Circuit Rules Disparagement Clause of §2(a) of the Lanham Act Unconstitutional". Haynes Boone, [http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Circuit's Analysis under ''Central Hudson'' ====

In the Federal Circuit's effort to show the unconstitutionality of the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, they chose to analyze the provision under the ''Central Hudson'' intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The part of the ''Central Hudson'' test that the Federal Circuit failed the Lanham Act on was the "legitimate Interest" element (See above).

For this element, the government raised three arguments for why they had a legitimate interest:
# The Government argued that they have a legitimate interest to dissociate itself from speech it finds odious. 
# The Government argued that it has a legitimate interest in "declining to expend its resources to facilitate the use of racial slurs as source identifiers in interstate commerce".
# The Government also argued that it has a legitimate interest in allowing States to make their own determinations about whether trademarks should be unenforceable on grounds of public policy.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

The Federal Circuit determined that none of the arguments raised by the government created a legitimate enough interest to pass the ''Central Hudson'' test. Since it does not pass the ''Central Hudson'' test, the Federal Circuit determined that it would also not pass strict scrutiny, since strict scrutiny requires a statute to rise to a higher standard.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Government Subsidy ===

The Government raised the argument that the Lanham Act should be classified as a Government Subsidy and therefore exempt from the strict scrutiny requirement.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit ultimately determined that no taxpayer dollars are used in registering trademarks, that it is completely user-funded in their application fees; therefore, the Federal Circuit determined that this does not fall under the government subsidy exception to strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

The Government also raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is government speech and should therefore fall outside of the purview of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government argues this because of the ability to place the "®" or "TM" on the registered mark.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government found this argument to be without merit.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit said that the only message the government conveys when a mark is registered with the PTO is that "a mark is registered."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The court cited many reasons for their determination, but, most prominently, was a policy consideration.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Court was concerned that if they allowed this argument to win the day, then it would also affect other areas of law, such as Copyright and Patent law.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The general concern being that the government could then control what they would and would not grant protections to and would therefore affect the types of speech expressed; this would have the effect of abridging free speech, which is a violation of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Concurrence by Judge O'Malley ===

In addition to agreeing with Circuit Judge Moore's opinion, Judge O'Malley added that she believes the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional under the vagueness doctrine too.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Part Concurrence &amp; Part Dissent by Judge Dyk ===

Circuit Judge Dyk generally agrees with the opinion of the majority in that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional; however, in his view, the majority err in going "beyond the facts of this case and holding the statute facially unconstitutional as applied to purely commercial speech."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Dyk also believed that many trademarks lack expressive characteristics that would merit First Amendment protection and therefore the analysis should be under the ''Central Hudson'' test and not strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Lourie ===

Judge Lourie disagreed with the majority in many ways outlined below:
* Judge Lourie argued that the Lanham Act has dated back 70 years, it has been continuously applied during that time and it now being found to be unconstitutional seems bizarre.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Lourie cites to ''stare decisis'' as the first reason why the majority made a mistake.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eriq Gardner (December 22, 2015). "Rock Band Wins First Amendment Appeal Over 'Disparaging' Trademarks". Hollywood Reporter, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689 http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, Judge Lourie said that denial of an applicant's trademark does not deny their right to speak freely.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Contending that the mark holder may still generally use the mark as it wishes; without federal registration, "it simply lacks access to certain federal statutory enforcement mechanisms for excusing others from confusingly similar uses of the mark."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;
* Judge Lourie also said that there are other ways for the mark holder to have protections, including common law rights.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent Kendall (December 22, 2015). "Government Can’t Reject Trademarks for Being Offensive, Court Says". Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668 https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finally, Judge Lourie also determined that trademarks are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Reyna ===

Judge Reyna disagreed with the majority in the sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the ''Central Hudson'' test and intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a legitimate interest in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the legitimate interest of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that it makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

The United States Patent and Trademark Office appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the following question in its petition for [[certiorari]]: "whether the disparagement provision in 15 U.S.C. 1052(a) is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment"?&lt;ref&gt;''Lee v.

The '''Melun Diptych''' is a two-panel oil painting by the French court painter [[Jean Fouquet]] (1425–1480) created around 1452. The name of the diptych came from its original home in the [[Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame, Melun|Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame]] in [[Melun]]. The left panel depicts [[Etienne Chevalier]] with his patron saint [[St. Stephen]] and the right panel depicts the Virgin and Christ child surrounded by cherubim. Each wooden panel measures about 93 by 85 centimeters and the two would have been hinged together at the center. The two pieces, originally a diptych, are now separated. The left panel now resides in the [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin and the right panel is now located at the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]], Belgium. A self-portrait medallion is also associated with the two panels. Measuring 6 centimeters in diameter, it would have adorned the frame, and consists of copper, enamel, and gold. The medallion is now located in the Louvre in Paris, France.

==Description of the left panel==

On the left Étienne Chevalier, the treasurer to [[Charles VII of France|King Charles VII]] of France, kneels in a red robe with in his hand in a position of prayer. The king liked to have non-aristocrats such as Chevalier about him because he thought them more reliable than nobles. On his right is Chevalier's patron saint, St. Stephen, in a dark deacon's robes with gold trim. His right arm is draped across Chevalier's shoulder while his left hand holds a book and a jagged rock, his representational attribute as he was stoned to death.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 7:58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men gaze off to the right as if they were looking at the Virgin and child on the other panel. The wall behind the treasurer and his patron saint is inlaid with marble panels and has elaborate white and gold moldings. The tiled floor's neutral colors create a stark contrast with the saturated colors of the men's robes. Identifying Chevalier is an engraving on the wall behind him that says "IER ESTIEN". This lettering has been used to link the painting to Fouquet since he never signed any of his work. It is very similar to lettering used in several miniatures which are attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, The Life of Christ and His Mother, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the right panel==
Seated on an elaborate gold throne, the Madonna and the Christ child are depicted in the right panel. The Madonna wears a blue dress, white mantle and a jewel-encrusted crown. On her lap sits the child, who makes a pointing gesture to the left with His left hand at the patron and the saint. The two are surrounded by blue and red cherubim, which greatly contrast with the pale skin of the Virgin and child. Although the figures are modeled realistically, the mood is otherworldly, described by historian Roger Fry as a dreamlike state of sentimentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, "Exhibition of French Primitives," 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The Madonna is depicted here as the Queen of Heaven and is meant to reveal her as between the veil of heaven and earth. She is both human and otherworldly.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hagen57"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The unnatural colors have been attributed to represent the heraldic colors of the king, being red, white, and blue.&lt;ref name="hagen56"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
	The Virgin is believed to be an idealized portrait of [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress of King Charles VII, who died two years earlier. Sorel was considered by many at the time to be "the most beautiful woman in the world" and therefore an obvious choice after which to model the Virgin.&lt;ref name="hagen56" /&gt; As minister of finance to the king, Etienne Chevalier was the executor of her will.&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, "Chevalier, Etienne."&lt;/ref&gt; Her costume and physical attributes have been compared to other representations of Sorel, such as another painting by Fouquet in which her dress is very similar to that in the diptych. It has also been suggested that the woman could be Chevalier's wife, Catherine Bude, over whose tomb the diptych was hung in Notre Dame, Melun.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;Schaefer, "Fouquet, Jean."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the medallion==
The original frame was covered in blue velvet with silver and gold embroidery, antique love knots, and pearls. It also included a self-portrait medallion of Jean Fouquet. Fouquet is shown frontally, his gold image is engraved into the black enamel background and framed by his name. It is believed that he invented this technique. The original position of the diptych high above the tomb would have made it difficult to see the tiny medallion and since the pieces have since been separated, its exact position on the frame is unclear. The medallion was Fouquet's way of signing the diptych. It is traditionally recognized as the oldest self-signed self-portrait and is Fouquet's only signed work.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;

== Background==
Much information about Fouquet's life is obscure. The artist was born in 1420 in Tours, France. He traveled to Rome in 1446 for two years as part of a French delegation. Fouquet was employed by Charles VII and Louis XI and was called "peintre du roi" meaning painter to the king. He was called upon to create portraits, manuscript illuminations, altarpieces, ephemeral decorations, and sculptural designs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Reynolds, "Jean Fouquet, Musée du Louvre", ''Burlington Magazine'' 123, no. 981 (May 1981): 324.&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have traveled to Florence and Venice where he studied the work of contemporary Italian masters. This influence can be seen in the Melun Diptych as it has been suggested that the background of the left panel is an Italian courtyard in empirical perspective, not unlike [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s method. In contrast to the Madonna and child panel, which lacks perspective completely, the background behind Chevalier and St. Stephen extends deep into space in a truly Italian style. The figures are also clear and modeled realistically in the Italian style as opposed to his native French.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, "Fouquet, Jean.".&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the right panel, the figures are so smooth they appear to be polished. This effect enhances the otherworldly aspects of this panel, in contrast to the very realistic rendering of the left panel. Etienne Chevalier commissioned the Melun Diptych to hang over his wife's tomb. Chevalier had a close relationship with Fouquet and was his main patron during his time as treasurer to the king.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; The diptych was hung above Catharine Bude's tomb.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; This has caused controversy over whether a third panel is now lost. Some scholars believe it may have formed part of a triptych of which the third panel would have depicted Chevalier's wife since it was meant to be hung above her tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, ''The Life of Christ and His Mother'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have tied the two different existing panels into a more cohesive piece. Others believe this is not the case. A report from Denys Godefroy who saw the piece in its original context in 1660, and is therefore the most reputable source available today, does not describe a third panel.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;

Until 1775, the diptych remained in the church of Notre Dame in Melun. In need of funds for restoration, the cathedral chapter decided to sell the panels. The right panel was purchased by the mayor of Antwerp and has remained in the city since 1840. The left panel was purchased by [[Clemens Brentano]], a German poet, and joined his collection in 1896.&lt;ref name="hagen57" /&gt; The halves have been reunited twice since their separation, the first time in 1904 when France borrowed the panels from Berlin for an exhibition of French primitives&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, The Ephemeral Museum, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second time in 2017, for the Jean Fouquet exhibition at [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie in Berlin]].

The '''Newington Butts Theatre''' was one of the earliest [[Elizabethan theatre]]s, possibly predating even [[The Theatre]] of 1576 and the [[Curtain Theatre]], which are usually regarded as the first dedicated playhouses in London. William Ingram believes it was probably the first of the three to begin construction, and may have been the first completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London | first=William | last=Ingram | publisher = Cornell University Press | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-8014-2671-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0PqSqgTWVEC&amp;pg=PA150 | page= 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and in 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.&lt;ref name=Ordish&gt;{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page= 30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell (in Shoreditch) and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at Newington near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields.&lt;ref name=Ordish /&gt; The Newington theatre was located not on Newington Butts but on the east side of Walworth Road near the junction with New Kent Road.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;{{citation | title=Survey of London Volume 25 – St George's Fields, the Parishes of St. George the Martyr Southwark and St. Mary, Newington | first=Ida | last=Darlington | publisher=London County Council | year=1955 | url=https://archive.org/details/surveyoflondon25londuoft | pages= 83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The playhouse stood less than an acre of land in Lurklane, occupying {{convert|48|yards}} of frontage on what became Walworth Road and bounded to the south by a drainage ditch (or "sewer" in the language of the time).&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 157–158 Ingram has a general map on page  151 and a more detailed map on p 161&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram uses Commissions of Sewers records of 1576–1578 to deduce that the actor Jerome Savage lived adjacent to the sewer and thus the playhouse was in the northern part of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; The Reliance Building used to occupy the site;&lt;ref name=Survey /&gt; it is now under the southern roundabout of the Elephant and Castle junction.

Lurklane was {{convert|10|acre}} out of {{convert|35|acre}} leased in 1566 from the [[Dean of Canterbury|Dean and Chapter]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by Richard Hick(e)s. Hicks was a [[Worshipful Company of Grocers|grocer]] and member of the royal retinue, sometimes described as a "yeoman of the guard".&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 153–157 discusses Hicks in detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks sublet Lurklane to Jerome Savage on or about Lady Day (25 March) 1576, some three weeks before the lease was signed for [[The Theatre]] in [[Shoreditch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) p 164&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon after the 1576 lease was signed, Hicks and his son-in-law Peter Hunningborne tried to rescind it. They failed to do so through the courts, but used trickery to make Savage default on his rent on Lady Day 1577.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Savage appears to have stayed on the premises, and in turn sought the protection of the law as Hunningborne sought to move into Savage's residence.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram (1992) pp 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Hunningborne described Savage as "a verrie lewed fealowe" who "liveth by noe other trade than playinge of staige plaies and Interlevdes".&lt;ref name=Ingram168&gt;Ingram (1992) p 168&lt;/ref&gt; However the sewer assessments indicate that Savage remained on the premises, so the lawsuit may have been withdrawn or settled out of court.&lt;ref name=Ingram168 /&gt;

Wickham ''et al'' interpret these documents to mean that Hicks constructed a 'house or tenement' that someone (presumably the actor Savage) converted into a playhouse.&lt;ref name=Wickham321&gt;{{citation | title= English professional theatre, 1530–1660 | first1=Glynne William | last1=Gladstone Wickham| first2=Herbert | last2=Berry | first3=William | last3=Ingram | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-23012-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y82YJ1P5gksC&amp;pg=PA321 | page= 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was clearly established by Lady Day 1577 and like the Theatre may have been in use before the winter of 1576/77,&lt;ref name=Ingram170&gt;Ingram (1992) p 170&lt;/ref&gt; or even in 1575.&lt;ref name=Wickham320&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p 320&lt;/ref&gt; Savage may have built the theatre under the patronage of the [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] whose company of actors first performed at court on 14 February 1575.&lt;ref name=Wickham320/&gt; Warwick had been appointed to the Privy Council in the autumn of 1573, and the more powerful privy councillors – the earls of [[Sussex's Men|Sussex]], [[Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Arundel]] and his younger brother [[Leicester's Men|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] – were all patrons of playing companies.&lt;ref name=Ingram172&gt;Ingram (1992) p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Warwick's company appears to have flourished for around five years,&lt;ref name=Ingram172 /&gt; before ill-health forced him to retire to his home in Herfordshire. On 13 May 1580 the Privy Council wrote to the Surrey justices about an unknown company playing at Newington Butts despite a ban on theatre.&lt;ref name=Ingram174&gt;Ingram (1992) p 174&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that John and Lawrence Dutton led members of Warwick's company to reform as the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]'s players by April 1580, and Ingram speculates that it was they who were playing at their old home.&lt;ref name=Ingram174 /&gt;  Oxford was sent to the [[Tower of London]] in 1581, banished from court until 1 June 1583&lt;ref&gt;Historical Manuscripts Commission, The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland, i, p.  150&lt;/ref&gt; and went off to war in Flanders in 1585. John Dutton left for the newly formed [[Queen's Men]] in 1583 but Oxford's Men survived the loss of their leader, being recorded in each year 1584–1587 and leaving traces of activity thereafter.&lt;ref name=Ingram175&gt;Ingram (1992) p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

A sewer record of 26 February 1591 refers to Hunningborne and the playhouse.&lt;ref name=Ingram176&gt;Ingram (1992) p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By that time it seems to have been in decline, as more theatres sprung up closer to London. Some time in the early 1590s (and definitely before September 1593) [[Lord Strange's Men]] played three days there, but the undated Privy Council document comments on the inconvenience of its location and "of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working daies".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Elizabethan stage |year=1923 | first=Edmund Kerchever | last=Chambers | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethanstage04chamuoft | pages= 312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plague closed down London's theatres for most of the period between 22 June 1592 and 14 May 1594.&lt;ref name=Wickham328&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p 328&lt;/ref&gt; The impresario [[Philip Henslowe]] took the opportunity to remodel his [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], but for some reason the Privy Council kept it closed from 16 May to 15 June 1594.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt;

Accordingly Henslowe promoted a series of plays at Newington Butts from 3–13 June 1594 with the [[Admiral's Men]] and [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], the two companies that had emerged from Lord Strange's men during the layoff.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt; The nature of Henslowe's relationship with Newington Butts is uncertain, Vickers among others has suggested Henslowe owned it by this time&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | first=Brian | last= Vickers | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwpUt5qY8sEC&amp;pg=PA149 | page= 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Wickham ''et al'' speculate that the poor profits he recorded for the season were in part due to the cost of renting the theatre.&lt;ref name=Wickham328 /&gt; The ownership theory might be bolstered by Winifred Frazer's suggestion that the enigmatic abbreviation 'ne' used by Henslowe in his records of certain plays, conventionally taken to mean a new play, applies to a performance at Newington.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Henslowe's 'ne' | first=Winifred | last=Frazer | journal=Notes &amp; Queries | volume=38 | year=1991 | pages= 34–35 | doi=10.1093/nq/38.1.34 | url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/1/34.full.pdf+html | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This season of plays in June 1594 is well documented, as Henslowe kept assiduous records in his "Diary".&lt;ref&gt;The June 1594 season was as follows : 3rd ''Hester and [[Ahasuerus]]'', 4th ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'', 5th ''[[Titus Andronicus|Andronicus]]'', 6th ''Cutlack'' (since lost), 7th (no show), 8th ''Bellendon'' (since lost), 9th ''[[Hamlet]]'', 10th ''Hester'', 11th ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]'', 12th ''Andronicus'', 13th ''The Jew''&lt;/ref&gt; These include some of the earliest known performances of familiar names such as ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]''&lt;!--note, not "The" Shrew --&gt; but in each case the exact relationship between the 1594 plays and those we know as [[Shakespeare]]'s is uncertain and controversial among scholars. Rutter regards the ''Titus'' put on by Henslowe at the Rose in January 1594 as "almost certainly Shakespeare's",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Documents of the Rose Playhouse |first=Carol Chillington | last= Rutter | publisher = Manchester University Press | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7190-5801-1 | page= 78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGzoae4J55sC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is very early for the ''Hamlet'' of the [[Second Quarto]] and [[First Folio]], which is ascribed to around 1600.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez&gt;{{citation | title=A synoptic Hamlet: a critical-synoptic edition of the second quarto and first folio texts of Hamlet | first=Jesús | last=Tronch-Pérez | publisher=Universitat de València | year=2002  | isbn=978-84-370-5381-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlKm5SqMCD0C&amp;pg=PA26 | page= 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other evidence has led to the theory that the 1600 text is based on an earlier play, the so-called "''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''", which was written by either Thomas Kyd, Shakespeare, or someone else.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez /&gt; This performance is the first one on record of Ur-Hamlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Oral traditions and gender in early modern literary texts | first1=Mary Ellen | last1=Lamb | first2=Karen | last2=Bamford | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7546-5538-1 |page= 133 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmqsi_wRK34C&amp;pg=PA133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it appears to have existed since at least 1589.&lt;ref name=Tronch-Perez /&gt;

On 6 July 1594 the Dean and Chapter let the playhouse site to Paul Buck, on condition that he convert the playhouse to other uses and that no more plays were performed after [[Michaelmas]] (29 September).&lt;ref name=Ingram176 /&gt; Buck seems to have complied – there is no mention of the playhouse in the renewal of his lease on 5 April 1595, and on 5 October 1599 the Sewer Commission refers to "the houses where the old playe house did stand att Newington".&lt;ref name=Ingram176 /&gt; The theatrical links lingered after the theatre was gone; a bad pun is referred to as a "Newington conceit" in a play of 1612&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (1923) vol 2 p 405, referring to [[Nathan Field|Field]]'s ''[[A Woman is a Weathercock]]'' III. iii. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and the playwright [[Thomas Middleton]] died there and was buried at Newington Butts church on 4 July 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Cambridge History of English Literature 6, Part 2: The Drama to 1642, Volume 6 | first1= Alfred Rayney | last1=Waller | first2=Adolphus William | last2=Ward | publisher = CUP Archive | year=1920 | isbn=978-0-521-04520-9 | page= 58 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTc8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Online music education''' is a recent development in the field of [[music education]] consisting of the application of new technologies associated with [[distance learning]] and [[online education]] for the purpose of teaching and learning music in an [[online]] environment mediated by [[computers]] and the [[internet]].

The origins of online music education may be traced to the use of technologies to supplement face-to-face learning in traditional classroom settings, however in recent years it has expanded to include the offering of entire degree programs – even [[doctoral degree]]s – online.  

The rise of technologies leading to the development of online music education is well documented, and  such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007). Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon &amp; Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007). It is likely that more studies will be seen in this high-growth area in the coming years.

== Institutions offering online music education ==
The following is a partial list of North American institutions that offer online degree programs in [[music education]]:

*[[Boston University College of Fine Arts]]
*[[University of Florida College of the Arts]]
*[[University of Georgia]]
*[[Rutgers University]] [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]]
*[[Auburn University]]
*[[Duquesne University]] [[Mary Pappert School of Music]]
*[[Ohio University]]
*[[University of South Florida]]
*[[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]
*[[Kent State University]]
*[[Stephen F. Austin State University]]
*[[University of Southern Mississippi]]
*[[East Carolina University]]

The most common degree offered online in this subject area is a Master of Music, although one institution also offers a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degree. As of mid-2008, one institution - Boston University - has over 800 online graduate students in music education.

Writers Contest''' in 2009 as a continuation from its predecessor called '''Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest'''&lt;ref name="relaunch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aronowitz|first=Scott|title=PBS Kids Go Launches National Writing Contest|url=http://thejournal.com/articles/2009/11/10/pbs-kids-go-launches-national-writing-contest.aspx|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=THE Journal|date=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was started in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Rainbow|url=http://www.skooldays.com/categories/saturday/sa1726.htm|publisher=Skooldays|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
In 1995, the first competition was launched by the creators of [[Reading Rainbow]] children television program. The annual competition had been sponsored to compliment the Reading Rainbow program to inspire children to have a lifelong love of reading. The competition encouraged, challenged and rewarded children to write and illustrate their own [[picture book]]s. The entries were submitted to the local stations for local judging. The winners at local level would then be submitted for national-level judging.

After a few years, the number of entries that were submitted nationally had been increased to almost 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=READING RAINBOW|url=http://www.wned.org/Productions/ReadingRainbow/default.asp|publisher=WNED Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest|url=http://www.wviz.org/rainbow/1998/index.htm|publisher=WVIZ Station|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of participants continued to increase at the peak in 2007 with more than 50,000 entries.&lt;ref name="2007national"&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Winners Announced!|url=http://www.aptv.org/rr/2007winners.asp|publisher=Alabama Public Television|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading Rainbow funding==
The future of the competition became questionable starting in 2006 when the funding for the Reading Rainbow program started to dry up. There was a new funding agreement but no new program had been produced since April 2006 when the commitment for funding of 52 new episodes did not pan out. The program was on a [[rerun]] since then by another funding source.&lt;ref name="getler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Getler|first=Michael|title=End of the Rainbow|url=https://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/2009/09/end_of_the_rainbow_1.html|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite news|last=Drury|first=Tracey|title=WNED's Reading Rainbow fades to black|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2009/08/24/daily38.html?page=all|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=The Business Journals|date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This funding issue caused the creators to cancel the national-level competition in 2006. However, the local competitions organized by local [[PBS|public broadcasting stations]] continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Reading Rainbow contest must go on|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060128&amp;slug=readingrainbow28|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=28 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the participants of the competition continued to grow into 2007 even without any new episode of Reading Rainbow, the [[WNED-TV]] station in [[Buffalo, New York]] which was a co-creator of the program took ownership to administrate the national-level judging. The national-level competition resumed in 2007.&lt;ref name="2007national"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monty|first=Lynn|title=Vermont Public Television "PBS Kids Go!

At that time, the level of participation in the competition was still high with 90 participating stations.&lt;ref name="biz"/&gt; With a strong call for expansion of the competition despite the cancellation of the program, the PBS headquarters arranged to have the winning entries to continue to be accessible online as they had been until December 2009.&lt;ref name="getler"/&gt;

==Relaunch==
In November 2009, PBS secured its partnership with WNED-TV to launch the competition in the same format as in prior years but with the new name as ''[[PBS Kids Go!]] Writers Contest''. They also launched a new website for the competition to update information and archive winning stories.&lt;ref name="relaunch"/&gt; In 2014, one year after the discontinuation of PBS Kids Go!, [[PBS]] changed the name of the Writers Contest to the ''PBS Kids Writers Contest''.

==Format==
Children who are in grades K through 3 within the viewing areas of participate local stations can submit their entries to their local stations. Stories can be fact or fiction, and prose or poetry but each story must be done by single author. Stories with the illustrations done by kindergarten and first grade have word count of 50-200 words, and 100-350 words for grades 2 and 3. Each local PBS station handles local judging separately by grade levels. The first place winners from each station are sent to the national contest later in the year.

'''''Pastoral Pleasure''''' (French - ''Le Plaisir pastoral'') is a c.1714-1716 [[fête galante]] painting by [[Jean Antoine Watteau]], now in the [[musée Condé]] in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=00000076655|title=JOCONDE entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://srv225.hosteur.com/musee/conde02/voir.xsp?id=00101-4064&amp;qid=sdx_q0&amp;n=7&amp;e=|title=Museum catalogue entry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Watteau paintings survive with extremely similar compositions - the largest and most finished is ''[[The Shepherds (Watteau)|The Shepherds]]'' ([[Schloss Charlottenburg]]), whilst another seems to be a reworking of the Charlottenburg painting (Wildenstein collection). [[Pierre Rosenberg]] argues that the Chantilly version was an oil sketch for the Charlottenburg work. Three other copies of the Chantilly version appeared in 19th and 20th century auctions, but their locations are now unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 149-151 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chantilly work belonged to [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], a great Watteau collector - it is mentioned as being in his house from at least 1729, around which time [[Nicolas-Henri Tardieu]] made an engraving after it. On 1 February 1775 it was sold after Mariette's death. According to Edmond Goncourt, it was resold in Paris on 11 May 1789, entering the marquis de Maison's collection, which was acquired in its entirety by the [[Henri d'Orléans (1822-1897)|duc d'Aumale]] in 1868 whilst in exile in the United Kingdom. After moving back to France he hung the work in his [[château de Chantilly]], where it still hangs in the [[musée Condé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 149 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
It shows French aristocrats dressed as shepherds - one couple dances to the right and a young couple court each other on a balcony to the left. The painting also includes real peasants in simpler clothes and with simpler gestures, making it easier to distinguish between them and the aristocrats than in other Watteau paintings such as ''The Shepherds''.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wyngaard, "Switching Codes: Class, Clothing, and Cultural Change in the Works of Marivaux and Watteau", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, vol. 33, no. 4, Summer 2000, p. 523-541&lt;/ref&gt; Several details are directly inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s paintings - the musician, the man next to him, the shepherd embracing the woman next to him and the dog in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nicole Garnier-Pelle, ''Chantilly, musée Condé. Peintures du xviiie siècle'', Réunion des musées nationaux, coll. « Inventaire des collections publiques de France » (no 38), 1995, 222 p. (OCLC 300738204), p. 151 (notice 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7768">[[File:Mice-burying-the-cat.jpg|thumb|''The Mice are burying the Cat'', a 1760s Russian [[lubok]] hand-coloured woodcut. It probably originally dates from the reign of [[Peter the Great]], but this impression probably dates from c. 1766.  Possibly a satire on Peter's reforms, or just a representation of carnivalesque inversion, "turning the world upside down".]]

'''Popular prints''' is a term for [[printing|printed]] images of generally low artistic quality which were sold cheaply in Europe and later the New World from the 15th to 18th centuries, often with text as well as images. They were some of the earliest examples of [[mass media]]. After about 1800, the types and quantity of images greatly increased, but other terms are usually used to categorise them.

== 15th century ==
[[File:Zehen eygenschaft des altters der menschen BM 1872 0608 351.jpg|thumb|left|''The Seven Ages of Man'', German, 1482, [[British Museum]]]]
From about 1400, there began a "visual revolution that inundated Europe with images during the fifteenth century" (Field) as the [[woodcut]] technique was applied to [[paper]], which was now manufactured in Christian Europe, instead of being imported from Islamic Spain. In the 15th century, the great majority of these images were religious, if [[playing card]]s are excluded. They were sold at churches, fairs and places of pilgrimage. Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by [[stencil]].  One political [[cartoon]] relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later).  [[Old master print]] is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints. 

Although early information as to prices is almost non-existent, it is clear from a number of sources that small [[woodcut]]s were affordable by at least the urban working-class, and much of the [[peasant]] class as well.

During the middle of the century, the quality of the images became typically very low, but there was an improvement towards the end, partly because it was necessary to keep pace with the quality of images in [[engraving]]s. [[Engraving]]s were always much more expensive to create, as they needed greater skill to create the plate, which would last for far fewer impressions than a [[woodcut]]. They did not come into the popular prints category until the 19th century, when different techniques made them much cheaper.

== 16th century ==
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Von einem schrecklichen und wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M D LXXViJ Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat - 000003593.jpg|thumb|[[Great Comet of 1577|Der Große Komet]] über [[Prague|Prag]], 12. November 1577, [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]]]]

Broadsheets, also known as broadsides, were a common format. They were usually single sheets of paper of various sizes, typically sold by street-vendors. Another format was the [[chapbook]], usually a single sheet cut or folded to make a small pamphlet or book. In Spain there were ''[[pliego]]''s, in Portugal the ''[[papel volante]]'', and in other countries other names. These covered a great variety of material, including pictures, popular history, political comment or [[satire]], news, [[almanac]]s (from c.   1470), poems and songs.  They could be very influential politically, and were often subsidized by political factions for propaganda purposes.  See [[Broadside (music)]] for their musical use.  The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] hugely increased the market for satirical and polemical prints in all counties affected. In [[France]] the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], and in England the [[English Civil War]] and the political convulsions after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] all produced huge quantities of propaganda and polemic, in images as well as text.

Despite being often issued in large numbers, their survival rate was extremely low, and they are now very rare, with most having not survived at all.  This has been demonstrated by analysis of the records of the [[London]] Stationers Company from 1550 onwards; some blocks were in print for over a century with no copies now surviving.  They were very commonly pasted to the walls of rooms.  Paper was still sufficiently expensive that all available spare pieces tended to be used in the toilet. One of the biggest surviving collections with 439 prints is [[Wickiana]] at the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]].

== After 1600 ==
[[Image:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray]]'s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in danger]]'' (1805),  which caricatured [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], was voted the most famous of all UK political cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br J Rev |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=59–64 |author= Preston O |title= Cartoons... at last a big draw |doi=10.1177/0956474806064768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library of Congress]]]]

Newspapers began in the early 17th century, as an upmarket and expensive form of broadsheet (still a [[broadsheet|term]] for a large-format newspaper).  The first in English came in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003170056/http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this century [[book]]s also became much cheaper, and began to replace some types of popular print.  These trends continued during the next century, and although most of the traditional types of popular print lived on until the 19th century or beyond, they were by then part of a much wider print culture, and the term is generally not used of them. One type of publication continuing into the 20th century is the [[Brazil]]ian ''[[cordel literature]]'' ("string literature" - it is hung on strings by the sellers) that continue to use woodcuts, and is part of a continuous tradition going back to the Portuguese ''[[papel volante]]'' of the 17th century. [[Lubok]] prints in [[Russia]] were another local variant.

Political [[caricature]] prints for sale as single sheets are found as early as the 15th century, but reached the peak of their popularity in much of Europe in the 18th and early 19th century, before the form migrated into newspapers and magazines. Above all they were popular in England, where a high degree of [[freedom of the press]] meant that dedicated print-shops, often also acting as the publishers, could openly sell and display scathing images of the Royal Family and government politicians, a business that had to remain "under the counter" in much of Europe.

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style of architecture]] was introduced in [[Architecture of Portugal|Portugal]] between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century. In general, Portuguese cathedrals have a heavy, fortress-like appearance, with crenellations and few decorative elements apart from portals and windows. Portuguese Romanesque cathedrals were later extensively modified, among others the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]], although it only had some minor changes.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological and geographical distribution of Romanesque buildings in [[Portugal]] are intimately connected with the territorial organization emerging from the [[Reconquista]], being the fundamental reason for the differences between a locally influenced artistical phenomenon in the North of the country and a more "international" kind in buildings like [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] Cathedrals.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanesque architecture first developed in Minho and Douro regions (with [[Braga Cathedral]] being its reference) spreading later southwards to Coimbra. It is in the rural areas of the northwest and center regions that Romanesque buildings are more concentrated, being more dense in the margins of rivers Douro and Mondego.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in areas that had been recently added to Portuguese territory, thus more open to foreign influence, places where royal and ecclesiastical sponsorship were stronger, where French monastical communities settled in and foreign artists produced their works (like [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]]), that we find the most artistically complete forms of Romanesque. As it expanded it became more local, mixing with earlier regional construction techniques and solutions.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque building construction activity gained pace after 1095, when [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] took possession of the [[County of Portugal]]. Count Henry came with noblemen and Benedictine monks from the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], which was headed by Henry's brother, [[Hugh of Cluny|Hugh]]. The Benedictines and other religious orders ended up giving great impulse to Romanesque architecture in Portugal during the whole 12th century.
Examples of those rural monastical and parish churches, most of them built in the 9th and 10th centuries with late High Middle Ages artistical features and before the expansion of Romanesque architecture, are the [[Monastery of Rates]], one of the best iconographical buildings of this style in Portugal, the churches of Paço de Sousa Monastery, [[Igreja de Santa Maria de Airães|Santa Maria de Airães]] and the [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|Monastery of São Pedro de Ferreira]], among others.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their communities first followed the Benedictine rule but were later deeply influenced by the monastical reforms in the 11th century, mainly the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]], reflected in the adoption of newly Romanesque architectural features, creating some very regional and rich decorative and architectural solutions.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Romanesque architecture: The Mozarabic art==

[[Image:Castro de avelas 08.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Apse of Castro de Avelãs Monastery, a mix of Mozarabic and Asturian-Leonese style.]]
[[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] refers not only to the artistic style of [[Mozarabs]] (from musta'rab meaning "Arabized"), Iberian [[Christian]]s living in [[Al-Andalus]] who adopted some Arab customs without converting to Islam, preserving their religion and some ecclesiastical and judicial autonomy, but also to those same communities that migrated north to the [[Reconquista|Christian Kingdoms]], bringing with them an architectural phenomenon in which Christian and Islamic artistic elements were fused together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mozarabs in Medieval and Early Modern Spain: Identities and Influences|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CPAopjXXF4AC|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9780754663140|first = Richard|last = Hitchcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mozarabic communities maintained for the practice of their religious rites some of the Visigothic churches predating the Islamic occupation, the extent of this Visigothic artistical heritage is hard to pinpoint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.pt/books?id=WdXQnaME1gMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=The+art+of+Medieval+Portugal&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mozarabic%20architecture&amp;f=false|title = Art of the frontier: Mozarabic Monasticism|date = |accessdate = |website = The Art of Medieval Spain, A.D. 500-1200|publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as most monuments from the previous period have been lost. Nevertheless, those buildings that did survive seem to hold on tenaciously to traditions of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] architecture with few, if any, [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] features. All this includes them in the ample concept of [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]]. Besides this possible Visigothic connection, Mozarabic architecture in Portugal also came in contact with [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]], identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century specifically in the territories that comprised the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Novos elementos sobre a arte moçárabe em território português|url = https://www.academia.edu/462174/Novos_elementos_sobre_a_arte_mo%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A1rabe_em_territ%25C3%25B3rio_portugu%25C3%25AAs|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this artistic activity, in general (and architecture specifically) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed the whole northern peninsula and continued during the next century.

[[Image:PM 33274 P Lourosa.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Central nave of the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa (Coimbra)]]

The most exceptional example of Mozarabic architecture in [[Portugal]] is the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DGPC {{!}} Pesquisa Geral|url = http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70268/|website = www.patrimoniocultural.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Igreja de São Pedro de Lourosa faz 1100 anos: é uma das mais antigas de Portugal e a «única» do período moçárabe {{!}} Secretariado Nacional da Pastoral da Cultura|url = http://www.snpcultura.org/igreja_sao_pedro_lourosa_faz_1100_anos.html|website = www.snpcultura.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Coimbra]]. There is no doubt that this rural church was founded sometime around 912 AD (950 by the [[Spanish era|Era of Caesar]], corresponds to 912 by [[Anno Domini|Christian Era]]) according to an authentic inscription found in one of the transept arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.snpcultura.org/fotografias/igreja_sao_pedro_lourosa/3.jpg|title = Inscription found in São Pedro de Lourosa church that points to the date of its construction.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a number of Asturian references to the church's engravings, the influences of the architectural models favoured by the Mozarabs are clearly visible in the modulation of the masonry and mainly in the decorative elements of the cornices (use of the [[Alfiz]]) and the design of [[horseshoe arch]]es, typical of Mozarabic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A igreja de São Pedro de Lourosa - Oliveira do Hospital|url = https://saopedrodelourosa.no.sapo.pt/mocarabeartes.htm|website = saopedrodelourosa.no.sapo.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its basilican type structure comprises a small transept separating the chancel from the main body of the building (called a [[Narthex]]), and a row of three surmounted arches supported by columns separating the central nave from the side aisles. During restoration works carried out in the mid-20th century, various architectural features were found that would have belonged to an earlier Visigothic church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In the Lands of the Enchanted Moorish Maiden: Islamic Art in Portugal (Islamic Art in the Mediterranean)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDzdBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Museum With No Frontiers, MWNF (Museum Ohne Grenzen)|date = 2013-06-01|isbn = 9783902782137|first = Cláudio|last = Torres|first2 = Santiago|last2 = Macias|first3 = Susana|last3 = Gómez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and development of Romanesque in Portugal (11th to 13th century)==
[[Image:Mosteiro_de_Santa_Cruz%2C_fachada.jpg|thumb|right|'''Monastery of Santa Cruz''' (Coimbra), its original Romanesque facade was later redecorated with [[Manueline]] style during the 16th century]]

In Portugal, the Romanesque architecture comes in late 11th century within a wider phenomenon of European cultural and religious spreading to the Iberian Peninsula, influenced by the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]] monastical reforms and the arrival of the Orders of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] (after 1086), [[Cistercians|Cister]] (or Citeaux) (1144), [[Order of Saint Augustine|St. Augustine]] (after 1131) and the Military-Religious Orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (1121) and the [[Knights Templar]] (1126).&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanesque architecture, through its prestige, relates with the rise and assertion of Portuguese independence.

Developing itself later than witnessed in the rest of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the [[Reconquista]]&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, one of the most significant aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"/&gt; The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the general context of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, but above all, to its social organization.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt; This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;José Custódio Vieira da Silva, Portugal §2: Architecture; Oxford Art online&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Igreja_de_Rates.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Main façade of [[Monastery of Rates]] old church, a Cluniac monastic building.]]

The first Romanesque churches in the North were simple constructions, consisting of a nave with a timber roof and a rectangular apse. Examples can be found at the [[Igreja de São Cristóvão de Rio Mau]], at the [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso]] and at the [[Church of Fontarcada]] (with already a semicircular apse at the east end).&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

Expansion of the Romanesque style coincided with the reign of [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] (1139–1185), a monarch with [[House of Burgundy|Burgundian]] background being the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] and great grandson of [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], King of France.&lt;ref name="Mattoso"&gt;{{Cite book|author = José Mattoso |title= D. Afonso Henriques |language=pt |edition=second |location=Lisbon |publisher=Temas e Debates |date=2014 |isbn=978-972-759-911-0 |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]], [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra]], [[Porto Cathedral|Porto]] and [[Viseu Cathedral|Viseu]] Cathedrals were built and also the Augustinian [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Monastery of Santa Cruz]], projected to be a royal pantheon.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt; The construction began in 1131 and by 1150 the nave and its apses were already finished. Its structural shape and decorative features were a novelty in Portugal, showing that its architect was either probably French or came in contact with [[List of Romanesque buildings|French Romanesque]] architecture from [[Burgundy]] like Tournus, Cluny, Paray-le-Monial or Romainmôtier.

Being a predominantly religious architecture, Portuguese Romanesque style was deeply related with ecclesiastical rural church parishes and [[Monasticism|monastic]] monasteries founded or rebuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, with bishops, by royal mandate, their biggest sponsors.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt;

==Romanesque cathedrals (Braga, Porto, Viseu, Coimbra and Lisbon)==
===Braga Cathedral===
The [[Braga Cathedral|Cathedral of Braga]] was rebuilt in the 1070s by Bishop Pedro and consecrated in 1089, although only the apse was finished at the time. He wished to create a pilgrimage church, with a three aisled nave, an ambulatory and a large transept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repositorio.ucp.pt/bitstream/10400.14/4966/1/LS_S1_01_AvelinoJCosta.pdf|title = Restoration of Braga Cathedral in 1070 AD|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Universidade Católica Portuguesa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Works increased during the tenure of [[Paio Mendes|D.Paio Mendes]] as archbishop (1118–37), after King D.Afonso Henriques granted a [[Foral|foral chart]] to the city as well as generous donations for its construction. It was then resumed and lasted until the middle of the 13th century. The original 12th-century building was built in the Burgundian Romanesque style of the monastery church of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] and influenced many other churches and monasteries in Portugal in that period. In later times the cathedral was greatly modified, so that today it is a mix of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monumentos|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1050|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[Image:Sé_de_Braga_001.jpg|thumb|left|Main façade of '''Braga Cathedral'''. The entrance gallery (galilee) with three arches is gothic (end of the 15th century), but the towers and upper storeys are early baroque (17th century).]]

The original Romanesque '''Western façade''' of the Cathedral has been totally suppressed, except for some [[archivolt]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the main portal, heavily decorated with animal and human sculptured reliefs. The figures on one archivolt, with hens, foxes and a minstrel, may be telling a moralistic song like the ones from [[Roman de Renart]], of French tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDIEVALISTA|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA1/medievalista-iconografia.htm|website = www2.fcsh.unl.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-23|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131107001353/http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA1/medievalista-iconografia.htm|archivedate = 2013-11-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside it has three [[aisle]]s covered by a wooden roof, a transept and five Eastern chapels in the apse. On the north wall outside of the cathedral there is the small '''Chapel of São Geraldo''', in memory of [[Gerald of Braga|Geraldo of Moissac]], Archbishop of Braga (1096–1108), of early Romanesque design, that may be a remnant of the late 11th-century building. This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a change of design in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evolução Histórico - Artística - Rota das Catedrais|url = http://rotadascatedrais.com/pt/braga-evolucao-historico-artistica|website = rotadascatedrais.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[nave]]''' is essentially Romanesque thanks to a "purifying" reform in the 20th century that suppressed most later additions, although some original capitals of the columns have been lost. '''D.Afonso''', son of King [[John I of Portugal|D.João I]], is buried in a 15th-century tomb made of bronze, which can be seen in the nave of the Cathedral.

Several chapels were built adjacent to the cathedral in the Middle Ages.

===Porto Cathedral===
[[Image:Se-Catedral-Exterior (4), Sé do Porto, 2004.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Porto Cathedral''', its heavy and imposing facade with thick buttresses was later embellished by a Baroque portal.]]
The [[Porto Cathedral]], located in the historical centre of the city of [[Porto]], is one of the city's oldest monuments and one of the most important Romanesque monuments in the country.
There is evidence that the city has been a bishopric seat since the [[Suevi]] domination in the 5th-6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=F-aXDCMdJR0C&amp;pg=PP61&amp;lpg=PP61&amp;dq=Bispos+do+Porto+no+per%C3%ADodo+Suevo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UCaW74yio1&amp;sig=p18fTn80iMpXenJPDRCsUH0oSSU&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs0o_Z76nJAhXIbxQKHUdABRUQ6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Bispos%20do%20Porto%20no%20per%C3%ADodo%20Suevo&amp;f=false|title=Catálogo e historia dos bispos do Porto|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Diocese do Porto|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current building was built according to tradition around 1110 under the patronage of '''Bishop Hugo''' (1112-1136),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDIEVALISTA|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA12/melo_ribeiro1207.html|website = www2.fcsh.unl.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently the church is likely to have been built in the mid-12th century, after 1147, because the "[[De expugnatione Lyxbonensi|De Expugnatione Lyxbonensi]]" appears to describe a small church that appears to match the old pre-Romanesque cathedral built in the 9th-10th centuries. As such, the building was likely built later, as the artistic evidence, that links the Romanesque of this church to the area of La Rochelle, supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title=A Arte Românica em Portugal|last=Rosas|first=Lúcia|last2=Botelho|first2=Leonor|publisher=Fundación Santa Maria la Real|year=2010|isbn=|location=Aguilar de Campo|pages=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was only completed in 1557, when the Manueline lantern tower was installed.

The cathedral is flanked by two square towers, each supported with two [[buttresses]] and crowned with a [[cupola]]. The façade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a [[Baroque]] porch and a beautiful [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Rose window|wheel window]] under a [[crenellated]] arch, giving the impression of a fortified church.
The Romanesque [[nave]] is rather narrow and is covered by [[barrel vault]]ing. It is flanked by two [[aisle]]s with a lower vault. The stone roof of the central aisle is supported by [[flying buttress]]es, making the building one of the first in Portugal to use this architectonic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artes.ucp.pt/citar/portoxvi/pdf/relatorio/PortoVirtualSecXVI-Mem%C3%B3ria-ParteI.pdf|title = MEMÓRIA JUSTIFICATIVA PROJECTO PORTO SÉCULO XVI A Sé e a sua envolvente no Século XVI|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = José Ferrão Afonso e Maria Leonor Botelho|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This original building has suffered some alterations (minored by the archaizing restorations of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] between 1927 and 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title=Arte Românica em Portugal|last=Rosas|first=Lúcia|last2=Botelho|first2=Leonor|publisher=Fundación Santa Maria la Real|year=2010|isbn=|location=Aguilar de Campo|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but the general aspect of the building has remained a mix of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Gothic.

Also to be referenced the elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cloister, built between the 14th and the 15th centuries during the reign of King [[John I of Portugal|D.João I]], who married English Princess [[Philippa of Lancaster]] in this cathedral in 1387.

===Viseu Cathedral===
[[Image:Sé_de_Viseu_fachada.jpg|thumb|left|290px|'''Viseu Cathedral''', its two towers are still Romanesque but the three-storey portal is Mannerist.]]
[[Viseu Cathedral]] started being built in the 12th century and is the most important historical monument of the city. It is currently a mix of architectural styles, specially from the [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Mannerist]] periods.

The current cathedral building started being erected in the mid-12th century, but little remains from this early Romanesque building except for some architectural details. The church was greatly enlarged in the following centuries of the Middle Ages, assuming its present configuration as a three-aisled building with three Eastern chapels. Some Gothic chapels in the [[cloisters]] also date from this period.

Built has a three-aisled nave, [[transept]] and three Eastern chapels. The main façade is flanked by two towers. The outer, lateral walls of the church have a heavy, menacing appearance, typical of Portuguese medieval cathedrals, being partially decorated with [[merlon]]s.
The South (clock) tower is still of medieval origin, while the North tower had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after a storm. The storm also destroyed the Manueline façade, which was rebuilt around 1635. The three-storey façade resembles a Mannerist altarpiece and is decorated with niches harbouring statues of the [[Four Evangelists]], as well as the [[Holy Mary]] and [[Theotonius|Saint Theotonius]].

===Coimbra Cathedral===
The [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]] (Portuguese: '''Sé Velha de Coimbra''') was built some time after the [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139. The project of this Romanesque cathedral is attributed to Master Robert, a, possibly, French architect who was directing the building of Lisbon Cathedral at that time and visited Coimbra regularly. The works were supervised by Master Bernard, possibly also French, who was succeeded by Master Soeiro, an architect active in other churches around the Diocese of Porto.

[[Image:SeVelha1.jpg|thumb|right|310px|'''Coimbra Cathedral''', with crenellated tops and heavy buttresses giving it a castle like appearance.]]

From the outside, Coimbra's old cathedral looks like a fortress, with its high, [[Battlement|crenellated]] walls harbouring few, narrow windows. This menacing appearance is explained by the belligerent times in which it was built. There is a tower-like structure in the middle of the western façade with a portal and a similar-looking upper window. Both portal and window are heavily decorated with Romanesque motifs of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] and [[Pre-Romanesque]] influences. The façade is reinforced by thick [[buttress]]es at the corners that compensate for the angle of the terrain (the cathedral was built on the slope of a hill).
The interior of the cathedral has a nave with two aisles, a small transept, and an eastern [[apse]] with three chapels. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and the lateral aisles by [[groin vault]]s. The nave has an upper storey, a spacious [[triforium]] (arched gallery), that could accommodate more mass attendants in the tribunes if needed. All columns of the interior have decorated capitals, mainly with vegetable motifs, but also with animals and geometric patterns. The windows of the lantern-tower and the big window in the west facade are the main sources of natural light of the cathedral.

The cloister, built during the reign of [[Afonso II of Portugal|Afonso II]] (early 13th century), is a work of the transition between Romanesque and Gothic. Each of the Gothic pointed arches that face the courtyard encompass two twin round arches in Romanesque style.

===Lisbon Cathedral===
The '''Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Mary Major''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or Sé de Lisboa) or simply [[Lisbon Cathedral]] is the oldest church in the city and the see of [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Archdiocese of Lisbon]].

[[Image:Se-cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|330px|'''Lisbon Cathedral''', severely damaged after the earthquake of 1755, it was rebuilt following the same original 12th-century plan.]]

This first building was completed between 1147 and the first decades of the 13th century in Late Romanesque style. At that time the relics of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent of Saragossa]], patron saint of Lisbon, were brought to the cathedral from Southern Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = St. Vincent's Cathedral - About Us|url = http://www.stvincentscathedral.org/page/st_vincent_of_saragossa_deacon_first_martyr_of_spain|website = www.stvincentscathedral.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cathedral follows a Latin cross plan with three aisles, a transept and a main chapel surrounded by a Gothic [[ambulatory]]. The church is connected with a cloister on the Eastern side. The main façade of the cathedral looks like a fortress, with two towers flanking the entrance and crenellations over the walls. This menacing appearance, also seen in other Portuguese cathedrals of the time, is a relic from the Reconquista period, when the cathedral could be used as a base to attack the enemy during a siege.

From its first building period from 1147 until the first decades of the 13th century, Lisbon cathedral has preserved the West façade with a [[rose window]] (rebuilt from fragments in the 20th century), the main portal, the North lateral portal and the nave of the cathedral. The portals have interesting sculptured [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] with Romanesque motifs.
The nave is covered by [[barrel vault]]ing and has an upper, arched gallery ([[triforium]]). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West façade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral aisles of the nave as well as the windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very similar to that of the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Cathedral of Coimbra]], which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.

==Knights Templar round church (Charola/Rotunda) at Convent of Christ==
Originally a 12th-century [[Knights Templar|Templar]] stronghold, when the order was dissolved in the 14th century the Portuguese branch was turned into the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Knights of the Order of Christ]], that later supported Portugal's [[Age of Discovery|maritime discoveries]] of the 15th century. The [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Convent and Castle complex]] in [[Tomar]] is a historic and cultural monument which was listed in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] list in 1983.

[[Image:Tomar_Convento_0254.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The round church of the '''Knights Templar''' in Tomar was built to be a fortified chapel, serving both for praying and defense.]]

The convent was founded by the [[Knights Templar|Order of Poor Knights of the Temple]] (or Templar Knights) in 1160. Its construction continued until the final part of the 12th century with the construction of the Charola (oratory), in one of the angles of the castle, completed by the Grand Master [[Gualdim Pais]] sometime around 1180.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=4718|title = Convento de Cristo / Mosteiro de Cristo Portugal, Santarém, Tomar, União das freguesias de Tomar (São João Baptista) e Santa Maria dos Olivais|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = Lisbon, Portugal: SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico|publisher = Mendonça, Isabel; Marques, Lina; Branco, Ricardo; Matias, Cecília|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Templar Church===
The Romanesque round church (charola, rotunda) was built in the second half of the 12th century by the Knights Templar, as a 16-side polygonal structure, with strong buttresses, round windows and a bell-tower. Inside, the round church has a central, octagonal structure, connected by arches to a surrounding gallery ([[ambulatory]]). The general shape of the church is modelled after similar round structures in [[Jerusalem]]: the [[Mosque of Omar]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA4/medievalista-santos.htm|title = The Templar round church of Tomar: A Romanesque masterpiece between East and West.|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = Institute of Medieval Studies - New University of Lisboa|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns are still Romanesque (end of the 12th century) and depict vegetal and animal motifs, as well as a Daniel in the Lions' Den scene. The style of the capitals shows the influence of artists working on the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Cathedral of Coimbra]], which was being built at the same time as the round church.&lt;ref name="A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uc.pt/chsc/rhsc/rhsc_11/rhsc11_39-56_cess.pdf|title = A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = Universidade Nova de Lisboa, FCSH|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Sousa Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the round church is magnificently decorated with late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]/[[Manueline]] sculptures and paintings, added during a renovation sponsored by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] starting in 1499. The pillars of the central octagon and the walls of the ambulatory have polychrome statues of saints and angels under exuberant Gothic canopies, while the walls and ceilings of the ambulatory are painted with Gothic patterns and panels depicting the life of Christ. The paintings are attributed to the workshop of the court painter of Manuel I, the Portuguese [[Jorge Afonso]], while the sculptured decoration is attributed to Flemish sculptor Olivier of Gand and the Spaniard Hernán Muñoz.&lt;ref name="A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uc.pt/chsc/rhsc/rhsc_11/rhsc11_39-56_cess.pdf|title = A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = Universidade Nova de Lisboa, FCSH|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Sousa Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A magnificent panel depicting the [[martyrdom]] of [[Saint Sebastian]], by Portuguese painter [[Gregório Lopes]], was painted for the Round Church and now hangs in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art]] in [[Lisbon]].

==Churches and monasteries==
[[Image:Mosteiro_de_Paco_de_Sousa.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''Monastery of Paço de Sousa''', built in the 10th century by the Benedictine monks.]]
As previously stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal by the end of the 11th century by the hand of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]], [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] orders, bringing with them the [[Cluniac Reforms|monastical reforms]] that were already underway in their countries of origin. Their influence and importance on the spreading of this new art form can be asserted by the large number of [[Architecture of Portugal|churches and monasteries]], one of the kind of Romanesque buildings that survived until our days.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this new style coincides with the advance of the [[Reconquista]] to the south and the development of recent Portuguese independence and its territorial changes, reflecting this war paradigm and the need for defense profoundly engraved in the specific kind of Romanesque art we can find in Portugal: thick and menacing crenelated walls, towers, use of [[battlement]]s, [[merlon]]s, [[Embrasure|narrow slits]] and decorative austerity, like the church of '''Travanca Monastery''' with its heavy tower, the '''Monastery of Cete''', the [[Igreja de Santa Maria de Airães|Church of Airães]], [[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|São Martinho de Mouros]], '''Paço de Sousa Monastery''' and the [[Monastery of Rates]], one of the most artistically diverse. Almost every religious building has a fortress-like design because in the absence of castles, churches were always considered the best fortresses.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SMMouros_01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|Church of São Martinho de Mouros]] with its heavy and fortified structure.]]

Therefore, it is not surprising that monastical buildings comprise most of the Romanesque kind, specially in the northern areas of [[Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province|Entre-Douro-e-Minho]], [[Tâmega Subregion|Tâmega]] and Sousa valleys and along the [[Douro]] river margins. With a significant rural population dispersed within these regions and organized in [[Foral|villages]] or [[concelho]]s we also find a significant number of parish churches, like [[Igreja de São Gens de Boelhe|São Gens de Boelhe]], [[Igreja de São Vicente de Sousa|São Vicente de Sousa]], [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|São Pedro de Ferreira]] or '''Santa Maria de Cárquere''' Being very simple and small constructions, it is astonishing how each of them have such an [[Iconography|iconographic]] variety of decorative features, being another unique "indigenous" characteristic of Portuguese Romanesque.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese Romanesque churches have a longitudinal structure, following the basilical plan common throughout Europe: three [[aisle]]s, [[transept]] and [[apse]] with two apsidoles, either semi-circular or square shaped, or just with one single aisle and apse.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With semi-circular apse and apsidoles we have the churches of Ganfei, Rates, Pombeiro, São Tiago of Coimbra and Castro de Avelãs. The churches of [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso|São Cristóvão de Rio Mau]] and [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso|Santa Eulália de Arnoso]], among others, present a square-shape apse and apsidoles.

===Interiors===
[[Image:Sao_Pedro_de_Rates_Church2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior of the church of [[Monastery of Rates]] seen towards the main chapel, with its wooden roof and pointed arches.]]

Most Romanesque monasteries, parish churches and abbey churches in Portugal are aisless halls with a projecting [[apse]] at the chancel end, or sometimes, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have [[aisle]]s separated from the nave by arcades. The apse is lower or at the same height of the nave. Monasteries are usually larger with 3 aisles supported by decorated [[column]]s and piers. The walls are of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings and almost entirely made out of granite stones.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arcade (architecture)|Arcades]] can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a [[cloister]] is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the [[clerestory]] rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently "blind arcading" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Sanfins_de_Friestas_(3424487664).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Interior of the church of [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|São Pedro de Ferreira Monastery]] with small openings and carved capitals.]]

The [[arch]]es used in Portuguese Romanesque buildings follow the basic European model and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a door with a [[lintel]] is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular [[lunette]] with decorative carving.&lt;ref name="Art through the Ages"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages.|last = |first = |publisher = Helen Gardner|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These doors sometimes have a carved central [[jamb]].
Narrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Portuguese Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arcade openings, separated by a [[Column|pillar]] or '''colonette''' and often set within a larger arch. There were some number of buildings in which '''pointed arches''' have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons and it is believed that in these cases there is a direct influence of Mozarabic and/or Islamic architecture.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other late Romanesque churches the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of [[Gothic architecture]].

[[Image:Iglesia_de_São_Pedro_de_Rubiães_(1861498064).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Interior of the [[Church of São Pedro de Rubiães]] seen towards the main entrance, with its wooden roof.]]

Although basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core [[column]]s on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch.
Piers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and [[transept]], are commonly [[cruciform]] in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Columns, colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired.

The majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple truss, tie beam or king post form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at the monasteries of [[Monastery of Rates|Rates]] or '''Paço de Sousa'''. Some others are completely [[Barrel vault|barrel]] vaulted or a mix between wooden roofs and a vaulted apse. In later stages [[rib vault]]ing started to be used as an experiment in main altar roofs.

===Portals===
[[Image:PortalSaoTiagoCoimbra.png|thumb|right|220px|Portal of the [[Igreja de Santiago (Coimbra)|Church of Santiago]] in Coimbra has columns decorated with detailed motifs.]]
Romanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building, and both the largest and the smallest, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers. Doorways have a character form, with the [[Doorjamb|jambs]] having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular [[Fluting (architecture)|shaft]], all surmounted by a continuous [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]].

[[Image:TravancaPortal.png|thumb|left|230px|'''Travanca Monastery''' has a pointed arch portal, a feature that would later be developed in [[Gothic architecture]].]]

The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same serried planes and circular [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] as the jambs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Romanesque.|last = |first = |publisher = Rolf Toman|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch consists typically of four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.

The opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], generally carved. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the [[Nativity in art|Birth of Christ]]. The portal may be protected by a porch, from simple open porches to more elaborate structures. The religious context of the art at the time was well noticeable in the churches carvings, both inside the church as outside. They showed several episodes of the life of saints and various myths and biblical stories. Those that were sculptured specially in the tympanums, capitals and collonettes of the portals can be divided into two major themes:
* Representations of [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] motifs, such as crosses and [[Esoteric Christianity|esoteric]] symbols.
* Representations of [[Theophany|Theophanies]] or [[Christ in Majesty|"Maiestas Domini"]] (Christ in Majesty) such as [[Lamb of God|"Agnus Dei"]] (the mystical lamb trespassed by a cross) or [[Christ]] in [[Aureola|mandorla]] surrounded by prophets, angels and [[tetramorph]]s.

===Capitals===
The foliate [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, being some much closer to the Classical than others.&lt;ref name="Art through the Ages"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages.|last = |first = |publisher = Helen Gardner|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Orada_(2105927940).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Vegetalist capitals at the chapel of '''Nossa Senhora da Orada'''.]]

The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Escultura Românica: Arte e Técnica.|last = |first = |publisher = Marlene Borges Félix|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative, without forgetting that the kind of stone used for construction of Romanesque churches in Portugal was mostly granite which made the carving of intricate and sharp details much harder.

[[Image:Igreja_de_São_Tiago%2C_Coimbra._Capiteis_y_colunelos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vegetalist and animal intricate capital and column carvings in [[Igreja de Santiago (Coimbra)|Santiago Church]].]]

It is however in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on [[Manuscript illumination|manuscripts illustrations]] of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints, all of those with a deep religious meaning and pedagogical objective of teaching the faithful ones about virtues and sins guiding them through the right path.&lt;ref name="Rota do Românico"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rotadoromanico.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PerfilHistoriador/O_Romanico_em_Portugal.pdf|title = Rota do Românico|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of the iconography represented in capitals throughout the Portuguese Romanesque buildings are the scenes of daily life or mundane events such as musicians playing instruments, acrobats performing stunts, people dancing. Also, scenes representing the several economical activities of that period like peasants planting crops, farm animals (cows, sheep, goats, horses, etc.), as well as the social medieval hierarchy displaying knights, bishops and peasants each performing specific tasks according to their social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/marques8013.html|title = O Mundo do Fantástico na Arte Românica e Gótica em Portugal.|date = |accessdate = |website = Medievalista online|publisher = Marisa Costa Marques|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corbels and Modillions===
[[Image:Exterior_Cathedral_Braga_(3).jpg|thumb|right|180px|The "horn blower" at [[Braga Cathedral]].]]
In [[Romanesque architecture]] a corbel is a structural piece of stone jutting from a wall to carry a [[wikt:superincumbent|superincumbent]] weight, a type of [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]. The technique of corbelling, where rows of [[corbel]]s deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corbel, Encyclopædia Britannica|last = Chisholm|first = Hugh|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1911|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A modillion is an ornate bracket, a corbel, underneath a [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]] and supporting it, more elaborate than [[dentil]]s (literally translated as small teeth), they were carved classically under a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or a [[Composite order|Composite]] cornice, but may support any type of [[eaves]] cornice.

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Sanfins_de_Friestas_(1922122488).jpg|thumb|left|240px|A '''corbel table''' with humans, animals and beasts carved in the modillions. [[Igreja de São Fins de Friestas|Sanfins de Friestas Church]].]]

Corbels in Portuguese Romanesque buildings often have an elaborately carved appearance with stylised heads of humans, animals and imaginary "beasts", or a wide range of motifs, sometimes end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on corbels resembled those used in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[column]]s.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another particular feature of Romanesque buildings are '''corbel tables''', a projecting moulded [[string course]] supported by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the [[Rain gutter|gutter]], but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a [[parapet]].&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apses (East ends) and apsidoles===
[[Image:Capilla_de_Santo_Abdão_da_Correlhã_(2437007714).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Simple square east end on the'Chapel of Santo Abdão.]]
One of the most striking features of a Romanesque church is its [[apse]] or "east-end", a recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an [[Exedra]], applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination to the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] or aisles of a church at the liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apses and [[Apsidiole|apsidoles]] can be either semi-circular, with or without a high chancel surrounded by an [[ambulatory]], or a square end from which an apse is projected. Apsidoles can be also be found whenever the main altar is surrounded by lateral chapels.

[[Image:Igreja_Matriz_de_Armamar_002.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 12th-century-built [[Igreja de São Miguel (Armamar)|Church of Armamar]] already has a semi-circular apse.]]

Churches in Portugal have long since followed the Pre-Romanesque kind of simple square-shaped apses typical of [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] and [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] periods where east ends reflected the common structural plan of single-aisled churches as the main altar is separated from the nave by a [[transept]] or is just the extension of it. This style continued to be popular through the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and well into [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref name="Rota do Românico"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rotadoromanico.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PerfilHistoriador/O_Romanico_em_Portugal.pdf|title = Rota do Românico|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully Romanesque semi-circular apses started being more widespread in the regions between [[Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province|Douro and Minho]] in the second quarter of the 12th century (1125-1150), coming from the center region of [[Coimbra]] that was more open to foreign novelties as stated above. This kind of so-called "French style" semi-circular apses and apsidoles became more frequent not only in single nave churches, on which case there are no apsidoles, but particularly in three-aisled churches and monasteries built in the second half of the 12th century and during the 13th century.

===Cloisters===
[[Image:Catedral_Vieja_de_Coimbra%2C_claustro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cloister of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]], arcades and columns are Romanesque but its roof already presents a ribbed vault.]]

A '''[[cloister]]''' (from [[Latin]] claustrum, "enclosure") is a covered walk, open gallery, or open [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] running along the walls of buildings and forming a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|square]] or garth. The attachment of a cloister to a [[cathedral]] or church, commonly against a warm southern flank,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister|last = Horn|first = Walter|publisher = Gesta 12.1/2|year = 1973|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually indicates that it is (or once was) part of a [[monastic]] foundation, forming a continuous and solid architectural barrier that effectively separates the world of the [[monk]]s from that of the [[serf]]s and workmen, whose lives and works went on outside and around the cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cloister|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Claustro_Igreja_de_S._Pedro_do_Mosteiro_de_Cête_(4931341221).jpg|thumb|left|250px|'''Monastery of Cete''' cloister have simple composite capitals with no decorations.]]

Although much of the cloisters in Portuguese churches and cathedrals have been extensively remodelled in later centuries, original Romanesque ones still survived, some almost completely preserved, others in various states of ruin. In contrast to their French counterparts, they often have suffered less modern intervention, and as a result, their current state is more likely to reflect their original arrangement and to preserve more fully the character of the visual imagery found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pictorial Narrative in the Romanesque Cloister: Cloister Imagery &amp; Religious Life in Medieval Spain|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_2mEB4XlrcwC|publisher = Peter Lang|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780820472683|first = Pamela Anne|last = Patton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most arcades and masonry walls of the cloister carries simple wooden [[shed]] roofs as barrel or groin vaulted ceilings weren't common or likely didn't survived into our days.

Cloisters provided special accommodation for the activities that took place within it: stone benches were used for reading, books were sometimes stored in cupboards or armoires built into the walls. In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], such as vine [[scroll]]s and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.&lt;ref name="The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ|publisher = OUP USA|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9780195395365|first = Colum|last = Hourihane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cistercian Romanesque==
[[Image:R1033302c_(7881550954).jpg|thumb|left|250px|'''Tarouca Abbey''' copying the facade of the [[Abbey of Fontenay]].]]
The [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian Romanesque architecture]] reflected the austerity and sobriety characteristic of that monastical Order in their quest for a mistic and spiritual goal preached by their leader and mentor Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].
In Portugal, besides a Cistercian Gothic-featured architecture (in which the [[Alcobaça Monastery]] is a universal symbol), there is a previous Romanesque style expressed by the '''Abbeys of Tarouca''' (construction started in 1144, the year of Cistercian monks arrival in Portugal), '''Salzedas''' (started in 1152) and [[Church of Fiães|Fiães]] (started in 1163).
&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:O_mosteiro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Amares Abbey''', one of the first of the Order of Cister in Portugal.]]

In the architecture of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a [[Gothic architecture|proto-Gothic]] feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] and [[Abbey of Fontenay|Fontenay]] and Salzedas still have some similarities with [[Fontfroide Abbey|Fontfroide]], their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of smaller churches were also influenced by Cistercian Romanesque, like the vault of [[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|São Martinho de Mouros]] that shows the influx of Tarouca's abbey central nave vault and the exterior capitals in the main altar of [[Igreja de São Miguel (Armamar)|Armamar]] church are significantly influenced by the outlayer of Salzedas abbey.

==Civil and military architecture==
===Domus Municipalis (Town hall) of Bragança===
[[Image:Domus_Municipalis_4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The stonework of the '''Domus Municipalis''', located across the courtyard of [[Castelo de Bragança|Bragança Castle]].]]
The [[Domus Municipalis]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: municipal house) is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building in the northeastern municipality of [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]]. Its exact function, name and construction date have been the onset of much debate and controversy, even after many researches during the 20th century: first it was believed it could have been the city's [[Town hall|Municipal house]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: "Casa da Câmara"), place of public meetings and a symbol of people's local government through their representatives, but more recent findings have presented basis for a theory that it could have served as [[cistern]], but there are still doubts if that was its primary function.

[[Image:P8093277w_(7874335812).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Upper level where the town meetings took place (cistern drains in the centre )]]

This singular (and enigmatic) building of Romanesque civic architecture also presents challenges in its dating construction. An initial thesis stated that by its design and decorative features it could have been built as early as the 10th or 11th century, but a closer look actually tells us that was, most likely, built in the first half of the 13th century. Also, a deeper research showed that the existing building might be the result of two different dating constructions, with an older cistern on its lower floor and a meeting room built on top, using the already existing structure. Doubts about its real function arouse from a document of 1501 in which the author (according to the published writings of the Abbot of Baçal (1865-1947)) referred to the local record of Martim Anes (1185-1254) who spoke of the construction of the '''Domus''' upper level during his lifetime. In this account he stated that it was used as a meeting place for the "good men" of the municipality.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Domus_Municipalis_6.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Corbel details show its Romanesque style although probably built in a later period.]]

There is another document from 1503 referring to the building as both a ''Sala da Água'' ([[English language|English]]: Water-room) and a place where the town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should not be surprising if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level by the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located near the Castle's courtyard alongside the '''Church of Santa Maria''', the structure is based on a multi-level irregular [[pentagon]], constructed of rounded granite blocks and held together by [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], with a barrel vaulted wooden roof supported by three arches and covered by tiles. Its floor-plan is slightly steeped and a natural water fountain was found in the Northwest corner at a low depth.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towers and fortified houses===
[[Image:Paco_S_Cipriano.JPG|thumb|right|280px|'''Tower-House of São Cipriano''', near [[Guimarães]]. Remodelled in the 15th and 18th centuries, its tower and main building date back to the early 12th century.]]
In sharp contrast to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque civil architecture]] that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]] (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:"Casa-Torre"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands ([[Feudalism|Coutos or Honras]]), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Solar_Azevedo_(43).JPG|thumb|left|280px|'''Azevedo Tower-House''', in [[Braga]] (13th century). Nowadays, like many manors, is a rural-tourism guest house.]]

Among those we have the manors and towers of '''Vilar''' ([[Penafiel]]), '''Pousada''' ([[Guimarães]]), [[Dornelas (Amares)|Dornelas]] in [[Braga]], '''Oriz''' ([[Vila Verde]]), '''Lourosa do Campo''' ([[Arouca, Portugal|Arouca]]) and '''Quintela''' ([[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]]). In northern Portugal there were two kinds of fortified houses during the Middle Ages: the [[Manor house]] and the [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]].&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

This kind of model was adopted by the smaller ranks of nobility in search of social ascension in a way of displaying to local communities their newly acquired power.&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

[[Image:Solar_dos_Pinheiros.JPG|thumb|right|290px|'''Pinheiro''' fortress-house, built by late 14th and early 15h centuries still, near [[Guimarães]].]]

The [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]] is composed by several divisions:

- The most important being the [[Fortified tower|Tower]], of square plan (round ones were rare in Portugal), fortifying the house and offering protection to their owners and respective [[Serfdom|servants]] in case of need. It was built with four levels, each corresponding to a single division. Just like a keep tower in castles, the main gate was accessed by the first floor rather than the ground floor. This ground floor was the reception and living room, as the upper floors were destined for private chambers.

- A "domus fortis" also had a separate building coupled with or close to the tower, with rectangular plan and two floors. Those were usually the servants area and accommodations.

- In some cases is reported the existence of a private chapel like in [[Pedro Martins, Lord of the Tower of Vasconcelos|Vasconcelos Tower-house]]. Also other individual structures, like kitchens, were built close to water springs or small streams. No remains are left from these buildings although their existence if fully documented.&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

Most of tower-houses were built in northern and central regions of Portugal that belonged to feudal areas. Some were progressively restored in later centuries reflecting more modern [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles: like [[Aguiã]], [[Ponte de Lima|Refoios]], '''Gomariz''', [[Castro, Portugal|Castro]], '''Faralães''' and '''Barbosa''' Tower-Houses. In other cases their towers were separated from the main building like '''Silva''', '''Quintela''', '''Oriz''' and [[Tower of Penegate|Penegate]] Towers, among others.

===Bridges===
[[Image:Ponte_Lagoncinha_-_Lousado.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ponte de Lagoncinha|Lagoncinha Bridge]] over the [[Ave River]], built in the 12th century on the road between [[Braga]] and [[Porto]].]]
Construction activity of [[bridge]]s during the [[Middle Ages]] is directly related to the need of restoring the old [[Roman roads|Roman road system]] that was already obsolete, in order to develop new connections and boost trading. Since the end of the 11th century that need was so urgent that building bridges and restoring the paveways were activities that started to be considered as pious. [[Gonçalo de Amarante|São Gonçalo of Amarante]] and '''São Lourenço Mendes''', sponsors of the construction of [[Amarante, Portugal|Amarante]] and '''Cavês''' bridges, respectively, were called saints by popular acclamation, such as [[Pont Saint-Bénézet|Saint Benizet of Avignon]] (France) or '''Sán Domingos da Calçada''' ([[La Rioja (Spain)]]), showing how much this phenomenon of bridge and road construction were considered extremely important elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ponte_do_Porto_04.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Ponte do Porto|Porto Bridge]] over the [[Cávado River]], built in the 11th century.]]

In the will of monarchs, noblemen and clergymen there are many references to donations for building bridges, King [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] (1109-1185) himself contributed to the construction of [[Coimbra]], [[Ave River|Ave]] and '''Piares''' ([[Douro]] river) bridges.
The stonemasons of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period were more careful about the structural design and maintenance of bridges than their previous [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterparts, and looked for more solid grounds to build them, and because of that, according to Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida, medieval bridges resisted better against the danger of floodings and the test of time.
&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ponte_de_Prado_(4).JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Ponte do Prado|Prado Bridge]] over the [[Cávado River]], although originally Roman it was rebuilt in the early 12th century.]]

Romanesque bridges present large [[arch]]es whose height had to be balanced with the use of [[abutment]]s at each end by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. Bridge builders also improved on the Roman structures by using narrower [[pier]]s, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios.
Examples of these are the bridges of [[Ponte de Lagoncinha|Lagoncinha]] (12th century), over the [[Ave River]], with six arches, [[Ponte do Prado|Prado]] bridge over the [[Cávado River]] (11th century), with nine arches and '''Cavês''' bridge over the [[Tâmega River]] (13th century).&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge building deeply shaped the Portuguese medieval landscape. Among the Romanesque civil architecture and by the economical and technical means used for their construction, the building of bridges had the most impact in everyday life, benefiting communication between people.

===Castles===
{{See also|Castles in Portugal}}

[[Image:19.4.14_Guimaraes_61_(13917539186).jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''[[Guimarães Castle]]''', built in the 10th century, its current look is the result of late 13th-century enlargements.]]
In Portugal, [[castle]]s are directly related with military needs and the state of continuous warfare characterised by the [[Reconquista]]. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the [[Douro]] river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very simple structure and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with [[Granite|granite outcrops]], that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) we witness a boom of castles due to the ever-growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Celorico_de_Basto_2.JPG|thumb|left|250px|'''Arnoia Castle''', built in the late 11th century, offered protection to a nearby monastery.]]

The strength of a Romanesque castle sits in the thickness and height of its walls in order to resist sieges. The [[Chemin de ronde|Allure or round-path]] ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]: Adarve) was intertwinned with towers in order to break continuous cloths of wall and in the 12th century other outer sets of walls were built next to castles themselves to shelter populations and cattle as attested in the [[Castle of Castro Laboreiro]].&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanesque castle testifies to the triumph of rural nobility and is also the symbol of a territory's safety. During this period it consisted of a wall with [[Chemin de ronde|allures]], [[battlement]]s and a central tower: the [[Keep]], symbol of feudal power, and the biggest innovation to the fortress. This element has its origins in the [[Tower house|domus fortis]], the strengthened noble residence.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tor_mit_(Zug-)_Brücke_zum_Castelo_do_Lindoso.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main gate of '''Lindoso Castle''' and its [[drawbridge]].]]

Between the North and the South of Portugal, particularly in the regions defined by the margins of the [[Mondego River|Mondego]] and [[Tagus|Tejo]] Rivers, there are notable differences in military structures. In the North castles have a more basic structure and are very tied to fortifications typified in [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] era. Going southwards castles display more advanced techniques in the field of military architecture. The strategic area was then concentrated on the border with the [[Moors]] where the [[Military order (monastic society)|Military Orders]] would play a key role. In the North we can find the castles of [[Castelo de Lanhoso|Lanhoso]], [[Castle of Castro Laboreiro|Castro Laboreiro]], [[Castelo de Lindoso|Lindoso]], [[Castelo de Melgaço|Melgaço]], [[Castelo de Arnóia|Arnoia]], [[Castelo de Pena de Aguiar|Pena de Aguiar]], [[Castelo de Trancoso|Trancoso]], [[Castelo de Vilar Maior|Vilar Maior]], and the most outstanding [[Guimarães Castle]]. This fortress, documented since around 950 AD, had undergone restoration works during the reign of [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] and later changes in its layout in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Castelo_de_Lanhoso_(7).JPG|thumb|left|250px|Battlements and the round-path at '''Póvoa de Lanhoso Castle''', late 11th century.]]

Built under the tenure of [[Gualdim Pais]] as Master of the [[Knights Templar]] (1157-1195), the castles of [[Castle of Pombal|Pombal]] (c.1156), [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Tomar]] (1160), [[Castelo de Monsanto|Monsanto]] (1165), [[Castelo de Penas Róias|Penas Roias]] (1166), [[Castle of Almourol|Almourol]] (1171) and [[Castelo de Longroiva|Longroiva]] (1174) demonstrate the importance of the Templars in the development of Portuguese military architecture during the second half of the 12th century. The first document stating the Knights Templar presence in Portugal dates back to 1128, when Queen [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|D.Teresa]] donated them the castle of [[Soure Castle|Soure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PT-TT-OCCT-A-5-1-1_m0001.TIF - Carta de doação de D. Teresa, rainha de Portugal, do Castelo de Soure concedida ao Templo de Salomão - Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo - DigitArq|url = http://digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt/viewer?id=4251189|website = digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its keep, built on the north side of the fortress, retains a distinctive feature: the [[Levee|Alambor]], a reinforced base for the tower using a stone-slanted ramp. This solution gives it greater strength and makes an assault on its walls harder to accomplish. This feature can also be seen in the Keep of Pombal Castle.

At Tomar Castle, headquarters of the Order in Portugal, the alambor was built along the outer walls of the fortification. With origins in the military architecture developed by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]], this constructive technique was used in the castle of [[Citadel of Salah Ed-Din|Saône]] and the [[Krak des Chevaliers]], both located in [[Syria]], where Gualdim Pais was stationed between 1151 and 1156. It owns to the Templar Order some of the most innovative solutions that the Portuguese military architecture met throughout the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to Gothic architecture==
{{See also|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}
[[Image:La_Orden_del_Temple_y_el_"art_gotique".jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Church of Santa Maria do Olival]], built by the Knights Templar around 1170, was one of the first buildings reflecting the newly arrived [[Gothic architecture]] maintaining a Romanesque structural shape.]]
The arrival of the [[Cistercians]] in Portugal after 1142 coincided with the first steps on the development of the new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artistical style in France. Those initial Gothic features (pointed [[arch]], taller and slimmer [[column]]s, [[Groin vault|groin]] and [[rib vault]]s, [[flying buttress]]es and more [[Rose window|windows]]), although still with much Romanesque flavour, were implemented in Cistercian abbeys as they matched the exact kind of austere and ascetic teachings preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Igreja_de_São_João_de_Alporão.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Igreja de São João de Alporão|Church of São João do Alporão]], built by the Knights Hospitaller after 1185, also presents early Gothic features like the rose window or the non-decorated portal.]]

Thus, in Portugal, the strong presence and popularity of Romanesque until later centuries meant that this decorative and architectural Cistercian model was the perfect basis for the slow change into Gothic style, without never completely cutting off with the previous Romanesque. Instead, these two styles merged in Portuguese architecture like nowhere else in Europe within a specific kind called '''Mendicant Gothic''', typical of monastic buildings. [[Alcobaça Monastery|Alcobaça]], one of the biggest Cistercian abbeys in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repositorio.ucp.pt/bitstream/10400.14/4973/1/LS_S1_04_MaurCocheril.pdf|title = ABADIAS CISTERCIENSES PORTUGUESAS|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Cocheril|first = Frei Maur}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first fully Gothic building in Portugal, but it still has a heavy and austere exterior appearance, only balanced by its tall and massive [[rib vault]]ed central [[nave]] and [[aisle]]s. Churches like [[Church of Santa Maria do Olival|Santa Maria dos Olivais]] in [[Tomar]], or [[Igreja de São João de Alporão|São João de Alporão]] in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] are perfect examples of this Mendicant transitional period between the Romanesque and the definitive settle of Gothic style, which would only be a reality by the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evoros_katedra.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lateral view of [[Cathedral of Évora|Évora Cathedral]], where its massive buttresses give a very Romanesque look.]]

[[Cathedral of Évora|Évora Cathedral]] is another example of Romanesque/Gothic transition, combining both in a single monument. Built between 1186 and 1204 (but only fully completed by 1250) with a clear Romanesque outlook, it was again enlarged circa 1280-1340, this time in early Gothic style. The cathedral received several valuable additions through time, such as the cloisters (Gothic period - 14th century), or its [[Dome|zimborium]] (dome), built in the late 13th century and another addition already showing the new Gothic features.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque never truly ceased to be expressed in various ways both decorative and structural until as late as the 16th century, thus most historians name it as '''Resistance Romanesque''', referring to a specific kind of buildings that present a very marked statement of this period even if mixed with later artistical styles ([[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]). Some examples of those are the Churches of [[Igreja Matriz de Caminha|Caminha]], (built in the late 15th century), '''Torre de Moncorvo''' (built in the early 16th century), and the '''Cathedral of Viana do Castelo''' (also from the 15th century).

The '''Fénéon Prize''' (''Prix Fénéon''), established in 1949, is awarded annually to a French-language writer and a visual artist. The prize was established by Fanny Fénéon, the widow of French art critic [[Félix Fénéon]]. She bequeathed the proceeds from the sale of his art collection to the [[University of Paris]], whose Vice Chancellor chairs the award jury.

===First publication of stories===
The first UK magazine publication of all the stories has not been fully documented. The known listing is as follows:

* ''Problem at Pollensa Bay'': First published in issue 539 of the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in November 1935. The story was illustrated by Jack M. Faulks. The detective is [[Parker Pyne]].
* ''The Second Gong'': First published in issue 499 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in July 1932. This story with [[Hercule Poirot]] was the basis of the novella ''[[Dead Man's Mirror]]'' in 1935.
* ''Yellow Iris'': First published in issue 559 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in July 1937. This story with Hercule Poirot was the basis of the novel ''[[Sparkling Cyanide]]'', in which Poirot was replaced by [[Colonel Race]] and the plot was heavily altered.
* ''The Love Detectives'': First published in issue 236 of ''[[The Story-Teller]]'' magazine in December 1926 under the title of ''At the Crossroads''. This was the first of a series of six stories in consecutive issues of the magazine titled ''The Magic of Mr. Quin''. The remaining five were later published in book form in ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin]]'' in 1930. The plot has similarities to 1930 [[Miss Marple]] novel [[The Murder at the Vicarage]]
* ''The Regatta Mystery'': First published in issue 546 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in June 1936 under the title ''Poirot and the Regatta Mystery''. The story was illustrated by Jack M. Faulks. The story was later rewritten by Christie to change the detective from Hercule Poirot to Parker Pyne before its first book publication in the US in ''[[The Regatta Mystery|The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' in 1939. The publication in the ''Strand Magazine'' remained the only publication of the original version of the story in the UK until 2008, when it was included in the omnibus volume "Hercule Poirot: the Complete Short Stories" ({{ISBN|978-0006513773}}).
* ''Next To A Dog'': First published in issue 295 of the ''[[Grand Magazine]]'' in September 1929.
* ''Magnolia Blossom'': First published in issue 329 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in March 1926. The story first appeared in book form in the UK in the 1982 collection ''The Agatha Christie Hour'' ({{ISBN|0-00-231-3316}}) to tie in with a dramatisation of the story in the television series of the same name.

No magazine publication of ''The Harlequin Tea Set'' has yet been traced; the story was first published in book form in the UK in ''Winter's Crimes #3'' in 1971 by [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] ({{ISBN|0-333-12871-0}}).

'''Saint James' the Elder church''' is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Štvrtok na Ostrove]], [[Slovakia]]. The church was first mentioned in 1333. The consecration to [[Saint James the Elder]] is the oldest to this [[Apostles|Apostle]] in Slovakia.&lt;ref name='dajama'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Podolinsky|first1=Stefan|title=Romanesque churches|date=2009|publisher=Dajama|location=Bratislava|isbn=978-80-89226-79-5|pages=26-27|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing building material used for the original construction in the mid-13th century building boom were bricks. The majority of the romanesque churches in this region of Slovakia is from this period. The two-tower design though makes this church unique on the Žitný ostrov. The only similar one is the church of the Benedictine Abbey of Diakovce.&lt;ref name='dajama' /&gt;

[[File:Monet, Claude - The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''San Giorgio Maggiore'' in the collection of [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], The Lockton Collection, 70.76, discovernewfields.org]]
[[Claude Monet]] painted a series of paintings of the island-monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]] in [[Venice]]. They were begun in 1908 during the artist's only visit to the city. One of the best known is ''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk]]'', which exists in two versions.

Monet completed his paintings of Venice at home in France,&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/56280/ |title=The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1912 showed them in Paris. Buyers included the Welsh collector [[Gwendoline Davies]], who bought three paintings.

A painting by Monet, described as being of San Giorgio Maggiore, was seized in July 2016 by Swiss officials on behalf of U.S. authorities. The owner, [[Jho Low]], [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|embezzled funds]] from [[1Malaysia Development BHD.]], a government investment fund.  He had purchased the painting for $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-1mdb-net-an-art-world-whale-1469091601|title=In the 1MDB Net, an Art-World Whale|last=Crow|first=Kelly|date=2016-07-21|last2=Letzing|first2=John|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[National Gallery]] in London held an exhibition "Monet and Architecture" which reunited nine of the Venice paintings.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/08/monet-and-architecture-review-exhibition-national-gallery |title=Monet and Architecture review |last=Cumming |first=Laura |work=The Observer |access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included three paintings of San Giorgio Maggiore apparently painted from Monet's hotel on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. They came from galleries in [[Cardiff]] ([[National Museum Cardiff]]) and [[Indianapolis]] ([[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]) and one from a private collection.

'''Solaris Pictures''' is an [[India]]n film production company based in [[Mumbai]]. It was created by [[Sridhar Rangayan]], and [[Saagar Gupta]] in 2001.  The two have gone on to create several award-winning films under Solaris Pictures' banner, focusing on [[LGBT]] issues and [[HIV/AIDS]].

== Introduction ==

'''Solaris Pictures''' is perhaps the only [[India]]n [[film production]] company that has consistently been making bold and path-breaking films on issues such as [[homosexuality]] and [[gay rights]], films that engage the audience and initiate dialogues on issues dealing with health and sexuality, human rights, and the gay and transgender communities.

Previous productions include: [[The Pink Mirror]], which has won two Best Film awards, and was screened at over 72 festivals; [[Yours Emotionally]]! which was played at several international festivals and [[68 Pages]], which won the Silver Remi award at the 2008 WorldFest Houston. These films have made visible Indian queer characters and issues to a global audience, through a unique style that combines Bollywood melodrama with international avant-garde film techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humsafar.wordpress.com/category/solaris-pictures/ Film India Worldwide | Festival Touchstone (page 21) | Nov 2007-Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris Pictures is the Associate Producer of [http://projectbolo.com Project Bolo] - an Indian LGBT Oral History Project that interviews 20 Indian LGBT persons in Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaylaxymag.com/articles/current-affairs/project-bolo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris Pictures believes in pushing the envelope - both as [[Film producer|producer]] and as [[distributor]], and in partnering with grassroots [[NGO]]s and [[community-based organization]]s in India, and international collaborators from around the world. It produces films that go beyond mere entertainment, to emotionally engage the audience and initiate dialogues about underserved issues like health and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[human rights]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] issues.

The company has also collaborated in producing more than 100 hours of television content for serials like Rishtey, Gubbare, Kagaar and has produced advertising for companies like [[Life Insurance Corporation of India]], [[H &amp; R Johnson]], [[Godrej Group|Godrej]], Rupa, [[Zee TV]]. Thei social awareness films and spots for the [[National Institute for Hearing Handicapped]], [[Cancer Patients Aid Association]] and Cama &amp; Albless Hospital have been telecast on both [[DD National]] and [[Mumbai]] [[Doordarshan]].

Solaris Pictures is one of the principal organizers of [[Kashish Mumbai Queer Film Festival]] that was first held in April 2010 in Mumbai at [[PVR Cinemas]] and [[Alliance Francaise]] and then in 2011 and 2012 at [[Cinemax]] Versova and [[Alliance Francaise]]

Solaris Pictures has also organized [[Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival]] in Mumbai and New Delhi in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Human-rights-film-festival-returns-in-Mumbai/Article1-779904.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a country like [[India]] that is still in denial, where being HIV+ is still a curse, [[68 Pages]] rips open the underbelly of its society to reveal how it stigmatizes and shuns those who are [[HIV+]] or even those who just want to be what they are. Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary, we see the stories of Paayal, a [[sex worker]]; Nishit, an ID user; Kiran, a [[gay]] man and Umrao, a [[transsexual]] bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear, humiliation and rejection - not only by the society, but even by their loved ones. While these stories expose the shallowness of the system, it also offers hope and healing by trying to bring about a better understanding of their fight to live with dignity. The film is a tribute to the human spirit of optimism and survival. { Source: imdb} [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151299/]

===The Pink Mirror===

Drama/Gay / DV / 40 mins / India / 2003 / Hindi wst English&lt;br /&gt;
Directed and Written by [[Sridhar Rangayan]]&lt;br /&gt;
Produced by Solaris Pictures (India)

[[The Pink Mirror]] pits two Indian [[drag queen]]s against a westernized gay teenager in a battle to woo a handsome hunk. It's a clash of the east and west. The drag queens, who are expert in the art of seduction with their wit, innuendo and cunning or the young teenager who is saucy, slutty and sly? Underneath the campy humorous exterior, the film is an exploration of the [[India]]n [[gay]] landscape and understanding of the deep, humanly tender bondings that exist between drag queens in India who form unique, non-patriarchal families. Using the [[Bollywood]] soap idiom of song, dance and drama and for the first time in the Indian drag queens' very own language, Hindi, the film also explores other veiled issues related to the Indian [[gay]] community: the lurking threat of [[HIV/AIDS]]. {Source: imdb} [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386499]

'''Talespinner Children's Theatre (TCT)''' is a professional theater for child audiences based in  [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Its inaugural season began in early 2012, and since its inception has been based in the Reinberger Auditorium in the [[Gordon Square (Cleveland)#Gordon Square|Gordon Square]] neighborhood in the city's Near West Side.

TCT specializes in presenting imaginative original work inspired by or adapted from classic tales from world literature. To date, each play produced (adapted from fables, folktales, myths and literature) has been an original work commissioned by TCT from a Cleveland-area playwright. Presented on the thrust, platform stage in the Reinberger Auditorium, productions feature small ensembles of adult actors, utilizing puppets, dance, movement, music and song and fantastical costumes to bring each play to life for young audiences.&lt;ref name="TCT Homepage"&gt;[http://talespinnerchildrenstheatre.org] Home page&lt;/ref&gt;

TCT also provides theater-arts classes for children throughout the year.&lt;ref name="classes"&gt;[http://fox8.com/2013/09/06/my-town-talespinner-childrens-theatre-arts-classes/ Fox 8 - My Town: Talespinner Children’s Theatre Arts Classes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Artistic Director [[Alison Garrigan]], TCT has a board of directors and paid staff.&lt;ref name="TCT Homepage" /&gt;

'''Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori''' ('''National Māori Radio Network''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[radio network]], consisting of [[radio stations]] set up to serve the country's indigenous [[Māori people]]. Most stations receive contestable Government funding from [[Te Māngai Pāho]] to operate on behalf of affiliated [[iwi]] (tribes) or [[hapu]] (sub-tribes). Under their funding agreement, the stations must produce programmes in the local [[Māori language]] and actively promote local Māori culture.&lt;ref name=maorimedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Iwi Radio Coverage|url=http://www.maorimedia.co.nz/Iwi_Radio_Coverage.pdf|website=maorimedia.co.nz|publisher=Māori Media Network|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stations combine an English language [[urban contemporary]] playlist during breakfast and drive shows with [[full service (radio format)|full service broadcasting]] and Māori language programmes at other times of the day.&lt;ref name=sea92fm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlsson|first1=Sven|title=Contractors install the Whakaatu Whanaunga Trust’s far-reaching antenna last Friday|url=http://www.opotikinews.co.nz/webapps/i/88879/228222/602305|website=Opitiki News|publisher=Opitiki News|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have their own local shows, personalities and breakfast programmes, and broadcast through both terrestrial frequencies and online streams. There are regular segments updating people about local events, and teaching people Māori language and [[tikanga]] (customs).&lt;ref name="awards14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maoritelevision.com/news/latest-news/iwi-radio-stations-prepare-bi-annual-awards-night |title=Iwi Radio stations prepare for bi-annual awards night |publisher=[[Māori Television]] |author=Wepiha Te Kanawa |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations also produce local news shows, Māori music, educational programmes, comedies and dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irirangi.net/roopu-tautoko/history/whakaaro-ake.aspx|title=A brief history of Māori radio broadcasting|publisher=Te Whakaruruhau o Nga Reo Irirangi Māori|accessdate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024150324/http://www.irirangi.net/roopu-tautoko/history/whakaaro-ake.aspx|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tmpradio&gt;{{cite web|title=TMP Radio|url=http://www.tmp.govt.nz/iwi-radio-stations|website=[[Te Māngai Pāho]]|publisher=[[Te Māngai Pāho]]|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141007151341/http://www.tmp.govt.nz/iwi-radio-stations|archivedate=7 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network oversees the sharing of news bulletins, the pooling of resources and the production of network programmes. Manukau's Radio Waatea operates the network news service and produces network programmes. Its chief executive, [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]], also serves as association chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/227665/iwi-radio-happy-with-jackson's-governance-role|title=Iwi radio happy with Jackson's governance role|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programmes are shared and simulcast on a high-speed [[wide area network]].&lt;ref name=brianpauling /&gt; Almost every Māori person in New Zealand lives within the range of an iwi radio frequency, but transmission issues have been reported in remote areas.&lt;ref name=hiddensuccess /&gt;

==History==

===Early Māori broadcasting (1928-1978)===

The first Māori language to be broadcast on the radio were songs. A programme of Māori history, stories and songs were broadcast around the country on [[Waitangi Day]] 1928, and a regular programme featuring correct pronunciation of Māori began the same year. Māori broadcasters were appointed: Lou Paul of [[Ngāti Whātua]] in Auckland, Kīngi Tāhiwi of [[Ngāti Raukawa]] in Wellington, Te Ari Pītama of [[Ngāi Tahu]] in Christchurch, and broadcasting pioneer Airini Grenell of [[Ngāi Tahu]] in Dunedin.&lt;ref name=walkerfirstdecades&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=First decades of Māori radio|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-1|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first programme entirely in the Māori language was a news bulletin about [[World War II]] and local Māori issues, presented by Wiremu Bill Parker in 1940. Other shows followed, including ''Nga pao me nga pakiwaitara a te Maori: song and story of the Maori'', based in Wellington, and ''Te reo o te Māori'', broadcast from Napier.

Leo Fowler set up a Māori Programmes Section of the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1964, and, alongside Bill Kerekere took a mobile broadcasting studio to important Māori events. The department produced the English language Māori affairs programme ''Te puna wai kōrero'' and helped increase airtime for Māori music and show bands, including the Patea Māori Club hit [[Poi E]].&lt;ref name=walkerstory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=Story: Māori radio – reo irirangi|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Te Reo o Aotearoa, a Māori and Pacific unit of New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation's successor [[Radio New Zealand]], was set up in 1978 to produce Māori and Pacific programmes.&lt;ref name=patday1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Patrick|title=A history of broadcasting in New Zealand.

===Campaign for iwi stations (1978-1990)===

By the 1970s state broadcasters broadcast less than 90 minutes of Māori language and Māori interest programming a week, and there were growing concerns about the decline in fluent Māori speakers. [[Victoria University of Wellington]]’s Te Reo Māori Society campaigned for Māori radio, helping to set up Te Reo o Poneke, the first Māori-owned radio operation, using airtime on Wellington student radio station [[Radio Active (New Zealand)|Radio Active]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=walkerfirstiwi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=First iwi radio station|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-3|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other part-time Māori radio stations were also set up by young volunteers: [[Otaki, New Zealand|Ōtaki]]'s Te Reo o Raukawa in 1985, and [[Mangamuka]]'s Tautoko Radio and [[Ruatōria]]'s Radio Ngāti Porou in 1987.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork /&gt; The establishment of a Māori Radio Network was also discussed at a hui or gathering at [[Takapuwahia]] Marae in [[Porirua]].

[[Tairawhiti Polytechnic]] head of Māori studies Joe Te Rito operated a part-time station, Te Toa Takitini, on the polytechnic's [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] campus in 1988 and 1989, in an effort to broadcast [[Ngāti Kahungunu|Rongomaiwahine-Ngāti Kahungunu]]'s local elders and native speakers.&lt;ref name=kahungunuoff /&gt; A year later he relaunched it as full-time station Radio Kahungunu in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], to increase grammatical and spoken Māori language fluency, and expose the language to homes where no one spoke it.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=The iwi radio network|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-4|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Te Rito archived more than 2000 programme recordings, which he used to study and translate the tribe's distinctive [[dialect]], teach courses on the local spoken and written language, and provide an international model for preserving dialects in other communities in [[Asia]] and [[Pacific Ocean|the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=joeterito&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengthening Rongomaiwahine-Kahungunu Dialects through Archival Recordings|url=http://www.maramatanga.co.nz/project/kia-areare-ki-ng%C4%81-reo-o-ng%C4%81-t%C4%ABpuna|website=Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga|publisher=[[University of Auckland]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Te Rito, J.

===Waitangi Tribunal challenges (1990-1994)===

The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] deregulated the radio industry during the 1980s, selling the rights to use radio frequencies to private companies. The Wellington Māori Language Board, Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, was supporting the self-funded Te Upoko O Te Ika, and claimed the Government's sell off of broadcasting spectrum amounted to theft.&lt;ref name=geetheft&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gee|first1=Debbie|title=Airwaves theft?|journal=Onfilm|date=August 1989|volume=6|issue=5|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the New Zealand Māori Council jointly, it challenged the spectrum sell off and the lack of support for Māori broadcasting. In one case brought through the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], a permanent commission set up to investigate breaches of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], they argued the treaty gave them sovereignty over the airwaves and broadcast spectrum. They sought a share of the proceeds from the sale of rights to spectrum frequencies,&lt;ref name=maorislay&gt;{{cite news|title=Maoris lay claim to air waves|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=30 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequencies for their own use.&lt;ref name=drinnandeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drinnan|first1=John|title=Maoris get poor deal, court told|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=5 October 1990|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases followed through the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]], with one case reaching the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council in London]].&lt;ref name=walkerfirstiwi /&gt;

The Government addressed the claim by instructing [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to broadcast more Māori programmes,&lt;ref name=shanahan /&gt; and funding the establishment of Māori-owned and Māori-controlled radio stations.&lt;ref name=walkerkaranga&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Ranginui|title=Te Karanga : Maori radio|agency=[[Metro Magazine]]|issue=141|date=March 1993|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty one iwi radio stations were started between 1989 and 1994.

===Aotearoa Radio era (1994-1997)===

Several iwi applied for Government funding to establish radio stations in areas with significant Māori populations, developing an iwi-based radio network. However, the new stations struggled to survive as budgets did not cover the costs, volunteer staff lost enthusiasm, staff training was inadequate, and funding was insufficient to create professional career paths for Māori radio announcers and managers. Three stations broadcast on AM frequencies, costing an extra $100,000 a year than FM frequencies, but received the same flat rate of funding.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork /&gt; 
Radio Ngāti Porou station manager Ngahiwi Apanui set up a joint venture between iwi stations, the national advertising agency Māori Media Network, in 1994 to increase each station's sources of revenue.&lt;ref name="ruahistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.raukawafm.co.nz/index.php?pag=cms&amp;id=169&amp;p=history.html|website=Ruakawa FM|publisher=Ruakawa FM|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Māori Communication Network was set up in 1997.&lt;ref name=kennedystyle&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Erin|title=Maori radio changes style|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=17 June 1997|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the first Māori language radio network, Aotearoa Radio or Irirrangi Radio, began in Auckland on 18 July 1988 on a short-term warrant, broadcasting on 1XO 603 AM.&lt;ref name=teiwi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maori radio begins in Auckland|journal=Te Iwi o Aotearoa|date=August 1998|issue=12|pages=14–15|issn=0113-4523}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained a full-time warrant in 1989, extending to Tauranga on 1XV 603 AM, Wellington on 2XO 1323 AM and Christchurch on 3XQ 1323 AM.&lt;ref name=awaiting&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drinnan|first1=John|title=Aotearoa awaiting permanent warrant|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=30 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio and television producer [[Ray Waru]] was the chief executive.&lt;ref name=randomwaru&gt;{{cite web|title=Secrets and Treasures: Our stories told through the objects at Archives New Zealand by Ray Waru|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.nz/books/ray-waru/secrets-and-treasures-our-stories-told-through-the-objects-at-archives-new-zealand-9781869796891.aspx|website=randomhouse.co.nz|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher, lecturer and consultant Haare Williams served as the general manager.&lt;ref name=comethaare&gt;{{cite web|title=Haare Williams|url=http://www.comet.org.nz/wawcs0143729/idDetails=178/COMET'-s-kaumatua.html|website=comet.org.nz|publisher=COMET|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aotearoa Radio operated alongside the iwi radio stations, and broadcast a range of programmes on Māori issues, and gave airtime to Māori women at a time when women and Māori were both underrepresented in radio.&lt;ref name=kippingbreaking&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kipping|first1=Pat|title=Breaking sound barriers : Irirangi women|journal=Broadsheet|date=October 1990|volume=182|pages=14–17|issn=0110-8603}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tipene O'Regan]], Beverly Adlam, Pauline Butt, Toby Curtis, Wiremui Ohia, [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Dalvanius Prime]], [[Moana Maniapoto|Moana Maniapoto-Jackson]], Neil Gudsell, James Waerea, Libby Hakaraia, Trada Chadwick and Koro Wetere were involved in the Māori Radio Board during this period.

[[Ngāti Whātua]] took a leading role in iwi radio during the 1990s and early 2000s through its subsidiary Mai Media.

==Operations==

===Funding===

Iwi radio stations receive a share $11.7 million in Government funding each year, and can each be eligible for an annual Government grant of $350,000. They also source funding from sponsorship, advertising and leasing of studio space.&lt;ref name=sunfmawa&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun FM - Te Reo Irirangi o te Mānuka Tūtahi|url=http://www.ngatiawa.iwi.nz/cms/view/sunfm.aspx|website=Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Awa|publisher=Ngāti Aaw|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government-funded stations must broadcast at least eight hours of Māori language content between 6am and 12pm each day of the week.&lt;ref name=brianpauling&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Pauling|author-first=Brian|title="New Zealand - A Radio Paradise?" in: Radio in Small Nations: Production, Programmes, Audiences|editor1-last=Hand|editor1-first=Richard J.|editor2-last=Traynor|editor2-first=Mary|date=2014|publisher=University of Wales Press|location=[[Cardiff]]|isbn=0708325440|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Station managers are also usually required to be proficient in the Māori language.&lt;ref name=awamanager&gt;{{cite web|title=Awa FM station manager|url=http://www.mahi.co.nz/details/4855#.VSfXz_mUf50|website=Mahi,co.nz|publisher=Taea Limited|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 0.9% and 1.2% of each station's annual revenue is returned to the music industry through [[Recorded Music NZ]],&lt;ref name=radiotvbw&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio &amp; Television Broadcast &amp; Webcast|url=http://www.recordedmusic.co.nz/portfolio/broadcast-webcast/|website=recordedmusic.co.nz|publisher=[[Recorded Music NZ]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each station treated differently for licensing purposes.&lt;ref name=apraamcos&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio|url=http://apraamcos.co.nz/music-customers/licence-types/radio/|website=apraamcos.co,nz|publisher=APRA AMCOD New Zealand|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2018, the Iwi Radio Network received an extra $12 million to cover new operating costs and to assess the feasibility of expanding the network with new iwi stations, and $1.5 million towards archiving historic Māori language programmes. Māori Affairs Minister [[Pita Sharples]] said the extra funding would increase Māori language content and programme quality, and would ensure interviews with dead elders would be not be lost.&lt;ref name=boostfour&gt;{{cite news|title=$12m boost over four years for iwi radio stations|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1405/S00254/12m-boost-over-four-years-for-iwi-radio-stations.htm|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[New Zealand Government]]|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was specifically allocated to increasing community engagement with iwi stations, increasing Māori language hours and expanding the number of people the network reached.&lt;ref name=estimatestovote&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori Affairs Committee 2014/15 Estimates for Vote Māori Affairs: Written questions 124 133|url=http://www.parliament.nz/resource/mi-nz/50SCMA_EVI_00DBSCH_EST_13173_1_A398907/4e85fcc31245ec1b286985029c2c3f0ddb0bed29|website=parliament.nz|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network chairman Willie Jackson said many iwi stations were struggling, and welcomed and desperately needed the extra funding.&lt;ref name=wikitoria&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Wikitōria|title=Iwi radio stations receive a $12 million boost|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/regional/iwi-radio-stations-receive-12-million-boost|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[Te Kāea]]|publisher=[[Māori Television]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role and effectiveness===

A two-year [[Massey University]] survey of 30,000 people, published in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results were consistent with those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to stay in touch with their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills.&lt;ref name=hiddensuccess&gt;{{cite news|title=The hidden success of Māori radio|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2003/press_releases/01_08_03a.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|publisher=[[Massey University]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further [[Auckland University of Technology]] research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.&lt;ref name=diversityreportage&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robie|first1=David|title=Diversity reportage in Aotearoa: demographics and the rise of the ethnic media|journal=Pacific Journalism Review|date=1 May 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=67–91|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/2313/pjr_15%281%29_6_diversityreportage_pp67-911.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|accessdate=20 September 2015|location=Auckland|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Māori language advocates have recognised radio broadcasting as having a small but significant role in bringing Māori language to New Zealand audiences for more than half a century, particularly since the establishment of radio stations under iwi control. [[Postcolonialists]] have also suggested the Iwi Radio Network is a form of decolonisation, a means of achieving decolonisation, and a way to assert cultural identity and challenge [[Pākeha]] cultural dominance.&lt;ref name=cherrylsmith /&gt; Massey University research in 2006 assessed five year qualitative and quantitative research, literature on the long term history of the Māori language, comparative studies between Māori and Irish radio, and [[Tūhoe]]'s experiences setting up a radio station, and found the Iwi Radio Network had a positive impact on Māori language revitalisation.&lt;ref name=tereopaho&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matamua|first1=Rangiānehu|title=Te Reo Pāho : Māori radio and language revitalisation : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Māori Studies at Massey University|journal=Thesis|date=2006|url=http://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1864/02_whole.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|publisher=[[Massey University]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations have failed to counter a decline in the number of fluent Māori speakers in the 2010s, but continue to be part of the strategy to promote it.&lt;ref name=tereoprecious&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Te reo Maori far too precious to be lost|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11296481|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One award, for Iwi Station of the Year, recognises radio networks or individual stations which have performed outstandingly as a champion of Māori language and culture. The station is judged on the quality and effectiveness of its Māori language use, and its programmes, client relations, community involvements, news and current affairs, personality strength, promotions and marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name=iwiyear&gt;{{cite web|title=Iwi Station of the Year|url=http://radioawards.co.nz/awards/detail/cid/20|website=radioawards.co.nz|publisher=[[New Zealand Radio Awards]]|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumeke FM won Iwi Station of the Year in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Radio Awards "Iwi station of the year"|url=http://tumekefm.co.nz/?p=3665|website=tumekefm.co.nz|publisher=Tumeke FM|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngati Porou won the award in 2013, but faced criticism about its management and financial oversight a few months later.&lt;ref name=troubleiwi&gt;{{cite news|title=Trouble at Iwi Station of the Year|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/te-karere-news/trouble-iwi-radio-station-year-6058144|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=[[Te Karere]]|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony James Heaton [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''' (born 11 October 1954) is a British sculptor, [[disability rights]] activist and arts administrator, who was awarded an OBE in 2013 for services to the arts and the [[disability arts]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was CEO of the arts charity [[Shape Arts|Shape]] until March 2017. In 2012, he won the competition to produce an installation celebrating [[Channel 4]]'s involvement in the [[London 2012 Paralympic Games]].  This produced his 'Monument for the Unintended Performer'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early years==

Heaton was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]], in 1954, the son of a [[coppersmith]].  When, at the age of 16, a motor bike accident left him with a [[spinal injury]], he switched from a [[comprehensive school]] to a local arts college at [[Southport]].  From 1972, he was self-employed as artist, sign writer, disc jockey, record shop proprietor, progressive rock band member and mural painter. According to a Disability Arts Online profile, at this period "Heaton gathered enormous expertise and self-reliance whilst appearing to drift aimlessly".&lt;ref name=square&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony_heaton_profile |title=Tony Heaton: Squaring The Circle |publisher=disability arts online |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he enrolled on a visual arts degree at [[Lancaster University]] whilst earning a living as a sign-painter.&lt;ref name=square/&gt;

A contemporary of [[Andy Goldsworthy]], Heaton experimented with environmental sculpture on sands at [[Morecambe Bay]]. Lancaster's head of sculpture, Paul Hatton, noted that the marks left by Heaton were immediately distinguishable from the footprints of his fellow students and urged him to develop work about this. Heaton states that, "A chance comment about how the marks left in the sand by my feet and crutches made my tracks immediately identifiable became the catalyst for a whole series of works relating to disability and my interaction with the environment".&lt;ref name="square" /&gt; Heaton exhibited a plaster cast of his feet and stick imprints, his first piece of disability art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyheaton.co.uk/squareinthecircle.htm |title=Squareinthecircle? |publisher=tonyheaton.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic career ==

Heaton’s early sculptures often use what Disability Arts in London magazine described as "the everyday impedimenta of disability: [[Street fundraising|collecting can]]s, [[wheelchair|NHS wheelchairs]], [[X-ray]]s, [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part M. Access to and use of Buildings|Part M of the Building Regulations]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; But his work contradicts the normal associations of such materials by turning them into "profound and joyously witty statements about the nature of our oppression".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tony Heaton...exposed - a retrospective |journal=Disability Arts in London |volume=Issue 107 |date=November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early piece, "Springback" (1990), is an assemblage including a spinal X-Ray juxtaposed above the [[Shock absorber|shock absorber spring]]s of a scrapped motorcycle, referring to the accident which caused his impairment and the metal strengthening spring placed inside his spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony-heaton-interview |title=Interview: John O'Donoghue talks to Tony Heaton, Shape CEO |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Shaken..not Stirred' (1991) consisted of a seven-feet high pyramid of 1,760 [[Street fundraising|charity collecting cans]], its ascending ranks of red plastic referring to the hierarchical nature of the charity system.  The whole edifice was brought crashing to the ground when Heaton threw an artificial leg at it, suggesting that the hierarchical system could be destroyed by the collective power of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, A. |chapter=Choices, Rights and Cabaret |editor1=Swain, J. |editor2=French S. |title=Disability on Equal Terms |publisher=Sage |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4129-1987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his work has developed, it has embodied ideas about disability and impairment.  For instance, "Split" (1995) is a [[woodcarving]] made from a piece of ash discarded by a wood turner as useless because it has a [[Shakes (timber)|shake]]; a fault running through it.  Heaton saw this as "indicative of a society that sees only perfection and disregards all that is damaged or perceived as impaired".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[File:Wheelchair sculpture 6493.JPG|thumb|Great Britain from a Wheelchair]]
The 1994 sculpture, ‘Great Britain from a Wheelchair’ is a map of Britain made from two grey NHS wheelchairs.  "A delightful game, it forms a wonderful repudiation of the value judgement ('This is for some tragic bastard', in Heaton’s words) implicit in the wheelchairs."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; An image of this work was chosen by the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive as an example of work from the ‘golden age’ of disability arts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-35063050 |title=The 'golden age' of disability arts - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 Paralympics  Heaton was invited to redesign 'Great Britain From a Wheelchair' as lecterns for [[Lord Coe]] and [[Philip Craven|Sir Phillip Craven]] during the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton |publisher=Disability Arts International |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was commissioned to produce ‘Monument to the Unintended Performer’, an installation for the [[Big 4 (sculpture)|Big 4]]  sculpture sited outside Channel Four’s offices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-unveils-new-big-4-installation |title=Channel 4 unveils new 'Big 4' installation |publisher=Channel 4 |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought together three elements in addition to the Big 4: the first based on the classical Greek sculpture [[Discobolus]], the discus thrower, evoking the spirit of the Olympics; the second element, a circle, representing the wheel of the international symbol of access; and lastly, the introduction of gold, silver and bronze considers hierarchy. Heaton stated: "I wanted to use the structure of the Big 4 as one of four elements that would fuse together to form a new cohesive piece - which would provoke thought and celebrate Channel 4's involvement and commitment to the Paralympics. The subtext is the assertion that disabled people are almost always the object of scrutiny and curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/steps/features/clare-amsel-produces-the-paralympics/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton &amp;#124; Lancaster University |publisher=Lancaster.ac.uk |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/07/public-art-and-disability |title=Public art and disability: Getting noticed |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Gold Lamé', included in the 2014 exhibition Art of The Lived Experiment, is an [[Cars for wheelchair users|invalid car]] covered in [[gold leaf]].  The title puns on the word "lame". Heaton states that the [[Invacar]] has been “transformed from prosthetic to sculpture, transmuted from spazz blue to gold, from Lame to Lamé”, mirroring his own life adjustments, where he says, "I transmuted from biker to invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoublenegative.co.uk/2014/11/i-always-avoided-referring-to-disability-in-my-work-because-i-was-afraid-to-seem-pitiful-the-transformation-of-dadafest/ |title="I Always Avoided Referring To Disability In My Work, Because I Was Afraid To Seem Pitiful": The Transformation Of DaDaFest |publisher=The Double Negative |date=2014-11-04 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest-2014-art-of-the-lived-experiment-review |title=Review: DaDaFest International 2014: Art of the Lived Experiment |publisher=disability arts online |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holton Lee ==

From 1997 to 2007, Heaton was based in [[Dorset]], as Director of the [[Holton Lee Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/movers-tony-heaton-chief-executive-shape/management/article/800469 |title=Movers: Tony Heaton, chief executive, Shape |publisher=Third Sector |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a mix of environmental, artistic and spiritual activities, with short stay residential facilities for Disabled people, in an [[SSSI]] comprising 350 acres of woodland, reed bed and heath land landscape adjacent to [[Poole Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrysidemobility.org/locations/holton-lee |title=Holton Lee |publisher=Countryside Mobility |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaton developed a 10-year strategic plan for the organisation: a contemporary arts and education programme based on a series of accessible buildings including a gallery and artists’ studios, which would enable a new programme of artistic work, a growth in residential capacity and a focus for disability arts.

The first of these, Faith House gallery, designed by [[Tony Fretton]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;was hailed by Jonathan Glancey in the Guardian as ‘one of the most beautiful new buildings in Britain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/07/architecture.artsfeatures |title=Tony Fretton's Faith House &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Heaton organised the DA21 Disability Arts Conference at Holton Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/2000_2003 |title=2000 - 2003 |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned the inaugural conference to discuss the establishment of what would become the [[National Disability Arts Collection and Archive]]. The idea then envisaged was to create a purpose-built archive as part of the developing Holton Lee campus. This was abandoned after Heaton moved on. NDACA will now take the form of an interactive website and catalogue, after receiving funding of nearly £1 million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndaca.org.uk/about-ndaca |title=about ndaca - National Disability Arts Collection &amp; Archive |publisher=Ndaca.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape ==

In 2007 Heaton became CEO of [[Shape Arts]], the arts and disability charity founded by dancer Gina Levete. He brought to the organisation a new emphasis on disability arts and professional opportunities for artists.

He instituted the Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary, which provides 3-month bursaries for disabled artists to undertake residencies at leading visual arts institutions.  These have included the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Camden Arts Centre]], [[Spike Island Artspace|Spike Island]], [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]], the Bluecoat Gallery and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall|New Art Gallery Walsall]]. The bursary is named after the late sculptor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/adam-reynolds-memorial-bursary |title=News &amp;#124; Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Heaton had a close friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/adam-reynolds |title=Adam Reynolds: an Obituary |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early winners were Caroline Cardus, Aaron Williamson, Sally Booth and Noëmi Lakmaier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Adam-Reynolds-Memorial-Bursary-Shape-The-First-Four |title=Discussion: John O'Donoghue gives an overview of the Shape's Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary: The First Four |publisher=disability arts online |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also created the Shape Open, an annual open exhibition of artwork by disabled and non-disabled artists created in response to a disability-centred theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/shape-open |title=News &amp;#124; Shape Open |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition's patron is [[Yinka Shonibare]], at whose Guest Projects space in Hackney, London the 2016 exhibition took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/yinka-shonibare-to-host-shape-arts-annual-open-exhibition |title=Yinka Shonibare To Host Shape Arts’ Annual Open Exhibition |publisher=Artlyst.com |date=2015-12-17 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2016/02/yinka-shonibare-hosts-shape-open-exhibition/ |author=Jude Jweihan |title=Yinka Shonibare Hosts Shape Open Exhibition – Eastlondonlines |publisher=Eastlondonlines.co.uk |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spell phones==
Spell Phones are devices based on a real life [[cellphone]]s, but are adapted to provide functions for magic and spellbeads as well as provide the standard functions of a normal cellphone. "Spell Calls" are used to cast spells on other trollz across long distances.  To initiate a Spell Call, the caller places a spell bead in the spell bead slot after inciting the [[incantation]] and then dialing the phone number of the intended recipient and hitting the cast button. The Spell Phone then transfers the spell through the phone line and when the recipient picks up the phone the spell is released through the receiver of the phone. It is a useful function that allows trollz to cast spells across long distances, but a lot of teenagers misuse the function and instead use it to play [[pranks]].

The '''World Architecture Festival''' (WAF) is an annual festival and awards ceremony, one of the most important events dedicated to the architecture and development industry. The first four events were held in [[Barcelona]], from 2008 to 2011, at which point the festival moved to [[Singapore]] for four years. Since 2016, host cities have included [[Berlin]] and [[Amsterdam]]. At the festival around 200 shortlisted projects compete for awards in 31 categories. One of these projects is awarded the World Building of the Year title. All the entries are published in the World Buildings Directory online database&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=Online database|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/|utgiver=World Buildings Directory|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The World Architecture Festival was first held in 2008 as a "festival and live awards competition dedicated to celebrating and sharing architectural excellence from across the globe." The first four festivals were held in Barcelona; since 2012 the annual events have been hosted by [[Singapore]], [[Berlin]], and [[Amsterdam]]. Several hundred projects are entered in the competition for the awards and more than 200 of these are shortlisted for live presentation at the festival. All the presentations of the entries are collected in the World Buildings Directory. The architects pay a submission fee to enter a project for a WAF Award and travel to where the festival is arranged to present the project live if it is shortlisted. The entries are voluntary and the festival does not control who submits projects. In 2011 the Inside Festival (for interior architecture and design) was added in the same venue and arranged at the same time as WAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|forfatter=John Hill|tittel=Talking WAF - Interview with Paul Finch (Email interview)|url=http://www.world-architectsXX.com/pages/waf-interview-paul-finch|utgiver=world-architects, eMagazine|dato=04.08.2013#sthash.NrKVjdbX.dpuf|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Zamina mina (Zangaléwa)'''" is a 1986 hit song, originally sung by a [[makossa]] group from [[Cameroon]] originally named [[Golden Sounds]], popular in Africa for their use of  dance and costumes. Due to the song's popularity, the group renamed to ''Zangaléwa'' during its mainstream success. Zangaléwa pays tribute to African [[skirmisher]]s (a.k.a. [[tirailleur]]s) during [[World War II]]. Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves,&lt;ref name=Shakira&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/shakira-remixes-african-hit-for-world-cup/ NYT: Shakira Remixes African Hit for World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; and used the song in fund-raising efforts for Comic Relief.

==Background==
{{contradictory|date=January 2015}}

The languages present in the song's lyrics ([[Duala language|Douala]], [[French language|French]], [[patois]], and the [[pidgin English]] of some parts of West Africa)&lt;ref name=Kojidie&gt;[http://www.emilekojidie.com/lyrics/zangalewa_lyrics.html "Emile Kojidie: The Golden Voice of the Golden Sounds."]&lt;/ref&gt; make clear that the song originates from the area of Cameroon but the circumstances surrounding the time of the song's origin are less clear. Some sources indicate that the lyrics are, at the very least, a lament from the point of view of a single soldier,&lt;ref name=Kojidie /&gt; but other aspects of the song, including the way it is frequently performed (see cultural context section), has led to conflicting claims that the song is a tribute to African soldiers of World War II or a criticism of Africans who collaborated with European colonial authorities.&lt;ref name=Kojidie /&gt;

The song is still used today almost everywhere in Africa by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen, and their supporters, usually during training or for rallying.&lt;ref name=Shakira/&gt; It is particularly popular in Cameroon, where it is used as a marching song or rallying cry.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The song was popularized in Colombia under the name "the Military"{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} by West African [[DJ]]s based in Cartagena.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Cultural context==

In the music video for the 1986 release and in other performances of the song, performers often dress in military uniforms, wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes in certain places with pillows to give the appearance of being well-off and associated with European colonial authorities. This appearance and the lyrics, according to some music historians,{{Who|date=June 2010}} is a criticism of African military officers who were in league with whites and profited from the oppression of their own people during the era of European imperialist colonization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Some elements of the song incorporate Cameroonian slang and Cameroonian military jargon from World War II.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

According to Jean Paul Zé Bella, the lead singer of Golden Sounds, the chorus came "from Cameroonian sharpshooters who had created a slang for better communication between them during the Second World War";{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} the band initially recreated the fast pace of the military communication in their first arrangements of the song.

==Variants, covers, and sampling==

The song became internationally popular when the international pop star [[Shakira]] released a variant (as a tribute to African music) titled "[[Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)]]" in anticipation of the [[2010 World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freshlyground.com/#/news/ Freshlyground - Official blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.world2010cup.com/news/194/zangalewa-the-original-song-from-which-waka-waka-borrows-chorus.html | date = May 2010| title = Zangalewa - the original song from which Waka Waka borrows chorus| accessdate = May 2, 2010| publisher = World2010Cup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
