      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">In [[fluid dynamics]], an '''adverse [[pressure]] gradient''' occurs when the [[static pressure]] increases in the direction of the flow. Mathematically this is expressed as:
&lt;math&gt;dP/dx&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for a flow in the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction.
This is important for [[boundary layer]]s, increasing the fluid pressure is akin to increasing the [[potential energy]] of the fluid, leading to a reduced [[kinetic energy]] and a [[deceleration]] of the [[fluid]]. Since the fluid in the inner part of the boundary layer is slower, it is more greatly affected by the increasing pressure gradient. For a large enough pressure increase, this fluid may slow to zero velocity or even become reversed. When flow reversal occurs, the flow is said to be separated from the surface. This has very significant consequences in [[aerodynamics]] since [[flow separation]] significantly modifies the pressure distribution along the surface and hence the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] characteristics.

[[Turbulent]] boundary layers tend to be able to sustain an adverse pressure gradient better than an equivalent [[laminar flow|laminar]] boundary layer. The more efficient mixing which occurs in a turbulent boundary layer transports kinetic energy from the edge of the boundary layer to the low [[momentum]] flow at the solid surface, often preventing the separation which would occur for a laminar boundary layer under the same conditions. This physical fact has led to a variety of schemes to actually produce turbulent boundary layers when boundary layer separation is dominant at high [[Reynolds number]]s. The dimples on a [[golf]] ball, the fuzz on a [[tennis]] ball, or the seams on a [[baseball]] are good examples. Aeroplane [[wing]]s are often engineered with [[vortex generator]]s on the upper surface to produce a turbulent boundary layer.

'''Artificial gravity''' is a common theme in [[fiction]], particularly [[science fiction]].

==Rotational gravity== 
In the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and the same-named novel, a rotating centrifuge in the [[Discovery One|''Discovery'']] spacecraft provides artificial gravity. The people could walk, run, sit, or sleep along a curving "floor" that continually rotates inside the exterior shell of the spacecraft; the entry from the non-rotating part of the ship is through the centrifuge's central hub. To film the effect, a rotating circular set was used with the actors at the bottom; the set turned as the actors walked or jogged along the curved floor. One scene required one actor to be strapped in place while the set (and actor) rotated and the other actor walked towards him. The movie also features a large rotating space station; its full-scale interior set was a section of curved floor that did not rotate.

In ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', the 1982 novel and second in a series of four by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], the ''[[Leonov (fictional spacecraft)|Leonov]]'' spacecraft does not have the "luxury" of gravity, yet in ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'', [[Peter Hyams]]' 1984 [[science fiction film|sci-fi film]] adaptation and sequel to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', [[Syd Mead]]'s ''Leonov'' spacecraft design in the movie features [[centrifugal force]] [[artificial gravity]] very similar to the Europa One mission in ''[[Europa Report]]'', a 2013 [[science fiction]] film.  In the ''2010'' movie, a Russian unmanned probe mysteriously disappears near the surface of Europa omitting the novel's premise of a space race to Jupiter with the joint Soviet-American mission following a faster Chinese ship, the ''[[Tsien (fictional spacecraft)|Tsien]]'' that must land on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] to refuel with water from the icy moon. The ''Tsien'' is ambushed and destroyed by an indigenous Europan life-form attracted to lights stranding the only survivor - also strikingly similar to events in ''Europa Report''.

[[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[Ringworld]]'' featured a gigantic habitat encircling a star, which created artificial gravity through rotation.  Niven also makes a reference to the [[Coriolis effect]] when the protagonists see what looks like a giant eye above the horizon.  When they get closer, they realise that it is in fact a hurricane, but rotating about an axis parallel to the ground rather than perpendicular to it.  Large hurricanes on Earth rotate the way they do due to the Coriolis effect. A number of early [[Known Space]] and [[Man-Kzin Wars]] stories also make use of rotational gravity, prior to the adoption of "gravity polarizer" technology which generates artificial gravity fields.

In the [[Gundam]] universe, gigantic [[space habitat]]s similar to [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, called Colonies, are an important aspect to the plot. They spin to generate artificial gravity.

In the [[anime]] ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', the Bebop possesses a ringed area that generates artificial gravity and is often seen being used (with the rest of the ship not rotating).

The book ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' and the sequels featured an alien construct similar to an [[O'Neill habitat]] which was able to generate approximately 0.6g on the intentionally habitable ground section. The plot employed significant use of the difference in strength of artificial gravity as an object approaches the center of the rotating cylinder.

In the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] made extensive use of rotational gravity in its [[space station]]s and some larger military vessels, as well as civilian cruise ships.  It has been suggested that the cruise ships would alter their rate of spin gradually en route to match the destination, helping to acclimate the passengers to the new gravity they would find upon arrival. Earlier Earth Force ships [[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|are shown]] using straps and harnesses to hold crew in place, and the [[Minbari]] later share the secret of artificial gravity as part of the [[Interstellar Alliance]].

In the stories based on [[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri|Sid Meier's ''Alpha Centauri'']], the Unity provided artificial gravity by spinning, though the game made allusions to less conventional technologies developed later on.

In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s [[Gaian Trilogy|''Gaian'' trilogy]] (''Titan'', ''Wizard'', and ''Demon''), the title world Gaia, being a [[torus]] with a diameter of 1300 kilometers, spins at a rate of one revolution per sixty-one minutes, producing an apparent gravity of one-quarter ''g''.

In [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]], [[Orbital (The Culture)|Orbitals]] are made ten million kilometres in circumference so that they spin with a rate that gives a natural day/night cycle while the center is in orbit around a star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm Iain M. Banks: A Few Notes on the Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', the main location of the story is an artificial ringworld that creates artificial gravity by computer-controlled rotational spin (inspired by the aforementioned [[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[Ringworld]]'' but also uses some form of field or other artificially generated gravity as it is stated in Halo: The Flood, the ring world does not spin nearly fast enough to create the amount of gravity it possesses. "Halo" (or "Installation 04") is approximately 10,000 km in diameter and is eventually destroyed by the same forces keeping it in operation. A fusion explosion weakens part of the ringworld, and centrifugal forces tear the ring apart.

In ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' and the film of the same title, the ''Hermes'' spacecraft achieves artificial gravity by design; it employs a ringed structure, at whose periphery forces around 40% of Earth's gravity are experienced. Such artificial gravity is similar in strength to the [[gravity of Mars|gravity on mars]]. At the center of the ringed structure, lack of gravity makes the astronauts practically weightless.

In the ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|Expanse]]'' series by [[James S. A. Corey]], space stations generate artificial gravity by rotating, as do spun-up, hollowed-out asteroids, usually at around 0.3 g. Moving ships under constant thrust also simulate gravity by [[Artificial Gravity#Linear_acceleration|linear acceleration]].

In the video game ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]'', the various large space stations seen throughout the galaxy rotate in order to create artificial gravity for the people who live and work on them.  One class of these stations is the Coriolis starport, in reference to the eponymous effect it uses to generate gravity.

In the movie ''[[Interstellar (film)]]'' co-produced by ''[[Christopher Nolan]]'', the ''Endurance'' space stations and capsules create artificial gravity by rotating at a certain rotational frequency to simulate gravity. At the outer ring of the structure, the gravity experienced is similar to that on Earth.

==Field generators==
In many [[science fiction]] stories, there are artificial gravity generators that create a gravitational field based on a mass that does not exist. It helps the story by creating a more Earth-like [[spacecraft|spaceship]], and in the case of a movie or television program, it helps the production because it is a lot cheaper than the special effects needed to simulate [[weightlessness]].

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, artificial gravity is achieved by the use of "gravity plating" embedded in a starship's deck.
*In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", the gravity plating of the [[USS Defiant (NCC-1764)|USS ''Defiant'']] is used to fend off a [[Gorn (Star Trek)|Gorn]] attack by greatly increasing the ship's gravity in one section. The Gorn attacker was forced down to the floor and immobilized, where the [[Jonathan Archer#The_Mirror_Archer|"Mirror" Jonathan Archer]] easily killed him.
*[[Benjamin Sisko]] once built a replica of an ancient [[Bajoran]] solar-sailer spacecraft. As these craft were not normally equipped with artificial gravity, Sisko added gravity plating to make it easier for him and [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] to pilot the vessel. (''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|DS9]]'' episode "[[Explorers (DS9 episode)|Explorers]]")
*Star Trek novels more specifically explain the specifics of artificial gravity technology. It is often explained as making use of virtual gravitons.

In [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', set thousands of years in the future, gravity field generators not only provide gravity for the people inside the ship, but also reduce [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] of ships such as the ''[[Andromeda Ascendant]]'' to just under a kilogram. This greatly increases the efficiency of their Magneto-Plasma Dynamic Drive, allowing them to go from a stop to percentages of light speed very quickly. It can also be easily manipulated to do things like increase gravity and immobilize intruders (though prepared intruders can use an antigravity harness to prepare for this possibility), and reversed to expel things from the ship.

In the anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', gravity simulation plays a key part in various characters' training regime. It is also used to demonstrate the characters' increasing strength. For example, when [[Goku]] first arrives on King Kai's planet, he is nearly crushed by the gravity, which is ten times that of Earth's. By the end of his visit, nearly a year later, he is able to move at great speed under such conditions. This method of training gradually appears more and more in the universe, and the gravity gets stronger as well. Ten times Earth's gravity goes from a seemingly indomitable level of opposition to nothing, and several hundred times Earth's gravity becomes the standard. [[Vegeta]] even had a Gravity Room built into his house.

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Sontaran Experiment]]'', a [[Sontaran]] used similar technology to make a bar above a human very heavy, so that his friends had to lift it up with as much force as they could to prevent him being crushed. The Sontaran gradually increased the bar's weight as part of an experiment to study not only their physical strength but also their loyalty, as their friend had recently attempted to betray them.

In the Disney film [[Treasure Planet]], the ship used by the protagonists use a device which stimulates artificial gravity, keeping them firmly on the deck of the ship.

In the [[BioWare]] series ''[[Mass Effect]]'', the eponymous "mass effect" is responsible for the manipulation of gravity or kinetic forces(if the mass effect field is alternating), caused by subjecting a quantity of fictional "element zero" to an electric current. A negative current reduces the mass of anything within the field, a positive current increases mass, and an alternating current will create a barrier force of immense power that can shield or crush anything the force is directed at. Mass effect is used in [[faster than light travel]], [[artificial gravity]] on spacecraft, weapon technology, kinetic barriers and shields, and much more. Individuals exposed to element zero are known as "biotics," the nodules of element zero embedded into their nervous systems allow them to use neural impulses to create mass effect fields themselves if the power of the element is amplified with a biotic amp, granting specific types of abilities such as certain types of telekinesis. An individual exposed to this "eezo" would often rather cause cancer.

In the video game ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', artificial gravity plates are used to simulate an Earth-like environment in outer space. In several levels, gravity plating is off and the player has to navigate in weightlessness using 'Zero-Gravity Boots', similar to [[magnetic boots]]. Defective gravity plates are also encountered sometimes, which push objects upward rather than downward with great force, killing the player or enemies instantly if they step on them.

In the 2014 film, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', Peter Quill uses a device called a "Gravity Mine" which creates a powerful short-range artificial gravity field that attracts all nearby objects towards it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">The '''Association for the Sociology of Religion (ASR)''' is an academic association with more than 700 members worldwide. It publishes a journal, the ''[[Sociology of Religion: A Quarterly Review]]'' and holds meetings at the same venues and times as the [[American Sociological Association]].&lt;ref name="ERS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swatos|first=William H.|author2=Kivisto, Peter|title=Encyclopedia of religion and society|publisher=Rowman Altamira|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7619-8956-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TMFoMFe-D8C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=%22association+for+the+sociology+of+religion%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22association%20for%20the%20sociology%20of%20religion%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ASR was founded by Catholic sociologists in Chicago in 1938 as the American Catholic Sociological Society.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; The organization adopted its present name in 1970, reflecting changes in the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s policy that led to greater openness towards other faiths. It has long since become a base for sociological research on religion without regard to belief, creed, or religious orientation. 

==Activities==
The association publishes a journal, ''Sociology of Religion: A Quarterly Review'', as well as a quarterly newsletter.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; It is the co-publisher of an annual series entitled ''Religion and the Social Order''.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; The association provides research grants.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; 

The ASR, which has over 700 members worldwide, continues its historical practice of holding its meetings at the same venues and times as the [[American Sociological Association]], allowing mutual cross-fertilisation between the two associations.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; Past presidents of the ASR include [[David G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5034">'''CLIVAR''' (climate variability and predictability) is a component of the [[World Climate Research Programme]]. Its purpose is to describe and understand climate variability and predictability on seasonal to centennial time-scales, identify the physical processes responsible for [[climate change]] and develop modeling and predictive capabilities for climate modelling.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/about/about-clivar|title = About CLIVAR|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The following is an approximate timeline of CLIVAR and its precedents:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

* 1985: The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated the TOGA (Tropical-Ocean Global Atmosphere) (1985-1995), to study interannual variability driven by the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropics.
* 1990: The WCRP began the first observational phase of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (1990-1997)
* 1991: Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) called on a group of experts to come together and consider the possible future directions for climate research, building on the foundation laid by TOGA and WOCE.
* 1992: The deliberations of the Joint Scientific Committee were published in 1992 in a brochure entitled ‘CLIVAR – a study of Climate Variability and Predictability’.
* 1993: The WCRP JSC decided to undertake CLIVAR as a major activity.
* 1995: CLIVAR was officially launched, initially as a 15-year project. The launch coincided with the end of TOGA.
* 1997: The first CLIVAR implementation plan was published.

==Panels and working groups==

CLIVAR has a number of panels and working groups based on the study of climate variability and predictability of different components of the global climate system.

===Global panels===

CLIVAR has three global panels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/panels-and-working-groups/global|title = Global|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global Synthesis and Observation Panel (GSOP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/organization/gsop|title = Global Synthesis and Observation Panel|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/organization/etccdi|title = CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Working Group on Ocean Model Development (WGOMD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/organization/wgomd|title = CLIVAR Working Group on Ocean Model Development (WGOMD)|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional panels===

Regional panels focus on specific aspects of the climate system. Since the different regions of the ocean are qualitatively different, and given the important role of the oceans in controlling climate over the interannual, decadal, and centennial scales considered by CLIVAR, the subdivision into panels is largely based on regions of the ocean system. Specifically, the following is the list of regional panels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/panels-and-working-groups/regional|title = Regional|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asian-Australian Monsoon Panel (AAMP)
* Atlantic Implementation Panel (AIP)
* CLIVAR/GEWEX Africa Climate Panel (ACP)
* CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Panel (SOP)
* CLIVAR/IOC-GOOS Indian Ocean Panel (IOP)
* Pacific Panel (PP)
* Variations of the American Monsoon Systems]] (VAMOS)

===National programmes===

There are four national CLIVAR programmes, that run largely autonomously but contribute to the international CLIVAR program:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivar.org/organization/national-programmes|title = National Programmes|publisher = CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* US CLIVAR:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usclivar.org/|title = US CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014|publisher = US CLIVAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes directly to the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] (USGCRP) by coordinating and advancing research within the US to improve the documentation, understanding, modeling and prediction of variations in global and regional climate. It is supported by participating programs in five [[United States Government]] agencies: [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE), and the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usclivar.org/about-us-clivar|title = About US CLIVAR|accessdate = July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Casma Group''' ({{lang-es|Grupo Casma}}) is a [[Group (stratigraphy)|stratigraphic group]] of [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic-aged]] [[sedimentary formation]]s exposed along the coast and within the [[Cordillera Occidental (Peru)|Cordillera Occidental]] near [[Casma]], [[Peru]]. 

The sediments of the Casma Group reflect deposition in two distinct environments of the West Peruvian Basin. Some sediments were deposited near the [[Casma Volcanic Arc]] in an [[craton|intra-cratonic]] [[sedimentary basin]] that was occasionally connected to the ocean.

[[File:Space Shuttle concepts.jpg|thumb|right|In the top left is SERV with MURP. In comparison to the DC-3 design, with the straight wings to the right of SERV, SERV would be just over 100 feet long, while DC-3 was just under 300.]]

'''SERV''', short for '''Single-stage Earth-orbital Reusable Vehicle''', was a proposed [[Space Launch System|space launch system]] designed by [[Chrysler]]'s Space Division for the [[Space Shuttle]] project. SERV was so radically different from the two-stage spaceplanes than almost every other competitor entered into the [[Space Shuttle design process|Shuttle development process]] that it was never seriously considered for the shuttle program.

SERV was to be a [[single-stage to orbit]] spacecraft that would take off from the existing [[Saturn V]] complexes and land vertically at Kennedy for re-use. SERV looked like a greatly expanded [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Apollo capsule]], with an empty central core able to carry {{convert|125000|lb|abbr=on}} of cargo. SERV could be launched unmanned for cargo missions, ejecting a cargo capsule and returning to Earth. For manned missions, a separate [[spaceplane]], '''MURP''' (Manned Upper-stage Reusable Payload), could be carried atop the vehicle.

Note that the name "SERV" was also used by an entirely unrelated [[NASA]] project, the "Space Emergency Re-entry Vehicle".

==History==

===Background===
In 1966 the [[US Air Force]] started a study effort that explored a variety of manned spacecraft and associated launchers. As the proposals were studied, they broke them down into one of three classes, based on the level of reusability. On the simpler end of the development scale were the "Class I" vehicles that placed a [[spaceplane]] on top of an existing or modified [[ICBM]]-based launcher. "Class II" vehicles added partial reusability for some of the launcher components, while the "Class III" vehicles were fully reusable. The USAF had already started work on a Class I design in their [[X-20 Dyna Soar]] program, which had been cancelled in December 1963, but were interested in the [[Lockheed Star Clipper]] Class II design as a possible future development. Nothing ever came of the study effort, as the USAF wound down their interest in manned space programs.

At the time, NASA was in the midst of winding down the [[Project Apollo]] build-out, as the vehicles progressed to flight. Looking into the future, a number of NASA offices started programs to explore manned missions in the 1970s and beyond. Among the many proposals, a permanently manned [[space station]] was a favorite. These plans generally assumed the use of the existing Saturn rockets to launch the stations, and even the crews, but the Saturn systems were not set up for the sort of constant supply and crew turnaround being envisioned. The idea of a simple and inexpensive manned launcher, a "ferry and logistics vehicle", developed out of the space station studies almost as an afterthought, the first mention of it being in the fiscal year 1967 budgets.&lt;ref name=names&gt;Helen Wells, Susan Whiteley, and Carrie Karegeannes, [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/SP-4402.htm "Origins of NASA Names"], NASA SP-4402, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of a low cost, reusable [[Space Transportation System]] (STS) started in earnest in December 1967, when [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] organized a one-day brainstorming session on the topic. He jump-started the discussion by inviting the USAF to attend, even keeping the original USAF acronym for the project, "ILRV". Like the original USAF studies, a small vehicle was envisioned, carrying replacement crews and basic supplies, with an emphasis on low cost of operations and fast turnarounds. Unlike the USAF, however, NASA's Space Task Force quickly decided to move directly to the Class III designs.

===Phase A===
NASA envisioned a four-phase program of development for the STS. "Phase A" was a series of initial studies to select an overall technology path, and development contracts for proposals were released in 1968 with the proposals expected back in the fall of 1969. A number of designs were presented from a variety of industry partners. Almost universally, the designs were small, fully reusable, and based around [[delta wing]] or [[lifting body]] spaceplanes.

Chrysler Aerospace won contract NAS8-26341 for their entry into the Phase A series, forming a team under Charles Tharratt. Their 1969 report, NASA-CR-148948, outlined the SERV design, preliminary performance measures, and basic mission profiles. This report described a {{convert|23|foot}} wide cargo bay{{efn|Similar in diameter to the Saturn IV stage, allowing easy carriage of cargo on either platform.}} Tharratt was convinced that SERV offered better flexibility than any of the winged platforms, allowing it to launch both manned and unmanned missions, and being much smaller overall.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

With most of the NASA centers backing one of the winged vehicles, and being dramatically different from any of them, SERV found no supporters within the bureaucracy and was never seriously considered for STS.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Butrica, "Single Stage to Orbit", Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8018-7338-X}}, pg. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the astronaut corps was adamant that any future NASA spacecraft would have to be manned,&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Easterbrook, [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html "Beam Us Out Of This Death Trap, Scotty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304014605/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Washington Monthly'', April 1980&lt;/ref&gt; so the potentially unmanned SERV won no converts there either.

An extension contract was offered anyway, producing the final NASA-CR-150241 report on the SERV design that was turned in on 1 July 1971. This differed mostly in minor details, the major change being the reduction of the cargo bay from 23&amp;nbsp;feet to {{convert|15|foot}} in keeping with the rest of the Shuttle proposals.

==Description==

===Vehicle design===
SERV consisted of a large conical body with a rounded base that Chrysler referred to as a "modified Apollo design". The resemblance is due to the fact that both vehicles used [[Atmospheric reentry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt body re-entry profiles]], which lessen heating load during re-entry by creating a very large [[shock wave]] in front of a rounded surface. Tilting the vehicle in relation to the direction of motion changes the pattern of the shock waves, producing lift that can be used to maneuver the spacecraft - in the case of SERV, up to about 100 [[Nautical mile|NM]] on either side of its ballistic path.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-33&lt;/ref&gt; To aid lift generation, SERV was "stepped", with the lower portion of the cone angled in at about 30 degrees, and the upper portion closer to 45 degrees. SERV was {{convert|96|ft|m}} across at the widest point, and {{convert|83|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross lift off weight]] was just over {{convert|6000000|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=final&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-9&lt;/ref&gt; about the same as the [[Saturn V]]'s {{convert|6200000|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-was-the-saturn-v-58.html |title=What was the Saturn V |website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more than the Shuttle's {{convert|4500000|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Space_Shuttle/Shuttle_technical_facts |title=Shuttle Technical Facts |website=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the SERV airframe consisted of aluminum [[composite honeycomb]]. The base was covered with screw-on [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield panels]], which allowed for easy replacement between missions. The upper portions of the airframe, which received dramatically lower heating loads, were covered with metal shingles covering a quartz insulation below.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Four landing legs extended from the bottom, their "foot" forming their portion of heat shield surface when retracted.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve module LH2/LOX [[aerospike engine]] was arranged around the rim of the base, covered by movable metal shields.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 4-3&lt;/ref&gt; During the ascent the shields would move out from the body to adjust for decreasing [[air pressure]], forming a large [[altitude compensating nozzle]]. The module was fed from a set of four cross-linked [[turbopump]]s that were designed to run at up to 120% of their nominal power, allowing orbital insertion even if one pump failed immediately after takeoff. The engine as a whole would provide 7,454,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (25.8 MN) of thrust,&lt;ref name=final/&gt; about the same as the [[S-IC]], the first stage of the [[Saturn V]].

Also arranged around the base were forty {{convert|20000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} jet engines, which were fired just prior to touchdown in order to slow the descent. Movable doors above the engines opened for feed air.&lt;ref name=layout&gt;See general layout diagram, CR-150241, slide 2-13&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[RL-10]]'s provided de-orbit thrust, so the main engine did not have to be restarted in space. Even on-orbit maneuvering, which was not extensive for the SERV (see below), was provided by small LOX/LH2 engines instead of thrusters using different fuels.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of conical tanks around the outside rim of the craft, just above the engines, stored the [[LOX]]. [[LH2]] was stored in much larger tanks closer to the center of the craft. Much smaller spherical tanks, located in the gaps below the rounded end of the LOX tanks, held the [[JP-4]] used to feed the jet engines. Orbital maneuvering and de-orbit engines were clustered around the top of the spacecraft, fed by their own tanks interspersed between the LH2.&lt;ref name=layout/&gt; This arrangement of tanks left a large open space in the middle of the craft, 15 by {{convert|60|ft|m}}, which served as the cargo hold.{{efn|Some sources based on the original 1969 version of the SERV design state the cargo hold is 23 feet wide, but the final vehicle selection reduced this to 15 by 60 feet in keeping with the other shuttle designs.}}

===Operational modes===
Two basic spacecraft configurations and mission profiles were envisioned. "Mode A" missions flew SERV to a high-altitude parking orbit at {{convert|260|nmi|km|abbr=on}} inclined at 55 degrees, just below the space station's orbit at {{convert|270|nmi|km|abbr=on}}. "Mode B" missions flew to a {{convert|110|nmi|km|abbr=on}} [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) inclined at 28.5 degrees, a due-east launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. In either case the SERV was paired with a long cargo container in its bay, and optionally combined with a manned spacecraft on top.

The original proposals used a lifting body spaceplane known as MURP to support manned missions. The MURP was based on the [[HL-10]] design already under study by [[North American Rockwell]] as part of their STS efforts. MURP was fitted on top of a cargo container and fairing, which was {{convert|114|ft|m}} long overall.&lt;ref name="CR-150241, slide 2-5"&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-5&lt;/ref&gt; In the second version of the study, Chrysler also added an option that replaced MURP with a "personnel module", based on the [[Apollo CSM]], which was {{convert|74|ft|m}} long when combined with the same cargo container. The original, "SERV-MURP", was {{convert|137|ft|m|abbr=on}} when combined with SERV, while the new configuration, "SERV-PM", was {{convert|101|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=final/&gt; Both systems included an all-aspect abort of the manned portion throughout the entire ascent.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-17&lt;/ref&gt;

After considering all four combinations of mode and module, two basic mission profiles were selected as the most efficient. With SERV-PM the high-earth orbit would be used and the PM would maneuver only a short distance to reach the station. With SERV-MURP, the low Earth orbit would be used and the MURP would maneuver the rest of the way on its own. In either case, the SERV could return to Earth immediately and let the PM or MURP land on their own, or more commonly, wait in the parking orbit for a cargo module from an earlier mission to rendezvous with it for return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weight and balance]] considerations limited the return payload.

Both configurations delivered {{convert|25000|lb|abbr=on}} of cargo to the space station, although in the PM configuration the overall thrown weights were much lower.&lt;ref name="CR-150241, slide 2-5"/&gt; If the PM configuration was used with a fairing instead of the capsule, SERV could deliver {{convert|112000|lb|abbr=on}} to LEO, or as much as {{convert|125000|lb|abbr=on}} with an "Extended Nosecone".&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; The Extended Nosecone was a long spike with a high [[fineness ratio]] that lowered atmospheric drag by creating shock waves that cleared the vehicle body during ascent.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"/&gt;

In addition, Chrysler also outlined ways to support {{convert|33|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide loads on the front of SERV. This was the diameter of the [[S-IC]] and [[S-II]], the lower stages of the Saturn V. NASA had proposed a wide variety of payloads for the [[Apollo Applications Program]] that were based on this diameter that were intended to be launched on the [[Saturn INT-21]]. Chrysler demonstrated that they could also be launched on SERV, if weight considerations taken into account. However, these plans were based on the earlier SERV designs with the larger {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} cargo bay.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"/&gt; When NASA's loads were adapted to fit to the smaller {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} bay common to all the STS proposals, this option was dropped.

SERV was not expected to remain on orbit for extended periods of time, with the longest missions outlined in the report at just under 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it would return after a small number of orbits brought its [[ground track]] close enough to Kennedy, and abort-once-around missions were contemplated. The vehicle was designed to return to a location within four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of the touchdown point using re-entry maneuvering, the rest would be made up during the jet-powered descent.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction and operations===
NASA had partnered with Chrysler to build the NASA-designed [[Saturn IB]], at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] outside [[New Orleans]]. Chrysler proposed building SERVs at Michoud as well, delivering them to KSC on the Bay-class ships used to deliver Boeing's S-IC from the same factory. Since the SERV was wider than the ships, it had to be carried slightly tilted in order to reduce its overall width. Pontoons were then added to the side of the ships to protect the spacecraft from spray.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

SERVs would be fitted out in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) High Bay, mated with the PM or MURP which were prepared in the Low Bay, and then transported to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC39]] pads on the existing [[crawler-transporter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-15&lt;/ref&gt; The LC39 pads required only minor modifications for SERV use, similar to those needed to launch the [[Saturn IB]].&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-21&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler proposed building several SERV landing pads between LC39 and the VAB, and a landing strip for the MURP near the existing Space Shuttle landing strip.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The SERVs would be returned to the VAB on an enormous flatbed truck. The only other new infrastructure was a set of test stands at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center|Mississippi Test Operations]] engine testing complex, near Michoud.

Re-using much of the existing infrastructure lowered overall program costs; total costs were estimated as $3.565 billion, with each SERV costing $350 million in FY1971 dollars, and being rated for 100 flights over a 10-year service life.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This was far less expensive than the two-stage flyback proposals entered by most companies, which had peak development costs on the order of $10 billion.

==Similar designs==
SERV was similar to the later [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] design. The primary difference between the two was that the DC-X was built to a military mission and required much greater re-entry maneuvering capability. Because of this, the airframe was long and skinny, and the spacecraft re-entered nose-first. Tilting this shape relative to the path of motion generates considerably more lift than the blunt base of SERV, but also subjects the airframe to much higher heating loads.

More recently, the original SERV layout was used in the [[Blue Origin Goddard]] spacecraft. Like the SERV, Goddard did not need the extended crossrange capabilities of a military launcher, and returned to the simpler blunt-base re-entry profile. The similar [[Kankoh-maru]] design study also used the same blunt-body VTOL profile.

In [[optics]], a '''conjugate plane''' or '''conjugate focal plane''' of a given plane ''P'', is the plane ''P`'' such that points on ''P'' are imaged on ''P`''.&lt;ref&gt;Warren J. Smith. ''Modern Optical Engineering'' Third ed. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; If an object is moved to the point occupied by its image, then the moved object's new image will appear at the point where the object originated. In other words, the object and its image are interchangeable. This comes from the principle of reversibility which states light rays will travel along the originating path if the light's direction is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://physics.info/reflection/summary.shtml |title= The Physics HyperTextbook |last= Elert |first= Glenn |date= 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The points that span conjugate planes are called conjugate points.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Optics'', Fourth Ed. (1976) Francis A. Jenkins, Harvey E. White {{ISBN|978-0072561913}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[telescope]], the subject [[focal plane]] is at infinity and the conjugate image plane, at which the [[image sensor]] is placed, is said to be an '''infinite conjugate'''. In [[microscopy]] and [[macro photography]], the subject is close to the lens, so the plane at which the image sensor is placed is said to be a '''finite conjugate'''. Within a system with [[relay lens]]es or [[eyepiece]]s, there may be planes that are conjugate to the [[aperture]].

'''Consumer's risk''' or '''Consumer risk''' is a potential risk found in all consumer-oriented [[Product (business)|product]]s, that a product not meeting [[quality standards]] will pass undetected through the manufacturer's [[quality control]] system and enter the consumer [[marketplace]].

Accepting the lot of unsatisfactory quality is a risk for any consumer. The probability of accepting the lot of fraction defectives under sampling inspection plan is called as '''consumer's risk.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">A '''data janitor''' is a person who works to take [[big data]] and condense it into useful amounts of information. Also known as a "data wrangler," a data janitor sifts through data for companies in the [[information technology]] industry. A multitude of [[startup company|start-ups]] rely on large amounts of data, so a data janitor works to help these businesses with this basic, but difficult process of interpreting data.

While it is a commonly held belief that data janitor work is fully automated, many data scientists are employed primarily as data janitors. The Information technology industry has been increasingly turning towards new sources of data gathered on [[consumers]], so data janitors have become more commonplace in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data janitors work in a process that largely consists of four steps: selection and defining relationships, extraction and organization, loading, and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Big Data, Preparing Data is Most of the Work|url=http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/in-big-data-preparing-the-data-is-most-of-the-work|website=Data Science Central|publisher=Sullexis LLC|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data janitors identify sources of data before selecting which data is relevant and find the relationships between the data that will be useful to the company's projects. Next, they structure the data in an effort to extract the information and put it into a format that can be stored in a secure place for the business. Last, the data janitors work with other employees to create [[Presentation program|visual aids]] to present to managers and executives who will eventually benefit from the conclusions that can be made from them. In this way, the work of data janitors is integral to the functioning of businesses that rely on large amounts data to function.

In [[linguistics]], more precisely in [[traditional grammar]], a '''distributive number''' is a word that answers "how many times each?" or "how many at a time?", such as ''singly'' or ''doubly''. They are contrasted with [[multiplier (linguistics)|multipliers]]. In English, this [[part of speech]] is rarely used and much less recognized than [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] and [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]], but it is clearly distinguished and commonly used in Latin and several Romance languages, such as Romanian.

==English==
In English distinct distributive numbers exist, such as ''singly'', ''doubly'', and ''triply'', and are derived from the corresponding multiplier (of Latin origin, via French) by suffixing ''-y'' (reduction of Middle English ''-lely'' &gt; ''-ly''). However, this is more commonly expressed [[Periphrasis|periphrastically]], such as "one by one", "two by two"; "one at a time", "two at a time"; "in twos", "in threes"; or using a counter word such as "in groups of two" or "two pieces to a …". Examples include "Please get off the bus one by one so no-one falls.", "She jumped up the steps two at a time.", "Students worked in the lab in twos and threes.", "Students worked in groups of two and three.", and "Students worked two people to a team."

The suffixes ''-some'' (as in ''twosome'', ''threesome'') and ''-fold'' (as in ''two-fold'', ''three-fold'') are also used, though also relatively infrequently. For musical groups ''solo'', ''duo'', ''trio'', ''quartet'', etc. are commonly used, and ''pair'' is used for a group of two.

A conspicuous use of distributive numbers is in [[arity]] or [[adicity]], to indicate how many parameters a function takes. Most commonly this uses Latin distributive numbers and ''-ary'', as in ''unary'', ''binary'', ''ternary'', but sometimes Greek numbers are used instead, with ''-adic'', as in ''monadic'', ''dyadic'', ''triadic''.

==Other languages==
{{section-stub|date=May 2015}}
Georgian, Latin, and Romanian are notable languages with distributive numbers; see [[Romanian numbers#Distributive numbers|Romanian distributive numbers]].

In [[Japanese numerals]], distributive numbers are formed regularly from a cardinal number, a [[counter word]], and the suffix {{Nihongo||ずつ|-zutsu}}, as in {{Nihongo||一人ずつ|hitori-zutsu|one person at a time, one person each}}.

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], one of the -ar/-er [[suffix]]es (chosen according to [[vowel harmony]]) are added to the end of a cardinal number, as in "bir''er''" (one of each) and "dokuz''ar''" (nine of each). If the number ends with a vowel, a letter [[ş]] comes to the middle; as in "iki''şer''" (two of each) and "altı''şar''" (six of each).

Schultz was on a show on [[Animal Planet]] called ''[[Wild Recon]]'' which ran for one season for a total of 10 episodes. It ran under the title "Venom Hunter" overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/arts/television/05recon.html |title=A Toxic Workplace, With Ill-Tempered Clients |last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |date=2010-01-10 |work=New York Times |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oIV6YxF6?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/arts/television/05recon.html |archivedate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also featured in ''Venom in Vegas'', where he was put in a glass box full of 100 snakes, some venomous, in full view of the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/donald-schultzs-vegas-viper-stunt-dont-try-this-at-home/19323889 |title=Vegas Viper Stunt: Don't Try This at Home |last=Friess |first=Steve |date=2010-01-20 |work=AOL News |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oIUcCCTi?url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/donald-schultzs-vegas-viper-stunt-dont-try-this-at-home/19323889 |archivedate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, Schultz is also the guest on [[Chelsea Lately]] where he introduces Chelsea to various new animals.

He also co-hosted "Animal Intervention" with Allison Eastwood on Nat Geo Wild ' where he was involved in trying to convince owners of exotic animals, namely big cats, to either re-home or improve the conditions of exotic animals in their care. "Animal Intervention".

He often appears on the Jason Ellis Show on Sirius/XM to discuss Extreme Falling, Animals and tribal rituals among other topics of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisawesomeworld.com/the-jason-ellis-show/friends/donald-schultz/|title=Domain.com|website=www.ellisawesomeworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schultz works on a variety of travel, adventure and conservation content for television and other mediums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synergyla.com/index.php?page=client&amp;client_id=57|title=Synergy Management - Client|date=12 November 2014|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112215918/http://synergyla.com/index.php?page=client&amp;client_id=57|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schultz is also an accomplished skydiver and BASE jumper. With over 1500 wingsuit and BASE jumps, he has traveled to various countries on wing suit expeditions.

In March 2014, Schultz accompanied NITRO CIRCUS to South Africa for 3 LIVE shows in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. While there, the crew filmed 4 episodes due for release on MTV2 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donaldschultz.com/nitro-circus-in-south-africa/|title=NITRO CIRCUS in SOUTH AFRICA|website=donaldschultz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Schultz was charged with a misdemeanor for shipping pet lizards across state lines in 2010. Schultz claimed he was unaware a permit was needed and received community service and a $6000 fine. He said he is going to use the whole experience to learn and further educate people about the need for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Donald-Schultz-Wild-Recon-Animal-Planet-Endangered-Species-Lizards-232649221.html|title=Ex-TV Host Calls Rare Lizard Sale "Stupid"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/TV-Host-Sentenced-After-Trying-to-Illegally-Sell-Lizards-252275151.html|title=Ex-Animal Planet Host Sentenced Over Lizard Sale Attempt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fibrocartilage callus''' is a temporary formation of [[fibroblast]]s and [[chondroblast]]s which forms at the area of a [[bone fracture]] as the [[bone]] attempts to [[healing|heal]] itself.  The cells eventually dissipate and become dormant, lying in the resulting  [[extracellular matrix]] that is the new bone.
The callus is the first sign of union visible on x-rays, usually 3 weeks after the fracture. Callus formation is slower in adults than in children, and in [[cortical bone]]s than in [[cancellous bone]]s.

The '''gill plate trade''' is the buying and selling of [[stingray]] [[gill]] plates for their use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. The gill plates are harvested from stingrays that are caught intentionally, or caught as [[bycatch]]. The plates are sold whole or in a powder form. A single kilogram of the gill plate can be sold for up to $350 USD, though the price varies by ray species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Joyce|date=June 2016|title=Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/Traf-138.pdf|journal=Traffic Report|volume=|pages=|via=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Stingrays are caught by fishing lines or nets. Private fishermen tend to target these ray species due to the high payout from their gill plates. Large fishing operations tend to catch rays as bycatch when fishing for more desirable food fish such as tuna, where they are brought back to shore and sold regardless of the intention to catch these fish. The gill plates are split in two and dried after they are taken from the dead rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cites.unia.es/cites/file.php/1/files/pew-manta-ray-gill-plate-id-guide.pdf|title=Field Identification Guide of the Prebranchial Appendages (Gill Plates) of Mobulid Rays for Law Enforcementand Trade Monitoring Applications|last=Stevens|first=Guy|date=|website=Unia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once dried the plates are sold whole or ground into a powder.

== Uses in traditional Chinese medicine ==
Tonics made from stingray gill plates are used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantatrust.org/threats/gill-plate-trade/|title=Gill Plate Trade {{!}} Manta Trust|website=www.mantatrust.org|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but there is no evidence of its effectiveness in any medical treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== On stingray populations ===
A few biological factors known as K-selected traits make the stingray more susceptible to population decline. These K-selected traits include but are not limited to: late sexual maturity, long gestation, low and number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/K-selected-species|title=K-selected species {{!}} biology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919432043|title=Fishes of the Maldives : Indian Ocean|last=1943-|first=Kuiter, Rudie H.,|date=2014|publisher=Atoll Ed|isbn=9781876410971|edition=2.|location=Cairns, Australia|oclc=919432043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160108-manta-rays-conservation-wildaid-traditional-medicine-china-bycatch-peru/|title=New Protections For World’s Largest Population of Giant Manta Rays|date=2016-01-08|website=National Geographic News|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Croll 562–575"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croll|first=Donald A.|last2=Dewar|first2=Heidi|last3=Dulvy|first3=Nicholas K.|last4=Fernando|first4=Daniel|last5=Francis|first5=Malcolm P.|last6=Galván-Magaña|first6=Felipe|last7=Hall|first7=Martin|last8=Heinrichs|first8=Shawn|last9=Marshall|first9=Andrea|date=2016-06-01|title=Vulnerabilities and fisheries impacts: the uncertain future of manta and devil rays|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2591/abstract|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=562–575|doi=10.1002/aqc.2591|issn=1099-0755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the gill plate trade will accept plates from immature and mature rays, the number of rays that are able to reproduce is decreased by the capture of these animals. The population is slow to recover from these losses due to the K-selected traits and as fishing continues the population of stingrays decreases at a faster rate than it increases.&lt;ref name="Croll 562–575"/&gt;

=== On other marine species ===
The gill plate trade effects other marine species in one of two ways. The first is the impact that the fishing has on these other species which inhabit the rays ecosystem is when rays are caught intentionally they are typically caught by [[longline fishing]].  Longline fishing involves thousands of baited hooks on one very long fishing line close to the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dayton|first=Paul K.|last2=Thrush|first2=Simon F.|last3=Agardy|first3=M. Tundi|last4=Hofman|first4=Robert J.|date=1995-09-01|title=Environmental effects of marine fishing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.3270050305/abstract|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=205–232|doi=10.1002/aqc.3270050305|issn=1099-0755}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hooks draw many species including birds, marine mammals, fish, sharks, and rays. The second impact of stingray fishing and population decline is an ecological effect. The stingrays are keystone predators in coral reef environments, when these species are declined the other reef species are effected through trophic factors, for instance predator populations decrease therefore prey populations increase, and risk effects. Risk effects are the behavioral mannerisms that prey learn to avoid predators, such as where or when to feed without becoming a meal for a predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Predicting ecological consequences of marine top predator declines[Trends in Ecology and Evolution 23 (2008) 202–210]|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016953470800253X|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=23|issue=10|pages=537–537|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without predators such as stingrays, the behavior of prey species is altered.

== Legislation ==
It is currently illegal to trade [[Manta ray|manta]] and [[mobula]] ray species without proper documentation that it is [[Sustainability|sustainable]] trade due to these species having been added to the [[CITES]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/slider_stories/2013/02/cites_cop16.html|title=Sharks and Manta Rays Receive Protection Under CITES :: NOAA Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|website=www.nmfs.noaa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices {{!}} CITES|website=www.cites.org|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a species has been added to the CITES list it is internationally protected in legal trade; however, [[black market]] transactions still occur.

'''Hun Kal''' is a small [[impact crater|crater]] on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that serves as the reference point for the planet's system of [[longitude]]. The longitude of Hun Kal's center is defined as being 20° W, thus establishing the planet's [[prime meridian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/WGCCRE/constants/iau2000_table1.html|accessdate=22 October 2009|title=USGS Astrogeology: Rotation and pole position for the Sun and planets (IAU WGCCRE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hun Kal crater on Mercury.jpg|thumb|left|150px|This image shows the surrounding context of Hun Kal, which is almost invisibly tiny near the center.]]
Hun Kal was chosen as a reference point since the actual prime meridian was in shadow when ''[[Mariner 10]]'' photographed the region, hiding any features near 0° longitude from view.

Hun Kal is about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{gpn|62753|Hun Kal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Hun Kal" means '20' in the [[Mayan languages|language of the Maya]].

The '''International Society for Bayesian Analysis''' ('''ISBA''') is a society with the goal of promoting [[Bayesian analysis]] for solving problems in the sciences and government. It was formally incorporated as a not for profit corporation by economist [[Arnold Zellner]] and statisticians [[Gordon M. Kaufman]] and [[Thomas H. Leonard]] on 10 November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bayesian.org/history|title=History - International Society for Bayesian Analysis|website=bayesian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes the electronic journal ''[[Bayesian Analysis (journal)|Bayesian Analysis]]'' and organizes world meetings every other year.

ISBA is an "official partner" of the [[Joint Statistical Meetings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/conferenceinfo.cfm|title=Conference Information|website=www.amstat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jörg Kühn''' (1940–64) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[artist]], [[naturalist]] and scientific illustrator who specialized in bird paintings and drawings. He was also a [[Children's literature|children's book]] [[illustrator]]. He is noted for illustrations that are of a particularly scientific and exact nature.

==Biography==

Kühn's reputation as a master of the exact portrayal of animals is based on a professional career that lasted barely six years during which he worked prolifically. The legacy is regarded as very valuable&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Birds of the World – Chapter on Great Bird Artists  IPC magazines 1969&lt;/ref&gt; containing in excess of one hundred colour plates and several hundred line drawings and innumerable [[Field study|field studies]] of the animals he was illustrating. His depictive style has echoes of [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]

He worked from 1961 to 1964 as a scientific illustrator at the Zoological Museum (Zoologische Museum der Universitat Zürich). His work which appeared in scientific publications including  [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]], ''Pro Juventute'', [[World Wildlife Fund]], and ''Hallwag-Verlag'' are exact and beautifully drawn. He was also skilled in graphics and taught the skill at the Zoological Museum in Zürich.

As well as scientific publications, he was sometimes employed as an illustrator of books including the children’s book ''Der Wald Und Seine Tierre'' (''The Forest and its Animals'') (1963)&lt;ref&gt;Jorg Khun &amp; [[Vinzenz Ziswiler]], ''Der Wald Und Seine Tierre '' Atlantis-Verlag  (Zurich 1972) {{ISBN|3-7611-0309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his illustrations included monographs of forest animals.It has run to at least five editions since it was first published in 1963.

His colour plates include those of threatened wildlife that were commissioned by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and contributions to the ''[[Handbuch der Vögel Mitteleuropas]]'' (''Handbook of the Birds of Central Europe'').&lt;ref&gt;''Handbuch der Vogel Mitteleuropas''. Volume 14, Passeriformes. Urs N. Glutz von Blotzheim (Ed.). 1997. AULA-Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jörg Kühn's is chiefly remembered as a wildlife illustrator he was also commissioned to illustrate a number of medical textbooks including  for the ''Surgery of the Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands'' &lt;ref&gt;Daniel Oertli, Robert Udelsman, Surgery of the thyroid and parathyroid glands, edition 2007, {{ISBN|3-540-29165-2}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Kühn died in Zürich in October 1964 aged 24 from [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] diagnosed when he was 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jagdportal.ch/jagdampnatur/news/news-einzelansicht/browse/8/article/7/die-tierwelt-101273.html  Exhibition of in Kühn's work, Landshut Utrensdorf Castle,Zurich, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leaving the nest''' or '''moving out''' refers to the notion of a young person moving out of the accommodation provided by their guardian, [[fosterer]]s or [[parent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apter|first1=Terry|title=The Myth of Maturity: What Teenagers Need from Parents to Become Adults|date=2002|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a move can be motivated by various factors, including a desire for independence, the discovery of a more viable location and/or practicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peace|first1=Sheila|title=Adult Lives: A Life Course Perspective|date=2011|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age at which young people move out of their previous accommodation has been rising since the turn of the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/independence-for-young-millennials-moving-out-and-boomeranging-back.htm|title=Independence for young millennials: moving out and boomeranging back : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=R.|first=Dey,Judith G.;Pierret,Charles|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures view leaving the nest as one of the key milestones in the transition from tweenhood or teenhood to becoming an adult besides obtaining employment and getting wedded.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F., Ruben G. Rumbaut, and Richard A. Settersten. "On the frontier of adulthood: Emerging themes and new directions." On the frontier of adulthood: Theory, research, and public policy (2005): 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, especially [[Middle Eastern]] ones, it is not as socially acceptable for a woman or girl to leave the home to live by herself without a marriage arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=International encyclopedia of adolescence: A-J, index, Volume 1|date=2007|page=1038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that a delay in leaving the nest may result in a decrease in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/new-research-suggests-young-people-are-going-off-sex-1.2742803|title=New research suggests young people are going off sex|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48551">This article contains a list of notable libraries that can be used in [[List of CLI languages|.NET languages]]. This article is not merely a list of other Wikipedia entries, but covers a topic that is important on its own right. While the [[.NET framework]] provides a basis for [[Application software|application development]], which provides platform independence, language interoperability and extensive framework libraries, the whole development ecosystem around .NET is crucially dependent on a vast number of user libraries that are developed independently of the framework. The value of the framework for developers can not be estimated without having an overview of the user library ecosystem, including issues related to ''platform independence'' and ''licensing''

[[Standard Libraries (CLI)]] (including the [[Base Class Library]] (BCL) are not included in this article because they have a [[Base Class Library|separate article]].

== Application development in .NET Framework ==

Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a [[software]] environment known as [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR), an [[process virtual machine|application virtual machine]] that provides services such as security, [[memory management]], and [[exception handling]]. Framework includes a large class library called [[Framework Class Library]] (FCL), which together with CLR constitute the .NET framework.

Thanks to the hosting virtual machine, different [[List of CLI languages|.NET CLI compliant languages]] can operate on the same kind of data structures. Therefore, all CLI compliant languages can use the [[Framework Class Library]] and other .NET libraries that are written in one of the CLI compliant languages. When source code of a CLI compliant language is compiled, the compiler generates a platform independent code in the [[Common Intermediate Language]] (also referred to as bytecode), which is stored in [[Assembly (CLI)|CLI assemblies]]. When a .NET application is executed, the just-in-time compiler (JIT) turns the CIL code into platform specific machine code. To improve performance, the .NET Framework also comes with Native Image Generator (NGEN), which performs ahead-of-time compilation to machine code.

This architecture has several implications. The framework provides [[language interoperability]] (each language can use code written in other languages) across the [[List of CLI languages|.NET CLI compliant languages]] [[programming language]]s. Calls from one language to another are exactly the same as would be within a single programming language. If a library is written in one CIL language, it can be used in any other CIL language. Moreover, applications that consist only of pure .NET assemblies, can be transferred to any platform that contains implementation of .NET framework and executed on that platform. For example, an application written for Microsoft .NET on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] can also be executed on [[Mono (software)|Mono]] (a cross platform alternative implementation of .NET) on [[Linux]] or [[macOS]]. Such applications are automatically [[cross-platform]] (or platform independent) to the extent to which the .NET framework itself is ported to different platforms.

Ability to transfer applications across platforms is extremely important for software developers, because in this way they can use the same code base for the application on any platform, enabling code reuse and avoiding code duplication. Both lead to reduced development and maintenance costs.

However, platform independence is only guaranteed in the described way when none of the assemblies constituting an application depends on any code that is not pure .NET code. Many .NET libraries, however, make use of [[Native code|native libraries]] (written e.g. in C or C++) or system calls through [[.NET Framework#Interoperability|interoperability mechanisms]] such as [[Component Object Model|COM]] interoperability and the [[Platform Invocation Services|P/Invoke]] feature, which makes possible to call [[native code]] and thus call into libraries written in [[compiled language]]s (as opposed to managed) such as C or C++.

In these cases, platform independence of applications written for the .NET framework also depends on the ability to transfer non-.NET libraries, on which application depends, to target platforms. Any additional such library may add significantly to the effort necessary to transfer the application to other platforms. Sometimes, the best solution is to re-implement the parts of application that depend on such a library for each targeted platform. In many cases, the vast majority of the application's code base can be easily transferred across platforms, and only small specific portions of code dependent on problematic libraries must be re-implemented for each platform. Sometimes, a special [[compatibility layer]] is introduced that provides a uniform [[API]] to the platform dependent parts of code. Then, even if the higher level code heavily depends on platform dependent parts, dependence is resolved through API calls that are the same on all platforms, and the same high level code can still be used on different target platforms.

A notable example is the [[Windows Forms]] [[graphical user interface|graphical]] (GUI) [[Library (computing)|class library]]. The library provides access to [[Windows USER|Windows User Interface]] Common Controls by [[Wrapper pattern|wrapping]] the [[Windows API]] in [[managed code]].&lt;ref name=DeSmet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2048355&amp;seqNum=4|title=C# 4.0 Unleashed By Bart De Smet. Sams Publishing, Jan 4, 2011 Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library is therefore not easily transferred to platforms other than Windows. In spite of that, the cross-platform .NET implementation [[Mono (software)|Mono]] implements the library. Because of that, an application that depends on Windows Forms, can be ported to other forms by using the Mono runtime on which the Windows Forms library is implemented (beside Windows, this includes Unix and OSX). The Mono's implementation of the library is written in C# in order to avoid Windows dependence.&lt;ref name="GuiToolkitsMono"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/| title=GUI Toolkits| last= | first= | work=Mono site| publisher= | date=21 April 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402171119/http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/ | archive-date=2016-04-02|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the Windows Forms API works on Mono, except for some minor incompatibilities and implementation bugs. However, many .NET libraries that were written on Windows and depend on Windows Forms, also make direct P/Invoke calls straight to the Windows API and bypass the Windows Forms API (this is sometimes done to avoid limitations of the Windows Forms). Such libraries will be broken when transferred to platforms other than Windows, although Windows Forms itself is available on these platforms via Mono implementation. For a [[graphical user interface|GUI]] [[Library (computing)|class library]], the Mono project endorses use of the [[GTK#]] library,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} which is a .NET binding for the [[Gtk+]] toolkit written in C.

GUI libraries are not the only critical area of interest for .NET developers. Other libraries that may be problematic include 3D graphics libraries, sound and video libraries and device dependent libraries in general. While some areas are very well covered by core .NET libraries (such as database connectivity, file I/O, sockets, HTTP, XML manipulation, standard cryptography), the others (such as numerical libraries, general parsing libraries) are easy to implement in pure .NET but may be under represented as compared to availability of corresponding native libraries. For developers of both proprietary and open source software (including free software), licensing information is also critically important. Entries in the list therefore provide information about the scope of the listed libraries, main dependencies (especially when these affect platform dependence), and licensing information.

== Historical background ==
The [[.NET Framework]] has long supported cross-platform software development. The framework has been designed from the beginning for language interoperability, and parts of it were standardized in open standard (The [[.NET Framework#Common Language Infrastructure|Common Language Infrastructure]] and framework's most used programming language, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]). The original framework was first implemented only on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows operating systems]]. [[Microsoft]], the framework developer, and its partners, were working towards making their patents that cover some .NET - implemented technologies essential for framework implementation, available under "[[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory terms]]", which evolved into several patent promises issued by Microsoft. This made alternative third party implementations of the framework possible such as [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[Portable.NET]], and emulation [http://crossnet.codeplex.com/ CrossNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codeplex.com/crossnet |title=CrossNet |publisher=Codeplex.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of that, it has long been a concern within the [[Open source community]] that using alternative .NET implementations for cross-platform development, especially of free software, is unsafe because of the possibility or Microsoft patent claims against such implementations. The [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[Richard Stallman]] has openly opposed inclusion of C# implementations in the default installation of GNU/Linux distributions and stated that they (the community) should discourage people from writing programs in C#. Primary concerns were parts of the framework implementations that were not subject to standards and were not explicitly included in Microsoft's patent promises.

The 2010s saw some significant shifts in Microsoft's approach towards the Open software community. The company open sourced the [[.NET Compiler Platform]] ("Roslyn") and the [[ASP.NET]] in April 2014, and later the [[.NET Core]] (open sourced on November 2014&lt;ref name=landwerth-dotnetcore-oss&gt;{{cite web |title=.NET Core is Open Source|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx|website=.NET Framework Blog|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=30 December 2014|date=12 November 2014|first=Immo|last=Landwerth}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other software. In February 2016, Microsoft acquired [[Xamarin]], developer of [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open source and cross platform implementation of .NET. On March 31, 2016 Microsoft announced at [[Build (developer conference)|Microsoft Build]] that they will completely [[Software relicensing|re-license]] Mono under the MIT license.&lt;ref name="Anderson1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/31/xamarin_tools_code_free_and_open_source/|title=Microsoft to make Xamarin tools and code free and open source.|work=The Register|date=31 March 2016|first=Tim|last=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft issued the Patent Promise for Mono stating that they won't assert any "applicable patents" against parties that are "using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing Mono".&lt;ref name=Ferraira1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/news/29929/xamarin-now-comes-free-with-visual-studio|title=Xamarin now comes free with Visual Studio.|work=The Tech Report|date=31 March 2016|first=Bruno|last=Ferraira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft_PP_Mono"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/PATENTS.TXT| title=Microsoft Patent Promise for Mono | last= | first= | work=Mono on GitHub| publisher= Mono Project| date= 2016-03-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416133644/https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/PATENTS.TXT | archivedate=2016-04-16|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that the Mono Project was contributed to the [[.NET Foundation]], a nonprofit organization established by [[Microsoft Corporation|Microsoft]] in March 2014 to improve [[open-source software]] development and collaboration around the [[.NET Framework]].&lt;ref name="tc2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lardinois |first1=Frederic |date=April 3, 2014 |title=Microsoft Launches .NET Foundation To Foster The .NET Open Source Ecosystem |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/03/microsoft-launches-net-foundation-to-foster-the-net-open-source-ecosystem/ |website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these developments, a strong open source community has begun to develop around the .NET framework (especially on [[GitHub]]), starting a number of libraries and software projects&lt;ref name="NetOpenProjects"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/dotnet-developer-projects.md|title=.NET Open Source Developer Projects|work=GitHub|date=15 April 2015|first=|last=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415164104/https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/dotnet-developer-projects.md|archive-date=2016-04-15|access-date=2016-04-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; targeting the .NET framework for its cross platform character.

The .NET framework natively provides utilities for object-relational mapping&lt;ref name="OrmAmbler"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agiledata.org/essays/mappingObjects.html | title=Mapping Objects to Relational Databases: O/R Mapping In Detail | last=Ambler | first=Scott | work= | publisher=Agile Data | date= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103222615/http://www.agiledata.org/essays/mappingObjects.html | archive-date=2018-11-03 |access-date=2018-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[ADO.NET]], a part of .NET stack since .NET 1.0. In addition, a number of third-party object-relational libraries have been emerged, especially in earlier years of the .NET development, in order to fill some perceived gaps of the framework. 
&lt;ref name="OrmMaksimovic"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.agile-code.com/blog/microsoft-net-or-mapper-choose-your-own/ | title=Microsoft.NET O/R mapper: choose your own! | last=Maksimovic | first=Zoran | work=| publisher=agile-code.com  | date=November 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103220259/https://www.agile-code.com/blog/microsoft-net-or-mapper-choose-your-own/ | archive-date=2018-11-03 |access-date=2018-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the framework has evolved, additional object-relational tools were added, such as the [[Entity Framework]] included with the [[ .NET Framework 3.5]]. [[LINQ to SQL]] was also introduced with .NET 3.5.  This somehow reduced significance and popularity of third-party object-relational libraries. 

==== Open source object-relational mapping tools ====


===== Entity Framework =====
'''[[Entity Framework]]''' is an open source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krill|first=Paul|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/microsoft-open-sources-entity-framework-198213|title=Microsoft open-sources Entity Framework|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object-relational mapping|object-relational mapping (ORM)]] framework for [[ADO.NET]].  It was a part of [[.NET Framework]], but since Entity framework version 6 it is separated from .NET framework.

===== NConstruct Lite =====
[http://www.brothersoft.com/nconstruct-lite-333381.html NConstruct Lite] is a desktop and web rapid application development tool and environment for [[.NET Framework]], containing an extensive library for [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]].&lt;ref name="NConstructGitHub"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.openhub.net/p/NConstruct-Lite | title=NConstruct Lite - Project summary on GitHub| last= | first= | work=| publisher= GitHub| date=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528112838/https://www.openhub.net/p/NConstruct-Lite | archive-date=2016-05-28|access-date=2016-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== NHibernate =====
[[NHibernate]] is an object-relationar mapper for the .NET platform.
===== SQLProvider =====
SQLProvider is an ORM-like-tool for F# language and SQL databases.

==== Proprietary object-relational mapping tools ====
===== DataObjects.Net =====
[http://dataobjects.net/ DataObjects.NET]  is an object-relational mapper and business logic layer development framework for .NET projects. The framework focuses on non-trivial domain models with deep inheritance and composite objects,  and on code-first, test-driven development. It is a proprietary library that comes with source code, and community edition of the library is available for free.

=== Serialization and data formats ===

The .NET framework comes with a wide set of utilities for [[serialization]] of objects. The framework provides native object serialization to and from XML, JSON and binary streams. In spite of that, there are numerous third-party libraries that support serialization to target formats and working with these formats.

==== Open source serialization and data format libraries ====

===== Json.NET =====
[https://www.newtonsoft.com/json Json.NET] is a JSON framework for the .NET platform. Beside serialization and deserialization of arbitrary objects, is features numerous utilities for working with JSON documents. One can compose the  object structures that map to JSON documents, save them to strings, streams or files, reload object structure from streams, traverse the structures, find parts by using JSON Path (an analogue to XPath in XML), convert JSON documents to XML documents, etc.

According to the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]], there are approximately 50,000 [[lake]]s and small [[pond]]s in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]], with a total surface area of about {{convert|200,000|acre|ha}}. About 2,200 of these lakes are {{convert|5|acre|ha}} or greater, with a total surface area of {{convert|134,000|acre|ha}}. These 2,200  include both public and private lakes. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimated (from an electronic file generated from 1:100,000 scale maps) that Ohio has 5,130 lakes totaling {{convert|188,461|acre|ha}}. The difference in the number of lakes estimated by USEPA and ODNR is likely related to numerous small ponds (high number, small acreage) not detected on the 1:100,000 scale maps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.ohio.gov/portals/35/documents/96vol3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Lakes==

One of the five [[Great Lakes]] is partially within Ohio.

Following is a list of the frequently occurring equations in the theory of [[special relativity]].

== Postulates of special relativity ==

To derive the equations of special relativity, one must start with two postulates:

#The laws of physics are invariant under transformations between inertial frames.  In other words, the laws of physics will be the same whether you are testing them in a frame 'at rest', or a frame moving with a constant velocity relative to the 'rest' frame.
#The speed of light in a vacuum is measured to be the same by all observers in inertial frames.

From these two postulates, all of special relativity follows.

In the following, the [[relative velocity]] ''v'' between two [[inertial frame]]s is restricted fully to the ''x''-direction, of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Kinematics==

===Lorentz transformation===

The following notations are used very often in special relativity:

;[[Lorentz factor]]

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where β = ''v/c'' and ''v'' is the relative velocity between two [[inertial frame]]s.

For two frames at rest, γ = 1, and increases with relative velocity between the two inertial frames. As the relative velocity approaches the speed of light, γ → ∞.

;[[Time dilation]] (different times ''t'' and ''t''' at the same position ''x'' in same inertial frame)

:&lt;math&gt; t' = \gamma t&lt;/math&gt;

!Derivation of time dilation

|
Applying the above postulates, consider the inside of any vehicle (usually exemplified by a train) moving with a velocity ''v'' with respect to someone standing on the ground as the vehicle passes.  Inside, a light is shone upwards to a mirror on the ceiling, where the light reflects back down.  If the height of the mirror is ''h'', and the speed of light ''c'', then the time it takes for the light to go up and come back down is:

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{2h}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

However, to the observer on the ground, the situation is very different.  Since the train is moving by the observer on the ground, the light beam appears to move diagonally instead of straight up and down.  To visualize this, picture the light being emitted at one point, then having the vehicle move until the light hits the mirror at the top of the vehicle, and then having the train move still more until the light beam returns to the bottom of the vehicle.  The light beam will have appeared to have moved diagonally upward with the train, and then diagonally downward.  This path will help form two-right sided triangles, with the height as one of the sides, and the two straight parts of the path being the respective hypotenuses:

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 \left(\frac{t'}{2}\right)^2 = h^2 + v^2 \left(\frac{t'}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to get &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{t'}{2} \right )^2 = \frac{h^2}{c^2 - v^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t'}{2} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t' = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking out a factor of ''c'', and then plugging in for ''t'', one finds:

:&lt;math&gt; t' = \frac{2h}c \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the formula for time dilation:

:&lt;math&gt; t' = \gamma t&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In this example the time measured in the frame on the vehicle, ''t'', is known as the [[proper time]].  The proper time between two events - such as the event of light being emitted on the vehicle and the event of light being received on the vehicle - is the time between the two events in a frame where the events occur at the same location.  So, above, the emission and reception of the light both took place in the vehicle's frame, making the time that an observer in the vehicle's frame would measure the proper time.

;[[Length contraction]] (different positions ''x'' and ''x''' at the same instant ''t'' in the same inertial frame)

:&lt;math&gt;\ell' = \frac{\ell}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of length contraction
|-

Consider a long train, moving with velocity ''v'' with respect to the ground, and one observer on the train and one on the ground, standing next to a post.  The observer on the train sees the front of the train pass the post, and then, some time ''t&amp;prime;'' later, sees the end of the train pass the same post.  He then calculates the train's length as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = v t' \,&lt;/math&gt;

However, the observer on the ground, making the same measurement, comes to a different conclusion.  This observer finds that time ''t'' passed between the front of the train passing the post, and the back of the train passing the post.  Because the two events - the passing of each end of the train by the post - occurred in the same place in the ground observer's frame, the time this observer measured is the proper time.  So:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell' = v t = v \left ( \frac{t'}{\gamma} \right ) = \frac{\ell}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This is the formula for length contraction.  As there existed a proper time for time dilation, there exists a [[proper length]] for length contraction, which in this case is ''{{ell}}''.  The proper length of an object is the length of the object in the frame in which the object is at rest.  Also, this contraction only affects the dimensions of the object which are parallel to the relative velocity between the object and observer.  Thus, lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaffected by length contraction.

;[[Lorentz transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma \left ( x - v t \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left ( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of Lorentz transformation using time dilation and length contraction
|-
|
Now substituting the length contraction result into the Galilean transformation (i.e. ''x'' = ''{{ell}}''), we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x'}{\gamma} = x - v t&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma \left ( x - v t \right )&lt;/math&gt;

and going from the primed frame to the unprimed frame:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma \left ( x' + v t' \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Going from the primed frame to the unprimed frame was accomplished by making ''v'' in the first equation negative, and then exchanging primed variables for unprimed ones, and vice versa.  Also, as length contraction does not affect the perpendicular dimensions of an object, the following remain the same as in the Galilean transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, to determine how ''t'' and ''t&amp;prime;'' transform, substituting the ''x''↔''x&amp;prime;'' transformation into its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma \left ( \gamma \left ( x - v t \right ) + v t' \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma \left ( \gamma x - \gamma v t + v t' \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma^2 x - \gamma^2 v t + \gamma v t' \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t - \gamma^2 x + x \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t + x \left ( 1 - \gamma^2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in the value for γ:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t + x \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{1-\beta^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t + x \left ( \frac{1 - \beta^2}{1 - \beta^2} - \frac{1}{1-\beta^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t - x \left ( \frac{\beta^2}{1-\beta^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma v t' = \gamma^2 v t - \gamma^2 \beta^2 x \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, dividing through by γ''v'':

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left ( t - \beta \frac{x}{c} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Or more commonly:

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left ( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

And the converse can again be gotten by changing the sign of ''v'', and exchanging the unprimed variables for their primed variables, and vice versa.  These transformations together are the Lorentz transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma \left ( x - v t \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left ( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|}

;[[Velocity addition]]

:&lt;math&gt;V'_x=\frac{ V_x - v }{ 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V'_y=\frac{ V_y }{ \gamma \left ( 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V'_z=\frac{ V_z }{ \gamma \left ( 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of velocity addition
|-
|
The Lorentz transformations also apply to [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]s, so:

:&lt;math&gt;dx' = \gamma \left ( dx - v dt \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dy' = dy \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dz' = dz \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dt' = \gamma \left ( dt - \frac{v dx}{c^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity is ''dx/dt'', so

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{ \gamma \left ( dx - v dt \right ) }{ \gamma \left ( dt - \frac{v dx}{c^2} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{ dx - v dt }{ dt - \frac{v dx}{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{ \frac{dx}{dt} - v }{ 1 - \frac{dx}{dt} \frac{v}{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt;

Now substituting:

:&lt;math&gt;V_x = \frac{dx}{dt}\,\quad V'_x = \frac{dx'}{dt'}&lt;/math&gt;

gives the velocity addition (actually below is subtraction, addition is just reversing the signs of ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''V&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' around):

:&lt;math&gt;V'_x=\frac{ V_x - v }{ 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'_y=\frac{ V_y }{ \gamma \left ( 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'_z=\frac{ V_z }{ \gamma \left ( 1 - \frac{V_x v}{c^2} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the velocities in the directions perpendicular to the frame changes are affected, as shown above.  This is due to time dilation, as encapsulated in the ''dt''/''dt&amp;prime;'' transformation.  The ''V&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' equations were both derived by dividing the appropriate space differential (e.g. ''dy&amp;prime;'' or ''dz&amp;prime;'') by the time differential.

== The metric and four-vectors ==

{{main|metric tensor|four-vectors}}

In what follows, bold sans serif is used for [[4-vector]]s while normal bold roman is used for ordinary 3-vectors.

;[[Inner product]] (i.e. notion of [[length]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\mathsf{b}} =\eta (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}} , \boldsymbol{\mathsf{b}})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[metric tensor]].  In special relativity, the metric tensor is the [[Minkowski metric]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Space-time interval]]

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - c^2 dt^2 = \begin{pmatrix} cdt &amp; dx &amp; dy &amp; dz \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} cdt \\ dx \\ dy \\ dz \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is known as the spacetime interval.  This inner product is invariant under the Lorentz transformation, that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \eta ( \boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}' , \boldsymbol{\mathsf{b}}' ) = \eta \left ( \Lambda \boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}} , \Lambda \boldsymbol{\mathsf{b}} \right ) = \eta ( \boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}} , \boldsymbol{\mathsf{b}} )&lt;/math&gt;

The sign of the metric and the placement of the ''ct'', ''ct''', ''cdt'', and ''cdt&amp;prime;'' time-based terms can vary depending on the author's choice.  For instance, many times the time-based terms are placed first in the four-vectors, with the spatial terms following.  Also, sometimes ''η'' is replaced with −''η'', making the spatial terms produce negative contributions to the dot product or spacetime interval, while the time term makes a positive contribution.  These differences can be used in any combination, so long as the choice of standards is followed completely throughout the computations performed.

===Lorentz transforms===

It is possible to express the above coordinate transformation via a matrix.  To simplify things, it can be best to replace ''t'', ''t&amp;prime;'', ''dt'', and ''dt&amp;prime;'' with ''ct'', ''ct''', ''cdt'', and ''cdt&amp;prime;'', which has the dimensions of distance.  So:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma x - \gamma \beta c t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c t' = \gamma c t - \gamma \beta x \,&lt;/math&gt;

then in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} c t' \\ x' \\ y' \\ z' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma &amp; - \gamma \beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ - \gamma \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1  \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} c t \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The vectors in the above transformation equation are known as four-vectors, in this case they are specifically the position four-vectors.  In general, in special relativity, four-vectors can be transformed from one reference frame to another as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}' = \Lambda \boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}&lt;/math&gt; are the four-vector and the transformed four-vector, respectively, and Λ is the transformation matrix, which, for a given transformation is the same for all four-vectors one might want to transform.  So &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{a}}'&lt;/math&gt; can be a four-vector representing position, velocity, or momentum, and the same Λ can be used when transforming between the same two frames. The most general Lorentz transformation includes boosts and rotations; the components are complicated and the transformation requires [[spinor]]s.

===4-vectors and frame-invariant results===

Invariance and unification of physical quantities both arise from [[four-vector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Manchester Physics Series, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner product of a 4-vector with itself is equal to a scalar (by definition of the inner product), and since the 4-vectors are physical quantities their magnitudes correspond to physical quantities also.

==Doppler shift==

{{main|Doppler effect}}

General doppler shift:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu' = \gamma \nu \left ( 1 - \beta \cos \theta \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Doppler shift for emitter and observer moving right towards each other (or directly away):

:&lt;math&gt;\nu' = \nu \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta}}{\sqrt{1 + \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

Doppler shift for emitter and observer moving in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting them:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu' = \gamma \nu&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of the relativistic Doppler shift
|-
|
If an object emits a beam of light or radiation, the frequency, wavelength, and energy of that light or radiation will look different to a moving observer than to one at rest with respect to the emitter.  If one assumes that the observer is moving with respect to the emitter along the x-axis, then the standard Lorentz transformation of the four-momentum, which includes energy, becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \frac{E'}{c} \\ p'_x \\ p'_y \\ p'_z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma &amp; - \gamma \beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ - \gamma \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{E}{c} \\ p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E'}{c} = \gamma \frac{E}{c} - \gamma \beta p_x&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if 
:&lt;math&gt;p_x = \| p \| \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the angle between ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and &lt;math&gt;\vec p&lt;/math&gt;, and plugging in the formulas for frequency's relation to momentum and energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{h \nu'}{c} = \gamma \frac{h \nu}{c} - \gamma \beta \left \Vert p \right \| \cos \theta = \gamma \frac{h \nu}{c} - \gamma \beta \frac{h \nu}{c} \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nu' = \gamma \nu - \gamma \beta \nu \cos \theta = \gamma \nu \left ( 1 - \beta \cos \theta \right )&lt;/math&gt;

This is the formula for the relativistic doppler shift where the difference in velocity between the emitter and observer is not on the x-axis.  There are two special cases of this equation.  The first is the case where the velocity between the emitter and observer is along the x-axis.  In that case θ = 0, and cos θ = 1, which gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nu' &amp; = \gamma \nu \left ( 1 - \beta \right )\\
&amp; = \nu \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \left ( 1 - \beta \right ) \\
&amp; = \nu \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left ( 1 - \beta \right ) \left ( 1 + \beta \right ) }} \left ( 1 - \beta \right ) \\
&amp; = \nu \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta}}{\sqrt{1 + \beta}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation for doppler shift in the case where the velocity between the emitter and observer is along the x-axis.  The second special case is that where the relative velocity is perpendicular to the x-axis, and thus θ = π/2, and cos θ = 0, which gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu' = \gamma \nu&lt;/math&gt;

This is actually completely analogous to time dilation, as frequency is the reciprocal of time.  So, doppler shift for emitters and observers moving perpendicular to the line connecting them is completely due to the effects of time dilation.

The '''longitude rewards''' were the system of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] offered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government for a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's [[longitude]] at sea.  The rewards, established through an Act of Parliament (the [[Longitude Act]]) in 1714, were administered by the [[Board of Longitude]].

This was by no means the first reward to be offered to solve this problem. [[Philip II of Spain]] offered one in 1567, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] in 1598 offered 6,000 ducats and a pension,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Longitude and the Académie Royale|first1=J J |last1=O'Connor|first2=E F|last2= Robertson|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/PrintHT/Longitude1.html|year=1997|publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics}}
&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the [[States General of the Netherlands]] offered 10,000 florins shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Life of Christian Huygens|first=A.E.|last=Bell|page=35|year=1950|publisher=Edward Arnold, London|url=https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp#page/n41}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1675 [[Robert Hooke]] wanted to apply for a £1,000 reward in England for his invention of a spring-regulated watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these large sums were never won, though several people were awarded smaller amounts for significant achievements.

==The longitude problem==
The measurement of longitude was a problem that came into sharp focus as people began making transoceanic voyages.
Determining [[latitude]] was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun's [[declination#Sun|declination]] for the day.&lt;ref&gt;Latitude can also be determined in the Northern Hemisphere from the angle above the horizon of [[Polaris]], the northern [[pole star]]. However, since Polaris is not precisely at the pole, it can only estimate the latitude unless the precise time is known or many measurements are made over time. While many measurements can be made on land, this makes it impractical for determining latitude at sea.&lt;/ref&gt; For longitude, early ocean navigators had to rely on [[dead reckoning]], based on calculations of the vessel's heading and speed for a given time (much of which was based on intuition on the part of the master and/or navigator). This was inaccurate on long voyages out of sight of land, and these voyages sometimes ended in tragedy. An accurate determination of longitude was also necessary to determine the proper "magnetic declination", that is, the difference between indicated magnetic north and true north, which can differ by up to 10 degrees in the important trade latitudes of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Finding an adequate solution to determining longitude at sea was therefore of paramount importance.

The Longitude Act only addressed the determination of longitude at sea.  Determining longitude reasonably accurately on land was, from the 17th century onwards, [[History of longitude#Galileo's proposal — Jovian moons|possible]] using the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] as an astronomical 'clock'.  The moons were easily observable on land, but numerous attempts to reliably observe them from the deck of a ship resulted in failure.  For details on other efforts towards determining the longitude, see [[History of longitude]].

The need for better navigational accuracy for increasingly longer oceanic voyages had been an issue explored by many European nations for centuries before the passing of the [[Longitude Act]] in England in 1714. Monarchies in Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands offered financial incentives for solutions to the problem of [[longitude]] as early as 1598.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrewes|first1=William J.H.|title=Introduction|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the problem of longitude fell, primarily, into three categories: terrestrial, celestial, and mechanical.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_1/&gt;  This included detailed atlases, lunar charts, and timekeeping mechanisms at sea. It is postulated by scholars that the economic gains and political power to be had in oceanic exploration, and not scientific and technological curiosity, is what resulted in the swift passing of the [[Longitude Act]] of 1714 and the largest and most famous reward, the Longitude Prize being offered.&lt;ref name=Knowles&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knowles|first1=Jeremy R|title=Opening Address at the Longitude Symposium|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing the rewards==
In the early 1700s, a series of very public and very tragic maritime disasters occurred, including the wrecking of a squadron of naval vessels on the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707|Scilly Islands in 1707]].&lt;ref name=Stimson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stimson|first1=Alan|title=The Longitude Problem: The Navigator's Story|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=71–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, mathematician Thomas Axe decreed in his will that a £1,000 prize be awarded for promising research into finding “true longitude” and that annual sums be paid to scholars involved in making corrected world maps.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=A.J.|title=In the Wake of the Act, but Mainly Before|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=115–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713, when the longitude proposal of [[William Whiston]] and [[Humphrey Ditton]] was presented at the opening of the session of Parliament, a general understanding of the longitude problem prompted the formation of a parliamentary committee and the swift passing of the Longitude Act on July 8, 1714.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; Within this act, is detailed three rewards based on levels of accuracy, which are the same accuracy requirements used for the Axe prize, set by Whiston and Ditton in their petition, and recommended by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Edmund Halley]] to the parliamentary committee.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobel|first1=Dana|title=The Illustrated Longitude|date=1995|publisher=Walker and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*£10,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|10000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 1 [[Degree of arc|degree]] (equivalent to {{convert|60|nmi}} at the equator).  
*£15,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|15000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 40 [[Minutes of arc|minutes]]  
*£20,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|20000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 30 minutes 
 
In addition, rewards were on offer for those who could produce a method that worked within 80 geographical miles of the coast (where ships would be in most danger), and for those with promising ideas who needed financial help to bring them to trial.

Proposed methods would be tested by sailing through the ocean, from Britain to any port in West Indies (about six weeks) without losing its longitude beyond the limits listed above.  Also, the contender would be required to demonstrate the accuracy of their method by determining the longitude of a specific land based feature whose longitude was already accurately known.  The parliamentary committee also established the [[Board of Longitude]]. This panel of adjudicators would review proposed solutions and were also given authority to grant up to £2,000 in advances for promising projects that did not entirely fulfill the terms of the prize levels, but that were still found worthy of encouragement.&lt;ref name=Stimson/&gt; The exact terms of the requirements for the prizes would later be contended by several recipients, including John Harrison. Ultimately, the £20,000 reward was not awarded to anyone in a lump sum, although [[John Harrison]] did receive a series of payments totaling £23,065.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrewes|first1=William J.H.|title=Even Newton Could Be Wrong: The Story of Harrison’s First Three Sea Clocks|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=189–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Board of Longitude]] remained in existence for more than 100 years. When it was officially disbanded in 1828, an excess of £100,000 had been disbursed.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Britain's Board of Longitude: The Finances|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/03/howse.pdf|publisher=Mariner's Mirror (1998)|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable recipients==
The Longitude Act offered a very large incentive for solutions to the longitude problem. Some later recipients of rewards, such as Euler and Mayer, made clear publicly that the money was not the incentive, but instead the important improvements to navigation and cartography. Other recipients, such as Kendall and Harrison had to appeal to the Board of Longitude and other governmental officials for adequate compensation for their work. Still others submitted radical and impractical theories, some of which can be seen in a collection at Harvard’s [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name=Gingerich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gingerich|first1=Owen|title=Cranks and opportunists: "Nutty" solutions to the longitude problem|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=134–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemes and ideas for improvements to instruments and astronomy, both practical and impractical, can be seen among the digitised archives of the Board of Longitude.&lt;ref name="Papers of the Board of Longitude"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the Board of Longitude|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/rgo14|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Board of Longitude did not award £20,000 at one time, they did offer sums to various individuals in recognition of their work for improvements in instrumentation or in published atlases and star charts.

===List of awardees by amount===
* [[John Harrison]] &amp;ndash; £23,065 awarded overall after many years of contention with the Board as discussed in detail in the next section.

* Nathaniel Davies &amp;ndash; £300 awarded for the design of a lunar telescope for Mayer &lt;ref name=Sobel_2/&gt;

A full list of rewards made by the Commissioners and Board of Longitude was drawn up by Derek Howse, in an Appendix to his article on the finances of the Board of Longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Britain’s Board of Longitude: The Finances, 1714–1828|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/03/howse.pdf|publisher=Mariner's Mirror (1998)|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other submissions====
Only two women are known to have submitted proposals to the Longitude Commissioners, [[Elizabeth Johnson (pamphleteer)|Elizabeth Johnson]] and [[Jane Squire]]. Incoming submissions can be found among the correspondence of the digitised papers of the Board of Longitude.&lt;ref name="Papers of the Board of Longitude"/&gt;

==John Harrison's contested reward==

The winner of the most reward money under the Longitude Act is [[John Harrison]] for sea timekeepers, including his H4 [[marine chronometer|sea watch]]. Harrison was 21 years old when the Longitude Act was passed. He spent the next 45 years perfecting the design of his timekeepers. He first received a reward from the Commissioners of Longitude in 1737 and did not receive his final payment until he was 80.&lt;ref name=Quill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quill|first1=Humphrey|title=John Harrison: The Man who found Longitude|date=1966|publisher=John Baker Publishers|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was first awarded £250 in 1737, in order to improve on his promising H1 sea clock, leading to the construction of H2. £2,000 was rewarded over the span of 1741–1755 for continued construction and completion of H2 and H3. From 1760 to 1765, Harrison received £2,865 for various expenses related to the construction, ocean trials, and eventual award for the performance of his sea watch H4.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Richard|last2=Higgitt|first2=Rebekah|title=Finding longitude: how clocks and stars helped solve the longitude problem|date=2014|publisher=Collins|location=Glasgow|isbn=9780007525867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite
the performance of the H4 exceeding the accuracy requirement of the highest reward possible in the original [[Longitude Act]], Harrison was rewarded £7,500 (that is, £10,000 minus payments he had received in 1762 and 1764) once he had revealed the method of making his device, and was told that he must show that his single machine could be replicated before the final £10,000 could be paid.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2/&gt;

Harrison made one rather than the requested two further copies of H4, and he and his family members eventually appealed to [[King George III]] after petitions for further rewards were not answered by the [[Board of Longitude]].&lt;ref name=Quill/&gt; A reward of £8,750 was granted by Parliament in 1773 for a total payment of £23,065 spanning thirty-six years.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2/&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
*[[Rupert T. Gould]]'s 1923 ''The Marine Chronometer'' ({{ISBN|0907462057}}) is a thorough reference work on the Marine Chronometer. It covers the chronometer's history from the earliest attempts to measure longitude, while including detailed discussions and illustrations of the various mechanisms and their inventors.
*[[Dava Sobel]]'s 1996 bestseller ''[[Longitude (book)|Longitude]]'' ({{ISBN|0-14-025879-5}}) recounts Harrison's story. A film adaptation of ''[[Longitude (TV serial)|Longitude]]'' was released by [[Granada Productions]] and [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] in 2000, starring [[Michael Gambon]] as Harrison and [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Rupert Gould]].

'''Louis François Clément Breguet''' (22 December 1804 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1883),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' July 15, 1886, volume 34, page 259&lt;/ref&gt;  was a French physicist and watchmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Hall ''A biographical dictionary of people in engineering'', Purdue University Press, 2008 {{ISBN|1-55753-459-4}}, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; noted for his work in the  early days of [[electrical telegraphy|telegraphy]].

Educated in Switzerland, Breguet was the grandson of [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]], founder of the [[Breguet (watch)|watch manufacturing company Breguet]].  He became manager of ''Breguet et Fils'' watchmakers in 1833 after his father [[Louis Antoine Breguet]] retired.

Between 1835 and 1840 he standardized the company product line of watches, then making 350 watches per year, and diversified into scientific instruments, electrical devices, recording instruments, an electric thermometer, telegraph instruments and electrically synchronized clocks.  With Alphonse Foy, in 1842 he developed an electrical needle telegraph to replace the [[Semaphore line|optical telegraph system]] then in use.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman page 73&lt;/ref&gt; and a later step-by-step telegraph system (1847) was applied to French railways and exported to Japan.  He observed in 1847 that small wires could be used to protect telegraph installations from [[lightning]], the ancestor of the [[fuse (electricity)|fuse]].

He also manufactured the rotating mirror [[Fizeau–Foucault apparatus]], used by [[Léon Foucault]] and [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] to measure the [[speed of light]] (1850).  In 1856 he designed a public network of synchronized electric clocks for the center of Lyon.  In 1866 he patented an electric clock controlled by a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tuning fork.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crazywatches.pl/tuning-fork retrieved 2010 09 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 he transferred the leadership of the [[Breguet (watch)|company]] to Edward Brown. Breguet then focused entirely on the telegraph and the nascent field of telecommunications. He collaborated in the development of an [[induction coil]], later improved by [[Heinrich Ruhmkorff]].

"'''Monetae cudendae ratio'''" (also spelled "'''Monetæ cudendæ ratio'''"; English: "'''On the Minting of Coin'''" or "'''On the Striking of Coin'''"; sometimes, "'''Treatise on Money'''") is a paper on [[Currency|coinage]] by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (Polish: Mikołaj Kopernik). It was written in 1526 at the request of [[Sigismund I the Old]], [[King of Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Dunning Macleod]], ''The History of Economics'', Bliss, Sands and Co./[[University of California]], 1896. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iJBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=Copernicus+Moneta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;[[Henry William Spiegel]], ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', [[Duke University Press]], 1991. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXJkjfVCOLoC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Copernicus+Quantity+Theory#]&lt;/ref&gt; and presented to the [[Prussian estates|Prussian Diet]].

==History==
[[File:Copernicus-Muenzschriften.djvu|thumb|150px|Click on image to read the [[German language|German]] version.]]
Copernicus' earliest draft of his essay in 1517 was entitled "De aestimatione monetae" ("On the Value of Coin"). He revised his original notes, while at [[Olsztyn]] (Allenstein) in 1519 (which he [[Siege of Olsztyn|defended against the Teutonic Knights]]), as "Tractatus de monetis" ("Treatise on Coin") and "Modus cudendi monetam" ("The Way to Strike Coin"). He made these the basis of a report which he presented to the Prussian Diet at [[Grudziądz]] (Graudenz) in 1522; Copernicus' friend [[Tiedemann Giese]] accompanied him on the trip to Graudenz.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1947, pp. 89-91 (chapter 24: The Diseases of Money). [https://books.google.com/books?id=oUEgAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22The+World+of+Copernicus%22+money&amp;q=diet&amp;pgis=1#search]&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1528 [[Prussian estates|Prussian Diet]], Copernicus wrote an expanded version of this paper, "Monetae cudendae ratio", setting forth a general theory of money.

In the paper, Copernicus postulated the principle that "bad money drives out good",&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Poor Kindleberger]], ''Comparative political economy'', [[MIT Press]], 2000, p. 329. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG2vA_PycB0C&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=Copernicus+Gresham%27s+law]&lt;/ref&gt; which later came to be referred to as [[Gresham's Law]] after a [[Stigler's law of eponymy|later describer]], Sir [[Thomas Gresham]]. This phenomenon had been noted earlier by [[Nicole Oresme]], but Copernicus rediscovered it independently. Gresham's Law is still known in Poland and [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as the Copernicus-Gresham Law.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Numismatic Society]], ''Numismatic Literature'', American Numismatic Society, 1972, p. 83. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rZgoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Prawo+Kopernika&amp;dq=Prawo+Kopernika&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same work, Copernicus also formulated an early version of the [[quantity theory of money]],&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; or the relation between a stock of money, its velocity, its price level, and the output of an economy. Like many later [[Classical Economics|classical economists]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, he focused on the connection between increased [[money supply]] and [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Volckart, "Early Beginnings of the Quantity Theory of Money and Their Context in Polish and Prussian Monetary Policies, c. 1520-1550", ''Economic History Review'', New Series, vol. 50, no. 3 (August 1997), pp. 430-49.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Monetae cudendae ratio" also draws a distinction between the [[use value]] and [[exchange value]] of [[commodities]], anticipating by some 250 years the use of these concepts by [[Adam Smith]]—although it, too, had antecedents in earlier writers, including [[Aristotle]].

Copernicus' essay was republished in 1816 in the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], as ''Dissertatio de optima monetae cudendae ratione'' (''Dissertation on the Optimal Minting of Coin''), few copies of which survive.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Historical Review]]''.

The '''Monteggia fracture''' is a [[fracture (bone)|fracture]] of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] third of the [[ulna]] with dislocation of the proximal [[head of radius|head of the radius]]. It is named after [[Giovanni Battista Monteggia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2151|Monteggia's fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Monteggia. Istituzioni Chirurgiche. Vol 5. Milano, Pirotta &amp; Maspero, 1814.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Mechanisms include:
*Fall on an outstretched hand with the forearm in excessive [[pronation]] (hyper-pronation injury).  The Ulna fractures in the proximal one-third of the shaft due to extreme dislocation.  Depending on the impact and forces applied in each direction, degree of energy absorption determines pattern, involvement of the radial head and whether or not open soft tissue occurs.
*Direct blow on back of upper forearm would be a very uncommon cause.  In this context, isolated ulnar shaft fractures are most commonly seen in defence against blunt trauma (e.g. nightstick injury). Such an isolated ulnar shaft fracture is ''not'' a Monteggia fracture.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It is called a 'nightstick fracture'.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===

There are four types (depending upon displacement of the radial head):&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1231438-overview eMedicine: Monteggia Fracture]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bado Classification - Monteggia Fractures.jpg|thumb|Bado Classification - Monteggia Fractures]] 
*I - Extension type (60%) - ulna shaft angulates anteriorly (extends) and radial head dislocates anteriorly.
*II - Flexion type (15%) - ulna shaft angulates posteriorly (flexes) and radial head dislocates posteriorly.
*III - Lateral type (20%) - ulna shaft angulates laterally (bent to outside) and radial head dislocates to the side.
*IV - Combined type (5%) - ulna shaft and radial shaft are both fractured and radial head is dislocated, typically anteriorly.

These are known as the Bado types.

==Management==
Monteggia fractures may be managed conservatively in [[children]] with closed reduction (resetting and [[Orthopedic cast|casting]]), but due to high risk of displacement causing malunion, [[open reduction internal fixation]] is typically performed.&lt;ref name="pft"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McRae |first1=Ronald |last2=Esser |first2=Max |title=Practical Fracture Treatment |edition=5th |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-443-06876-8 |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteosynthesis (open reduction and internal fixation) of the ulnar shaft is considered the standard of care in adults.  It promotes stability of the radial head dislocation and allows very early mobilisation to prevent stiffness.  The elbow joint is particularly susceptible to loss of motion.

==Prognosis==
In children, the results of early treatment are always good, typically normal or nearly so. If diagnosis is delayed, reconstructive surgery is needed and complications are much more common and results poorer.  In adults, the healing is slower and results usually not as good. 

Complications of [[internal fixator|ORIF surgery]] for Monteggia fractures can include non-union, malunion, nerve palsy and damage, muscle damage, [[arthritis]], [[tendonitis]], [[infection]], [[joint stiffness|stiffness and loss of range of motion]], [[compartment syndrome]], audible popping or snapping, deformity, and chronic [[pain]] associated with surgical hardware such as pins, screws, and plates.  Several surgeries may be needed to correct this type of fracture as it is almost always a very complex fracture that requires a skilled orthopedic surgeon, usually a 'specialist', familiar with this type of injury.&lt;ref&gt;http://orthopedics.about.com/od/brokenbones/a/forearm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Cochrane has a B.A. in social science in 1951 from Illinois College. Her first professional job was as an indexer at the Corn Products Refining Company. She went on to receive an M.A. in library science from Rosary College (now [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]]). She worked as a reference librarian at the Chicago Public Library and Chicago Teacher’s College before going on to pursue a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]]. Focusing on classification research she saw her mission "to make [[S R Ranganathan|Ranganathan’s]] writings more accessible to North American LIS researchers, educators, and students."&lt;ref name="Barre10" /&gt; She was a co-founder of the Classification Research Study Group in the late 1950's, a group devoted to "the intellectual/theoretical development of knowledge organization" based on Ranganathan's Library Research Circle in India and the [[Classification Research Group]] in England.&lt;ref name="wws"&gt;{{cite web |last1=La Barre |first1=Kathryn |title=Weaving Webs of Significance: The Classification Research Study Group in the United States and Canada |url=http://docs.exdat.com/docs/index-363863.html |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Life==

In 1960 she was made Associate Director of the Documentation Research Project at the [[American Institute of Physics]] where she worked on ''A Project for the Development of a Reference Retrieval System for Physicists'' for the next four years. &lt;ref name="kent99"&gt;{{cite web | title=COCHRNE | website=personal.kent.edu | date=1999-04-14 | url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~tfroehli/sighfis/cochrn.htm | access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She differentiated how information retrieval would be performed by physicists as researchers versus physicists as authors using four facets which were in use at the [[American Institute of Physics]] until 2009. These facets were:
* property (being studied)
* object (of study)
* method (of inquiry)
* type of research (experimental, theoretical, or both).
Using bibliometrics, Cochrane was able to improve coverage of physics journals in ''Physics Abstracts'' using automated techniques.&lt;ref name="Barre10" /&gt;

In 1971 Cochrane became president of ASIS&amp;T. During her tenure AIS&amp;T began a continuing education program and prepared an international information science directory. &lt;ref name="ASIST"&gt;{{cite web | title=Pauline Atherton Cochrane - ASIST | website=ASIST &amp;#124; The Information Association for the Information Age | url=https://www.asist.org/pioneers/pauline-atherton-cochrane/ | access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued in her work to help librarians learn how to use "newer" technology to help patrons find information and created a six part continuing education series for the [[American Library Association]]'s magazine ''American Libraries''.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Coyle | first=Karen | title=Catalogs and Content: an Interlude | website=Coyle's InFormation | date=2016-07-04 | url=http://kcoyle.blogspot.com/2016/07/catalogs-and-content-interlude.html | access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Modern Subject Access in the Online Age'' Cochrane's lessons, co-written with various LIS colleagues, tackled topics such as creating a professional theory of information seeking behavior in users as well as an early awareness of information overload.&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cochrane |first1=Pauline Atherton |title=Modern Subject Access in the Online Age: Lesson 1 |journal=American Libraries |date=Feb 1984 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=80-83 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25626614 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AL2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cochrane |first1=Pauline Atherton |last2=Mandel |first2=Carol |last3=Mischo |first3=William  |last4=Harper |first4=Shirley  |last5=Buckland |first5=Michael |last6=Pietris|first6=Mary K.

'''''Psycho-Cybernetics''''' is a [[self-help book]] written by [[Maxwell Maltz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="book details"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Maxwell|title=Psycho-Cybernetics|isbn=978-0671700751|year=1960|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivational and [[self-help]] experts in personal development, including [[Zig Ziglar]], [[Tony Robbins]], [[Brian Tracy]] have based their techniques on Maxwell Maltz. Many of the  psychological methods of training elite [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s  are based  on the concepts in Psycho-Cybernetics as well.&lt;ref name=bookreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profitadvisors.com/psychoc.shtml|title=Psycho-Cybernetics Book Review|publisher=www.profitadvisors.com|accessdate=2008-03-14|last=Gray|first=Michael C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book combines the [[cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioral]] technique of teaching an individual how to regulate [[self-concept]], using theories developed by [[Prescott Lecky]], with the [[cybernetics]] of [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[John von Neumann]]. The book defines the mind-body connection as the core in succeeding in attaining personal goals.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/643367622.html?dids=643367622:643367622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Nov+02%2C+1973&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc='PSYCHO-CYBERNETICS'+AUTHOR&amp;pqatl=google 'Psycho-Cybernetics' Author; Plastic Surgeon Tries to Heal Inner Scars], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 2, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltz found that his plastic surgery patients often had expectations that were not satisfied by the surgery, so he pursued a means of helping them set the goal of a positive outcome  through [[Mental image|visualization]] of that positive outcome.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Maltz became interested in why setting goals works. He learned that the power of self-affirmation and mental visualization techniques used the connection between the mind and the body. He specified techniques to develop a positive inner goal as a means of developing a positive outer goal. This concentration on inner attitudes is essential to his approach, as a person's outer success can never rise above the  one visualized internally.

The book rapidly attained best-seller status and has remained in print continuously since its publication in 1960.

'''Quantum cognition''' is an emerging field which applies the mathematical formalism of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] to model cognitive phenomena such as information processing by the human brain, [[language]], [[decision making]], [[human memory]], [[concept]]s and conceptual reasoning, human [[judgment]], and [[perception]].&lt;ref name=Khrennikov2010&gt;

(2012), Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pothos, E. M., &amp; Busemeyer, J. R. (2013). Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling. Behavioral and Brain Sciences,36,255–274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Z., Busemeyer, J. R., Atmanspacher, H., &amp; Pothos, E. M. (2013). The potential of using quantum theory to build models of cognition. Topics in Cognitive Science, 5(4), 672-688.&lt;/ref&gt; The field clearly distinguishes itself from the [[quantum mind]] as it is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum mechanical about the brain. Quantum cognition is based on the quantum-like paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. 2006. Quantum-like brain: "Interference of minds"  Biosystems, vol. 84, no. 3, pp. 225–241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Information Dynamics in Cognitive, Psychological, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena (Fundamental Theories of Physics) (Volume 138), Kluwer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or generalized quantum paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Atmanspacher, H., Römer, H., &amp; Walach, H. (2002). Weak quantum theory: Complementarity and entanglement in physics and beyond. Foundations of Physics, 32(3), 379–406.&lt;/ref&gt; or quantum structure paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D. &amp; Aerts, S. (1994) Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes. Foundations of Science, 1, 85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; that information processing by complex systems such as the brain, taking into account contextual dependence of information and probabilistic reasoning, can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory.

Quantum cognition uses the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to inspire and formalize models of cognition that aim to be an advance over models based on traditional classical [[probability theory]]. The field focuses on modeling phenomena in [[cognitive science]] that have resisted traditional techniques or where traditional models seem to have reached a barrier (e.g., human memory&lt;ref name=Bruza2009&gt;Bruza, P., Kitto, K., Nelson, D., &amp; McEvoy, C. (2009). Is there something quantum-like about the human mental lexicon?. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology,'' 53(5), 362–377.&lt;/ref&gt;), and modeling preferences in [[decision theory]] that seem paradoxical from a traditional rational point of view (e.g., preference reversals&lt;ref&gt;Lambert Mogiliansky, A., Zamir, S., &amp; Zwirn, H. (2009). Type indeterminacy: A model of the KT (Kahneman–Tversky)-man. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 53(5), 349–361.&lt;/ref&gt;). Since the use of a quantum-theoretic framework is for modeling purposes, the identification of quantum structures in cognitive phenomena does not presuppose the existence of microscopic quantum processes in the human brain.&lt;ref name=deBarrosSuppes2009&gt;de Barros, J. A., Suppes, P. (2009). Quantum mechanics, interference, and the brain. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology 53'' (5), 306–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main subjects of research ==

===Quantum-like models of information processing ("quantum-like brain")===
The brain is definitely a macroscopic physical system operating on the scales (of time, space, temperature) which differ crucially from the corresponding quantum scales. (The macroscopic quantum physical phenomena such as e.g. the Bose-Einstein condensate are also characterized by the special conditions which are definitely not fulfilled in the brain.) In particular, the brain is simply too hot to be able perform the real quantum information processing, i.e., to use the quantum carriers of information such as photons, ions, electrons. As is commonly accepted in brain science, the basic unit of information processing is a neuron. It is clear that a neuron cannot be in the superposition of two states: firing and non-firing. Hence, it cannot produce superposition playing the basic role in the quantum information processing. Superpositions of mental states are created by complex networks of neurons (and these are classical neural networks). Quantum cognition community states that the activity of such neural networks can produce effects which are formally described as interference (of probabilities) and entanglement. In principle, the community does not try to create the concrete models of quantum (-like) representation of information in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. 2008. The Quantum-Like Brain on the Cognitive and Subcognitive Time Scales. Journal of Consciousness Studies, vol. 15, no.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum cognition project is based on the observation that various cognitive phenomena are more adequately described by quantum information theory and quantum probability than by the corresponding classical theories, see examples below. Thus the quantum formalism is considered as an operational formalism describing nonclassical processing of probabilistic data. Recent derivations of the complete quantum formalism from simple operational principles for representation of information supports the foundations of quantum cognition. The subjective probability viewpoint on quantum probability which was developed by C. Fuchs and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Caves, C. M., Fuchs, C. A., &amp; Schack, R. (2002). Quantum probabilities as Bayesian probabilities. Physical review A, 65(2), 022305.&lt;/ref&gt; also supports the quantum cognition approach, especially using of quantum probabilities to describe the process of decision making.

Although at the moment we cannot present the concrete neurophysiological mechanisms of creation of the quantum-like representation of information in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van den Noort, M., Lim, S., &amp; Bosch, P. (2016)|title=On the need to unify neuroscience and physics|journal=Neuroimmunology and Neuroinflammation |volume=3 |pages=271–273|url=http://nnjournal.net/article/view/1855/1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; we can present general informational considerations supporting the idea that information processing in the brain matches with quantum information and probability. Here, contextuality is the key word, see the monograph of Khrennikov&lt;ref name=Khrennikov2010/&gt; for detailed representation of this viewpoint. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally contextual.&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A., 
"Contextual Approach to Quantum Formalism" (Fundamental Theories of Physics 160), Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum systems do not have objective properties which can be defined independently of measurement context. (As was pointed by N. Bohr, the whole experimental arrangement must be taken into account.) Contextuality implies existence of incompatible mental variables, violation of the classical law of total probability and (constructive and destructive) interference effects. Thus the quantum cognition approach can be considered as an attempt to formalize contextuality of mental processes by using the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics.

===Decision making===
Suppose a person is given an opportunity to play two rounds of the following gamble: a coin toss will determine whether the subject wins $200 or loses $100. Suppose the subject has decided to play the first round, and does so. Some subjects are then given the result (win or lose) of the first round, while other subjects are not yet given any information about the results. The experimenter then asks whether the subject wishes to play the second round. Performing this experiment with real subjects gives the following results:

# When subjects believe they won the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round.
# When subjects believe they lost the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round.

Given these two separate choices, according to the ''sure thing'' principle of rational decision theory, they should also play the second round even if they don’t know or think about the outcome of the first round.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954). ''The Foundations of Statistics''. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; 
But, experimentally, when subjects are not told the results of the first round, the majority of them decline to play a second round.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., Shafir, E. (1992). The disjunction effect in choice under uncertainty. ''Psychological Science 3'', 305–309.&lt;/ref&gt;
This finding violates the law of total probability, yet it can be explained as a [[quantum interference]] effect in a manner similar to the explanation for the results from [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name=BusemeyerBruza2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pothos, E. M., &amp; Busemeyer, J. R. (2009). A quantum probability explanation for violations of ‘rational’decision theory. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276(1665), 2171–2178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YukalovSornette2009&gt;Yukalov, V. I., &amp; Sornette, D. (2011). Decision theory with prospect interference and entanglement. Theory and Decision, 70(3), 283–328.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar violations of the sure-thing principle are seen in empirical studies of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] and have likewise been modeled in terms of quantum interference.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, G. (2012). A New Enlightenment. ''Scientific American'' 307(5), 76–81. {{doi|10.1038/scientificamerican1112-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above deviations from classical rational expectations in agents’ decisions under uncertainty produce well known paradoxes in behavioral economics, that is, the [[Allais paradox|Allais]], [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and Machina paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;Allais, M. (1953) Le comportement de l’homme rationnel devant le risque: Critique des postulats et axiomes de l’ecole Americaine. ''Econometrica 21'', 503–546.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg, D. (1961). Risk, ambiguity, and the Savage axioms. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics 75'', 643–669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machina, M. J. (2009). Risk, ambiguity, and the dark-dependence axioms. ''American Econonomical Review 99'', 385–392.&lt;/ref&gt; These deviations can be explained if one assumes that the overall conceptual landscape influences the subject’s choice in a neither predictable nor controllable way. A decision process is thus an intrinsically contextual process, hence it cannot be modeled in a single Kolmogorovian probability space, which justifies the employment of quantum probability models in decision theory. More explicitly, the paradoxical situations above can be represented in a unified Hilbert space formalism where human behavior under uncertainty is explained in terms of genuine quantum aspects, namely, superposition, interference, contextuality and incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Sozzo, S., Tapia, J.

Considering automated decision making, quantum [[decision trees]] have different structure compared to classical decision trees. Data can be analyzed to see if a quantum decision tree model fits the data better.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Human probability judgments===
Quantum probability provides a new way to explain human probability judgment errors including the conjunction and disjunction errors.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., Kahneman, D. (1983). Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment. ''Psychological Review 90'', 293–315.&lt;/ref&gt; A conjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L ''and'' an unlikely event U to be greater than the unlikely event U; a disjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L to be greater than the probability of the likely event L ''or'' an unlikely event U. Quantum probability theory is a generalization of [[Bayesian probability]] theory because it is based on a set of [[von Neumann]] axioms that relax some of the classic [[Kolmogorov]] axioms.&lt;ref name=Bond2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=Rachael L.|last2=He|first2=Yang-Hui|last3=Ormerod|first3=Thomas C.|date=2018|title=A quantum framework for likelihood ratios|journal=[[International Journal of Quantum Information]]|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1850002|arxiv=1508.00936|doi=10.1142/s0219749918500028|issn=0219-7499|via=|bibcode=2018IJQI...1650002B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum model introduces a new fundamental concept to cognition—the compatibility versus incompatibility of questions and the effect this can have on the sequential order of judgments.

The liar paradox - The contextual influence of a human subject on the truth behavior of a cognitive entity is explicitly exhibited by the so-called [[liar paradox]], that is, the truth value of a sentence like "this sentence is false". One can show that the true-false state of this paradox is represented in a complex Hilbert space, while the typical oscillations between true and false are dynamically described by the Schrödinger equation.&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Broekaert, J., Smets, S. (1999). The liar paradox in a quantum mechanical perspective. ''Foundations of Science 4'', 115–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Aerts, S., Broekaert, J., Gabora, L. (2000).

===Knowledge representation===
Concepts are basic cognitive phenomena, which provide the content for inference, explanation, and language understanding. [[Cognitive psychology]] has researched different approaches for [[Concept learning|understanding concepts]] including exemplars, prototypes, and [[neural networks]], and different fundamental problems have been identified, such as the experimentally tested non classical behavior for the conjunction and disjunction of concepts, more specifically the Pet-Fish problem or guppy effect,&lt;ref&gt;Osherson, D. N., Smith, E. E. (1981) On the adequacy of prototype theory as a theory of concepts.

===Human memory===
The hypothesis that there may be something quantum-like about the human mental function was put forward with the quantum entanglement formula which attempted to model the effect that when a word’s associative network is activated during study in memory experiment, it behaves like a quantum-entangled system.&lt;ref name=Bruza2009/&gt; Models of cognitive agents and memory based on quantum collectives have been proposed by [[Subhash Kak]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S.

Observability and computability in physics, Quantum Matter 3: 172–176, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantic analysis and information retrieval===
The research in (iv) had a deep impact on the understanding and initial development of a formalism to obtain semantic information when dealing with concepts, their combinations and variable contexts in a corpus of unstructured documents. This conundrum of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and [[information retrieval]] (IR) on the web – and data bases in general – can be addressed using the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. As basic steps, (a) the seminal book "The Geometry of Information Retrieval" by K. Van Rijsbergen&lt;ref&gt;Van Rijsbergen, K. (2004). ''The Geometry of Information Retrieval''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a quantum structure approach to IR, (b) Widdows and Peters utilised a quantum logical negation for a concrete search system,&lt;ref name=WiddowsPeters2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Widdows, D. (2006). Geometry and meaning. ''CSLI Publications'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aerts and Czachor identified quantum structure in semantic space theories, such as [[latent semantic analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Czachor, M. (2004). Quantum aspects of semantic analysis and symbolic artificial intelligence. ''Journal of Physics A 37'', L123-L132.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the employment of techniques and procedures induced from the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory – Hilbert space, quantum logic and probability, non-commutative algebras, etc. – in fields such as IR and NLP, has produced significant results.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rosoka.com/sites/default/files/ParserlessExtraction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human perception===
Bi-stable perceptual phenomena is a fascinating topic in the area of perception. If a stimulus has an ambiguous interpretation, such as a [[Necker cube]], the interpretation tends to oscillate across time. Quantum models have been developed to predict the time period between oscillations and how these periods change with frequency of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Atmanspacher, H., Filk, T., Romer, H. (2004). Quantum zeno features of bi-stable perception. ''Biological Cybernetics 90'', 33–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum theory and an appropriate model have been developed by Elio Conte to account for interference effects obtained with measurements of ambiguous figures.&lt;ref name=Conte&gt;Conte, E., Todarello, O., Federici, A., Vitiello, F., Lopane, M., Khrennikov, A., Zbilut, J. P. (2007).

====Gestalt perception====
{{confusing|Section|date=June 2013}}

There are apparent similarities between [[Gestalt perception]] and quantum theory. In an article discussing the application of Gestalt to chemistry, [[Anton Amann]] writes: "Quantum mechanics does ''not'' explain Gestalt perception, of course, but in quantum mechanics and Gestalt psychology there exist almost isomorphic conceptions and problems:

*Similarly as with the Gestalt concept, the shape of a quantum object does ''not'' a priori exist but it depends on the interaction of this quantum object with the environment (for example: an [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer or a measurement apparatus]]).
*Quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception are organized in a holistic way. Subentities do ''not'' necessarily exist in a distinct, individual sense.
*In quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception ''objects have to be created'' by elimination of holistic correlations with the 'rest of the world'."&lt;ref name="amann-1993"&gt;[[Anton Amann]]: The Gestalt Problem in Quantum Theory: Generation of Molecular Shape by the Environment, Synthese, vol. 97, no. 1 (1993), pp. 125–156, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20117832 jstor 20117832]&lt;/ref&gt;
Amann comments: "The structural similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable, but even parables can teach us something, for example, that quantum mechanics is more than just production of numerical results or that the Gestalt concept is more than just a silly idea, incompatible with atomistic conceptions."&lt;ref name="amann-1993"/&gt;

===Quantum-like models of cognition in economics and finance===
The assumption that information processing by the agents of the market follows the laws of quantum information theory and quantum probability was actively explored by many authors, e.g., E. Haven, O. Choustova, A. Khrennikov, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov,&lt;ref&gt;Haven E. and Khrennikov A.
Quantum Social Science, Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; for detailed bibliography. We can mention, e.g., the Bohmian model of dynamics of prices of shares in which the quantum(-like) potential is generated by expectations of agents of the financial market and, hence, it has the mental nature. This approach can be used to model real financial data, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov (2012).

===Application of theory of open quantum systems to decision making and "cell's cognition"===
An isolated quantum system is an idealized theoretical entity. In reality interactions with environment have to be taken into account. This is the subject of theory of open quantum systems. Cognition is also fundamentally contextual. The brain is a kind of (self-)observer which makes context dependent decisions. Mental environment plays a crucial role in information processing. Therefore, it is natural to apply theory of open quantum systems to describe the process of decision making as the result of quantum-like dynamics of the mental state of a system interacting with an environment. The description of the process of decision making is mathematically equivalent to the description of the process of decoherence. This idea was explored in a series of works of the multidisciplinary group of researchers at Tokyo University of Science.&lt;ref&gt;
Asano, M., Ohya, M., Tanaka, Y., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., 2011.
Quantum-like model of brain's functioning: Decision making from decoherence. Journal of Theoretical Biologyvol. 281, no. 1, pp. 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Asano, M., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., Ohya, M., Yamato, I. 2013.
Non-Kolmogorovian Approach to the Context-Dependent Systems Breaking the Classical Probability Law
Foundations of Physics, vol. 43, no 7, pp. 895–911. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since in the quantum-like approach the formalism of quantum mechanics is considered as a purely operational formalism, it can be applied to the description of information processing by any biological system, i.e., not only by human beings.

Operationally it is very convenient to consider e.g. a cell as a kind of decision maker processing information in the quantum information framework. This idea was explored in a series of papers of the Swedish-Japanese research group using the methods of theory of open quantum systems: genes expressions were modeled as decision making in the process of interaction with environment.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Here is a short history of applying the formalisms of quantum theory to topics in [[psychology]]. Ideas for applying quantum formalisms to cognition first appeared in the 1990s by [[Diederik Aerts]] and his collaborators Jan Broekaert, Sonja Smets and Liane Gabora, by Harald Atmanspacher, Robert Bordley, and Andrei Khrennikov. A special issue on ''Quantum Cognition and Decision'' appeared in the [[Journal of Mathematical Psychology]] (2009, vol 53.), which planted a flag for the field. A few books related to quantum cognition have been published including those by Khrennikov (2004, 2010), Ivancivic and Ivancivic (2010), Busemeyer and Bruza (2012), E. Conte (2012). The first Quantum Interaction workshop was held at [[Stanford]] in 2007 organized by Peter Bruza, William Lawless, C. J. van Rijsbergen, and Don Sofge as part of the 2007 [[AAAI]] Spring Symposium Series. This was followed by workshops at [[Oxford]] in 2008, [[Saarbrücken]] in 2009, at the 2010 AAAI Fall Symposium Series held in [[Washington, D.C.]], 2011 in [[Aberdeen]], 2012 in [[Paris]], and 2013 in [[Leicester]]. Tutorials also were presented annually beginning in 2007 until 2013 at the annual meeting of the [[Cognitive Science Society]]. A ''Special Issue on Quantum models of Cognition'' appeared in 2013 ''Topics in Cognitive Science.''

It was suggested by theoretical physicists [[David Bohm]] and [[Basil Hiley]] that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both [[Implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|emerge from an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J.

Hiley, Paavo Pylkkänen: ''Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework''. In Paavo Pylkkänen and Tere Vadén (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, {{ISBN|90-272-5157-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CCX1NhhpQNQC&amp;pg=PA119 pages 119–144]&lt;/ref&gt; Pylkkänen underlines "unpredictable, uncontrollable, indivisible and non-logical" features of conscious thought and draws parallels to a philosophical movement some call "post-phenomenology", in particular to [[Pauli Pylkkö]]'s notion of the "aconceptual experience", an unstructured, unarticulated and pre-logical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paavo Pylkkänen|title=Can quantum analogies help us to understand the process of thought?|journal=Mind &amp; Matter|volume=12|number=1|pages=61–91|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/PYLCQA.1.pdf}} p.&amp;nbsp;83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical techniques of both Conte's group and Hiley's group involve the use of [[Clifford algebra#Physics|Clifford algebras]]. These algebras account for "non-commutativity" of thought processes (for an example, ''see:'' [[Commutative property#Noncommutative operations in everyday life|noncommutative operations in everyday life]]).

'''Synthetic ecosystems''' are [[System-on-a-chip|on-chip integrated devices]] where cellular cultures (individuals) and [[ecosystem services]] - such as the renewal of growth, delivery of  regulatory signals as well as removal of waste - are patterned into an integrated [[fluidic]] device using principles of [[landscape ecology]], [[physiology]] and [[cell signaling]].

'''''The Second Stage''''' is a 1981 book by American [[feminist]], [[activist]] and [[writer]]  [[Betty Friedan]], best known for her earlier book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interviews with Betty Friedan|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson, Miss.|isbn=978-1-57806-480-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXYStj1VHSoC&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=%22Second%20Stage%22%20friedan&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Sherman, Janann|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Friedan contends that "first stage" of feminism, a movement intended to liberate women from their traditional role as only mothers and house-wives, was coming to an end with the deadline for the ratification of The [[Equal Rights Amendment]], and that it was time to take feminism to a new stage, which could better deal with the issues of a new generation of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Nan|title=Betty Friedan Ushers in a 'Second Stage'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/09/specials/friedan-stage.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 19, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues discussed include: the double enslavement of women at work and at home, the [[social evolution]] of [[masculinity]], political [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[feminist]] [[lobbying]], developments in the field of [[management]] and leadership, and the need to recognize the social and economic value of traditional female occupations.

'''''Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], Michael A. Strauss, and [[J. Richard Gott]], based on an introductory [[astrophysics]] course they co-taught at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/06/we-have-a-pretty-good-idea-of-when-humans-will-go-extinct/ | title = We have a pretty good idea of when humans will go extinct | date = 6 October 2017 | accessdate = 10 October 2017 | publisher = ''[[The Washington Post]]'' | author = Christopher Ingraham }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was published by the [[Princeton University Press]] on September 20, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ryerson |first=James |title=The Truth Is Out There |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 23, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/books/review/search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html |accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour'' has been praised by literary critics.  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book as "an accessible and comprehensive overview of our universe by three eminent astrophysicists" and "an entertaining introduction to astronomy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=August 3, 2016 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/neil-degrasse-tyson/welcome-to-the-universe/ |accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Timpane of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' similarly called it "a well-illustrated tour that includes [[Pluto]], questions of intelligent life, and whether the universe is infinite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Timpane |first=John |title=Fall books: A warm, full, exciting autumn ahead |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=September 19, 2016 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2016-09-19/news/75433404_1_new-book-alan-moore-towles |accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote:{{quote|Reading through is akin to receiving a private museum tour from an expert scientist; the exhibits include [[Newton's laws of motion]], what will happen after our sun dies, how the space between stars is measured, [[quasar]]s and [[black hole]]s, [[time travel]], why the "[[Big Bang]] model is far more than 'just a theory,' " and the possibility of other life in the galaxy. The authors present challenging content in accessible prose as they lead readers from our solar system to the edge of the visible universe, getting into the how and the what of just about everything there is to know about the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=August 22, 2016 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-691-15724-5 |accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Wolfram Demonstrations Project''' is an organized, open-source&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/issues/v40_1/2.htm Interactive Economic Models from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Journal of Economic Education.&lt;/ref&gt; collection of small (or medium-size) interactive programs called Demonstrations, which are meant to visually and interactively represent ideas from a range of fields. It is hosted by [[Wolfram Research]], whose stated goal is to bring computational exploration to the widest possible audience.  At its launch, it contained 1300 demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/product/P000002568 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] CERN Courier June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but has grown to over 10,000. The site won a [[Parents' Choice Award]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=24826&amp;StepNum=1 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Parents Choice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- May 2012--&gt;

==Technology==
The Demonstrations run in ''[[Mathematica]]'' 6 or above and in ''[[CDF Player|Wolfram CDF Player]]'' which is a free modified version of Wolfram's ''Mathematica'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_05_02_07.html Math Games] MAA Online, May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificcomputing.com/Adventures-with-the-Wolfram-Demonstrations-Project.aspx Adventures with the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] John Wass, Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt; and can operate as a web browser plugin.

They typically consist of a very direct user interface to a graphic or visualization, which dynamically recomputes in response to user actions such as moving a slider, clicking a button, or dragging a piece of graphics. Each Demonstration also has a brief description of the concept.

Demonstrations are now easily embeddable into any website or blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaurov|first=Vitaliy|title=Add a Wolfram Demonstration to Your Site in One Easy Step|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/04/24/add-a-wolfram-demonstration-to-your-site-in-one-easy-step/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Demonstration page includes a snippet of JavaScript code in the Share section of the sidebar.

==Topics==
The website is organized by topic: for example, science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/molecular-wolfram-demonstrations.html Molecular Wolfram Demonstrations] ScienceBase&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics, computer science, art, biology, and finance. They cover a variety of levels, from elementary school mathematics to much more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and models of biological organisms.  The site is aimed at both educators and students, as well as researchers who wish to present their ideas to the broadest possible audience.

==Process==
Wolfram Research's staff organizes and edits the Demonstrations, which may be created by any user of ''Mathematica'', then freely published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/education/archives/29 Throwing beanbags in Mathematica 6], Scientific Computing, May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and freely downloaded. The Demonstrations are open-source, which means that they not only demonstrate the concept itself but also show how to implement it.

==Alternatives==
The use of the web to transmit small interactive programs is reminiscent of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java applet]]s, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and the open-source [[Processing (programming language)|processing]]. However, those creating Demonstrations have access to the algorithmic and visualization capabilities of ''Mathematica'' making it more suitable for technical demonstrations. 

The Demonstrations Project also has similarities to user-generated content websites like [[Wikipedia]] and [[Flickr]].  Its business model is similar to Adobe's [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]] and Flash strategy of charging for development tools but providing a free reader.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5464">The '''Wüstenhaus Schönbrunn''' (''Schönbrunn Desert House'') is a [[desert]] botanical exhibit in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].  It is located in the '''Sonnenuhrhaus''' ("Sundial House"), which was built in 1904 as the newest of the four botanical houses in [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn Palace Park]]. The desert exhibit opened in 2004 as a counterpart to the "Rainforest House" that opened in 2002 in the nearby [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn|Zoo Vienna]].
[[File:GuentherZ 2006-12-27 Sonnenuhrhaus 1336.jpg|thumb|350px|South facade of the Sundial House.]]

==History==
[[File:Sundial House (Schönbrunn) Wüstenhaus 20080216 025.jpg|thumb|East side.]]
The Sundial House stands opposite the [[Palmenhaus Schönbrunn|Schönbrunn Palm House]] (''Palmenhaus''; another botanical exhibit), directly between the [[Hietzing]] Gate and the Zoo.  The unprepossessing building owes its name to the [[sundial]] (''Sonnenuhr'') located in the gardens to the south.

It was built with the encouragement of [[Charles von Hügel]] – diplomat, explorer and founder of the Vienna Horticultural Society – to replace an earlier greenhouse which could no longer meet its plants' needs.  At first it housed the plants of the extensive "New Holland Collection"&lt;ref&gt;New Holland was an old name for [[Australia]]; Hügel's collection contained 32,000 objects, including many ethnological items.&lt;/ref&gt; which Hügel had assembled, and which had been acquired by the Imperial Court in 1848, and later expanded with plants from [[southern Africa]] and the [[Americas]] that required similar conditions.  The architect of the 1904 building was Alphons Custodis.&lt;ref name=home&gt;[http://www.zoovienna.at/anlagen/wuestenhaus/ Wüstenhaus] Home page on the Zoo website. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bombing of Vienna in World War II|bomb attack]] in February 1945, which almost totally destroyed the windows of the nearby Palm House, left the bulk of the Sundial House's glazing intact, probably because the Palm House stood between it and the bombed area, and because the Sundial House had windows which were roughly parallel to the spreading blast waves (unlike the Palm House).  A number of plants from the Palm House were therefore brought here for safekeeping, where space allowed.  The Sundial House again served as a refuge between 1986 and 1990, while the Palm House was renovated.

In April 1990 the first [[butterfly zoo]] in Austria was established in the Sundial House, but it was transferred to the greenhouse in the Burggarten in 1998.

[[Rust]] on the steel framework caused the building to be closed in 1998 and renovated from 2000 to 2003.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;  The Desert House was finally established here by a joint project between the Zoo and the Austrian Federal Gardens (''Bundesgärten''),&lt;ref name=home/&gt; which have managed the building since 1918 as successor to the Imperial and Royal Court Gardens.  The exhibition includes [[succulent plant]]s from the Federal Gardens, and small animals under the care of the Zoo, such as [[desert jerboa]]s, reptiles and birds.

===Notable features===

* Two ''[[Welwitschia]]s'' (one male and one female), the rare and endangered desert plant discovered in 1859 by the Austrian [[Friedrich Welwitsch]].  They can live up to 2,000 years; the two individuals in the Desert House, however, stem from the [[Botanischer Garten der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt University Botanic Gardens]] and are no more than 40 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebensministerium.at/article/articleview/23078/1/8705/ Wüstenhaus als Beispiel für gelungene Kooperation der Bundesgärten mit dem Tiergarten Schönbrunn] Austrian Government (''Lebensministerium''), 14 July 2004. Retrieved 30 August 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The distinctive, rose-like cactus ''[[Pereskia]]''.

==Architecture==

300&amp;nbsp;ft. long, 45&amp;nbsp;ft. wide and 50&amp;nbsp;ft. high, the building is fully glazed on the roof and the south face, while the north face is walled up.  With a total floor space of 14,000 sq. ft., the interior is divided lengthwise into three sections; there are two annexes to the central section, namely a plant-rich east wing which serves as the entrance hall, and a west wing used as a coldhouse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">'''Zero field NMR''' is the acquisition of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectra in an environment carefully screened from magnetic fields (Including from the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's field]]). It is useful for studying chemicals with magnetically active nuclei (spins 1/2 and greater), and for studying [[molecular dynamics]].

The development of very sensitive magnetic sensors such as [[SQUID]], [[Giant Monopole Resonance|GMR]], and [[atomic magnetometer]]s in the 2000s has made it possible to detect NMR signals directly in zero-field environments. Previous zero-field NMR experiments relied on indirect detection where the sample had to be shuttled from the shielded zero-field environment into a high magnetic field for detection with a conventional inductive pick-up coil.

One successful implementation was using atomic magnetometers at zero magnetic field working with [[rubidium]] vapor cells to detect zero-field NMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=D.|last2=Li|first2=S.|last3=Dural|first3=N.|last4=Romalis|first4=M.|title=Subfemtotesla Scalar Atomic Magnetometry Using Multipass Cells|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|date=18 April 2013|volume=110|issue=16|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.160802|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.160802|arxiv = 1208.1099 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110p0802S|pmid=23679590|page=160802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/apr/24/atomic-magnetometer-is-most-sensitive-yet |date= April 24, 2013 |title= Atomic magnetometer is most sensitive yet |first= Tushna |last= Commissariat |journal= [[Physics World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes but inaccurately referred to as [[nuclear quadrupole resonance]] (NQR).&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6919838}}&lt;/ref&gt;
