The '''meridian 1° west of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]]''' is a line of [[longitude]] that extends from the [[North Pole]] across the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Antarctica]] to the [[South Pole]].

The 1st meridian west forms a [[great circle]] with the [[179th meridian east]].

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 1st meridian west passes through:

The '''78th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 78 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[North America]]. It is the southernmost integral parallel north that does not pass through any continental mainland (being slightly to the north of [[Cape Chelyuskin]]).

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 78° north passes through:

'''Boyana''' ({{lang-bg|Бояна}}) is a neighbourhood of the [[Bulgaria]]n capital of [[Sofia]], part of [[Vitosha (municipality)|Vitosha municipality]] and situated 8 km south of the city centre, in the outskirts of [[Vitosha]]. Boyana is one of the most expensive parts of Sofia to live in. The residents are primarily wealthy business people, government officials and other prominent members of Bulgarian society. Formerly an outlying village, it was incorporated into Sofia in 1961.

==History==
Boyana's name was first mentioned in the 11th-century ''Vision of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'' in the excerpt &lt;small&gt;РЄЧЄТЬ ОУ БОІАНѢ ѠСТАВИТЄ ТОУ ПЛѢНЬ&lt;/small&gt;. The name is most likely derived from the personal name [[Boyan (given name)|Boyan]]. An alternative suggested etymology from [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Balkan Latin]] ''*boiana'' ("herdsman's [river]), from [[Latin]] ''boviana'' ("herdsman's") is considered less likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Чолева-Димитрова|first=Анна М.|title=Селищни имена от Югозападна България: Изследване. Речник|publisher=Пенсофт|location=София|year=2002|isbn=954-642-168-5|oclc=57603720|language=Bulgarian|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the 1040 uprising of [[Peter (II) Delyan of Bulgaria|Peter Delyan]] and the [[Pecheneg]] invasion of 1048, an important stronghold under the name of ''Boyan'' (''Боян, Βοιάνος'') is mentioned in the area, where a garrison led by a [[Voivode|voivod]] called Botko was stationed.

==Architecture==
The famous [[Boyana Church]], part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], is located in the neighbourhood. Other landmarks include the [[Boyana Waterfall]], the [[Kopitoto]] area and the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]] in the palatial former Boyana Residence, designed by [[Alexander Georgiev Barov]]. The [[Nu Boyana Film]] studios and the [[Big Brother Bulgaria]] house are also located in Boyana.

A '''business improvement district''' ('''BID''') is a defined area within which businesses are required to pay an additional tax (or levy) in order to fund projects within the district's boundaries.  The BID is often funded primarily through the levy but can also draw on other public and private funding streams.  BIDs may go by other names, such as '''business improvement area''' ('''BIA'''), '''business revitalization zone''' ('''BRZ'''), '''community improvement district''' ('''CID'''), '''special services area''' ('''SSA'''), or '''special improvement district''' ('''SID''').  These districts typically fund services which are perceived by some businesses as being inadequately performed by government with its existing tax revenues, such as cleaning streets, providing security, making capital improvements, construction of pedestrian and streetscape enhancements, and marketing the area. The services provided by BIDs are supplemental to those already provided by the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Tennessee Development District, Chattanooga, TN. [http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf "Green Infrastructure Handbook."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023034/http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf |date=20 March 2012 }} January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue derives from a tax assessment on commercial property owners, and in some cases, residential property owners. 

==Development==
The first BID was the [[Bloor West Village]] Business Improvement Area, established in [[Toronto]] in 1970 as an initiative by local private business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jennifer | last = Yang | title = The birthplace of BIAs celebrates 40 years | date = 18 April 2010 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/797286--the-birthplace-of-bias-celebrates-40-years | work = Toronto Star | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BID in the United States was the [[Downtown New Orleans|Downtown Development District in New Orleans]], established in 1974. There are now 1,200 across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Matson | first = Patricia | title = Wilmington Downtown hopes to emulate Big Easy’s success | work = Lumina News | publisher = Workin4U, Inc | date = 17 February 2011 | url = http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30 | accessdate = 7 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062559/http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30# | archive-date = 29 September 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries with BIDs include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jamaica, Serbia, Albania, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The process for creating a BID varies from one jurisdiction to another. In the [[United States]], it generally involves three steps. First, some number of businesses in the area petition the local government to create the BID. Second, the local government determines that a majority of businesses want the BID. Third, the local government enacts legislation creating the BID. Prior to this occurring, state legislatures need to grant local units the authority to create BIDs.

BIDs in England and Wales are funded by a levy on the occupiers rather than the owners of the properties within the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Bids |title=Local authority guide to Business Improvement Districts |page=3 |date=October 2005 |url=http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008061849/http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; If voted in by local businesses, the BID levy is an extension to existing non-domestic business-rates. "In England and Wales, for a BID to go ahead the ballot must be won on two counts: straight majority and majority of rateable value. In Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour.  This ensures that the interests of large and small businesses are protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britishbids.info/AboutBIDs/WhatisaBID.aspx#AboutBIDs_BIDDev%20British%20Bids | title = What is a BID? | accessdate = 2010-10-12 | publisher = British BIDs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BID may be operated by a [[nonprofit organization]] or by a [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] entity. The governance of a BID is the responsibility of a board composed of some combination of property owners, businesses, and government officials. The management of a BID is the job of a paid administrator, usually occupying the position of an executive director of a management company.

===United States===
{{main|Business Improvement Districts in the United States}} 
There are nearly 1,000 BIDs in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} New York City has 74 BIDs, the most of any city; in NYC, BIDs invest $134 million annually in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/bids.page|title=BIDs - SBS|website=www1.nyc.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. BIDs exist in almost every one of the top 50 largest cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. Minneapolis and Boston have been the last of the top 20 largest regions to adopt a business improvement district. The State of Wisconsin has adopted the most for smaller towns, with about 90 in the state{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, 25 of those being in Milwaukee and the rest throughout the state.

===Canada===
In Canada, Toronto has 81 BIAs within its city limit. [[Montreal]] – where BIAs are called Sociétés de Développement Commerciale (SDC) – has 17. The [[City of Winnipeg]] has 16 "Business Improvement Zones," the first of which were formed in 1987, with the amendment of The [[City of Winnipeg Act]]. In the province of [[Alberta]], they are termed "business revitalization zones". There are nine zones in the city of [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and 10 in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Regina, Saskatchewan has two Business Improvement Districts: Regina Downtown (BID) and The Warehouse District. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has 4 Business Improvement Districts: The Broadway BID, The Downtown Partnership, The Sutherland BID and The Riversdale BID. Some work has been made on creating a 5th BID in Saskatoon for the area of 33rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411232736/http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Push+continues+33rd+Street/8146530/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are over 400 BIDs in Canada but no count has been made. There are 8 business improvement districts in the Halifax Regional Municipality.  Halifax Regional Municipality has passed by laws in 2012 regarding the formation and conduct of these BIDs.
The 8 BIDS are: Downtown Halifax Business Commission, Downtown Dartmouth Business Commission, Spring Garden Area Business Association, North End Business Association, Quinpool Mainstreet and District Association Ltd. Sackville Business Association, Spryfield Business Association, Main Street Dartmouth Business Association.

BIDs have also become a powerful [[lobbying|lobby]] group, lobbying government for improvements such as new sidewalks, trees, park benches and other restorations. BIDs can also lobby different levels of government for a complete facelift on their area if they feel it is necessary to improve business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|title=Ottawa Business Journal|website=www.ottawabusinessjournal.com|accessdate=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011233655/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|archive-date=11 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rideau Street BIA in [[Ottawa]] has lobbied the city for years to give the entire street a face-lift because of its "run down" look.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===British BIDs===

[http://www.britishbids.info www.britishbids.info] is the industry body focused entirely on Business Improvement Districts.  
The organisation offers advice and services on BID development, management and renewal along with a range of training services and the [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/certificate-bid-management-2017/ Certificate in BID Management].

British BIDs conducts an annual [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/nationwide-bid-survey/ Nationwide BID Survey]. 2017 saw the publication of the 11th of these. The survey covers the fundamentals of a BID – number of businesses, types of businesses, levy rate and so on. It also asks questions about project delivery – what various BID's are delivering and how it works with other key strategic partners amongst other things. The survey provides the industry a real insight to the position at present.

British BIDs also produces the [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/industry-criteria/ Industry Criteria and Guidance] for developing and renewing BIDs alongside supporting organisations the  ATCM, Revo, ACS, BRC, intu and BPF.

British BIDs also administers the DCLG [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/the-bid-loan-fund/ BID Loan Fund] which supports developing BIDs.

In February 2017, Professor Chris Turner was appointed Chief Executive of British BIDs.

British BIDs have a Comprehensive renewal support package called [https://britishbids.info/services/ballot-buddy Ballot Buddy] which gives absolute confidence that the regs are adhered to and not at risk of a challenge.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|List of business improvement districts in London}}
In [[England and Wales]], BIDs were introduced through legislation (the [[Local Government Act 2003]]) and subsequent regulations in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cook | first = I. R. | title = Mobilising urban policies: The policy transfer of US Business Improvement Districts to England and Wales | work = Urban Studies, 45 (4), 773–795. | url = http://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cook-2008-Mobilising-urban-policies-Urban-Studies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Circle Initiative, a five-year scheme funded by the [[London Development Agency]], set up the first pilot BIDs, five in London, all of which had successful ballots by March 2006. [[Association of Town Centre Management]]-coordinated pilot 'talking shops' in 22 locations in England and Wales corresponded with the development of BIDs' regulations. As of October 2007 there were 36 proposed or operational BIDs across Greater London. By late 2014, there were over 180 BIDs in operation in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BID Intel Stats | url = https://www.bidintel.co.uk/bid-stats/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2017, there were 270 BIDs in the United Kingdom.

The [[New West End Company]] is the management and promotional company for [[Bond Street]], [[Oxford Street]] and [[Regent Street]].
As one of the largest Business Improvement Districts (BID) in Europe, New West End Company brings together the commercial interests of over 600 retailers, property owners and West End businesses working closely with the [[Mayor of London]], [[Transport for London]], [[Westminster City Council]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] and local neighbours in a collective vision to drive forward the nations retail heartland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newwestend.com/about-us/about-us About Us | New West End Company]. Newwestend.com (2013-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better [[Bankside]] was the third BID to be established in the UK, the second in London and the first south of the river. It was founded in 2005, and underwent a successful re-ballot in 2010 with 82% of businesses in favour.&lt;ref {{cite web |url=http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/our-last-ballot |title=Our Last Ballot |publisher=Better Bankside |accessdate=22 December 2013}} It is also notable for having won numerous awards, including Best Visitor Information Initiatives Silver Award in 2008, the Best Community Project 2011 and Best Partnership Award 2012 in the [[Mayor of London]]’s BID Awards, and was short-listed for Best Marketing &amp; Communications Campaign [[TfL]] Smarter Travel Awards 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/ Making Bankside a better place to live, work and visit]. Better Bankside.

The Means. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the Nottingham BID was successfully renewed by [http://www.centralmanagementsolutions.co.uk Central Management Solutions], a specialist management company for urban centres. This was particularly notable due to the fact that the BID merged the former leisure BID with the larger but, nonetheless, younger retail BID. The merger has led to combined services and aligned city promotions to consumers. 

In July 2015 the South Birmingham 'Lifford Bid' (Kings Norton, Cotteridge, Stirchley and Bournville) was rejected, with the Yes vote falling short with 45% of the vote.
 
====Scotland====
Business Improvement Districts Scotland (http://www.bids-scotland.com/) is the national organisation and voice for BIDs in Scotland. BIDS is responsible for delivering the Scottish Governments BIDs programme across Scotland, providing central support to developing BIDs, promoting and encouraging the development of BIDs across the country, whilst also working with operational BIDs to assist them in delivering for their local communities and contributing to sustainable inclusive economic growth. 

The Scottish Government provides a grant to local groups of up to £20,000 to help with the development of the BID. The legislation in Scotland (The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) is different from the England and Wales legislation in that it allows property owners as well as occupiers to be included in a BID. There are also differences in the timescales, ballot criteria (in Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour), reballot and the legislative requirements of the BID Proposer.  

The intention of the Scottish legislation is that BIDs are not restricted to towns and city centres to allow different and innovative BIDs to be developed across the country. The consultation of 2003 proposed that the BIDs model could be used in business parks, tourism and visitor areas, rural areas, agriculture and single business sectors. The legislation, and subsequent regulations were passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2006 and 2007 respectively. 

In March 2006, the Scottish Government announced funding for six pilot BIDs in Scotland, Bathgate (town centre), Clackmannanshire (business parks), Edinburgh (city centre), Falkirk (town centre), Glasgow (city centre) and Inverness (city centre). There are currently thirty seven operational BIDs in Scotland with a further twenty four in development. The thirty seven operational BIDs include thirty one town and city centre BIDs and three business park BIDs. 

In March 2014 the first tourism BID (TBID) was delivered in Loch Ness and Inverness (http://www.uniqueness.co.uk/)with others under discussion. The first themed BID in Scotland was delivered in December 2013, the Sauchiehall Street Evening Economy BID. In 2016 the worlds first Food and Drink BID was delivered in East Lothian (https://www.scotlandsfooddrinkcounty.com/) with the levy based on the number of full time employess, also a first. 

The development and interest in the BIDs model in Scotland continues to grow and the flexibility of the legislation and the model is now being recognised with the development of the Borders Railway BIDs Corridor and four Canal BIDs led by Scottish Waterways Trust. IN 2017 BIDs Scotland published The National Report on BIDs in Scotland (https://www.bids-scotland.com/about-us/the-national-report-on-bids-in-scotland-2017) which covers the types of BIDs, number of businesses, levels of employment in BIDs in Scotland and the contribution they make to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The opportunity for more innovative BIDs is under discussion. 

===Germany===
Six of the sixteen German Bundeslander (Federal States) introduced the requisite legal framework to create BIDs: Hamburg, Bremen, Hessen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein. BID projects in implementation exist only in a few German cities, yet – e.g. in Flensburg, Hamburg and Giessen.

==Criticism==

Whilst BIDs have been heralded for improving the trading environment, BIDs have also received noteworthy criticism.

BIDs have been accused of being by their very nature undemocratic, and that they concentrate power in a geographic area into the hands of the few.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Batchis, Business Improvement Districts and the Constitution: The Troubling Necessity of Privatized Government for Urban Revitalization, 38 [[Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly|Hastings Const. L.Q.]] 91 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Small businesses who fall below the BID levy threshold, although not liable to pay the BID levy, are often priced out of an area because BIDs tend to increase rental values. Larger businesses are more able to absorb these rent increases, particularly the multiple stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irelandafternama.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/the-retail-sector-business-improvement-districts-and-increasing-rents/|title=The Retail Sector, Business Improvement Districts and Increasing Rents|date=22 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIDs have also been criticized in the past by anti-poverty groups for being too harsh on the homeless and poor who may congregate around businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/nyregion/ex-outreach-workers-say-they-assaulted-homeless.html|title=Ex-Outreach Workers Say They Assaulted Homeless|first=Bruce|last=Lambert|date=14 April 1995|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIDs have also been known to be opposed to street vendors such as hot dog vendors and chip wagons.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In London, street traders who sold small items to tourists were barred from [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/street-traders-could-soon-be-barred-from-west-end-2029893.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Alistair | last1=Dawber | first2=Lydia | last2=Benatia | date=19 July 2010 | title=Street traders could soon be barred from West End}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of [[Civic Voice]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] criticised the creation of a BID in central London neighbourhood saying that is undemocratic: "Neither the people who live there, nor the many intriguing small shops and businesses, have been allowed to vote or have even been consulted.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/dont-let-business-in-to-destroy-unique-fitzrovia-8069360.html|title=Don’t let business in to destroy unique Fitzrovia|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I am wary of this initiative because of what may become [[unintended consequences]] (or indeed intended consequences) that help one sort of business (the property letting business) but will cause problems to smaller businesses and the large and wholly integrated residential population of the district".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/fight-this-undemocratic-attempt-to-manipulate-fitzrovia-into-something-it-is-not/ Griff Rhys Jones "We need to fight this undemocratic attempt to manipulate Fitzrovia into something it is not" Fitzrovia News, 24 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised some of the methods to oppose the BID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/writer-and-actor-criticises-bid-proposal-and-graffiti-campaign-against-it/|title=Writer and actor criticises BID proposal and graffiti campaign against it|date=24 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chauncy Dennison Harris''' (1914 - December 26, 2003) was a pioneer of modern [[geography]]. His seminal works in the field of American [[urban geography]] ("The Nature of Cities" and "A Functional Classification of Cities in the United States") along with his work on the [[Soviet Union]] during and after the [[Cold War]] era established him as one of the world's foremost urban geographers. He also made significant contributions to the geographical study of [[ethnicity]], specifically with respect to non-Russian minorities living within the Soviet Union. Harris traveled regularly to the Soviet Union and played a key role in establishing a healthy dialog between Soviet and American scholars.

==Life and career==
Harris was born in 1914 in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], [[Utah]]. The son of Academian [[Franklin S. Harris]], he showed an early interest in Geography, declaring to his family at the end of [[second grade]] that he was going to become a geographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ead.lib.uchicago.edu/view.xqy?id=ICU.SPCL.HARRISCD&amp;c=h Guide to the Chauncy D. Harris Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Brigham Young High School in Provo in 1930.  He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1933. The valedictorian of his class, Harris became the first [[Rhodes Scholar]] from BYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=232 | title = Catching Up with Former Rhodes Scholars | publisher = [[BYU]] | accessdate = 2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship took him to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] where he completed a second B.A. as well as a [[Master's Degree]]. He also received an M.A. from the [[London School of Economics]] before returning to the U.S. He completed his Ph.D. at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1940. His dissertation was entitled, "Salt Lake City - a Regional Capital in 1940."

After brief stints at [[Indiana University]] and the [[University of Nebraska]], Harris was appointed Assistant Professor of Geography at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1943. Around this same time he was called into military service with the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], Office of the Geographer. In Washington he became intrigued by the mystery surrounding the Soviet Union. He started studying [[Russian language|Russian]] and exploring the available [[cartography|cartographic]] and [[Statistics|statistical]] information about the country. He published his first two works on the Soviet Union in 1945. His early work in this area left him well prepared in the late 1950s when the Soviet Union began opening up to foreigners. By the time of his first visit, he was already a well established and respected expert in the field. Over the course of his career, he made 14 trips to the Soviet Union and played an important role in fostering and promoting collaboration between American and Russian geographers.

In addition to his work on the [[Soviet Union]], Harris made several important contributions to the field of American [[Urban Geography]]. In particular, in 1945 he wrote "The Nature of Cities" with [[Edward Ullman]]. The paper, published in the ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]'', described the [[Multiple nuclei model]] of urban development, which had prophetic relevance for understanding American cities in the later 20th century. This model gives a suggestion as to the possible land use within a city. It is an alternative model to the [[Concentric zone model]] and the [[Sector model]].

During his professional career Harris held a number of important and prestigious positions including dean of the Division of the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago (1954-1960). He served on the University of Chicago [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] from 1943 to 1984 and then continued as the [[Samuel N. Harper]] Distinguished Service [[Professor Emeritus]] in Geography until his death in 2003.

'''[[Hungary]]''' is subdivided administratively into 19 '''[[county|counties]]''' (''megyék'', singular: ''megye'') and the capital city (''főváros'') [[Budapest]]. The counties are further subdivided into 174 [[Districts of Hungary|districts]] (''járások'', singular: ''járás''). The capital Budapest is subdivided into [[List of districts in Budapest|23 districts]] (''kerületek'', singular: ''kerület'').

There are 23 towns with county's rights (''megyei jogú városok'', singular: ''megyei jogú város''), sometimes called urban counties. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers but they are not independent territorial units.

[[File:Polska-hydr-z.dobrzynska.png|thumb|Dobrzyń Land in present-day Poland]]
'''Dobrzyń Land''' ({{lang-pl|ziemia dobrzyńska}}) is a historic region, with the capital in the town of [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą]], in central-northern [[Poland]], within the [[Greater Poland]], between [[Mazovia]] and [[Prussia]]. It lies northeast of the [[Vistula]] River, south of the [[Drwęca]], and west of the [[Skrwa Prawa|Skrwa]]. The territory approximately corresponds with the present-day [[powiat]]s of [[Lipno County|Lipno]], [[Rypin County|Rypin]], and half of [[Golub-Dobrzyń County|Golub-Dobrzyń]] within the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]], although it encompasses parts of other counties as well. Totally, it has about 3,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 200,000 inhabitants.

==History==

Those areas have been a part of [[Piast]] state probably since the duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]] (960–992). Upon the death of his descendant Duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] in 1138, they were allocated to the newly established [[Duchy of Masovia]]. In his [[Prussian Crusade]], Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] in 1228 established the [[Order of Dobrzyń]] of [[Germans|German]] knights (''fratribus militiae Christi in Prussia''), whom he vested with the Dobrzyń estates. Soon after however, this order was absorbed by the [[Teutonic Knights]], who had established the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Order's State]] in the adjacent [[Chełmno Land]]. During the whole second half of 13th century it belonged to [[Kuyavia]]n [[Piasts]], the new branch of Mazovian dynasty. Finally, along with their other states, it became a part of resurrected [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]].

During the [[Polish–Teutonic War (1326–1332)|Polish–Teutonic War]] of 1326–1332, the forces of the Order's State occupied Dobrzyń Land, which however was relinquished to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1320–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in the 1343 [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]]. The Knights temporarily regained control in the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War]] of 1409–1411, but after their defeat at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] had to return it again according to the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|Peace of Thorn]]. It was incorporated into the [[Inowrocław Voivodeship]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Nevertheless, it has been still in the [[Mazovia]]n [[Diocese of Płock]] (and not in the [[Greater Poland|Greater Polish]] [[Diocese of Włocławek]]).

While the western part of the voivodeship had already been annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the course of the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, Dobrzyń Land on the eastern banks of the Vistula was incorporated into [[South Prussia]] during the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] in 1793. It was administered with [[New East Prussia]] from 1795 onwards, until in 1807 it became part of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] according to the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]. In 1815 however, it was attached to [[Congress Poland]] under the [[Russian Empire]].

Dobrzyń Land after [[World War I]] fell from Russia to the re-established independent [[Second Polish Republic]], it was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]], whereafter it was finally restored to Poland.

==Miscellanea==

The region has numerous lakes (like adjacent [[Prussia]] or [[Greater Poland]]) and descendants of [[yeoman|yeomanry]] (''drobna [[szlachta]]'', similar as [[Mazovia]]). Cities of [[Toruń]] and [[Włocławek]], as well as towns of [[Ciechocinek]] and [[Sierpc]], lie just besides its border. Its oldest officially crowned sanctuary of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] is [[Skępe]]; another is [[Obory, Golub-Dobrzyń County|Obory]]. Ecclesiastically, it is divided between the [[diocese]]s of Włocławek and Płock. After 1793, it has been part of administrative units with the capital in Płock and Warsaw; since 1938 it belonged to Toruń and Włocławek. [[Dialect]]ologically, it is usually adjoined to [[Chełmno Land]]. Therefore, it is considered as the transitory subregion between three big and different provinces: [[Greater Poland]], [[Mazovia]] and [[Prussia]].

'''Drainage density''' is the total length of all the [[streams]] and [[river]]s in a [[drainage basin]] divided by the total area of the drainage basin. It is a measure of how well or how poorly a watershed is drained by stream channels. It is equal to the reciprocal of the constant of channel maintenance and equal to the reciprocal of two times the length of overland flow.

Drainage density depends upon both climate and physical characteristics of the drainage basin. Soil [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability (infiltration difficulty)]] and underlying rock type affect the runoff in a watershed; impermeable ground or exposed bedrock will lead to an increase in [[Surface runoff|surface water runoff]] and therefore to more frequent streams. Rugged regions or those with high relief will also have a higher drainage density than other drainage basins if the other characteristics of the basin are the same.

Drainage density can affect the shape of a river's [[hydrograph]] during a rain storm. Rivers that have a high drainage density will often have a more 'flashy' hydrograph with a steep [[falling limb]]. High densities can also indicate a greater flood risk.

High drainage densities also mean a high [[bifurcation ratio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3770">The '''Eucla Basin''' is an [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] [[depression (geology)|depression]] located in [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]]. The onshore-offshore depression covers approximately 1,141,000&amp;nbsp;km² and slopes southward to an open bay known as the [[Great Australian Bight]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'Eucla Basin' was first used by H.Y. L. Brown ( see: - {{Citation | author1=Brown, H. Y. L. (Henry Yorke Lyell) | author2=South Australia. Parliament. House of Assembly | title=Report on geological character of country passed over from Port Augusta to Eucla | publication-date=1885 | publisher=Govt. Printer | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37098977 | accessdate=5 April 2012 }} ) on a geological map of South Australia that was published in 1900  - see page 12, of {{Citation | author1=Lowry, D. C. (David C.) | author2=Geological Survey of Western Australia | title=Geology of the Western Australian part of the Eucla Basin | publication-date=1970 | publisher=Geological Survey of Western Australia | isbn=978-0-7244-5250-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It extends more than 500&amp;nbsp;km offshore and about 350&amp;nbsp;km inland from the coastline. The Eucla Basin is a [[Cenozoic]] basin consisting mostly of [[carbonate]] [[sediment]]s and [[sedimentary]] [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. The basin contains a [[sandstone]] [[aquifer]] at its base (confined), and an unconfined [[limestone]] aquifer.

The surface area of the basin (and [[Nullarbor Plain]]) consists mostly of grazing and rangeland, but [[nickel]] and [[gold]] are mined at the western end. Very few people live in this part of the country, with most of the region having fewer than one inhabitant per km². In normal years, the area receives less than 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Due to a shortage of regional seals and [[source rock]]s, the basin has poor [[petroleum]] prospects, but it is forming as a major [[zircon]] producing area.

==Physiography==
The Eucla Basin is one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger [[Australian Shield|West Australian Shield]]. It includes the smaller [[Eyre Peninsula|Eyre Coastal Plain]] and [[Eucla Shelf]] physiographic sections.

The physiographic units within the basin are:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 Physiography pp. 16 - 36 of {{Citation | author1=Lowry, D. C.

{{Three worlds}}
The concept of  '''First World''' originated during the [[Cold War]] and included countries that were generally aligned with [[NATO]] and opposed to the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the definition has instead largely shifted to any country with little [[political risk]] and a well functioning [[democracy]], universal health care, [[rule of law]], [[capitalist economy]], [[economic stability]] and high [[standard of living]]. Various ways in which modern First World countries are often determined include [[GDP]], [[GNP]], [[literacy rates]], [[life expectancy]], and the [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/first-world.asp First World], ''[[Investopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In common usage, as per [[Merriam-Webster]], "first world" now typically refers to "the [[developed country|highly developed]] industrialized nations often considered the westernized countries of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/first%20world|work=Merriam-Webster |title=First world|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
After [[World War II]], the world split into two large geopolitical blocs, separating into spheres of [[communism]] and [[capitalism]]. This led to the [[Cold War]], during which the term ''First World'' was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macdonald|first1=Theodore|year=2005|title=Third World Health: Hostage to First World Health.|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|page=4|ISBN=1-85775-769-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbVkCkmCoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=fourth&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally thought of as the capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes [[Australia &amp; New Zealand]], the developed countries of Asia ([[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]]) and the wealthy countries of [[North America]] and Europe, particularly [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="nations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/third_world_countries.htm |title=First, Second and Third World |publisher=Nations Online |accessdate=27 May 2017 |date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology.&lt;ref name= nations/&gt; After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of [[NATO]], U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former [[British Empire|British Colonies]] that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer countries of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
According to Nations Online, the member countries of NATO after the Cold War included:&lt;ref name= nations/&gt;
*[[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].
The Western-aligned countries included:
*[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]
The neutral countries included:
*[[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref name="Yugoslavia: a concise history"&gt;Benson, Leslie; ''Yugoslavia: a Concise History''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2001 {{ISBN|0-333-79241-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='W0088977'&gt;{{cite news | title=Military Assistance Agreement Between the United States and Yugoslavia, November 14, 1951 | url =http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/yugo001.asp | work=Lillian Goldman Law Library | accessdate =4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifting in definitions===
Since the end of the Cold War, the original definition of the term ''First World'' is no longer necessarily applicable. There are varying definitions of the First World, however, they follow the same idea. John D. Daniels, past president of the Academy of International Business, defines the First World to be consisting of "high-income industrial countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= International business: environments and operations |last= Daniels |first= John |year= 2007 |publisher= Prentice Hall |isbn= 0-13-186942-6 |page= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar and Professor George J. Bryjak defines the First World to be the "modern, industrial, capitalist countries of North America and Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sociology: cultural diversity in a changing world |last= Bryjak |first= George |year= 1997 |publisher= Allyn &amp; Bacon |isbn= 0-205-26435-2 |page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. Robert Kohls, former director of training for the U.S. Information Agency and the Meridian International Center in Washington, D.C. uses First World and "fully developed" as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Survival kit for overseas living: for Americans planning to live and work abroad |last= Kohls |first= L. |year= 2001 |publisher= Nicholas Brealey Publishing |isbn= 1-85788-292-X |page= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other indicators===
Varying definitions of the term ''First World'' and the uncertainty of the term in today's world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later).&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book |title=Third World Health: Hostage to First World Health |last=Macdonald |first=Theodore |year=2005 |publisher=Radcliffe Publishing |isbn=1-85775-769-6 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbVkCkmCoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=fourth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{Cite web
 | title = First, Second and Third World
 | publisher = One World - Nations Online
 | date = July 2009
 | url = http://nationsonline.org/oneworld/third_world_countries.htm
|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of [[Gross National Product]] (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; The [[second world]] included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Most of the rest of the world was deemed part of the [[third world]], while the [[fourth world]] was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than US$100 annually.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; If we use the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the [[World Bank]] classifies countries according to their [[Gross national income|GNI]] or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.

==Three World Model==
[[File:Location NATO.svg|thumb|300px|right|NATO member countries as of 2017]]

The terms ''First World'', ''Second World'', and ''Third World'' were originally used to divide the world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gaddis |first1= John |title= We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 0-19-878071-0 |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the Cold War era, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] were created by the United States and The Soviet Union, respectively.

In 1952, the French [[demography|demographer]] [[Alfred Sauvy]] coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France.&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{Cite web

Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the "East-West Conflict".&lt;ref name=model/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard3&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Third World |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Developing World |last=Leonard |first=Thomas M. |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08OV704armMC&amp;pg=PA1542&amp;dq=Alfred+Sauvy+third+World&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Alfred%20Sauvy%20third%20World&amp;f=false |isbn=0-87073-943-3|accessdate=27 May 2017 |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the "First World" and "Second World" respectively. Here the three-world system emerged.&lt;ref name="leonard1542-3"/&gt;

However, [[Secwepemc|Shuswap]] Chief [[George Manuel]] believes the '''Three World Model''' to be outdated. In his 1974 book ''The Fourth World: An Indian Reality'', he describes the emergence of the [[Fourth World]] while coining the term. The fourth world refers to "nations", e.g., cultural entities and ethnic groups, of indigenous people who do not compose states in the traditional sense.&lt;ref name=fourth/&gt; Rather, they live within or across state boundaries (see [[First Nations]]). One example is the Native Americans of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=fourth/&gt;

==Relationships with the other worlds==

===Historic===
During the Cold War Era, the relationships between the First World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, by virtue of its name, was a primarily ideological struggle between the First and Second Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=hinds&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hinds |first1= Lynn |title= The Cold War as Rhetoric: The Beginnings, 1945-1950 |year= 1991 |publisher= Praeger Publishers |location= New York |isbn= 0-275-93578-7 |page= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] (from the U.S) and the [[Molotov Plan]] (from the Soviet Union).&lt;ref name=hinds /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bonds |first1= John |title= Bipartisan Strategy: Selling the Marshall Plan |year= 2002 |publisher= Praeger |location= Westport |isbn= 0-275-97804-4 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Powaski |first1= Ronald |title= The Cold War: The United States and the Soviet Union, 1917-1991 |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-19-507851-9 |page= 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in [[Berlin]]—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the [[Berlin Wall]] within the actual city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ambrose |first1= Stephen |title= Rise to Globalism |year= 1998 |publisher= Longman |location= New York |isbn= 0-14-026831-6 |page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the First World and the Third World is characterized by the very definition of the Third World. Because countries of the Third World were noncommittal and non-aligned with both the First World and the Second World, they were targets for recruitment. In the quest for expanding their sphere of influence, the United States  (core of the First World) tried to establish pro US regimes in the Third World. In addition, because the Soviet Union  (core of the Second World) also wanted to expand, the Third World often became a site for conflict. [[Image:Domino theory.svg|thumb|275px|right|The [[Domino Theory]]]]Some examples include [[Vietnam]] and [[Korea]]. Success lay with the First World if at the end of the war, the country became capitalistic and democratic, and with the Second World, if the country became communist. While Vietnam as a whole was eventually communized, only the northern half of Korea remained communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) announced that the first Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) would be available at the summer of 2010.

The movement of information and technology from the First World to various Third World countries has created a general "aspir(ation) to First World living standards".&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; The Third World has lower living standards as compared to the First World.&lt;ref name="leonard1542-3"/&gt; Information about the comparatively higher living standards of the First World comes through television, commercial advertisements and foreign visitors to their countries.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; This exposure causes two changes: a) living standards in some Third World countries rise and b) this exposure creates hopes and many from Third World countries immigrate – both legally and illegally – to these First World countries in hopes of attaining that living standard and prosperity.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; In fact, this immigration is the "main contributor to the increasing populations of U.S. and Europe".&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; While these immigrations have greatly contributed to globalization, they have also precipitated trends like [[brain drain]] and problems with [[repatriation]]. They have also created immigration and governmental burden problems for the countries (i.e., First World) that people immigrate to.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt;

===Environmental impact===
Some have argued that the most important human population problem for the world is not the high rate of population increase in certain Third World countries, but rather the "increase in total human impact".&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; The per-capita impact – the resources consumed and the wastes created by each person – is varied globally; the highest in the First World and the lowest in the Third World: inhabitants of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan consume 32 times as many resources and put out 32 times as much waste as those in the Third World.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt;
However, China leads the world in total emissions, but its large population skews its per-capita statistic lower than those of more developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global warming: Each country's share of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
Until the recent past, little attention was paid to the interests of Third World countries.&lt;ref name=darby&gt;{{cite book |title=At the Edge of International Relations: Postcolonialism, Gender, and Dependency |last=Darby |first=Phillip |year=2000 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0-8264-4719-8 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IG3PcfCGfQsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=international+relations+%22first+world%22+-War#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20relations%20%22first%20world%22%20-War&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinds |first1=Lynn Boyd |last2=Windt |first2=Theodore |title=The Cold War as Rhetoric: The Beginnings, 1945-1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bi9nAAAAMAAJ|year=1991 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-275-93578-7 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift.&lt;ref name=darby/&gt; However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.&lt;ref name=darby/&gt;

===Development theory===
During the Cold War, the [[modernization theory]] and [[development theory]] developed in Europe as a result of their economic, political, social, and cultural response to the management of former colonial territories.&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite book |title=International Relations Theory: A Critical Introduction |last=Weber |first=Cynthia |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-34208-2 |pages=153–154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4P-RPDXaKzMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA54&amp;lpg=RA1-PA54&amp;dq=international+relations+%22first+world%22+-War#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20relations%20%22first%20world%22%20-War&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; European scholars and practitioners of international politics hoped to theorize ideas and then create policies based on those ideas that would cause newly independent colonies to change into politically developed sovereign nation-states.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; However, most of the theorists were from the United States, and they were not interested in Third World countries achieving development by any model.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; They wanted those countries to develop through liberal processes of politics, economics, and socialization; that is to say, they wanted them to follow the liberal capitalist example of a so-called "First World state".&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; Therefore, the modernization and development tradition consciously originated as a (mostly U.S.) alternative to the Marxist and neo-Marxist strategies promoted by the "[[Second World]] states" like the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; It was used to explain how developing Third World states would naturally ''evolve'' into developed First World States, and it was partially grounded in liberal economic theory and a form of Talcott Parsons' sociological theory.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt;

==Globalization==
[[The United Nations]]'s [[ESCWA]] has written that [[globalization]] "is a widely-used term that can be defined in a number of different ways". Joyce Osland from [[San Jose State University]] wrote: "Globalization has become an increasingly controversial topic, and the growing number of protests around the world has focused more attention on the basic assumptions of globalization and its effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osland |first=Joyce S. |title=Broadening the Debate: The Pros and Cons of Globalization |journal=Journal of Management Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=137–154 |publisher=Sage Publications |date=June 2003 |url=http://jmi.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/12/2/137 |accessdate=27 May 2017 |doi=10.1177/1056492603012002005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Globalization is not new, though. For thousands of years, people—and, later, corporations—have been buying from and selling to each other in lands at great distances, such as through the famed [[Silk Road]] across Central Asia that connected China and Europe during the Middle Ages. Likewise, for centuries, people and corporations have invested in enterprises in other countries. In fact, many of the features of the current wave of globalization are similar to those prevailing before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Globalization? |url=http://www.globalization101.org/What_is_Globalization.html |accessdate=27 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015224819/http://www.globalization101.org/What_is_Globalization.html |archivedate=15 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The most prominent example of globalization in the first world is the [[European Union]] (EU).&lt;ref name=aucoin&gt;{{cite web |last=Aucoin |first=Danielle |title=Globalization: The European Union as a Model |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/euro/teachers/article.asp?parentid=23564 |year=2000 |accessdate=27 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035737/http://www.international.ucla.edu/euro/teachers/article.asp?parentid=23564 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is an agreement in which countries voluntarily decide to build common governmental institutions to which they delegate some individual national sovereignty so that decisions can be made democratically on a higher level of common interest for Europe as a whole.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web |title=The European Union: A Guide for Americans |url=http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531020012/http://eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=43 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 May 2008 |pages=2–3 |accessdate=27 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a union of 28 Member States covering {{convert|4324782|km2}} with roughly half a billion people. In total, the European Union produces almost a third of the world’s gross national product and the member states speak more than 23 languages. All of the European Union countries are joined together by a hope to promote and extend peace, democracy, cooperativeness, stability, prosperity, and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; In a 2007 speech, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for External Relations, said, "The future of the EU is linked to globalization...the EU has a crucial role to play in making globalization work properly...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Managing Globalization |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/07/503&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |pages=1–2|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 speech at the European Parliament, the Italian PM [[Matteo Renzi]] stated, "We are the ones who can bring civilization to globalization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfranciscoitaly.com/post/90601178974/europe-as-an-expression-of-the-soul-prime-minister Europe as an expression of the soul, prime minister of Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;
With the "Brexit" (British Exit) of the EU in 2016, the fundamental economic and motivational powerhouse of globalization in Europe was placed, once again, in the hands of Germany.

Just as the concept of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; In 1951 the beginnings of the EU were founded with the creation of [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises.&lt;ref name=aucoin/&gt; Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the [[Euro]], the creation of the [[European Monetary Institute]], and the opening of the [[European Central Bank]].&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

In 1993, at the Copenhagen European Council, the European Union took a decisive step towards expanding the EU, what they called the Fifth Enlargement, agreeing that "the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union". Thus, enlargement was no longer a question of if, but when and how. The European Council stated that accession could occur when the prospective country is able to assume the obligations of membership, that is that all  the economic and political conditions required are attained. Furthermore, it defined the membership criteria, which are regarded as the Copenhagen criteria, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |accessdate=27 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071626/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities
* the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union
* the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union

It is clear that all these criteria are characteristics of developed countries. Therefore, there is a direct link between globalization, developed nations, and the European Union.&lt;ref name=aucoin/&gt;

===Multinational corporations===
A majority of [[multinational corporation]]s find their origins in First World countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade.&lt;ref name=mnc1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnet |first1=Richard |last2=Cavanagh |first2=John |title=Global Dreams: Imperial Corporations and the New World Order |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1994 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and later the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade.&lt;ref name=mnc1/&gt; The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnet |first1=Richard |last2=Cavanagh |first2=John |title=Global Dreams: Imperial Corporations and the New World Order |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1994 |page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the world starts to globalize, it is accompanied by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, it is hard to be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.&lt;ref name=MNC&gt;{{cite web |last=Shah |first=Anup |title=Corporations |url=http://www.globalissues.org/issue/50/corporations |date=November 4, 2009 |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third industrial revolution is spreading from the developed world to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries must be seen as attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.&lt;ref name=MNC2&gt;{{cite web |last=Thurow |first=Lester C. |title=Globalization: The Product of a Knowledge-Based Economy |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/auth/checkbrowser.do?rand=0.5902949670045176&amp;cookieState=0&amp;ipcounter=1&amp;bhcp=1 |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If these conditions are in place, multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary to participate in the global economy. By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put bluntly, multinational companies possess a variety of factors that developing countries must have if they are to participate in the global economy.&lt;ref name=MNC2/&gt;

===Outsourcing===
[[Outsourcing]], according to Grossman and Helpman, refers to the process of "subcontracting an ever expanding set of activities, ranging from product design to assembly, from research and development to marketing, distribution and after-sales service".&lt;ref name=OSC1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossman |first1=Gene M |last2=Helpman |first2=Elhanan |title=Outsourcing in a Global Economy |jstor=3700687 |volume=72 |pages=135–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies have moved to outsourcing services in which they no longer specifically need or have the capability of handling themselves.&lt;ref name=OSC2&gt;{{cite web |last=Quinn |first=J. B. |title=Strategic Outsourcing |url=http://www.decon.unipd.it/info/sid/materiale9/bel_eat_letture_ottava_settimana/quinn1.pdf |accessdate=27 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722065135/http://www.decon.unipd.it/info/sid/materiale9/bel_eat_letture_ottava_settimana/quinn1.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to considerations of what the companies can have more control over.&lt;ref name=OSC2/&gt; Whatever companies tend to not have much control over or need to have control over will outsource activities to firms that they consider "less competing".&lt;ref name=OSC2/&gt; According to SourcingMag.com, the process of outsourcing can take the following four phases.&lt;ref name=OSC3&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Outsourcing - What is Outsourcing? | title = Sourcingmag.com | contribution-url = http://www.sourcingmag.com/content/what_is_outsourcing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsourcing is among some of the many reasons for increased competition within developing countries.&lt;ref name=OSC4&gt;"http://www.international.ucla.edu/media/files/GlobalUnequal_10_252.pdf"&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular [[offshore outsourcing]], as an opportunity for increased income.&lt;ref name=OSC6&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kansal |first1=Purva |last2=Kaushik |first2=Amit Kumar |title=Offshore Outsourcing: An E-Commerce Reality (Opportunity for Developing Countries) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4zJOECe_tAC&amp;pg=PT133&amp;dq=%22outsourcing%22+%22developing+countries%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22outsourcing%22%20%22developing%20countries%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease.&lt;ref name=OSC5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admin.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/documents/labour1996.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623001353/http://admin.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/documents/labour1996.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-23 |title=U.S. Trade with Developing Countries and Wage Inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and [[Gordon Hanson]] predict that there will be a rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.&lt;ref name="OSC4"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of annual average temperatures as a function of location.]]

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

{{legend|#ef8888|Tropical}} ]]

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

[[File:Resting fallow deer in historistic park of Villa Haas (Sinn).jpg|thumb|Evening idyll in the historistic park of Villa Haas - resting fallow deer around a decorative cannon on the roundel.]]

A '''German garden''' 
is a type of architecture of gardens, originating in [[Germany]], influenced by the [[English garden]] concept. . With staffages (eg. grotto) and weeping trees a sense of emotional aesthetics should be developed.  Typical of this kind of park design is clear structure and domestic animals, a necessary component of the garden, as seen in former times in the [[Luisium|Luisium Palace]] near [[Dessau]] in [[Germany]] or still existing the historistic park of [[Villa Haas]] (Hesse) from 1892. 
Livestock in the park serve to enhance the idyll (nature experience). The park area therefore had to be redesigned to protect the plants (walls, hedges, watercourses, fences).

The term "[[Ornamental Farm]]", which is still used today in manors with small park areas, forms a flowing border to this. 
Here, too, beauty always serves the useful. 
An own German garden style, as demanded by the leading German garden theorist Hirschfeld and his pupils, is never concretized in the literature compared to the French or English style. Therefore, in addition to the usual references to ancient mythology, the German style is limited to the decoration of statues, memorial stones, etc. of national importance.

If the [[English landscape garden]] mostly is the expression of a liberal bourgeoisie, the German garden is more oriented towards the model of the nobility and later incorporates elements of [[German Romanticism]] and other styles. &lt;ref&gt; Schepers, Wolfgang: Zu den Anfängen des Stilpluralismus im Landschaftsgarten und dessen theoretische Bedeutung in Deutschland. In:Brix, Michael, und Monika Steinhauser:Geschichte allein ist zeitgemäß. Historismus in Deutschland 1978, S. 73-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the style concept is confused with the "new german gardening". Here, more emphasis is placed on easy-care, location-loyal shrubs and color aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt; The Telegraph. By Noel Kingsbury 1.6.2012: What can we learn from German gardening &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Géoportail 2D.png|thumb|2D view of [[continental France]]]]
'''Géoportail''' is a comprehensive [[web mapping]] service of the [[French government]] that publishes maps and geophysical aerial photographs from more than 90 sources for [[French territory|France and its territories]]. The service, first developed by two public agencies (the [[Institut Géographique National|IGN]] and the [[Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières|BRGM]]), was officially inaugurated on June 23, 2006 by president [[Jacques Chirac]].

Though the French service has sometimes been described as a competitor or rival to [[Google Maps]], it is different from [[Google]]'s mapping service (launched one year before in February 2005), since they have different objectives. Geoportail makes some unusual cartographic sources available, such as the renowned 18th-century [[French cartography#Cassini maps|Cassini maps]] and the Napoléonic-period Minutes État-Major, in addition to IGN road maps, administrative maps, topographic maps, cadastral and building surveys, public service utility maps, transportation maps, hydrographic maps, atmospheric and weather maps, geological maps, land use maps, maps of cultural sites, and much more.  All maps and aerial photographs at Geoportail may be combined and viewed in transparent layers controlled by the user. The highest resolution of aerial photography, in general, is higher than what is available at Google Maps. Place names are identified and searchable for smallest villages and physical locations, beyond what is found on similar sites.

Since its inception in June 2006, the French service has progressively added new data and has undergone significant updates. The latest major upgrade became available in summer 2012.

==Origin of the project==
The project originated for two main purposes:
* [[INSPIRE directive|INSPIRE]] (Infrastructure for spatial information in Europe) European directive and ADELE French programme aim at the development of on-line administrative information;
* the success of other online projects like [[Google Maps]], in which navigation in maps and satellite views is possible.

==Partners==
* The DGME (French General Directorate for State Modernisation) is in charge of the project, with implementation managed by two state entities:
:* [[Institut Géographique National (France)|IGN]] developed the visualisation interface, with the background of its own data (maps and photos),
:* French Office of Geological and Mineral Research [[Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières|BRGM]] developed the catalog and search system.
* [[Geoconcept]]
* IDEE (Spain)
* SwissImage
* Swisstopo

==History of the portal==

=== Project ===
The project was launched during summer 2005 in the IGN. The goal for the opening of the Géoportail was set as summer 2007.

On January 6, 2006, in [[Metz]], the former [[President of the French Republic]], [[Jacques Chirac]], expressed the wish to open the Géoportail during the year.

In early March 2006, the IGN launched an advertising campaign about the Géoportail.

===Launch problems===
On June 23, 2006, the site was launched by Jacques Chirac and other ministers.

In this first release, users could browse in 2D over:
* the [[orthophoto]] (corrected aerial photographs) of France, including a great part of [[French overseas departments and territories]], with an [[image resolution]] of 50&amp;nbsp;cm;
* the IGN maps, at a scale adapted for the chosen zoom (up to 1:25000 with a zoom of 1/3000).

After the site was first launched, connection requests were 5 times greater than expected by the project team, which led to a crash of the servers. A message was posted apologizing for this problem while a solution was found.
On July 1, access to the site was restored.

'''''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Also Called America''''', ([[French language|French]]: ''Histoire d'un voyage fait en la terre de Brésil''; [[Latin]]: ''Historia Navigationis in Brasiliam, quae et America Dicitur'') is an account published by the French [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] [[Jean de Léry]] in 1578 about his experiences living in a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] colony in the [[Guanabara Bay]] in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.virginia.edu/rmds/collections/gordon/travel/lery.html|title=Rare Materials Digital Services at the University of Virginia Library|website=www.lib.virginia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the colony dissolved, De Léry spent two months living with the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] Indians.

== Historical context ==
Brazil was the first area of the Americas explored by the French.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/232116446|title=Encyclopedia of Latin American history and culture|date=2008|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|others=Kinsbruner, Jay,, Langer, Erick Detlef,|isbn=9780684315904|edition= Second |location=Detroit|oclc=232116446}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Jean de Léry’s ''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Also Called America'', the French and the Portuguese were in competition for control of the resources of Brazil.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; While reports of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous people]] were widespread, interactions with the natives showed that they were friendly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the time, it was common practice to use [[Europeans]] who had spent time with the indigenous peoples as interpreters to help the Europeans communicate with the natives.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In the years preceding de Léry’s writing of ''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Also Called America'', the Portuguese had begun their effort to completely [[Brasil Colonial|colonize Brazil]], so the influence of the French was fading, though pockets of French control and influence still existed in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This fading influence coincided with the Portuguese's exploration of the [[Amazon River|Amazon river delta]], though tade between the people of Brazil and the English and the Dutch was also increasing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869521852|title=Native Brazil : beyond the convert and the cannibal, 1500-1900|others=Langfur, Hal,|isbn=9780826338419|location=Albuquerque|oclc=869521852}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the competition for control of the lands of Brazil between the French and the Portuguese in Brazil was the creation of tribal alliances, with the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]], the group referred to in ''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Also Called America'', siding with the French against the [[Tupiniquim]], who allied themselves with the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brazil Imagined: 1500 to the Present|last=Sadlier|first=D. J.|publisher=Austin: University of Texas Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this era of first contacts, the understanding of the indigenous peoples were being informed by the accounts of early explorers like de Léry and the Portuguese explorers, so much of what was known to new arrivals about the indigenous peoples game from reports like de Léry's.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These other accounts had some thematic similarities to de Léry’s, such as the usage of tribe names to describe the people specifically, or the frequent use of gender-indicating nouns like “man” or “woman”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, de Léry was writing in a different historical context from those accounts emerging from Africa, which emphasized racial elements more than they emphasized gender or non-racial elements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Jean de Léry was born to an upper-class family in 1534 in Margelle ([[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté|Bourgogne]]), France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.virginia.edu/rmds/collections/gordon/travel/lery.html|title=Rare Materials Digital Services at the University of Virginia Library|website=www.lib.virginia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-educated; he studied [[theology]] in Geneva whilst working as a shoe-maker. Léry was alive during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] time-period in France between the Protestants and the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Millennium Web Catalog|url=http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780195149227.001.0001/acref-9780195149227-e-0801|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195149227.001.0001/acref-9780195149227-e-0801}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that the Genevan church was recruiting Frenchmen to be trained as missionaries of the Reformed Gospel. Léry joined this group but instead of returning to France, in November 1556, he and a group of thirteen [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] ministers were sent to Brazil.&lt;ref name="Millennium Web Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://0-quod-lib-umich-edu.dewey2.library.denison.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;rgn=full%20text;idno=heb03132.0001.001;didno=heb03132.0001.001;view=image;seq=16;node=heb03132.0001.001:3;page=root;size=100|title=Millennium Web Catalog|website=0-quod-lib-umich-edu.dewey2.library.denison.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were to create the first Protestant mission in the New World. Upon his return to France in 1558, he got married but it is unknown whether or not he had children. He returned to Geneva to further his ministerial studies and became a Protestant minister near Lyon. He also joined Protestant troops in the French religious wars where he used knowledge he gained from his expeditions in Brazil to help him and other soldiers to survive. In 1613, he died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] at the age of 79.&lt;ref name="Millennium Web Catalog"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book has 22 chapters, with Chapter 1 discussing the motive behind the voyage to [[Brazil]] and Chapters 2-5 describing the sights and events that occurred during the voyage to [[Brazil]]. Chapters 6-20 consist of Léry describing the land of Brazil, the physical description of the indigenous people, and the behaviors and customs of the indigenous people. Lastly, Chapters 21 and 22 recount the departure from [[Brazil]] and the trip back to [[France]]. The book contains detailed descriptions of the plants, animals, and indigenous people in the new world for the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/renaissance-in-print/travelnarratives/lery|title=Jean de Léry (1534-1613?)|last=Conrad|first=Elsa|date=|website=University of Virginia Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

===The Tupinamba physical constitution===

Léry describes the physical characteristics of the [[Tupinamba people]] and details the modifications they make to their bodies, as well as their comfortability with being completely nude. Lery describes the constitution of the average Tupinamba person:

{{quote|Not taller, fatter, or smaller in stature than we Europeans are; their bodies are neither monstrous, nor prodigious with respect to ours. In fact, they are stronger, more robust and well filled-out, more nimble, less subjected to disease; there are almost none among them who are lame; one eyed or disfigured&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Léry goes on to describe that some individuals that he encountered lived well beyond one hundred years old (with respect that the Tupinamba people had a different Calendar than the [[Gregorian Calendar]]), and their elders are slow to develop grey or white hair. When describing the skin tone of the average Tupinamba person Lery states

{{quote|They are not particularly dark, but merely of tawny shade, like the Spanish or provencals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Léry then discusses how the Tupinamba people are completely comfortable with being naked, especially the women.

{{quote|We tried several times to give them dresses and shifts (as I have said we did for the men, who sometimes put them on) it has never been our power to make them wear clothes: to such a point were they resolved (and I think they have not changed their minds) not to allow anything at all on their bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bodily modifications===
Much of the chapter is dedicated to describing various body modifications Lery witnessed among men and women of the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]] nation including, but not limited to, tattoos and piercings. Lery states that men more often modify their bodies than women do. Lery describes a tradition of piercing the lower lip in young boys and inserting a bone an inch wide and that can be removed at any time. On this page he also describes how after birth, babies often have their noses pushed in to make their noses seem more attractive.

{{quote|However, our Americans, for whom the beauty of their children lies in being pug-nosed, have the noses of their children pushed in and crushed with the thumb as soon as they come out of their mother’s wombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tattoos===
Tattoos are described as being made with the dye of the [[genipap]] fruit. Lery states that often people would blacken their legs and that the dye is to a degree waterproof and can take up to twelve days to wash off. Some of these painting are put over incisions they make on their skin that show how many people they have killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Léry also describes facial paintings. This process is noted to have involved feathers from hens, red dye from [[Brazilwood]] (he described how other tribes used other colored dyes from different objects), and boiling the feathers.&lt;ref name="Léry 1993 61"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gum was used as an adhesive and the feathers were chopped up with iron tools they procured from the colonists. Once this process was complete these feathers were put all over the body. Lery described how in some accounts these feathers have led to a misconception in Europe that the Tupinamba were covered in hair, and he stated this is not the case and that naturally the Tupinamba did not have a lot of hair on their bodies. It is also mentioned that feathers from a Toucan were often placed in the front of the ear and attached with an adhesive gum by many women. Ostrich feathers are also said to have been attached along a cotton thread to make a decorative hip belt.&lt;ref name="Léry 1993 61"/&gt;

Léry states that Tupinamba people would regularly strip their bodies of hair which included eyebrows and eyelashes. Women would have their hair long, while men would typically shave their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry and necklaces===
According to Léry, the Tupinamba people had different types of necklaces. He wrote about what the natives called a boure which was made with pieces of seashells that were  polished on a sandstone which then were pierced and lined along a cotton string. Lery also notes that boure can be made with a type of 'black wood' that has a similar appearance to seashell boure. Women also made bracelets around their arms that were made of bones joined together with a gum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil order and everyday life ===
Léry describes the customs of the [[Tupinambá people]], how the Tupinambá people live, and how they treat their guests. For the most part, Jean de Léry indicates that the Tupinambá people are peaceful, but rarely a fight breaks out between them that may end in a death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of the deceased then has the right to kill the murderer as the Tupinambá people believe in revenge, such as a life for a life.

Léry also recounts the living setup of the Tupinambá people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazi|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The houses are big and are made out of wood and pindo plants. Although families live in the same house, they are separated and have their own space, including land to plant crops. From time to time, the Tupinambá people would move their houses to a different location and when Jean de Léry asked for the reason why he was told that,&lt;blockquote&gt;“The change of air keeps them healthier, and that if they did other than what their grandfathers did, they would die immediately” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jean de Léry then goes in depth on how women spin cotton in order to make the beds that the Tupinambá people sleep on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the description Jean de Léry gives, the beds are [[hammock]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that are set up outside the houses. In addition to spinning cotton, women also do the majority of the housework and make pottery.

===Cannibalism===
Léry also describes an event that occurred to him regarding [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he and his interpreter made a stop at one of the villages, he was greeted accordingly and realized that the Tupinamba people were in the midst of a celebration. This celebration consisted of dancing, cooking, and eating a prisoner they had killed earlier. Jean de Léry did not want to participate in the celebration and stayed at his bed alone. However, one of the Tupinamba people came and offered him the prisoner’s foot, but since Jean de Léry’s interpreter was not present, he thought they were threatening to eat him. By morning, Jean de Léry realized his error and was afraid for nothing.

=== Treatment of guests ===
The customs of the Tupinambá people regarding how they treat guests consisted of seating their guests on a bed while the women wept in gratitude for their visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this, the head of the household makes an arrow and when he is done, he greets the guest and offers them food. The guests must eat on the ground since there are no tables. After the women are done weeping, they serve the guest fruit or other small gifts. If the guest desires to sleep there, their bed is hung among several fires to keep them warm. At the end of the visit, gifts are exchanged, which are usually small since the Tupinambá people travel by walking and do not have animals to carry cargo for them. Jean de Léry praises the treatment he has received from the Tupinambá people and even compares it to the French, as he states,&lt;blockquote&gt;“...I can’t help saying that the hypocritical welcomes of those over here who sue slippery speech for consolidation of the afflicted is a far cry from the humanity of these people, whom nonetheless we call “‘barbarians’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lastly, Jean de Léry describes how the Tupinambá people make fires through the use of sticks only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes their method and how they deem it necessary to have fire with them at all times due to their fear of an evil spirit called Aygnan. He ends the chapter explaining that the Tupinambá people and the French get along well because they have a common enemy: the Portuguese.

=== Illnesses and death ===
Jean de Léry describes how the Tupinambá people treat illnesses and how they handle deaths. If someone has a wound and bedridden, they are treated through suction and are not fed unless they explicitly ask for food. However, celebrations still continue as normal. The most dangerous disease that the Tupinambá people cannot treat is called pians and occurs through lechery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean de Léry compares it to [[smallpox]] and states that it affects the entire body and lasts for a lifetime.

If someone dies, there is great mourning as Jean de Léry compares the cries of women to, “the howling of dogs and wolves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Tupinambá people comfort each other, remember the good deeds the deceased person had done, and sing in their memory. Mourning lasts half a day, until the Tupinambá proceed with burying the body in the ground with jewelry the person used to wear. Jean de Léry mentions how the Tupinambá people do not bury any valuable jewelry with dead bodies anymore since the French have arrived, perhaps due to past experiences with Europeans digging up graves for jewelry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil|last=Léry|first=Jean de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=9780520913806|location=|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first night the body is buried, the Tupinambá people have a feast on the grace of the deceased person and do this until they believe the body has fully decayed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The rationale behind this custom is that the Tupinambá people believe that Aygnan, the evil spirit mentioned before, is hungry and finds no other meat around, he will dig up the dead body and eat it. Thus, the celebration occurs for protection. Still, Jean de Léry finds this custom disrespectful and tried to convince the Tupinambá people not to do it through interpreters with little success. Lastly, the Tupinambá people place the plant called pindo used to build houses on graves as well so that they can recognize where their loved one was buried.

== Reception ==

''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil'' is regarded as a significant work in many fields. Reviewers of the text note the breadth of its scope and the varying opportunities for its use.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PEREIRA|first1=ANTHONY|last2=Pereyra|first2=Anthony|title=Review of History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Otherwise Called America, JEAN DE LÉRY|journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revue canadienne des études latino-américaines et caraïbes|date=1991|volume=16|issue=32|pages=119–122|jstor=41800685}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is fundamental in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] studies and South American ecology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=da Cunha|first1=Antonio Brito|title=Review of History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Otherwise Called America|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=1992|volume=67|issue=1|pages=40–41|jstor=2830894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean de Lery , Janet Whatley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conley|first1=Tom|title=Jean de Lery , Janet Whatley|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=April 1993|volume=46|issue=1|pages=217–219|doi=10.2307/3039179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides insight to history, colonizer and native languages, religion, and political theory.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Because of its wide disciplinary coverage, it is a valuable source for historians and colonial scholars&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|last2=de Lery|first2=Jean|last3=Whatley|first3=Janet|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Otherwise called America, Containing the Navigation and the Remarkable Things Seen on the Sea by the Author; the Behavior of Villegagnon in That Country; and the Customs and Strange Ways of Life of the American Savages; Together with the Description of Various Animals, Trees, Plants, and Other Singular Things Completely Unknown over Here.|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|date=August 1991|volume=71|issue=3|page=628|doi=10.2307/2515899}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[geologist]]s and biologists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For colonial historians, it contributes to a greater understanding of “the meaning and significance of the European conquest of the Americas”&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; and helps to describe native people, their relationship with the Europeans, and the cognitive justifications of European domination.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; It also details “how Brazil was created out of a fusion of Indian, European (and later African) elements”&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; and highlights larger historical themes.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Reviews of Janet Whatley’s 1990 English translation of ''History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil'' are overwhelmingly favorable. There are two main components to most reviews beyond the text’s significance: praise for the detail provided by de Léry and praise for Whatley’s translation. De Léry describes the lives, culture, and rituals of the Tupinambá with “detailed thoroughness”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Judith P.|last2=Whatley|first2=Janet|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil.N Jean de Lery.|journal=Sixteenth Century Journal|date=Winter 1991|volume=22|issue=4|page=880|doi=10.2307/2542462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen as exceptional in “his surprising openness to an alien culture.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The great detail of de Léry’s work and his willingness to intimately engage with the Tupinambá&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is only critiqued by his “naive comparisons between the savagery of the Indians and the savagery of the Europeans.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Whatley is noted as a “graceful”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; translator and “a stylistic marvel.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It is generally agreed that she was able to stay true to the charm of de Léry’s prose and maintain the stylistic integrity of sixteenth-century French writing.&lt;ref name="Jean de Lery , Janet Whatley"/&gt; Additions made by Whatley were also received well, as the inclusion of notes on references made by de Léry were helpful reading guides and aided in the placement of de Léry’s writing in historical context.&lt;ref name="Jean de Lery , Janet Whatley"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1029">The '''Interagency GPS Executive Board''' ('''IGEB''') was an agency of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]] that sought to integrate the needs and desires of various governmental agencies into formal [[Global Positioning System]] Planning. GPS was administered by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], but had grown to service a wide variety of constituents.  The majority of GPS uses are now non-military, so this board was fundamental in ensuring the needs of non-military users.

In 2004, the IGEB was superseded by the [[National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing]] (PNT), established by presidential order.

The '''Isle of Ely''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|l|i}} is a historic region around the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], England. Between 1889 and 1965, it formed an [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]].

==Etymology==
Its name is said to mean "island of [[eel]]s", a reference to the creatures that were often caught in the local rivers for food. This etymology was first recorded by the [[Venerable Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Ecclesiastica'',IV:XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Isle of Ely 1648 by J Blaeu.jpg|thumb|left|Isle of Ely 1648 by J Blaeu]]
Until the 17th century, the area was an island surrounded by a large area of [[fen]]land, a type of swamp. It was coveted as an area difficult to penetrate, and was controlled in the very early medieval period by the [[Gyrwas]], an Anglo-Saxon tribe. Upon their marriage in 652, Tondbert, a prince of the Gyrwas, presented [[Æthelthryth]] (who became St. Æthelthryth), the daughter of King Anna of the East Angles, with the Isle of Ely. She afterwards founded a monastery at Ely, which was destroyed by Viking raiders in 870, but was rebuilt and became a famous [[Ely Cathedral|Abbey]] and [[St Etheldreda's Church|Shrine]]. The Fens were ultimately drained. This began in 1626 using a network of canals designed by Dutch experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridgeshire History &amp; the Isle of Ely Timeline|url=http://www.cambridgeshirehistory.com/cambridgeshire/timeline/timeline14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Fenlanders were opposed to the draining as it deprived some of them of their traditional livelihood; acts of vandalism on dykes, ditches and sluices were common, but the drainage was completed by the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Visit Ely - The Draining of the Fens"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Draining of the Fens|url=http://visitely.eastcambs.gov.uk/history/draining-fens|publisher=Visit Ely|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area's natural defences led to it playing a role in the military history of England. Following the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isle became a refuge for Anglo-Saxon forces under Earl [[Morcar]], [[Æthelwine (Bishop of Durham)|Bishop Aethelwine of Durham]] and [[Hereward the Wake]] in 1071.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/after_11.shtml ''Hereward and the Isle of Ely'', BBC History, accessed 6 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The area was taken by [[William the Conqueror]] only after a prolonged struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/after_12.shtml ''The taking of Ely'', BBC History, accessed 6 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1139 [[The Anarchy|civil war]] broke out between the forces of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]]. [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Bishop Nigel of Ely]], a supporter of Matilda, unsuccessfully tried to hold the Isle. In 1143 [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] rebelled against Stephen, and made his base in the Isle. Geoffrey was mortally wounded at [[Burwell, Cambridgeshire|Burwell]] in 1144.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~engcam/elycwar.htm ''The Isle of Ely and Civil War'': Trevor Bevis, ''Hereward of the Fens'', (Cambridgeshire Genealogy), accessed 6 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1216, during the [[First Barons' War]], the Isle was unsuccessfully defended against the army of [[John of England|King John]]. Ely took part in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.

==Administration==
[[File:The plaque on the Leonard Childs Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 277463.jpg|thumb|left|This plaque in Chatteris serves as a reminder of the Isle's county status]]
From 1109 until 1837, the Isle was under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of Ely]] who appointed a Chief Justice of Ely and exercised temporal powers within the Liberty of Ely. This temporal jurisdiction originated in a charter granted by King [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] in 970, and confirmed by [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] to the abbot of Ely. The latter monarch established Ely as the seat of a bishop in 1109, creating the Isle of Ely a [[county palatine]] under the bishop. An [[act of parliament]] in 1535/6 ended the palatine status of the Isle, with all justices of the peace to be appointed by [[letters patent]] issued under the great seal and warrants to be issued in the king's name. However, the bishop retained exclusive jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, and was [[custos rotulorum]]. A chief bailiff was appointed for life by the bishop, and performed the functions of [[high sheriff]] within the liberty, who also headed the government of the city of Ely.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Samuel, ''Topographical Dictionary of England'', Vol. II, London 1831&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liberty of Ely Act 1837''&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty of Ely Act, 1837'' (7 Will 4 &amp; 1 Vict c.53)&lt;/ref&gt; ended the bishop's secular powers in the Isle. The area was declared a division of [[Cambridgeshire]], with the right to appoint [[Justice of the Peace|justices]] revested in the crown.  Following the 1837 Act the Isle maintained separate [[Quarter Sessions]], and formed its own constabulary.

Under the ''[[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Bill]]'' of 1888, which proposed the introduction of elected [[county council]]s, the Isle was to form part of Cambridgeshire. Following the intervention of the local [[member of parliament]], [[Charles William Selwyn|Charles Selwyn]], the Isle of Ely was constituted a separate [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] in 1889. The county was small in terms of both area and population, and its abolition was proposed by the [[Local Government Boundary Commission (1945 - 1949)|Local Government Boundary Commission]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"Town and county boundaries - First decisions of the Commission", ''The Times'', 2 May 1947&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the LGBC was not acted upon, and the administrative county survived until 1965. Following the recommendations of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958–1967)|Local Government Commission for England]], on 1 April 1965 the bulk of the area was merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]], with the [[Thorney Rural District]] going to [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]].

===Subdivisions===
In 1894 the county was divided into county districts, with the rural districts being [[Ely Rural District]], [[Thorney Rural District]], [[Whittlesey Rural District]], [[Wisbech Rural District]], [[North Witchford Rural District]], and the urban districts were [[Ely Urban District|Ely]], [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]], [[Whittlesey]] and [[Wisbech]] (the only [[municipal borough]]).  Whittlesey Rural district consisted of only one parish (Whittlesey Rural), which was added to Whittlesey urban district, in 1926.

The [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely parliamentary constituency]] was created as a two-member seat in the [[First Protectorate Parliament|First]] and [[Second Protectorate Parliament]]s from 1654 to 1659. The constituency was re-created with a single seat in 1918. In the boundary changes of 1983 it was replaced by the new constituency of [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]]. Original historical documents relating to the Isle of Ely are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]] at the County Record Office in [[Cambridge]].

==Coat of arms==
The Isle of Ely County Council was granted a [[coat of arms]] on 1 May 1931. Previous to the grant the council had been using the arms of [[Diocese of Ely]]: ''Gules, three ducal coronets, two and one or''. In the 1931 grant, silver and blue waves were added to the episcopal arms, to suggest that the county was an "isle". The crest above the shield was a human hand grasping a trident around which an eel was entwined, referring to the popular derivation of "Ely". On the wrist of the hand was a "[[Wake knot]]", representing Hereward the Wake.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Scott-Giles, ''Civic Heraldry of England and Wales'', 2nd edition, London, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kunsag map.GIF|250px|thumb|Kunság (Cumania) within modern Hungary]]
'''Kunság''' is a historical and geographical region in [[Hungary]] situated in the current [[Bács-Kiskun]] and [[Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok]] counties.  Like other historical European regions called [[Cumania]], it is named for the [[Cumans]], a [[nomad]]ic tribe who formed a confederation with the [[Kipchaks]] that settled the area.  It is divided into [[Greater Cumania]] and [[Little Cumania]].

== Ethnic affiliations and genetic origins ==
In a study by Bogacsi-Szabo, Erika. et al. (2005) of the [[mtDNA]] (Mitochondrial DNA) of the Cuman nomad population that migrated into the Carpathian basin during the 13th century,  six haplogroups were revealed. "One of these haplogroups belongs to the M lineage ([[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|haplogroup D]]) and is characteristic of [[Eastern Asia]], but this is the second most frequent haplogroup in southern Siberia too.  All the other haplogroups (H, V, U, U3, and JT) are West Eurasian, belonging to the N macrohaplogroup. Out of the eleven remains, four samples belonged to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]], two to [[haplogroup U]], two to [[haplogroup V]], and one each to the JT, U3, and [[D haplogroups]]. Modern Hungarian samples represent 15 haplogroups. All but one is a West Eurasian haplogroup [the remaining one is East Asian (haplogroup F)], but all belong to the N lineage. Four haplogroups (H, V, U*, JT), present in the ancient samples, can also be found in the modern Hungarians, but only for haplogroups H and V were identical haplotypes found. [[Haplogroups U3]] and D occur exclusively in the ancient group, and 11 haplogroups (HV, U4, U5, K, J, J1a, T, T1, T2, W, and F) occur only in the modern Hungarian population. Haplogroup frequency in the modern Hungarian population is similar to other European populations, although haplogroup F is almost absent in continental Europe; therefore the presence of this haplogroup in the modern Hungarian population can reflect some past contribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/human_biology/v077/77.5szabo.html | journal=Human Biology | title=Mitochondrial DNA of Ancient Cumanians: Culturally Asian Steppe Nomadic Immigrants with Substantially More Western Eurasian Mitochondrial DNA Lineages|pages = 639–662| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The results suggested that the Cumanians, as seen in the excavation at [[Csengele]], were far from genetic homogeneity. Nevertheless, the grave artifacts are typical of the Cumanian steppe culture; and five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis appeared [[Asia]]n rather than [[Europe]]an (Horváth 1978, 2001), including two from the mitochondrial [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]], which is typically European. The only skeleton for which anthropological examination indicated a partly European ancestry was that of the chieftain, whose haplotype is most frequently found in the Balkans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/human_biology/v077/77.5szabo.html | journal=Human Biology | title=Mitochondrial DNA of Ancient Cumanians: Culturally Asian Steppe Nomadic Immigrants with Substantially More Western Eurasian Mitochondrial DNA Lineages|pages = 639–662| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Image:Hungary 13th cent.png|thumb|200px|left|Hungary in the late 13th century]]
Prior to their entry into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the Cumans inhabited the vast areas of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], where they had created a powerful nomadic confederacy (see [[Cumania]]). In the 13th century, they were attacked and defeated by the [[Mongol Empire]] after which most of them fled to Hungary, the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. 

The first Cumans arrived in Hungary in 1239 but there was violence between the nomadic Cumans and the settled Hungarians.  Hungarians murdered the Cuman leader [[Kuthen]] (Kötöny) and the Cumans fled to the [[Balkan]]s in 1241, pillaging as they went.

Following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]] of Hungary in 1246, King [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]], invited 40 to 60 thousand Cumans and smaller group of [[Jasz people|Jazyges]] back to Hungary to settle in areas of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] depopulated by Mongol invasions that would become Kunság and [[Jászság|Jazygia]].  An area between [[Szolnok]] and [[Debrecen]] became [[Greater Cumania]] (Nagykunság) while an area between the [[Kalocsa]] and [[Szeged]] became Little Cumania (Kiskunság).  

In exchange for military service to the Hungarian king against the Mongols, the Cumans were allowed to keep their own ethnic customs but they were required to settle permanently and convert to Christianity.  Bela bethrothed his son [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]] to Kuthen's daughter [[Elizabeth the Cuman|Elizabeth]]. In 1279, King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]] formalized Cuman territorial autonomy in Kunság.

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of much of Hungary in the 16th century, the region was part of the Jazygia-Cumania (Jászkunság) District which lay outside the [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary's county system]].

[[Image:Cumania-Jazygia-1700s.png|250px|thumb|Kunság (Cumania) in the 18th century within the Kingdom of Hungary]]
The 1711 [[Peace of Szatmár]] following the [[Rákóczi Uprising]] abolished the privileges of the Cumans and Jazyges but Jazygia-Cumania was restored by [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] in 1745.  The territories possessed greater rights than the counties of Hungary including the freedom from [[villein]]age ([[serfdom]]) well before its abolition throughout Hungary in 1858.

Cuman autonomy had been revoked and restored several times over the centuries, but in 1876 the territories were permanently abolished and incorporated into the county system as part of the [[Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok (former county)|Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok]] and [[Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun]] counties.

==Language and population==

After settling in Kunság, the Cumans continued to practice nomadic of animal husbandry and lived in felt-covered yurts. By the end of the 14th century, the Cumans had begun to settle in villages and were gradually assimilating into Hungarian ways. The wars and [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century disrupted the social structure of the region, but the Cumans returned to the areas and kept some of their native social customs.

The [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[Cuman language]] was still spoken at the time of the Ottoman occupation and during the [[Protestant Reformation]] but it died out in Hungary by the middle of the 17th century and its traces can only be found in placenames.

'''Lion's Head''' is a community in the municipality of [[Northern Bruce Peninsula, Ontario|Northern Bruce Peninsula]], [[Bruce County, Ontario|Bruce County]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Located at the midway point of the [[Bruce Peninsula]], about halfway between [[Owen Sound, Ontario|Owen Sound]] and [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]], Lion's Head is just east of [[Ferndale, Bruce County, Ontario|Ferndale]] on Bruce Road 9. Lion's Head is located on or somewhere near the [[45th parallel north]], halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. The town is named after the resemblance of a lion's profile in the rock formation of the Niagara Escarpment. The first post office opened in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hepburn|first=Glen Gordon|title=Benchmarks : A History of Eastnor Township and Lion's Head|year=1987|publisher=The Eastnor and Lion's Head Historical Society|location=Owen Sound|isbn=0-9692848-0-2|page=22|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=1058278}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The estimated summer population ranges widely from 900 to 5000.

It is a well travelled holiday spot on the coast of [[Georgian Bay]].

The [[limestone]] rock formations make it a scenic area for [[canoeing]], kayaking, hiking the [[Bruce Trail]], rock climbing and visiting the marina-lookout by car.

[[Bruce Peninsula District School]] is the only secondary school north of [[Wiarton]], and one of the few schools in Ontario to go from Kindergarten to grade 12.
 
There are accommodations, restaurants, shops, and galleries all located in Lion's Head. There is also a marina, [[Bruce Peninsula District School|school]], hospital, bank, library, pharmacy, grocery store and several churches in the town. Lion's Head is under the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP) jurisdiction. There is also the Northern Bruce Peninsula Fire Department, which operates four trucks in the region.

The area has four somewhat distinct seasons. Cold, snowy, and blustery winters, as well as warm, comfortable summers are the usual pattern. Summer mornings are usually cool but do warm quickly before 9 or 10 AM. Rain showers are common, along with thunderstorms, and a few severe thunderstorms per year. Tornadoes are less likely in the region, unlike the far southern part of Ontario. Summer brings the largest number of people to Lion's Head (mostly July and August). This influx of people creates parking problems especially near the beach and marina. The 2017 tourist season was the most crowded yet according to many long time residents. The population drops during the colder seasons.
Lion's Head experienced a more significant [[tornado]] during the [[1985 Barrie tornado outbreak]] which damaged areas on the outskirts of the village. Since then, no tornadoes have been reported in the area.

This '''list of landslides''' is a list of notable [[landslide]]s and [[mudflow]]s divided into sections by date and type. This list is very incomplete as there is no central catalogue for landslides, although some for individual countries/areas do exist. Volumes of landslides are recorded in the scientific literature using cubic kilometres (km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for the largest and millions of [[cubic metre]]s (normally given the non-standard shortening of MCM) for most events.

| A minor eruption of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano caused melting of its ice cap. This released a series of [[lahar]]s, volcanic mudflows, that traveled at speeds of up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h down the slopes of the volcano. These lahars swiftly moved into valleys, merging to form larger flows, one of which destroyed the town of Armero.

In most elections, no one party has won an absolute majority of seats and so usually parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s. The one exception is the 1989 election, when the [[People's Alliance Party (Solomon Islands)|People's Alliance Party (PAP)]] led by Solomon Mamaloni did win an absolute majority. However, in late 1990, Mamaloni broke away from the [[People's Alliance Party (Solomon Islands)|PAP]] and continued ruling in a coalition government until the 1993 election.

Many parties are established immediately prior to an election and most are very short-lived. Some will achieve no parliamentary representation and dissolve within a year. Others will achieve parliamentary representation but, having served their purpose, are then discarded.

The most enduring political parties in Solomon Islands are the [[People's Alliance Party (Solomon Islands)|PAP]] and the [[Solomon Islands United Party]], founded in 1979 and 1980, respectively. The [[People's Alliance Party (Solomon Islands)|PAP]] has led three governments and been in coalition in at least three more. The United Party led two governments in the 1980s however its representation has waned in recent years and after the 2006, it no longer had any parliamentary representatives.

The '''London Government Act 1963''' (c. 33) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which recognised officially the [[conurbation]] known as [[Greater London]] and created a new [[local government]] structure for the capital. The Act significantly reduced the number of local government districts in the area, resulting in local authorities responsible for larger areas and populations. The upper tier of local government was reformed to cover the whole of the Greater London area and with a more strategic role; and the split of functions between upper and lower tiers was recast. The Act classified the boroughs into [[Inner London|inner]] and [[outer London]] groups. The [[City of London]] and its corporation were essentially unreformed by the legislation. Subsequent amendments to the Act have significantly amended the upper tier arrangements, with the [[Greater London Council]] abolished in 1986, and the [[Greater London Authority]] introduced in 2000. {{As of |2016}}, the London boroughs are more or less identical to those created in 1965, although with some enhanced powers over services such as waste management and education.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act set up a two-tier local government system, with powers divided between the newly formed [[Greater London Council]] (GLC), 32 new [[London boroughs|London borough councils]] and the existing [[City of London]]. The provisions of the Act came into effect on 1 April 1965, the new councils having been elected as "shadow authorities" in 1964.

Section 1 of the Act established 32 London boroughs, each of which was to be governed by an elected borough council, and was to be regulated by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]] and [[Local Government Act 1933]]. Twelve of the boroughs, corresponding to the former [[County of London]], were designated ''Inner London boroughs''. The remaining twenty boroughs were designated ''Outer London boroughs''. None of the boroughs were given names in the Act.

Section 2 declared that the ''area comprising the areas of the London boroughs, the City and the Temples shall constitute an administrative area to be known as Greater London''. An elected Greater London Council was to govern the new area.

Section 3 abolished the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Middlesex]] and [[County of London|London]] (created in 1889), and absorbed parts of [[Kent]], [[Essex]], [[Surrey]] and [[Hertfordshire]] plus the whole of the [[City of London]] to form the administrative area of Greater London. As well as the two counties, the twenty-eight existing [[metropolitan borough]]s, plus all [[county borough]]s, county districts or [[civil parish|parishes]] that fell wholly within Greater London were to cease to exist, along with their councils. No part of Greater London was to form part of any administrative county, county district or parish. Three Middlesex [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] not included in Greater London were transferred to other counties: [[Potters Bar Urban District|Potters Bar]] to [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Staines Urban District|Staines]] and [[Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District|Sunbury-on-Thames]] to [[Surrey]].

The Act also established the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to administer schools and colleges in the 12 inner London boroughs. The remaining 20 outer boroughs became [[Local education authority|local education authorities]] in their own right. The [[London Traffic Area]] and the [[London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee]], set up in 1924, were abolished, with the GLC gaining powers to regulate road traffic. An alteration was also made to the [[Metropolitan Police District]] to include the whole of Greater London, but the district continued to include a number of areas in surrounding counties.

====Names====
As passed, the Act did not include names for the new boroughs. Keith Joseph, the Minister, asked local councils for suggestions as to possible names, asking that they be a single word if possible, and noting that "the best name will be the place recognised as the centre of the new borough". Double-barrelled names were to be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Choosing Names For New Boroughs |work=The Times |date=25 June 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where Judgement of Solomon Will Be Required: Minister to Have Final Word on Names of New London Boroughs |work=The Times |date=8 August 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Royal Borough of [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]' was proposed for the Greenwich and Woolwich metropolitan boroughs.  Lewisham and Deptford were unable to agree on whether the borough should be named Lewisham, Deptford or after the central river/stream, Ravensbourne. The councils to become part of the [[London Borough of Barnet]] suggested "Northgate" or "Northern Heights" as names. Islington and Finsbury (Borough 3) were also unable to come to a decision, with Finsbury preferring "New River" and Islington preferring Islington. [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] and [[Twickenham]] (Borough 24) disagreed over which, if any of those names should appear in the new borough names. Suggestions for [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] (Borough 32) included "[[Enfield Chase]]" and "[[Edmonton (hundred)|Edmonton Hundred]]".

Nine names were without controversy and were proposed in September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Names for Nine New Boroughs of London |work=The Times |date= 14 September 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[City of Westminster|Westminster]] (Borough 1)
*[[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] (Borough 2) – "virtually in the centre of the three boroughs"
*[[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] (Borough 5) – a historic alternative name for the [[Tower division]] of [[Middlesex]]
*[[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]] (Borough 14) – named for a red bridge of the [[River Roding]] in [[Ilford]]
*[[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] (Borough 17) – combination of [[East Ham]] and [[West Ham]]
*[[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] (Borough 20)
*[[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston upon Thames]] (Borough 23)
*[[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] (Borough 27)
*[[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] (Borough 31) – a variant spelling of [[Harringay]]

Six new names were proposed by the Minister in October 1963 for boroughs unable to decide upon a name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minister Names New Boroughs |work=The Times |date=30 October 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] (Borough 18)
*[[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] (Borough 19)
*[[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] (Borough 21)
*[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]] (Borough 24)
*[[London Borough of Hounslow|Hounslow]] (Borough 25)
*[[Uxbridge]] (ultimately changed to [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]]) (Borough 26)

The Minister proposed a further twelve names in January 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea Name Retained: New Decisions on Three Boroughs |work=The Times |date=3 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] (not Charlton as previously suggested) (Borough 6)
*[[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]] (not Uxbridge) (Borough 26)
*[[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] (Borough 3)
*[[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] (Borough 4)
*[[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] (Borough 7)
*[[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] (Borough 8)
*[[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] (Borough 10)
*Kensington and Chelsea (Borough 12)
*[[London Borough of Waltham Forest|Waltham Forest]] (Borough 13)
*[[London Borough of Havering|Havering]] (Borough 15) – after the former [[Royal Liberty of Havering]] which covered a similar area
*[[London Borough of Barking|Barking]] (Borough 16)
*[[London Borough of Merton|Morden]] (Borough 22) (ultimately changed to [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]])
*[[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] (Borough 30)
*[[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] (Borough 32)
*Wembley and Willesden (Borough 28) wished to be called "Willesden and Wembley", but was ultimately titled [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] after the [[River Brent]].
*[[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]] (Borough 11) were unable to choose a single name, and sent a shortlist to the Minister including "Riverside" and "Olympia".

Councillors for the Metropolitan Boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington were divided and opposed the loss of their two [[ancient parish]] names in combining, so the Minister for Housing and Local Government made one exception and the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] came into being.

==Background==

===Herbert Report===
{{main|Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London}}

A [[royal commission]] was appointed in 1957 under the chairmanship of Sir [[Edwin Herbert]] to consider future local government structures in Greater London. The commission delivered its report in October 1960 proposing the creation of a Greater London with 52 Greater London Boroughs.

The Greater London area set up by the 1963 Act was very similar to that proposed by the Herbert Report but excluded [[Banstead]], [[Caterham and Warlingham]], [[Esher]], [[Walton and Weybridge Urban District|Walton and Weybridge]] in Surrey, [[Chigwell]] in Essex, [[Cheshunt]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and [[Staines Urban District|Staines]] and [[Sunbury Urban District|Sunbury]] in Middlesex.

===Passage through Parliament===
The government considered that the boroughs should be fewer and larger so published its plan for 34 London boroughs in late 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government Plan for 34 London Boroughs |work=The Times |date=19 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the County of London this reorganised the proposed boroughs so that combinations for the present boroughs of Camden, Westminster and Islington were achieved. The Hackney borough had Shoreditch rather than the Tower Hamlets borough. Lewisham would be standalone, Deptford would combine with Camberwell and Bermondsey, and Southwark and Lambeth would unite. Eastern Wandsworth was to form a borough in itself, with western Wandsworth being paired with Battersea.

Outside the former County of London, the outer London boroughs were to be:

*Chigwell (north of the Roding – that is, [[Loughton]] and [[Buckhurst Hill]])/Chingford/Leyton/Walthamstow/Wanstead and Woodford

The Minister of Housing and Local Government announced, on their request, that five urban districts (Cheshunt, Chigwell, Esher, Staines and Sunbury) were to be excluded from Greater London on 18 May 1961, having earlier confirmed the widely expected exclusion of [[Banstead]], [[Caterham and Warlingham]] and [[Walton and Weybridge]].

Requests from the councils of Romford, Barnet, Carshalton, Coulsdon and Purley, Feltham, Yiewsley and West Drayton to be removed from the area were turned down. Additionally, the department decided that the "northern part of the borough of Epsom and Ewell definitely forms part of Greater London and must be included".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five More Towns Now Out Of London Plan |work=The Times |date=19 May 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epsom and Ewell would ultimately be excluded from the area in its entirety.

Changes published in August 1962 saw a reduction from 33 to 32 boroughs, and in greater detail, Shoreditch to join [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]; Wanstead and Woodford to be added to Ilford to form '[[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]]' rather than join [[London Borough of Waltham Forest|Waltham Forest]]; [[Chislehurst and Sidcup]] to be divided between the [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] and the [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]]; [[East Barnet]], [[Friern Barnet]], [[Hendon]], and [[Finchley]] to form [[London Borough of Barnet|a single borough (Barnet)]], Enfield to join Edmonton and Southgate (to be simply [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]]), the Tottenham, Hornsey and Wood Green authorities to combine to form [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and at the most local level, Clapham and Streatham neighbourhoods to join [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Changes In Proposals For London Council Areas: Ministry Accepts Recommendations |work=The Times |date=3 August 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slightly amended form was laid before Parliament for substantive debates from November 1962 until April 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London Government Bill. Fewer, Bigger, Boroughs To Run Own Education, Central Control Over Water |work=The Times |date=23 November 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed the eventually settled 32 more empowered boroughs forming a new administrative county.

===Support===
Ministerial proponents of the Bill advanced its smooth passage summarising the Royal Commission's Report:
{{quote|One of those basic strands is that London Government must reflect the physical fact that Greater London is a single city with a recognisable existence of its own: ''it is a living organism with its heart, its limbs and its lungs.'' The [[Surrey County Council|Surrey]] [-proposed] Plan does not recognise this important basic fact.

Secondly, the Government regard it as vital that the functions that need to be exercised over the whole of Greater London should be in the hands of a body with real positive powers. In no other way can such a Government be effective.&lt;ref name=hans&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Lords |title=LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1962/mar/14/london-government#S5LV0238P0_19620314_HOL_192|date=March 14, 1962 |column_start=278 |column_end=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe|Earl Jellicoe]], Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Housing, ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Con]])}}

{{quote|...but [in] ordinary human speech, how is it that such people can be so appalled at acknowledging that they live in what is the greatest capital city in the world?

...

It would be ludicrous for the Government to go to this extent to try to reorganise metropolitan government for the next half century and boggle at including in it the whole of the metropolitan continuous built-up area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/feb/20/schedule-1-the-london-boroughs|date=February 20, 1963 |column_start=278 |column_end=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Sir [[Keith Joseph]], ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Con]]), Minister of Housing and Local Government}}
{{quote|I invite hon. Members on both sides to agree that, whatever may have been the merits of saying that the area of the L.C.C. was London in 1848, it is idle to say in 1962 that the frontiers are the same now. Plainly, in the more than 70 years since the L.C.C. came into existence, the whole pattern of London has been transformed.&lt;ref name=comms&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1962/dec/11/london-government-bill|date=December 11, 1962 |column_start=278 |column_end=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Charles Curran (politician)|Charles Curran]], ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Con]], Uxbridge, Middlesex moved into London under this Bill)}}

===Opposition===
The leaders and all members of the Opposition in both houses saw the Bill as being partisan, opposed London's re-casting and celebrated its predecessor:

{{quote|...you mean to go through with this execution of the [[London County Council]] because they have been so successful and they have been so strongly supported for 28 years by the electorate.&lt;ref name=hans/&gt;|[[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|Viscount Alexander of Hillsborough]], Leader of Opposition (Lords) ([[Labour Party (UK)|Lab-Coop]])}}

{{quote|...we believe that it is a party political Bill. We have been told that it is "politics in the raw". It certainly is. If London County Council can be destroyed for political reasons, so can the [[City of London]] Common Council.&lt;ref name=comms/&gt;|[[John Parker (British politician)|John Parker]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Lab]], Dagenham, Essex, moved into London under this Bill}}

Five Conservative MPs (for North-West Croydon, South Croydon, Carshalton, Wimbledon and East Surrey) sympathised with a petition from 20,000-30,000 people from Croydon and two hillside semi-rural towns not to join London. Former Labour Home Secretary [[James Chuter Ede]], a retired Surrey magistrate and county councillor, co-led the opposition in Committee, having met residents who were all "resolutely and determinedly opposed to the Bill." He was instrumental in getting his own area, Epsom and Ewell, completely excluded. [[Charles Doughty (British politician)|Charles Doughty]], MP for [[East Surrey (UK Parliament constituency)|East Surrey]] (including [[Coulsdon]] and [[Purley, London|Purley]]), prophesied that "A shotgun marriage of the kind proposed in the Bill between Coulsdon, Purley and [the Borough of] [[Croydon]] can never be successful...The affinities of Coulsdon and Purley go south, not to the north and east. This is a very bad part of the Bill."&lt;ref name=comms/&gt;  The Bill passed, and the boundaries including this fusion, have lasted since 1 April 1965.

==Subsequent amendments==

===Local Government Act 1972===
The [[Local Government Act 1972]] provided a mechanism for councils to change their names: the [[London Borough of Hammersmith]] and the [[London Borough of Barking]] changed their names after their creation to contain a second locality, to form the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] and the [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham]].

===Local Government Act 1985===
The [[Local Government Act 1985]] abolished the Greater London Council and transferred its functions to the London borough councils, joint arrangements and to central government. The [[Inner London Education Authority]] continued to exist as a directly elected authority.

===Education Reform Act 1988===
The [[Education Reform Act 1988]] abolished the Inner London Education Authority and made the inner London boroughs education authorities.

===Greater London Authority Act 1999===
The [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]] created the [[Greater London Authority]] as a replacement for the Greater London Council.

'''Minneapolis–Saint Paul''' is a major [[metropolitan area]] built around the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] and [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix]] rivers in east central [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minnesota cities|last=Xiong|first=Yia|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is commonly known as the '''Twin Cities''' after its two largest cities, [[Minneapolis]], the most populous city in the state, and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], the state capital. It is an example of [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity]]. Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) as "The Cities".

There are several different definitions of the region. Many refer to the ''Twin Cities'' as the seven-county region which is governed under the [[Metropolitan Council]] regional governmental agency and planning organization. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] officially designates 16 counties as the "Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington MN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area", the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|16th largest]] in the [[United States]]. The entire region known as the "Minneapolis–St. Paul MN–WI Combined Statistical Area", has a population of 3,946,533, the [[Combined Statistical Area|14th largest]], according to 2017 Census estimates.

Despite the Twin moniker, both cities are independent municipalities with defined borders. Minneapolis is somewhat younger with more modern skyscrapers downtown, while Saint Paul has been likened to an [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]] city, with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-[[Victorian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |title=St. Paul travel guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232949/http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minneapolis was influenced by its early [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Lutheran]] heritage. St. Paul was influenced by its early [[French Canadian|French]], [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] [[Catholic]] roots.

==Populated places==
===Counties===
The Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area, or The Cities, includes 16 counties, of which 14 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin.

Note: Counties that are '''bolded''' are under jurisdiction of the [[Metropolitan Council]]. Numbers in parentheses are 2013 census estimates. Counties that are ''italicized'' were added to the metropolitan area when the [[Office of Management and Budget]] revised its delineations of [[metropolitan statistical area]]s in 2013.&lt;ref name="MSA-2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update of Statistical Area Definitions and Guidance on Their Uses|url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/fy2009/09-01.pdf|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2015|publisher=Office of Management and Budget|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSA-2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised Delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and Guidance on Uses of the Delineations of These Areas|url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf|date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2015|publisher=Office of Management and Budget|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined Statistical Area==
The '''Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN–WI Combined Statistical Area''' is made up of 19 counties in Minnesota and two counties in Wisconsin. The statistical area includes two [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan areas]] and three [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan areas]]. As of the 2010 Census, the CSA had a population of 3,684,928 (though a July 1, 2012 estimate placed the population at 3,691,918).&lt;ref name=PopEstCSA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/tables/CBSA-EST2012-02.csv |title=Table 2.

==Rivalry==
Minneapolis and St. Paul have competed since they were founded, resulting in some duplication of effort.&lt;ref name="OAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007feb/wingerd.html |title=Separated at Birth: The Sibling Rivalry of Minneapolis and St. Paul |author=Mary Lethert Wingerd |date=February 2007 |publisher=Organization of American Historians |work=OAH Newsletter |issue=35 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707020313/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007feb/wingerd.html |archivedate=July 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After St. Paul completed its elaborate [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral]] in 1915, Minneapolis quickly followed up with the equally ornate [[Basilica of Saint Mary, Minneapolis|Basilica of St. Mary]] in 1926. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the rivalry became so intense that an architect practicing in one city was often refused business in the other. The [[1890 United States Census]] even led to the two cities arresting and/or kidnapping each other's census takers, in an attempt to keep either city from outgrowing the other.&lt;ref name="Cen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DEED7123BE533A25752C2A9609C94619ED7CF|title=CENSUS-BRED BITTERNESS; ST.

[[File:Minneapolis Millers 1905.jpg|thumb|right|450px|The 1905 [[Minneapolis Millers]] baseball team]]

The rivalry could occasionally erupt into inter-city violence, as happened at a 1923 game between the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and the [[St. Paul Saints]], both [[baseball]] teams of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1950s, both cities competed for a [[major league baseball]] franchise (which resulted in two rival stadiums being built), and there was a brief period in the mid-1960s where the two cities could not agree on a common calendar for [[daylight saving time]], resulting in a period of a few weeks where people in Minneapolis were one hour "behind" anyone living or traveling in St. Paul.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The cities' mutual antagonism was largely healed by the end of the 1960s, aided by the simultaneous arrival in 1961 of the [[Minnesota Twins]] of the [[American League]] and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]], both of which identified themselves with the state as a whole (the former explicitly named for both Twin Cities) and not with either of the major cities (unlike the earlier [[Minneapolis Lakers]]). Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole. In terms of development, the two cities remain distinct in their progress, with Minneapolis absorbing new and avant-garde architecture while St. Paul continues to carefully integrate new buildings into the context of classical and Victorian styles.&lt;ref name="OAH" /&gt;

==Culture==
{{see also|Culture of Minnesota}}

===Fine and performing arts===
[[Image:Guthrie-North.jpg|thumb|alt=view from the Mississippi river side showing the Guthrie's design and bridge to nowhere and green foliage|[[Guthrie Theater]] on the [[Mississippi River]], Minneapolis]]
The Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area [[fine art]] museums include the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]], the [[Walker Art Center]], and the [[Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]. The [[Minnesota Orchestra]] and the [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]] are full-time professional [[musical ensemble]]s.   The [[Guthrie Theater]] moved into a new building in 2006 overlooking the Mississippi River. The [[Minnesota Fringe Festival]] is an annual celebration of [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[improvisation]], [[puppetry]], kids' shows, [[visual art]], and musicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How to fringe| work = Fresh Art Delivered Daily| publisher = Minnesota Fringe Festival| year = 2006 | url = http://www.fringefestival.org/new.cfm| accessdate = 2006-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114023612/http://www.fringefestival.org/new.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Radio program ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', hosted by Minnesota native [[Garrison Keillor]] aired live for many years from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].  The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor ''[[Live from Here]]'' also airing from the same venue.

===Outdoors===
[[File:Bounce-Saint Paul-2006-05-11.jpg|thumb|left|A Saint Paul Bouncing Team aerialist exhibition in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]]]
There are numerous [[lake]]s in the region, and cities in the area have some very extensive [[park]] systems for [[recreation]]. Organized recreation includes the [[Great River Energy bicycle festival]], the [[Twin Cities Marathon]], and the U.S. [[pond hockey]] championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, [[medicine]] is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], as the [[University of Minnesota]] has joined other [[college]]s and [[hospital]]s in doing significant research, and major [[medical device]] manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is [[Medtronic]]). Technical innovators have brought important advances in [[computing]], including the [[Cray]] line of [[supercomputers]].

It is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share [[cabin (housing)|cabin]]s and other properties along lakes and [[forest]]ed areas in the central and northern regions of the state, and weekend trips "up North" happen through the warmer months. [[Ice fishing]] is also a major pastime in the winter, although each year some overambitious [[fishing|fishermen]] find themselves in dangerous situations when they venture out onto the [[ice]] too early or too late. [[Hunting]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV riding]] and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular. This connectedness with the outdoors also brings a strong sense of [[environmentalism]] to many Minnesotans.

In 2011 and 2012, the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] named Minneapolis–Saint Paul the healthiest metropolitan area in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actively Moving America to Better Health|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2011_afi_report_final.pdf|format=PDF|year=2011|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2012_afi_report_final.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) American Fitness Index|year=2012|title=Health and Community Fitness Status of the 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==

===Place of birth===
Approximately 93.2% of the metropolitan area's population was native to the United States. Approximately 92.6% were born in the U.S. while 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or born abroad to American parents. The rest of the population (6.8%) were foreign-born.

The highest percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

With regards to ethnicity, the metropolitan area is predominantly white, with every county having at least 70% of its population coming from that background. However, the area is gradually becoming more diverse over time.

===Religion===
[[File:Church in Chaska-20070203.jpg|thumb|Guardian Angels Catholic Church in [[Chaska, Minnesota|Chaska]]]]
Minneapolis–Saint Paul is also a major center for religion in the state, especially [[Christianity]]. The state headquarters of five major Christian churches are found here: the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]], the [[Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota]], the [[Presbyterian]] Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington as well as the Orthodox Church in America.

The headquarters of the former [[American Lutheran Church]] [[American Lutheran Church|(ALC)]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Lutheran Free Church]] and the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]] were located in Minneapolis; the headquarters of [[Augsburg Fortress]] publishing house still is. The [[Minneapolis Area Synod]] and the [[Saint Paul Area Synod]] are the first and third largest synods of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]]), respectively.

The [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] has its headquarters in Bloomington, and the [[Association of Free Lutheran Congregations]] is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.

The Twin Cities are home to several [[synagogue]]s serving the [[Judaism|Jewish]] population, which is concentrated in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities suburb of [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]]. A recent influx of immigrants from [[Laos]] and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] has brought many more religions to the area. There are several [[Islam]]ic [[Masjid]]s in the area. There is a temple for the religion of [[Eckankar]] in the suburb of [[Chanhassen]] known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS [[St. Paul Minnesota Temple]] opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several very strong [[Unitarian Universalist]] communities such as the [[First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis|First Unitarian Society]] of Minneapolis, as well as several [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[Buddhist]] groups. The cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis have been called [[Paganistan]] due to the large numbers of Pagans living there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/April-2009/MNMO-Recommends/ Welcome to Paganistan]&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 20,000 Pagans living in the Twin Cities area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.startribune.com/articles/206115007 Wiccan prisoner sues state, claiming religious rights violated] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minneapolis is where the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] started and was its home for more than fifty years.

The Twin Cities is one of [[U.S. cities with teams from four major league sports|thirteen American metropolitan areas]] to have teams in all four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major sports]] — MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL. Including Major League Soccer (MLS), it is one of ten metro areas to have five major sports. To avoid favoring either of the Twin Cities, most teams based in the area use only the word Minnesota in their name, rather than Minneapolis or St. Paul.

Minneapolis was the site of two [[Super Bowl]]s - [[Super Bowl XXVI]] in 1992 and [[Super Bowl LII]] in 2018.  It was the farthest north that a Super Bowl has ever been played.

The [[World Series]] has been played in the Twin Cities three times - 1965, 1987 and 1991 as well as three MLB [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]s - 1965, 1985 and 2014. All-Star games in the NHL were hosted in 1972 and 2004, the NBA in 1994 and the WNBA in 2018.

The [[Stanley Cup Finals]] have been played in the Twin Cities twice - 1981 and 1991 as well as the [[NHL Stadium Series]] played host to a game in 2016.

The [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] Men's NCAA basketball tournament has been hosted by Minneapolis four times - 1951, 1992, 2001 and 2019 and Women's one time - 1995. The women's tournament will return to Minneapolis in 2022.

Major golf tournaments hosted in the Twin Cities include - [[US Open]] - 1916, 1930, 1970, 1991; [[US Women's Open]] - 1966, 1977, 2008; [[PGA Championship]] - 1932, 1954, 2002, 2009; [[Walker Cup]] - 1957; [[Solheim Cup]] - 2002 and the [[Ryder Cup]] - 2016. The Ryder Cup is scheduled to return in 2028.

The 1998 [[World Figure Skating Championships]] was held at [[Target Center]] in Minneapolis.

The Twin Cities host three nationally competing [[Roller Derby]] leagues: The [[Minnesota RollerGirls]] of the [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] Division 1, the [[North Star Roller Girls]] of WFTDA Division 2, and Minnesota Men's Roller Derby, a league of the [[Men's Roller Derby Association]]. MNRG and NSRG possess four home teams each: the Dagger Dolls, Garda Belts, Rockits, and Atomic Bombshells of MNRG and the Banger Sisters, Delta Delta Di, Kilmore Girls and Violent Femmes of NSRG, as well as two traveling teams each. MMRD possesses three home teams: The Gentlemen's Club, Destruction Workers, and Thunderjacks, and two traveling teams.

The annual [[Twin Cities Marathon]] is held in the fall with a course running through Minneapolis and St. Paul. Minneapolis was the birthplace of [[Rollerblade]] and is a center for [[inline skating]], as well as home to the most [[golf]]ers per capita of any city in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.50states.com/facts/minn.htm 50states.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[water skiing]] got its start on [[Lake Pepin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterskihalloffame.com/waterskihistory.html Waterskihalloffame.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a short distance southeast of the metropolitan area.

Some other sports teams gained their names from being in Minnesota before relocating. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] get their name from once being based in Minneapolis, the City of Lakes. The [[Dallas Stars]] also derived their present name from their tenure as a Minnesota team, the [[Minnesota North Stars]].

==Politics==
{{see also|Politics of Minnesota}}
The [[2008 Republican National Convention]] was held at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in St. Paul. Minneapolis and St. Paul submitted combined bids to host the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] and the Republican National Convention. Minneapolis was host to the [[1892 Republican National Convention]].

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Minnesota|List of companies based in Minneapolis–Saint Paul}}
The Minneapolis–Saint Paul area is home to 18 of Minnesota's 19 [[Fortune 500]] headquarters - [[UnitedHealth Group]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Best Buy]], [[CHS Inc.|CHS]], [[3M]], [[US Bancorp]], [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]], [[General Mills]], [[Land O'Lakes]], [[Ecolab]], [[CH Robinson Worldwide]], [[Ameriprise Financial]], [[Xcel Energy]], [[Thrivent Financial for Lutherans|Thrivent Financial]], [[The Mosaic Company|Mosaic]], [[Patterson Companies|Patterson]], [[Securian Financial Group|Securian Financial]] and [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]].  A number of private companies are also headquartered in the Twin Cities area, including [[Cargill]], the country's largest private company, [[Carlson Companies|Carlson]], [[Radisson Hotel Group]], [[Mortenson]], [[Holiday Stationstores]], and [[Andersen Corporation|Andersen]]. Foreign companies with U.S. headquarters in the Twin Cities include [[Aimia (company)|Aimia]], [[Allianz]], [[Canadian Pacific]], [[Coloplast]], [[Medtronic]], [[Pearson VUE]], [[Pentair]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada|RBC]].

==History==
{{see also|History of Minnesota|History of Wisconsin}}
[[File:Stillwater-2004-01-02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]]]]
The first European settlement in the region was near what is now known as the town of [[Stillwater, Minnesota]]. The city is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} from downtown Saint Paul and lies on the western bank of the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest in the area was the outpost at [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the [[confluence]] of the [[Minnesota River]] and the [[Mississippi River]].

Fort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of [[Saint Anthony Falls]], thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank of the river was Colonel [[John H. Stevens]], who operated a [[ferry]] service across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged. On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul.

[[File:Stpaul001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], showing barges on the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Minnesota State Capitol|Capitol dome]], and [[St. Paul]] in the background. In the lower right is a typical nineteenth century home.]]
Natural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the two cities. The [[Mississippi River Valley]] in this area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, some seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) downstream from [[Saint Anthony Falls]], the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the [[Mill City Museum]], housed in the former [[Washburn "A" Mill]], which was among the world's largest mills in its time.

The oldest farms in the state are located in Washington County, the eastern most county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.&lt;ref&gt;"Afton Remembered," Edwin Robb, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford lock and dam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River]] just upstream of the [[Minnesota River]]]]
The [[Grand Excursion]], a trip into the Upper [[Midwest]] sponsored by the [[Rock Island Railroad]], brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by [[railroad|rail]] and [[steamboat]] in 1854. The next year, in 1855, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', an [[epic poem]] based on the [[Ojibwe]] legends of [[Hiawatha]]. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as [[Lake Minnetonka]] and [[Minnehaha Falls]]. [[Tourism|Tourists]] inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following decades.

At one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban [[streetcar]] systems and interstate rail. Due to the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by [[railroad]]. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the [[head of navigation]] on the river, prior to a new [[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River|lock and dam facility]] being added upriver in Minneapolis.

Passenger travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and from the [[Saint Paul Union Depot]]. This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the [[automobile]], some of the earliest [[streamliner]]s ran from [[Chicago]] to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Today, the only vestige of this interstate service comes by [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Empire Builder]]'' train, running once daily in each direction. It is the railroad's busiest long-distance train and is named after [[James J. Hill]], a railroad [[tycoon]] who settled on [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]] in Saint Paul at what is now known as the [[James J. Hill House]].

Like many Northern cities that grew up with the [[Industrial Revolution]], Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the [[Demographics of Minneapolis|central city areas]], [[white flight]] to suburbs,&lt;ref&gt;Chap. 1 "It Couldn't Happen Here..." Myron Orfield, Metropolitics (Washington DC, Brookings Institution: 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the summer of 1967, [[race riots]] on Minneapolis's North Side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109122142/http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=1|date=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and St. Paul were frequently cited as former [[Rust Belt]] cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic, November 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and geology==
{{see also|Geology of Minnesota}}

Along with much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water and ice over the course of millions of years. The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural [[cave]]s to develop, which were expanded into [[mining|mine]]s when white settlers came to the area. In the time of [[Prohibition]], at least one [[speakeasy]] was built into these hidden spaces—eventually refurbished as the [[Wabasha Street Caves]] in Saint Paul.

Lakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of [[glacier]]s. This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. For example, [[Lake Minnetonka]] out toward the western side of the Twin Cities consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the metropolitan area range from {{convert|1376|ft|m|0}} above sea level in the northwest metro to {{convert|666|ft|m|0}} at the edge of the [[Mississippi River]] in the southeast.

[[File:Bald Eagle-Burnsville-2006-01-15.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bald eagle]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]]]]
Because it is comparatively easy to dig through limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building [[rapid transit|subway]]s for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much greater than surface projects.

The Twin Cities area takes the brunt of many types of extreme weather, including high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin Cities history was a [[derecho]] event on May 15, 1998. [[Hail]] and [[Wind]] damage exceeded [[Dollar sign|$]]950&amp;nbsp;million, much of it in the Twin Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott |first=Woelm |title=Top 10 Minnesota Severe Weather Events 1990–1999 |publisher=Metro Skywarn |date=June 30, 2006 |url=http://www.skywarn.ampr.org/mn_top10.html |accessdate=2007-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328054606/http://www.skywarn.ampr.org/mn_top10.html |archivedate=March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other memorable Twin Cities weather-related events include the [[1965 Twin Cities tornado outbreak|tornado outbreak]] on May 6, 1965, the [[Armistice Day Blizzard]] on November 11, 1940, and the [[Halloween Blizzard]] of 1991.

===Buildings and structures===
[[File:Minneapolis-skyline-2006-07-17.jpg|thumb|The tallest buildings in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] are, left to right, the [[IDS Center]], [[Capella Tower]] and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]].]]
The four tallest buildings in the area are located in downtown Minneapolis. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallest—most Minnesotans would immediately think of the [[IDS Center]] if queried on the point, although most sources seem to agree that [[Capella Tower]] is slightly taller. But in early 2005, it was found that the [[IDS Center]] is taller by a {{convert|16|ft|m|0|adj=on}} washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). [[Capella Tower]] and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]] only differ in height by a [[foot (unit)|foot]] or two, a rather negligible amount.

Buildings have gone up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order.&lt;ref name="Millett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=Lost Twin Cities|year=1992|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). [[Minneapolis City Hall]] is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types—including personal residences such as the [[James J. Hill House]]—were similarly designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul Clifford|last=Larson|author2=Martin, Judith|editor=Larson, Paul Clifford |title=The Spirit of H.H. Richardson on the Midland Prairies|year=1988|publisher=Iowa State University Press|location=Ames, Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few decades later, [[Art Deco]] brought several structures that survive today, including [[St. Paul City Hall]], the [[Foshay Tower]], and the [[Minneapolis Post Office]]. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while St. Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.

[[File:MendotaBridge8.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mendota Bridge]] over the [[Minnesota River]] between [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] and [[Mendota, Minnesota|Mendota]]]]
St. Paul and Minneapolis in particular went through some massive [[urban renewal]] projects in the post-[[World War II]] era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived.&lt;ref name="Millett"/&gt; In fact, the area might be signified more by [[bridge]]s than buildings. A series of [[reinforced concrete]] [[arch]] spans crossing the Mississippi River were built in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic, but remain pleasing to the eye despite their age (a number have undergone major repair work, but retain the original design). Several of the bridges are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. They include the [[10th Avenue Bridge]], [[Intercity Bridge]] (Ford Parkway), [[Robert Street Bridge]], and the longest, the 4119&amp;nbsp;ft (1255 m) [[Mendota Bridge]] next to Fort Snelling. The area is also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. That structure is long gone, but a series of [[Hennepin Avenue Bridge]]s have been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as [[skyway]]s.

[[File:Guthrie-North.jpg|thumb|[[Guthrie Theater]] on the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]
Several prominent buildings in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis Public Library|Central Public Library]], [[Weisman Art Museum]] and the [[Guthrie Theater]]. Opened in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage for its opening in June, 2006. The design is the work of architect Jean Nouvel and is a 285,000 square foot (26,500 m²) facility that houses three theaters: (1) the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100, (2) a 700-seat proscenium stage, and (3) a black-box studio with flexible seating. In 2002 the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the United States in response to plans announced by the Walker Art Center to expand on the land occupied by the theater. However, the original Guthrie building was torn down in 2006. These building projects have rejuvenated the downtown area.

==Transportation==
{{see also|Transportation in Minnesota}}

===Roads and highways===
[[File:Walker Art Center-Minneapolis-061230.jpg|thumb|[[Walker Art Center]] on [[Hennepin Avenue]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]
In the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward significantly. Automobiles made it possible for [[suburb]]s to grow greatly. The area now has a number of [[freeway]]s to transport people by car. The area incorporates a large number of [[traffic camera]]s and [[ramp meter]]s to monitor and manage [[traffic congestion]]. There is some use of HOV ([[high-occupancy vehicle]]) express lanes, which is becoming much more common. In order to use an express lane, you need to own a MNPASS or have multiple people in the car. MNPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MNPASS express lanes are open to all traffic.

[[Interstate 94]] comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the [[Interstate 494|I-494]]/[[Interstate 694|I-694]] [[beltway|loop]], and [[Interstate 394|I-394]] continues west when I-94 turns north. Additionally, [[Interstate 35]] splits in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] in the southern part of the Twin Cities region, bringing [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] into St. Paul and [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] into Minneapolis. They join together again to the north in [[Columbus, Minnesota|Columbus]], (just south of [[Forest Lake, Minnesota|Forest Lake]]) and continue to the highway's terminus in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. This is one of only two examples of an Interstate highway splitting off into branches and then rejoining into one again; the other split occurs in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], where I-35 splits into [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] for motorists going to Dallas and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] for traffic heading into Fort Worth.

On Wednesday, August 1, 2007, a large portion of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] near University Avenue in the city of Minneapolis collapsed into the [[Mississippi River]] around 6:05pm [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/allheadlines/ci_6518669 | title=35W bridge collapses over Mississippi River, cars in the water | publisher=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]  | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/S156329.shtml?cat=1 | title= 35W bridge over Mississippi collapsed | publisher=[[KSTP-TV|5 EYEWITNESS NEWS]] | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[St. Anthony Falls (35W) Bridge|replacement bridge]] opened on Thursday, September 18, 2008.

===Air travel===
The main [[airport]] in the region is [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport]] (MSP), which is a major hub for [[Delta Air Lines]]. The airport is also the main hub and operating base for [[Sun Country Airlines]]. There are six smaller ([[relief airport|relief]]) airports in the area which are owned and operated by the [[Metropolitan Airports Commission]] (the same agency operates the main MSP airport). Some people even [[commuting|commute]] by air to the Twin Cities from the northern part of the state.

===Public transit===
[[File:Metro Transit-Minneapolis-2005-06-04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] storefront, [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]

[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]], by far the biggest bus service provider in the area, owes its existence to the [[Twin City Rapid Transit|old streetcar]] lines that ran in the area. Metro Transit provides about 95% of the [[public transit]] rides in the region with over 900 buses, although some suburbs have other bus services. The [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]] operates a free bus system between its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector [[Bus Rapid Transit]] line which travels between the Minneapolis and St. Paul Campuses by a dedicated bus line, and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] LRT ([[light rail]]) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown Minneapolis, [[Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport]] and the [[Mall of America]] in Bloomington. It was followed by the [[Red Line (Minnesota)|METRO Red Line]] BRT (bus rapid transitway)  in 2013 connecting the Mall of America with [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]] along [[Cedar Avenue]] through the southern suburbs. The [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] LRT connecting downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota campus and downtown St. Paul along [[University Avenue (Minneapolis–Saint Paul)|University Avenue]] opened in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Council - Central Corridor transit FAQ |url=http://metrocouncil.org/transportation/ccorridor/ccfaq.htm |accessdate=3 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612083026/http://www.metrocouncil.org/transportation/ccorridor/ccfaq.htm |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three lines are operated by Metro Transit. Additionally, the [[Northstar Line]] [[commuter rail]] line connecting Minneapolis with [[Big Lake, Minnesota|Big Lake]] opened in November 2009; the line may be extended to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] as ridership numbers warrant.

In many ways the light rail of today is a return to the streetcars that existed in the past, it is being used as a stepping-stone to other projects.

[[File:Hiawatha Line-bike rack-20061211.jpg|thumb|Bicycle rack on the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] LRT]]

A variety of rail services are currently being pondered by state and local governments, including neighborhood streetcar systems, intercity light rail service, and [[commuter rail]] options out to [[Commuter town|exurban]] regions. In addition, Minnesota is one of several states in the Midwest examining the idea of setting up [[high-speed rail]] service using Chicago as a regional hub.&lt;ref name="rail"&gt;[http://www.dot.state.mn.us/passengerrail/highspeed.html Midwest Regional Rail Initiative]. Retrieved June 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minneapolis–St. Paul area has been criticized for inadequate public transportation.&lt;ref name="traffic"&gt;[http://www.metrocouncil.org/Directions/transit/transit2005/congestionJun05.htm Metropolitan Council Release on Traffic Congestion]. Retrieved October 16, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224912/http://www.metrocouncil.org/Directions/transit/transit2005/congestionJun05.htm |date=February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to many other cities its size, the public transportation system in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area is less robust. As the metropolitan area has grown, the roads and highways have been updated and widened, but traffic volume is growing faster than the projects needed to widen them, and public transportation has not expanded enough to commensurate with the population. The Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area is ranked as the fifth worst for congestion growth of similar-sized U.S. metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="traffic"/&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2011}} 
Additional lines and spurs are needed to upgrade public transportation in the Twin Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Council - Central Corridor transit FAQ |url=http://metrocouncil.org/transportation/ccorridor/ccfaq.htm |accessdate=3 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612083026/http://www.metrocouncil.org/transportation/ccorridor/ccfaq.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are underway for [[Southwest Corridor (Minneapolis)|Green Line extension]] connecting downtown Minneapolis to the southwest suburb of [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]].  A northwest LRT (Blue Line extension) along [[Bottineau Boulevard]] is being planned from downtown Minneapolis to [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]]. The [[Orange Line (Minnesota)|METRO Orange Line]] BRT will open in 2019, connecting downtown Minneapolis with Lakeville to the south along I-35W. The METRO Gold Line BRT is planned to connect downtown St. Paul to the eastern suburbs within the next few years.

==Media==
{{main|Media in Minneapolis–St. Paul}}

===Print===
The Twin Cities have two major daily newspapers: the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Saint Paul Pioneer Press]]''. Additionally, the ''[[Minnesota Daily]]'' serves the [[University of Minnesota system|University of Minnesota]]'s Twin Cities campus and surrounding neighborhoods. There is one general-interest neighborhood weekly newspaper still in the cities: The ''[[East Side Review]]'', devoted to the 90,000 residents in the eastern third of St. Paul. Other weekly papers are devoted to specific audiences/demographics including [[City Pages]].

===Television===
[[File:KARE-TV-MN State Fair 20060826.jpg|thumb|left|[[KARE (TV)|KARE]] television broadcast, [[Minnesota State Fair]]]]
The region is currently ranked as the 15th largest [[television]] market according to Nielson Media Research. Three [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]] exist in the Twin Cities: [[Twin Cities PBS]] operates both [[Twin Cities PBS|KTCA and KTCI]], [[Hubbard Broadcasting]] (built by Stanley E. Hubbard) owns both [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KSTP-TV]] and [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KSTC-TV]], and [[Fox Television Stations]] operates both [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[KMSP-TV]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] O&amp;O [[WFTC]]. Diversified from radio, [[KSTP-TV]] became the first television channel to air in the region with a show reaching 3,000 television sets in 1948, and the 17th station to broadcast in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minneapolis Public Library |title=A History of Minneapolis: Radio and Television |url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/nm2.asp |year=2001 |accessdate=2007-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419090008/http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/nm2.asp |archivedate=2007-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transmitters-downtown-Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|[[WCCO-TV]] building [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]
The only station with its main studios in Minneapolis is [[CBS]] [[O&amp;O]] [[WCCO-TV|WCCO]], while St. Paul is host to KSTP/KSTC, KTCA/KTCI, and [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WUCW]]. [[NBC]] affiliate [[KARE (TV)|KARE]] has a sprawling broadcasting complex in west suburban [[Golden Valley, Minnesota|Golden Valley]]. [[KMSP-TV|KMSP]] is located in southwest suburban [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]]. Other stations are located in the suburbs. For much of the last two decades, WCCO and KARE have shared in having the most popular evening newscasts of the area channels. On the other end, KSTP has struggled to maintain ratings on its news programs. KMSP has had a 9 o'clock newscast since at least the early 1990s when it was an independent channel.

Communities in the region have their own [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) [[cable television]] channels. One channel, the Metro Cable Network, is available on channel 6 on cable systems across the seven-county region.

Several television programs originating in the Twin Cities have been aired nationally on terrestrial and cable TV networks. KTCA created the science program ''[[Newton's Apple]]'' and distributes a children's program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (predecessor to WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including cult classic ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The short-lived ''[[Let's Bowl]]'' started on KARE, and PBS series ''[[Mental Engineering]]'' originated on the St. Paul cable access network.

===Radio===
{{advert|section|date=November 2017}}
The [[radio]] market in the Twin Cities is considered to be somewhat smaller than for TV, ranked 16th. For decades, [[WCCO (AM)|WCCO]] radio was the most well-known broadcaster in the region, with an all-day [[talk radio|talk]] format. WCCO was eventually pushed out of the top spot by [[KQRS-FM]], a [[classic rock]] station with a popular morning show.

[[File:MPR-2006-12-19.jpg|thumb|[[Minnesota Public Radio]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]]]
KSTP also has some fairly well known radio stations, with [[pop music]] format on FM and [[ESPN Radio]] on AM. KSTP-AM and FM are owned by [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]. In 1985, Hubbard – valued at $400 million – was one of the larger corporate media companies in the United States; in 2005, valued at US $1.2 billion, Hubbard is a fairly small major-market media operation.

The Twin Cities have a peculiar mix of commercial and non-commercial radio. The city's market is dominated by [[iHeartRadio]] which operates seven stations, but two small independent stations are award winners—[[KUOM]] operated by the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[KFAI]] [[public access television|public access]] radio in [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|Cedar Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=iBiquity Digital Corporation |title=HD Radio – Minnesota |year=2007 |url=http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio/hdradio_find_a_station/MN/StnMarket#stationlist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211015/http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio/hdradio_find_a_station/MN/StnMarket |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }} and {{cite web |author= |title=Independent Public Radio |url=http://www.ampers.org/station-awards.shtml |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-05-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629175047/http://www.ampers.org/station-awards.shtml |archivedate=2007-06-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) is also a major player in the state and across the country, best known across the U.S. for the variety show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''. Doing business under the name [[American Public Media]], the company is the second largest producer of National Public Radio content, behind [[National Public Radio]] (of which MPR is an affiliate).
The Current is an affiliate of MPR, as well, and it is member supported.

===Independent media===
The Twin Cities is also home to many independent media organizations, including [[The UpTake]], ''[[MinnPost]]'' and ''[[Twin Cities Daily Planet]]''.

==Honors==
The [[United States Navy]] currently has one ship named for the region, {{USS|Minneapolis–Saint Paul|SSN-708|6}}, a {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine}} launched in 1983. Previously, two sets of two ships each had carried the names {{USS|Minneapolis}} and {{USS|Saint Paul}}.

'''Occupational safety and health''' ('''OSH'''), also commonly referred to as '''occupational health and safety''' ('''OHS'''), '''occupational health''',&lt;ref&gt;It can be confusing that British English also uses ''[[industrial medicine]]'' to refer to occupational health and safety and uses ''occupational health'' to refer to [[occupational medicine]]. See the Collins Dictionary entries for [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/industrial-medicine ''industrial medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-medicine ''occupational medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-health ''occupational health''].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''workplace health and safety''' ('''WHS'''), is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the [[safety]], [[health]], and [[quality of life|welfare]] of people at [[Employment|work]]. These terms also refer to the goals of this field,&lt;ref&gt;[Mosby's Medical Dictionary http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/occupational+health]&lt;/ref&gt; so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of ''occupational safety and health program/department'' etc.

The goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe and healthy work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{!}} ORNL|url = http://www.ornl.gov|website = www.ornl.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSH may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment. In the United States, the term occupational health and safety is referred to as '''occupational health and occupational and non-occupational safety''' and includes safety for activities outside of work.&lt;ref name= Fanning&gt;Fanning, Fred E. (2003). Basic Safety Administration: A Handbook for the New Safety Specialist, Chicago: American Society of Safety Engineers&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) "occupational health deals with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of hazards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WPRO {{!}} Occupational health|url = http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/occupational_health/en/|website = www.wpro.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health]] has been defined as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|title = WHO Definition of Health|date = |accessdate = |website = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160707120526/http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|archivedate = 2016-07-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational health is a multidisciplinary field of [[healthcare]] concerned with enabling an individual to undertake their [[Job|occupation]], in the way that causes least harm to their health. Health has been defined as It contrasts, for example, with the promotion of health and safety at work, which is concerned with preventing harm from any incidental [[hazards]], arising in the workplace.

Since 1950, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health. It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995. The definition reads:

{{quote|"The main focus in occupational health is on three different objectives: (i) the maintenance and promotion of workers’ health and working capacity; (ii) the improvement of working environment and work to become conducive to safety and health and (iii) development of work organizations and working cultures in a direction which supports health and safety at work and in doing so also promotes a positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance productivity of the undertakings. The concept of working culture is intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned. Such a culture is reflected in practice in the managerial systems, personnel policy, principles for participation, training policies and quality management of the undertaking."|Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework_bookshelf/english?content&amp;nd=857170174 |title=Occupational Health Services And Practice |publisher=Ilo.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Those in the field of occupational health come from a wide range of [[discipline (academia)|disciplines]] and professions including [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[physiotherapy]] and rehabilitation, [[occupational therapy]], [[occupational medicine]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], and many others. Professionals advise on a broad range of occupational health matters. These include how to avoid particular pre-existing conditions causing a problem in the occupation, correct posture for the work, frequency of rest breaks, preventative action that can be undertaken, and so forth.

"Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job.

==History==
[[File:Lewis Wickes Hines - Harry McShane 1908.jpg|right|thumb|Harry McShane, age 16, 1908. Pulled into machinery in a factory in [[Cincinnati]] and had his arm ripped off at the shoulder and his leg broken without any compensation.]]
The research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon. As [[labor movements]] arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as a labor-related issue.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Factory Acts]] of the early nineteenth century (from 1802 onwards) arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working in cotton mills: the Act of 1833 created a dedicated professional [[Factory inspector|Factory Inspectorate]].&lt;ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=B L|last2=Harrison|first2=A|title=A history of factory legislation by ;   Published 1911|date=1911|publisher=P S King &amp; Son|location=Westminster|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/factoryofhistory00hutcrich|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|41}}  The initial remit of the Inspectorate was to police restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young persons (introduced to prevent chronic overwork, identified as leading directly to ill-health and deformation, and indirectly to a high accident rate).  However, on the urging of the Factory Inspectorate, a further Act in 1844 giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry introduced a requirement for machinery guarding (but only in the textile industry, and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children).&lt;ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911/&gt; {{rp|85}}

In 1840 a [[Royal Commission]] published its findings on the state of conditions for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of accidents. The commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the Mines Act of 1842. The act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements, and by 1850, inspectors were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Account of the Founding of H.M.

[[Otto von Bismarck]] inaugurated the first social insurance legislation in 1883 and the first [[worker's compensation]] law in 1884 – the first of their kind in the Western world. Similar acts followed in other countries, partly in response to labor unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abrams|first=Herbert K.|title=A Short History of Occupational Health|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=34–80|url=http://cavcominc.com/uploads/files/History_OccHealth_Abrams.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2012 |doi=10.2307/3343553 |pmid=11382089 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace hazards==
{{main article|Occupational hazard}}

Although work provides many economic and other benefits, a wide array of workplace hazards also present risks to the health and safety of people at work. These include but are not limited to, "chemicals, biological agents, physical factors, adverse ergonomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of safety risks," and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;Concha-Barrientos, M., Imel, N.D., Driscoll, T., Steenland, N.K., Punnett, L., Fingerhut, M.A., Prüss-Üstün, A., Leigh, J., Tak, S.W., Corvalàn, C.

[[Physical hazard]]s affect many people in the workplace. Occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability.&lt;ref name="topic-noise2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|work = Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics|publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = 3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falling (accident)|Falls]] are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and maintenance.&lt;ref name="fall_topic2"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/falls/|title = Fall Injuries Prevention in the Workplace|work = NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machines have moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and other hazards with the potential to crush, [[burn]], [[Cutting|cut]], [[Shearing (physics)|shear]], [[Stabbing|stab]] or otherwise [[Impact force|strike]] or [[wound]] workers if used unsafely.&lt;ref name="topic-machine2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Machine Safety|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/machine/|work = NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher = National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = 11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological hazard]]s (biohazards) include infectious microorganisms such as viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as [[anthrax]]. Biohazards affect workers in many industries; [[influenza]], for example, affects a broad population of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Seasonal Influenza (Flu) in the Workplace - Guidance - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flu/guidance.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal bites and stings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Insects and Scorpions - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Venomous Snakes - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Venomous Spiders - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/spiders/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[urushiol]] from poisonous plants,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Poisonous Plants - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/plants/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and diseases transmitted through animals such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Lyme Disease - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - West Nile Virus - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/westnile/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care workers, including [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary health]] workers, risk exposure to [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogens]] and various infectious diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Veterinary Health Care: Biological Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/veterinary/biological.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Bloodborne Infectious Diseases - HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially those that are [[Emerging infectious disease|emerging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Emerging Infectious Diseases - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emerginfectdiseases/default.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerous chemicals can pose a [[Chemical hazards|chemical hazard]] in the workplace. There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Chemical Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chemical-safety/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities such as regulatory agencies set [[occupational exposure limit]]s to mitigate the risk of chemical hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IOHA - International OEL Issues and Activities|url = http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html|website = www.ioha.net|accessdate = 2015-09-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html|archivedate = 2015-08-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An international effort is investigating the health effects of mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals. This may be particularly important in causing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing the carcinogenic potential of low-dose exposures to chemical mixtures in the environment: the challenge ahead|journal = Carcinogenesis|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1460-2180|pmc = 4480130|pmid = 26106142|pages = S254–296|volume = 36 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgv039|first = William H.|last = Goodson|first2 = Leroy|last2 = Lowe|first3 = David O.|last3 = Carpenter|first4 = Michael|last4 = Gilbertson|first5 = Abdul|last5 = Manaf Ali|first6 = Adela|last6 = Lopez de Cerain Salsamendi|first7 = Ahmed|last7 = Lasfar|first8 = Amancio|last8 = Carnero|first9 = Amaya|last9 = Azqueta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychosocial hazard]]s include risks to the mental and emotional well-being of workers, such as feelings of job insecurity, long work hours, and poor work-life balance.&lt;ref name="euosha"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/reports/7807118|title = Expert forecast on emerging psychosocial risks related to occupational safety and health|date = 2007|accessdate = September 3, 2015|website = |publisher = European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|last = Brun|first = Emmanuelle|last2 = Milczarek|first2 = Malgorzata}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent [[Cochrane review]] - using moderate quality evidence - related that the addition of work-directed interventions for depressed workers receiving clinical interventions reduces the number of lost work days as compared to clinical interventions alone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006237.pub3/abstract|title = Interventions to improve return to work in depressed people|last = Nieuwenhuijsen|first = Karen|date = 1 Jan 2014|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006237.pub3|pmid = 25470301|access-date = 7 October 2015|volume=12|pages=CD006237}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review also demonstrated that the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to primary or occupational care and the addition of a "structured telephone outreach and care management program" to usual care are both effective at reducing sick leave days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== By industry ==
Specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. [[Construction]] workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of [[drowning]]. The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] identifies the [[commercial fishing|fishing]], [[aviation]], [[lumber]], [[metalworking]], [[agriculture]], [[mining]] and [[transportation]] industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers.&lt;ref name=bls-iif&gt;{{cite web |title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities 2010|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/|work=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly psychosocial risks such as [[workplace violence]] are more pronounced for certain occupational groups such as health care employees, police, correctional officers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Violence in the Workplace : OSH Answers|url = http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/violence.html|website = www.ccohs.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last = Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

[[File:China Constrcution Site Safety.jpg|thumb|Workplace safety notices at the entrance of a Chinese construction site.]]
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the [[United States]] and in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=niosh-topic&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/construction/|work=Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eurostat&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and safety at work statistics|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Health_and_safety_at_work_statistics|work=eurostat|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers.&lt;ref name=niosh-topic/&gt; [[falling (accident)|Falls]] are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.&lt;ref name=niosh-topic/&gt; Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.&lt;ref name=osha-campaign&gt;{{cite web |title=OSHA's Fall Prevention Campaign|url=https://www.osha.gov/stopfalls/|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and [[safety]] of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations.  For example, the role of the Construction Design Management (CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritas-consulting.co.uk/blog/health-and-safety-in-the-construction-industry/|title=Health and safety in the Construction Industry|date=11 March 2009|publisher=Veritas Consulting|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS) identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks. Among all U.S. workers in the construction sector, 44% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees) compared to 19% of all U.S. workers, 15% had temporary employment compared to 7% of all U.S. workers, and 55% experienced job insecurity compared to 32% of all U.S. workers. Prevalence rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed. Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction industry were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).&lt;ref name=nhis_construction&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Construction Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/construction.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
{{Main article|Agricultural safety and health}}[[File:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] tractor.]]
Agriculture workers are often at risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use or prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]]. The most common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which can be prevented by the use of [[roll over protection structures]] which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over.&lt;ref name="aginjury"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Nichole A.|last2=Spinelli|first2=John J.|last3=Gotay|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Teschke|first4=Kay|date=2018-07-03|title=Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=187–214|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734|pmid=30047858|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2013-02-15|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2012108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families, including children, commonly work alongside their families, agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among younger workers.&lt;ref name="NIOSH alert youth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-128/pdfs/2003128.PDF |title=NIOSH Alert: Preventing Deaths, Injuries, and Illnesses of Young Workers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Agri"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 NHIS-OHS found elevated prevalence rates of several occupational exposures in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector which may negatively impact health. These workers often worked long hours. The prevalence rate of working more than 48 hours a week among workers employed in these industries was 37%, and 24% worked more than 60 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumaraveloo|first=K Sakthiaseelan|last2=Lunner Kolstrup|first2=Christina|date=2018-07-03|title=Agriculture and musculoskeletal disorders in low- and middle-income countries|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–248|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1458671|pmid=30047854|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all workers in these industries, 85% frequently worked outdoors compared to 25% of all U.S. workers.

===Service sector===
{{see also|Service sector}}
As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[occupational stress]], [[workplace bullying]], and [[overwork]] in many countries have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, hazardous physical/chemical exposures in the service sector were lower than national averages. On the other hand, potentially harmful work organization characteristics and psychosocial workplace exposures were relatively common in this sector. Among all workers in the service industry, 30% experienced job insecurity in 2010, 27% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift), 21% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees).&lt;ref name=nhis_service&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Services Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/service.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the manual labour involved and on a per employee basis, the US Postal Service, UPS and FedEx are the 4th, 5th and 7th most dangerous companies to work for in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Owen|title=The USPS is an extremely dangerous place to work|url=https://theoutline.com/post/1836/the-usps-is-an-extremely-dangerous-place-to-work|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=[[The Outline (website)]]|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining and oil &amp; gas extraction===
{{see also |Mine safety}}
According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, workers employed in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had high prevalence rates of exposure to potentially harmful work organization characteristics and hazardous chemicals. Many of these workers worked long hours: 50% worked more than 48 hours a week and 25% worked more than 60 hours a week in 2010. Additionally, 42% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift). These workers also had high prevalence of exposure to physical/chemical hazards. In 2010, 39% had frequent skin contact with chemicals. Among nonsmoking workers, 28% of those in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had frequent exposure to [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] at work. About two-thirds were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes at work.&lt;ref name=nhis_mining&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Sectors Profile Page | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/mining.html | accessdate = July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare workers are exposed to many hazards that can adversely affect their health and well-being. Long hours, changing shifts, physically demanding tasks, violence, and exposures to infectious diseases and harmful chemicals are examples of hazards that put these workers at risk for illness and injury.

According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, U.S. hospitals recorded 253,700 work-related injuries and illnesses in 2011, which is 6.8 work-related injuries and illnesses for every 100 full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Facts About Hospital Worker Safety|publisher = Occupational Safety and Health Administration|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hospitals/documents/1.2_Factbook_508.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The injury and illness rate in hospitals is higher than the rates in construction and manufacturing – two industries that are traditionally thought to be relatively hazardous.

The Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/|title=CDC - Occupational Safety Health Network (OHSN)  - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. OHSN uses existing data to characterize risk of injury and illness among health care workers. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities.  NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities;&lt;ref&gt;See NPR series [https://www.npr.org/series/385540559/injured-nurses Injured Nurses] about patient handling risks&lt;/ref&gt; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.

{{Update|No info here from post-2015|date=March 2018}}
The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]] compiles information about workplace [[occupational fatality|fatalities]] and non-fatal injuries in the [[United States]]. In 1970, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job – by 2010, the workforce had doubled, but workplace deaths were down to about 4,500.&lt;ref name= AAO &gt;{{cite web|title=All About OSHA|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/all_about_OSHA.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Between 1913 and 2013, workplace fatalities dropped by approximately 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/04/26/wmd2013/ |title = WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 2013 |first = John |last = Howard |date = 26 April 2013 |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
In most countries males comprise the vast majority of workplace fatalities. In the EU as a whole, 94% of death were of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emhf.org/resource_images/Vienna_Declaration_Bgrd_Doc.pdf|title=The Vienna Declaration on the health of men and boys in Europe|publisher=European Men's Health Forum|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the disparity was even greater with males comprising 97.4% of workplace deaths. In the UK there were 171 fatal injuries at work in financial year 2011–2012, compared with 651 in calendar year 1974; the fatal injury rate declined over that period from 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 workers to 0.6 per 100,000 workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical picture : Trends in work-related injuries and ill health in Great Britain since the introduction of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) 1974|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/history/historical-picture.pdf|website=Health &amp; Safety Executive|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2014}} : of course the period saw the virtual disappearance from the UK of some historically risky industries (deep sea fishing, coal mining)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the USSR, the enterprises became owned by new owners who were not interested in preserving the life and health of workers.{{cn|date=September 2018}} They did not spend money on equipment modernization, and the share of harmful workplaces increased.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The state did not interfere in this, and sometimes it helped employers.{{cn|date=September 2018}} At first, the process of growth was slow - due to the fact that in the 1990s this was compensated by mass de-industrialization (factories with foundries and other harmful types of production were closed).{{cn|date=September 2018}} In the 2000s, this method of restraining the growth of the share of harmful workplaces was exhausted. Therefore, in 2010s the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Labor]] adopted the Federal law 426-FZ, which equated the issuance of [[Personal protective equipment|personal protective equipment]] to the employee to real improvement of working conditions; and the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]] made significant changes in the methods of risk assessment in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Chebotarev-2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chebotarev |first1=Alexander |title=Working environment and occupational morbidity of mine personnel |journal=Mining Industry Journal |date=January 2018 |issue=1 (137) |pages=92-95 |doi=10.30686/1609-9192-2018-1-137-92-95 |url=https://mining-media.ru/en/articleen/13414-working-environment-and-occupational-morbidity-of-mine-personnel |accessdate=18 October 2018 |publisher=Research and production company "Gemos limited" |location=Moscow |language=ru |issn=1609-9192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains the "decline" in the proportion of workers working in harmful conditions after 2014 - it happened not in practice, but only on paper.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Management systems==
===National===
National management system standards for occupational health and safety include AS/NZS 4801-2001 for Australia and New Zealand, CAN/CSA-Z1000-14 for Canada and ANSI/ASSE Z10-2012 for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standards.org.au/standards-catalogue/sa-snz/publicsafety/sf-001/as-slash-nzs--4801-2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cos-mag.com/safety-leadership-culture/columns/iso-45001-is-now-available-are-you-considering-it/ |title=ISO 45001 is now available — are you considering it? |last=Pozniak |first=Eldeen |date=13 March 2018 |website=Canadian HR Reporter |publisher=Thomson Reuters Canada Limited |access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AFNOR|Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR)]] in France also developed occupational safety and health management standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pun K.-F. |author2=Yam R.C.M. |author3=Lewis W.G. | year = 2003 | title = Safety management system registration in the shipping industry | url = | journal = International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 704–721 | doi=10.1108/02656710310482140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, non-departmental public body [[Health and Safety Executive]] published Managing for health and safety (MFHS), an online guidance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.actassociates.co.uk/news-view.asp?ID=451&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the state factory inspectorates of Bavaria and Saxony had introduced the management system OHRIS. In the Netherlands, the management system Safety Certificate Contractors combines management of occupational health and safety and the environment.

===International===
[[ISO 45001]] was published in March 2018.

Previously, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) published ILO-OSH 2001, also titled "Guidelines on occupational safety and health management systems" to assist organizations with introducing OSH management systems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems|publisher = ILO-OSH|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Geneva|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines encourage continual improvement in employee health and safety, achieved via a constant process of policy, organization, planning &amp; implementation, evaluation, and action for improvement, all supported by constant auditing to determine the success of OSH actions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 1999 to 2018, the occupational health and safety management system standard [[OHSAS 18001]] was adopted as a British and Polish standard and widely used internationally. OHSAS 18000 comprised two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard existed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was intended to integrate with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/Assessment-and-certification-services/management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BSOHSAS-18001/ |title=BS OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety |publisher=BSI Group |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National legislation and public organizations==
{{Main article|List of occupational safety and health agencies}}

Occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for compliance. In the EU, for example, some member states promote OSH by providing public monies as subsidies, grants or financing, while others have created tax system incentives for OSH investments. A third group of EU member states has experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for companies or organisations with strong OSH records.&lt;ref&gt;See European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2004): “Effectiveness of economic incentives to improve occupational safety and health”, Forum # 14, Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISBN|92-9191-119-4}}, http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/14/view or Elsler, D.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the Commonwealth, four of the six states and both territories have enacted and administer harmonised Work Health and Safety Legislation in accordance with the ''Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/node/276|title=Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety {{!}} Council of Australian Governments (COAG)|website=www.coag.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these jurisdictions has enacted Work Health &amp; Safety legislation and regulations based on the Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and common Codes of Practice developed by [[Safe Work Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/model-whs-laws/pages/model-whs-laws|title=Model work health and safety laws - Safe Work Australia|website=www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions have also included mine safety under the model approach, however, most have retained separate legislation for the time being. Western Australia intends to adopt a moderated version of the model approach and Victoria has retained its own regime, although the Model WHS laws themselves drew heavily on the Victoria approach.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation (including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work. The [[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]] (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada, was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief that all Canadians had "...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment." CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses.  The CCOHS maintains a useful (partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/legislation/fulllist.html|title=CCOHS: Web Information Service: Canadian enviroOSH Legislation plus Standards|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], [[member state]]s have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met. In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved [[productivity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]]). In 1996, the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] was founded.

Member states of the [[European Union]] have all transposed into their national legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on occupational health and safety. These directives (of which there are about 20 on a variety of topics) follow a similar structure requiring the employer to assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]. This hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and ends with [[personal protective equipment]].

However, certain EU member states admit to having lacking quality control in occupational safety services, to situations in which risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly surprising that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 2-4 of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2001): "Quality of Work ‘A future Community strategy for safety and health at work’, FORUM # 1, downloadable from: http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/1/view.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siden kan ikke findes|url = http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/Integration/online_danish/working_in_denmark/occupational_safety_and_health_at_the_workplace/how_a_good_working_environment_is_secured_in_denmark.htm|website = www.nyidanmark.dk|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Working Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work.&lt;ref&gt;English web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority, http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/en/engelsk/wea.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public, current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection, should they wish to do so.&lt;ref&gt;The inspection results can be found from the main page of the Danish Working Environment Authority at: http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/da/ under the heading "Smiley Status". See also http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/en/engelsk/inspection/smiley-26-6-07.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In [[Spain]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Spanish Act on Prevention of Labour Risks. The Ministry of Employment and Social Security is the authority responsible for issues relating to labour environment.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Employment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Employment and Social Security: Home page|url=http://www.empleo.gob.es/en/index.htm|website=www.empleo.gob.es|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute for Labour Safety and Hygiene is the technical public Organization specialized in occupational safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instituto Nacional de Seguridad e Higiene en el Trabajo (INSHT)|url=http://www.insht.es/portal/site/Insht/|website=www.insht.es|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the [http://www.av.se/inenglish/lawandjustice/workact/ Work Environment Act]. The [[Swedish Work Environment Authority]] is the [[government agency]] responsible for issues relating to the working environment.

In the [[UK]], health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] and local authorities (the local council) under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (1974.c37)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety Executive (2009): A Guide to Safety and Health Regulation in Great Britain. 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-0-7176-6319-4}}, http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web42.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; (HASAWA).  HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment).  The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated.&lt;ref&gt;see Second Reading debate - {{cite journal|title=HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC.

Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.

For the UK, the government organisation dealing with occupational health has been the [[Employment Medical Advisory Service]] but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation - the [[Health and Work Service]] - was created to provide advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on long-term sick-leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26105246|title=New Health and Work Service to get long-term sick back to work|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service, funded by government, will offer medical assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term absence from their employer; in return, the government will no longer foot the bill for [[Statutory Sick Pay]] provided by the employer to the individual.

===India===
In [[India]], the Labour Ministry formulates national policies on occupational safety and health in factories and docks with advice and assistance from Directorate General of Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), and enforces its Policies through inspectorates of factories and inspectorates of dock safety.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgfasli.nic.in/about1.htm|title=About DGFASLI- Directorate General, Factory Advice service and Labour Institutes|website=www.dgfasli.nic.in|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGFASLI is the technical arm of the Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment, Government of India and advises the factories on various problems concerning safety, health, efficiency and well - being of the persons at work places.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The DGFASLI provides technical support in formulating rules, conducting occupational safety surveys and also for conducting occupational safety training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL3_1JyReisC|title=Challenges of Occupational Safety and Health: Thrust : Safety in Transportation|last=Chaturvedi|first=Pradeep|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180692840|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], the [[Cabinet of Indonesia|Ministry of Manpower]] is responsible to ensure the safety, health and welfare of workers while working, in a factory, or even the area surrounding the factory where labourers work. There are a few rules that control the safety of workers, for example Occupational Safety Act 1970 or Occupational Health Act 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gajimu.com/pekerjaan-yanglayak/keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja/pertanyaan-mengenai-keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja-di-indonesia-1|title=Pertanyaan mengenai Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja di Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The sanctions, however, are still low and the violations of these laws are still at a high rate - with a maximum of 15 million rupiahs fine and/or a maximum of 1 year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xperthr.co.uk/international-manual/indonesia-health-and-safety/155684/|title=Indonesia Health and Safety|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
In [[Malaysia]], the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under the Ministry of Human Resource is responsible to ensure that the safety, health and welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld. DOSH is responsible to enforce the Factories and Machinery Act 1967 and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994]].

=== People's Republic of China ===
[[File:Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment, etc - 02.jpg|thumb|Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment]]
In the [[People's Republic of China]], the Ministry of Health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the State Administration of Work Safety for safety issues at work. On the provincial and municipal level, there are Health Supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of Work Safety for safety. The "Occupational Disease Control Act of PRC" came into force on May 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Occupational Disease Control Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/01/content_19003.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Work safety Act of PRC on November 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"The Work Safety Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/ztzl/2006-05/27/content_292725.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Occupational Disease Control Act is under revision. The prevention of occupational disease is still in its initial stage compared with industrialised countries such as the US or UK.

=== Singapore ===
In [[Singapore]], the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] operates various checks and campaigns against unsafe work practices, such as when working at height, operating cranes and in traffic management. Examples include Operation Cormorant and the Falls Prevention Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/more-workers-die-in-falls-from-height|title=More workers die in falls from height|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the Department of Labour is responsible for occupational health and safety inspection and enforcement in commerce and industry apart from mining and energy production, where the Department of Mineral Resources is responsible.

The main statutory legislation on Health and Safety in the jurisdiction of the Department of Labour is ''Act No. 85 of 1993: Occupational Health and Safety Act as amended by Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act, No. 181 Of 1993.''

Regulations to the OHS Act include:

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] of the [[Ministry of Labor (Taiwan)|Ministry of Labor]] is in charge of occupational safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction|url = http://www.osha.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&amp;ids=329|website = Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Ministry of Labour|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is governed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Occupational Safety and Health Act|url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=N0060001|website = Laws &amp; Regulations Database of the Republic of China|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
[[OSHAD]] was introduced in February 2010 to regulate the implementation of occupational health and safety in the emirates of Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oshad.ae/en/Pages/Aboutcenter.aspx|title=Pages - About Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], President [[Richard Nixon]] signed the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] into law on December 29, 1970. The act created the three agencies that administer it. They include the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], and the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Della-Giustina, Daniel E. (2000). Developing a Safety and Health Program, New York: Lewis Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to regulate private employers in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories.&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Retrieved on November 28, 2003, from http://www.osha.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The Act establishing it includes a [[general duty clause]] (29 U.S.C. § 654, 5(a)) requiring an employer to comply with the Act and regulations derived from it, and to provide employees with "employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees."

OSHA was established in 1971 under the Department of Labor. It has headquarters in Washington, DC and ten regional offices, further broken down into districts, each organized into three sections; compliance, training, and assistance. Its stated mission is ''to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OSHA|url=https://www.osha.gov/about.html|website=OSHA|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was for OSHA to oversee 50 state plans with OSHA funding 50% of each plan. Unfortunately it has not worked out that way. 
There are currently 26 approved state plans (4 cover only public employees)&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt; and no other states want to participate. OSHA manages the plan in the states not participating.&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;

OSHA develops safety standards in the Code of Federal Regulation and enforces those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by Compliance Officers; enforcement resources are focussed on high-hazard industries. Worksites may apply to enter OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); a successful application leads to an on-site inspection ; if this is passed the site gains VPP status and OSHA no longer inspect it annually nor (normally) visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until VPP revalidation (after 3–5 years)&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;(VPP sites have injury and illness rates less than half the average for their industry).

It has 73 specialists in local offices to provide tailored information and training to employers and employees at little or no cost&lt;ref name="Fanning"/&gt; Similarly OSHA produces a range of publications, provides advice to employers and funds consultation services available for small businesses.

OSHA's Alliance Program enables groups committed to worker safety and health to work with it to develop compliance assistance tools and resources, share information with workers and employers, and educate them about their rights and responsibilities. OSHA also has a Strategic Partnership Program that zeros in on specific hazards or specific geographic areas.&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;
OSHA manages Susan B. Harwood grants to nonprofit companies to train workers and employers to recognize, avoid, and prevent safety and health hazards in the workplace. Grants focus on small business, hard-to-reach workers and high-hazard industries.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], created under the same act, works closely with OSHA and provides the research behind many of OSHA's regulations and standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about/|title=CDC - NIOSH - About NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional roles and responsibilities==
The roles and responsibilities of OSH professionals vary regionally, but may include evaluating working environments, developing, endorsing and encouraging measures that might prevent injuries and illnesses, providing OSH information to employers, employees, and the public, providing medical examinations, and assessing the success of worker health programs.

===Europe===
In Norway, the main required tasks of an occupational health and safety practitioner include the following:
* Systematic evaluations of the working environment
* Endorsing preventative measures which eliminate causes of illnesses in the workplace
* Providing information on the subject of employees’ health
* Providing information on occupational hygiene, ergonomics, and environmental and safety risks in the workplace&lt;ref&gt;Hale A, Ytehus I, 2004, ‘Changing requirements for the safety profession:  roles and tasks’, Journal of Occupational Health &amp; Safety – Australia and New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, the required tasks for health and safety staff are only summarily defined and include the following:
* Providing voluntary medical examinations
* Providing a consulting room on the work environment to the workers
* Providing health assessments (if needed for the job concerned)&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"&gt;Hale, A et alia.  2004&lt;/ref&gt;

‘The main influence of the Dutch law on the job of the safety professional is through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified working conditions service to advise them on health and safety’.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;  A ‘certified service’ must employ sufficient numbers of four types of certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the service:
* A safety professional
* An occupational hygienist
* An occupational physician
* A work and organisation specialist.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;

In 2004, 37% of health and safety practitioners in Norway and 14% in the Netherlands had an MSc; 44% had a BSc in Norway and 63% in the Netherlands; and 19% had training as an OSH technician in Norway and 23% in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;

===US===
[[File:Occupational Safety Equipment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Leather craftsman gloves, safety goggles, and a properly fitted hardhat are crucial for proper safety in a construction environment.]]
The main tasks undertaken by the OHS practitioner in the US include:
* Develop processes, procedures, criteria, requirements, and methods to attain the best possible management of the hazards and exposures that can cause injury to people, and damage property, or the environment;
* Apply good business practices and economic principles for efficient use of resources to add to the importance of the safety processes;
* Promote other members of the company to contribute by exchanging ideas and other different approaches to make sure that every one in the corporation possess OHS knowledge and have functional roles in the development and execution of safety procedures;
* Assess services, outcomes, methods, equipment, workstations, and procedures by using qualitative and quantitative methods to recognise the hazards and measure the related risks;
* Examine all possibilities, effectiveness, reliability, and expenditure to attain the best results for the company concerned&lt;ref&gt;Board of Certified Safety Professionals, 2012, "Safety Fundamentals" and "Comprehensive Practice" blueprints, accessed 17 February at http://www.bcsp.org/csp&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge required by the OHS professional in the US include:
* Constitutional and case law controlling safety, health, and the environment
* Operational procedures to plan/develop safe work practices
* Safety, health and environmental sciences
* Design of hazard control systems (i.e.  fall protection, scaffoldings)
* Design of recordkeeping systems that take collection into account, as well as storage, interpretation, and dissemination
* Mathematics and statistics
* Processes and systems for attaining safety through design&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Board of Certified Safety Professionals, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skills required by the OHS professional in the US include (but are not limited to):
* Understanding and relating to systems, policies and rules
* Holding checks and having control methods for possible hazardous exposures
* Mathematical and statistical analysis
* Examining manufacturing hazards
* Planning safe work practices for systems, facilities, and equipment
* Understanding and using safety, health, and environmental science information for the improvement of procedures
* Interpersonal communication skills&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Differences between countries and regions==
Because different countries take different approaches to ensuring occupational safety and health, areas of OSH need and focus also vary between countries and regions. Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found that there is a need to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous.  2008.  ‘Occupational Health’, Health and Safety News:  In Brief, Vol 60, Iss. 3;  UK.  pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, in Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation.  However, in some other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: “Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Paton, Nic.  2008.  ‘Senior Managers Fail to Show Competence in Health and Safety’ Occupational Health, Vol. 60, Iss. 3; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying safety and health hazards==

===Hazards, risks, outcomes===
The terminology used in OSH varies between countries, but generally speaking:
* A [[hazard]] is something that can cause harm if not controlled.
* The outcome is the harm that results from an uncontrolled hazard.
* A [[risk]] is a combination of the probability that a particular outcome will occur and the severity of the harm involved.&lt;ref name="Risk basic definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=www.riskmanagementinsight.com|url=http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|archivedate=18 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Hazard”, “risk”, and “outcome” are used in other fields to describe e.g. environmental damage, or damage to equipment. However, in the context of OSH, “harm” generally describes the direct or indirect degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-being of workers. For example, repetitively carrying out [[manual handling]] of heavy objects is a hazard. The outcome could be a [[Musculoskeletal disorders|musculoskeletal disorder]] (MSD) or an acute back or joint injury.  The risk can be expressed numerically (e.g. a 0.5 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in relative terms (e.g. "high/medium/low"), or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme (e.g. situation-specific risks).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Hazard identification===
Hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are "acceptable risks" in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öztaş|first=Dilek|last2=Kurt|first2=Burak|last3=Koç|first3=Ayşegül|last4=Akbaba|first4=Muhsin|date=2018-07-03|title=Living Conditions, Access to Healthcare Services, and Occupational Health and Safety Conditions of Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Workers in the Çukurova Region|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470048|pmid=30047859|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept "satisfactory" – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.

===Risk assessment===
{{Further information|Risk assessment#Risk assessment }}
Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a [[risk assessment]] be carried out prior to making an intervention. It should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

This assessment should:
* Identify the hazards
* Identify all affected by the hazard and how
* Evaluate the risk
* Identify and prioritize appropriate control measures{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or [[probability]] of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences. This can be expressed mathematically as a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] assessment (by assigning low, medium and high likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a [[risk factor]]), or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the harm could arise.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices. The assessment should include practical recommendations to control the risk. Once recommended controls are implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine if it has been lowered to an acceptable level. Generally speaking, newly introduced controls should lower risk by one level, i.e., from high to medium or from medium to low.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, epubli, Berlin, 3rd edition 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-7418-7478-9}}, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary developments==
On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments in developing nations with projects such as [[Healthy city|Healthy Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;Swuste, P., Eijkemans, G. "Occupational safety, health, and hygiene in the urban informal sector of Sub-Saharan Africa: An application of the prevention and control exchange (PACE) program to the..." International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. Abel Publications Services Inc. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. As a 2007 Factsheet from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states: "Countries with less developed OSH systems spend a far higher percentage of GDP on work-related injury and illness – taking resources away from more productive activities&amp;nbsp;... The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU."&lt;ref&gt;European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2007): Facts 76/EN National economics and occupational safety and health. Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISSN|1681-2123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future.

===Nanotechnology===
{{See also|Health implications of nanotechnology}}

[[File:Nano containment hood.PNG|thumb|right|A nanomaterial containment hood, an example of an engineering control used to protect workers handling them on a regular basis.]]
[[Nanotechnology]] is an example of a new, relatively unstudied technology. A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires.  Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationsgesellschaft.ch/images/fremde_publikationen/Nature_Public_concern.pdf|title=Risks and nanotechnology: the public is more concerned than experts and industry|year=2007|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex.  The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective.  The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter.  As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance.  This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=1781.php |title=Nanotechnology risks – the real issues |doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.10.005 |publisher=Nanowerk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational Health Disparities===
'''Occupational health disparities''' refer to differences in occupational injuries and illnesses that are closely linked with demographic, social, cultural, economic, and/or political factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/ohd/risks.html|title=CDC - NIOSH Program Portfolio : Occupational Health Disparities : Risks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The [[University of Southern California]] was one of the first schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the [[Indiana State University]] who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the [[University of North Carolina]]'s online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often don’t have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the [[University of Connecticut]]'s online OSH Certificate,&lt;ref name="UConn Credit Online OSH Certificate"&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Connecticut Online OSH Certificate|url=http://osh.uconn.edu|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].
In Australia, training in OSH is available at the vocational education and training level, and at university undergraduate and postgraduate level. Such university courses may be accredited by an Accreditation Board of the Safety Institute of Australia. The Institute has produced a Body of Knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsbok.org.au/|title=The OHS Body of Knowledge|last=Knowledge|first=The OHS Body of|website=www.ohsbok.org.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it considers is required by a generalist safety and health professional, and offers a professional qualification based on a four-step assessment.

'''Road curves''' are regular bends in [[roads]] to bring a gradual change of direction. Similar curves are on [[railways]] and [[canals]].

Curves provided in the horizontal plane are known as horizontal curves and are generally circular or parabolic.

Four types of circular curves are on roads:
* Simple curve
* Compound curve
* Reverse or serpentine curve
* Deviation curve

==Simple curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-57.jpg|thumb|Diagram of simple curve]]
A simple curve has the same [[radius]] throughout and is a single [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[circle]], with two [[tangent]]s meeting at the intersection (B in this diagram).

==Compound curve==
[[File:Road curve 2014-08-18 12-16.jpg|thumb|Diagram of compound curve]]
A compound curve has two or more simple curves with different radii that bend the same way and are on the same side of a common tangent. In this diagram, MN is the common tangent.

==Reverse curve==
{{main article|Reverse curve}}
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-52.jpg|thumb|Diagram of reverse curve]]
Also called a serpentine curve, it is the reverse of a compound curve, and two simple curves bent in opposite directions are on opposite sides of the common tangent.

==Deviation curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-19.jpg|thumb|Diagram of deviation curve]]
A deviation curve is simply a combination of two reverse curves. It is used when it is necessary to deviate from a given straight path to avoid intervening obstructions such as a building, a body of water, or other significant site.

{{Campaignbox Rojava Revolution}}

The '''Rojava conflict''', also known as the '''Rojava revolution''', is a political upheaval and military conflict taking place in Northern Syria, known among Kurdish nationalists as '''Western Kurdistan''' or '''Rojava'''. During the [[Syrian Civil War]] from 2012, a Kurdish-dominated coalition led by the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] as well as some other Kurdish, Arab, Syriac-Assyrian and Turkmen groups have sought to establish a new [[Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|constitution]] for the ''de facto'' autonomous region, while military wings and allied militias have fought to maintain control of the region. This led to the establishment of the [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] (DFNS) in 2016. The supporters of the DFNS argues that the events constitute a [[social revolution]]&lt;ref name=secular-utopia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enzinna|first1=Wes|title=A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html?_r=0|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a prominent role played by women both on the battlefield and within the newly formed political system, as well as the implementation of [[democratic confederalism]], a form of [[libertarian socialism]] which emphasizes decentralization, gender equality and the need for local governance through [[semi-direct democracy]].

==Background==
{{Further information|Kurds in Syria|Rojava}}
[[File:Kurds Caught in Throes of Syrias War.ogv|thumb|left|thumbtime=2:06|2013 [[VOA]] report about the Kurdish situation in Syria]]
The area is strategically important, because it contains a large percentage of Syria's oil supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=[[CIA]] |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State discrimination===
{{Further information|Human rights in Syria}}
Repression of the Kurds and other ethnic minorities has gone on since the creation of the [[French Mandate of Syria]] after the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]].&lt;ref name="remmm.revues.org"&gt;
{{cite web

  |publisher=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Syrian government (officially known as the [[Syrian Arab Republic]]) never officially acknowledged the existence of the Kurds&lt;ref name="remmm.revues.org"/&gt; and in 1962 120,000 Syrian Kurds were stripped of their citizenship, leaving them [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=hrw-silenced-kurds&gt;

  |website=Human Rights Watch
  |publisher=Human Rights Watch
  |accessdate=28 November 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kurdish language]] and culture have also been suppressed. The government attempted to resolve these issues in 2011 by granting all Kurds citizenship, but only an estimated 6,000 out of 150,000 stateless Kurds have been given nationality and most discriminatory regulations, including the ban on teaching Kurdish, are still on the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minority Kurds struggle for recognition in Syrian revolt|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Mar-31/168622-minority-kurds-struggle-for-recognition-in-syrian-revolt.ashx#axzz21XpGFIlr|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star Lebanon|date=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, the government is no longer in a position to enforce these laws.

===Qamishli uprising===
{{Further information|2004 Qamishli riots}}
In 2004, [[2004 Qamishli riots|riots broke out]] against the government in the northeastern city of [[Qamishli]]. During a soccer match between a local Kurdish team and a visiting Arab team from [[Deir ez-Zor]], some Arab fans brandished portraits of [[Saddam Hussein]] (who slaughtered tens of thousands of Kurds in [[Southern Kurdistan]] during the genocidal [[Al-Anfal campaign]] in the 1980s). Tensions quickly escalated into open protests, with Kurds raising [[Flag of Kurdistan|their flag]] and taking to the streets to demand cultural and political rights. Security forces fired into the crowd, killing six Kurds, including three children. Protesters went on to burn down the Ba'ath Party's local office. At least 30 and as many as 100 Kurds were killed by the government before the protests were quelled.  Thousands of Kurds fled to Iraq afterwards, where a refugee camp was established. Occasional clashes between Kurdish protesters and government forces occurred in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;

==The path to self-governed Rojava==

===Syrian Civil War===
[[File:Demonstration in Qamishli against the Syrian government.jpg|thumb|Kurds, Assyrians, and Arabs demonstrate against the [[Syrian government]] in [[Qamishli]], 6 January 2012]]
In 2011, the [[Arab Spring]] spread to Syria. Similar to the beginning of the [[Tunisian revolution]], Syrian citizen Hasan Ali Akleh soaked himself in gasoline and set himself on fire in the northern city of [[Al-Hasakah]]. This inspired activists to call for a "Day of Rage", which ended up being sparsely attended, mostly because of fear of repression from the Syrian government. Days later, however, protests again took place, this time in response to the police beating of a shopkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iddon|first1=Paul|title=A recap of the Syrian crisis to date|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/329590|accessdate=17 April 2016|agency=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller protests continued, but it was on 7 March 2011, when thirteen political prisoners went on hunger strike, that momentum began to grow against the Assad government.

Protests grew over the months of March and April 2011. The Assad government attempted to appease Kurds by promising to grant citizenship to thousands of Kurds, who until that time had been stripped of any legal status.&lt;ref name=aljaz2Apr11&gt;{{Cite news |title=Many arrested in Syria after protests |publisher=Al Jazeera | url= http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/20114211257594538.html |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer, protests had only intensified, as did violent crackdowns by the Syrian government.

In August, a coalition of opposition groups formed the [[Syrian National Council]] in hopes of creating a democratic, pluralistic alternative to the Assad government. However, internal fighting and disagreement over politics and inclusion plagued the group from its early beginnings. In the fall of 2011 the popular uprising escalated to an armed conflict. The [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) began to coalesce and armed insurrection spread, largely across the central and southern parts of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Syrian rebels|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24403003|website=BBC News|accessdate=30 March 2017|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish parties negotiate===

The National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, a coalition of Syria's 12 Kurdish parties, boycotted a Syrian opposition summit in [[Antalya]], Turkey on 31 May 2011, stating that "any such meeting held in Turkey can only be a detriment to the Kurds in Syria, because Turkey is against the aspirations of the Kurds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Yoshie|last=Furuhashi |url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/kb010611.html |title=Syrian Kurdish Parties Boycott Syrian Opposition Conference in Antalya, Turkey |work=Monthly Review|date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the August summit in [[Istanbul]], which led to the creation of the [[Syrian National Council]], only two of the parties in the National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, the [[Kurdish Union Party]] and the [[Kurdish Freedom Party]], attended the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/3941.html |title=Most Syrian Kurdish Parties Boycott Opposition Gathering |work=Rudaw |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917033604/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/3941.html |archivedate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-[[Syrian government|government]] protests had been ongoing in the Kurdish-inhabited areas of Syria since March 2011, as part of the wider [[2011–2012 Syrian uprising|Syrian uprising]], but clashes started after the opposition [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Kurdish Democratic Union Party]] (PYD) and [[Kurdish National Council]] (KNC) signed a seven-point agreement on 11 June 2012 in [[Erbil]] under the auspice of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] president [[Massoud Barzani]]. This agreement, however, failed to be implemented and so a new cooperation agreement between the two sides was signed on 12 July which saw the creation of the [[Kurdish Supreme Committee]] as a governing body of all Kurdish-controlled territories in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Kurds Try to Maintain Unity |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4964.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=17 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012730/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4964.html |archivedate=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria: Massive protests in Qamishli, Homs |url= http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20110519/103075.shtml|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=[[CNTV]]|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Kurdish Official: Now Kurds are in Charge of their Fate |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/5010.html |accessdate=30 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=27 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801020239/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/5010.html |archivedate=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===YPG claims territory===
The [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) entered the conflict by capturing the city of [[Kobanî]] on 19 July 2012, followed by the capture of [[Amuda]] and [[Afrin, Syria|Efrîn]] on 20 July.&lt;ref name=liberated&gt;{{cite news|title=More Kurdish Cities Liberated As Syrian Army Withdraws from Area |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/4978.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721142617/http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/4978.html |archivedate=21 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities fell without any major clashes, as Syrian security forces withdrew without any significant resistance.&lt;ref name=liberated/&gt; The Syrian Army pulled out to fight elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8A619520121107?irpc=932 |title=After quiet revolt, power struggle looms for Syria's Kurds |publisher=Mobile.reuters.com |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KNC and PYD afterwards formed a joint leadership council to run the captured cities.

The YPG forces continued with their advancement and on 21 July captured [[Al-Malikiyah]] ({{lang-ku|Dêrika Hemko}}), which is located 10 kilometers from the Turkish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City of Derik taken by Kurds in Northeast Syria|url=http://en.firatnews.com/index.php?rupel=article&amp;nuceID=4957|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=Firat news|date=21 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802071420/http://en.firatnews.com/index.php?rupel=article&amp;nuceID=4957|archivedate=2 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels at the time also intended to capture [[Qamishli]], the largest Syrian city with a Kurdish majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban: Syrian regime 'failed to protect civilians'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/21/world/meast/syria-unrest/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Syrian government attacked a patrol of Kurdish YPG members and wounded one fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clashes between Kurds and Syrian army in the Kurdish city of Qamişlo, Western Kurdistan|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2012/7/syriakurd542.htm|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=Ekurd.net|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day it was reported that Kurdish forces were still fighting for Al-Malikiyah, where one young Kurdish activist was killed after government security forces opened fire on protesters. The YPG also took control over the towns of [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah|Ra's al-'Ayn]] ({{lang-ku|Serê Kaniyê}}) and [[Al-Darbasiyah]] ({{lang-ku|Dirbêsî}}), after the security and political units withdrew from these areas, following an ultimatum issued by the Kurds. On the same day, clashes erupted in Qamishli between YPG and government forces in which one Kurdish fighter was killed and two were wounded along with one government official.&lt;ref name=casualties&gt;{{cite news|title=Armed Kurds Surround Syrian Security Forces in Qamishli |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4984.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=22 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724224808/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4984.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease with which Kurdish forces captured the towns and the government troops pulled back was speculated to be due to the government reaching an agreement with the Kurds so military forces from the area could be freed up to engage opposition forces in the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting in Syria indicates Bashar Assad's end isn't imminent |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/07/23/3400914/fighting-in-syria-indicates-bashar.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Charlotteobserver.com |date=23 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July, the PYD announced that Syrian security forces withdrew from the small Kurdish city of 16,000 of [[Al-Ma'bada]] ({{lang-ku|Girkê Legê}}), located between Al-Malikiyah and the Turkish borders.

===Self-governed Rojava established===
{{Main|Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}

On 1 August 2012, Assad forces on the periphery of the country were pulled into the intensifying conflict taking place in [[Aleppo]]. During this large withdrawal from the north, the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG), a pro-Kurdish militia that formed after the [[2004 Qamishli riots]],&lt;ref name=meet-ypg&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the YPG|url=https://www.vice.com/read/meet-the-ypg|website=Vice News|publisher=Vice News|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; took control of at least parts of [[Qamishlo]], [[Efrin]], [[Amude]], [[Terbaspi]] and [[Ayn El Arab]] with very little conflict or casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies |first=Wyre |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19021766 |title=Crisis in Syria emboldens country's Kurds |publisher=BBC News|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2012, the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change]] announced that most Kurdish-majority cities in Syria, with the exception of [[Qamishli]] and [[Hasaka]], were no longer controlled by government forces and were now being governed by Kurdish political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://syrianncb.org/2012/08/02/pyd-press-release-a-call-for-support-and-protection-of-the-peaceful-establishment-the-self-governed-syrian-kurdish-region/ |title=PYD Press Release: A call for support and protection of the peaceful establishment, the self-governed Rojava region &amp;#124; هيئة التنسيق الوطنية لقوى التغيير الديمقراطي |publisher=Syrianncb.org |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915073042/http://syrianncb.org/2012/08/02/pyd-press-release-a-call-for-support-and-protection-of-the-peaceful-establishment-the-self-governed-syrian-kurdish-region/ |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Qamishli, government military and police forces remained in their barracks and administration officials in the city allowed the [[Kurdish flag]] to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petercliffordonline.com/syria/ |title=Syria – News |publisher=Peter Clifford Online |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month, the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) successfully bombed the government's intelligence center in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2012/8/syriakurd594.htm#.UDCwArn2HQg.twitter |title=Explosion at intelligence center in Qamishli, Syrian Kurdistan |publisher=Ekurd.net |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After months of de facto rule, the PYD officially announced its regional autonomy on 9 January 2014. Elections were held, popular assemblies established and the [[Constitution of Rojava]] was approved. Since then, residents have been organizing local assemblies, re-opening schools, establishing community centers and pushing back the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) to gain control of further territory. They see their model of grassroots democracy as a model that can be implemented throughout Syria in the future.

==Social revolution==
{{Further|Human rights in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}
{{Libertarian socialism| Significant events}}
[[File:Kurdish YPG Fighters (15943141741).jpg|thumb|Male and female members of the [[Asayish (DFNS regions)|Asayish]] police force]]
After declaring autonomy, grassroots organizers, politicians and other community members have radically changed the social and political make-up of the area. The extreme laws restricting independent political organizing,  women's freedom, religious and cultural expression and the discriminatory policies carried out by the Assad government have been superseded. In their place, a [[Constitution of Rojava]] guaranteeing the cultural, religious and political freedom of all people has been established. The constitution also explicitly states the equal rights and freedom of women and also "mandates public institutions to work towards the elimination of gender discrimination".&lt;ref name="secular-utopia"/&gt;

The political and social changes taking place in Rojava have in large part been inspired by the [[libertarian socialist]] politics of Kurdish leader [[Abdullah Öcalan]].&lt;ref name=secular-utopia/&gt;

===Cooperative economy===
The Rojava economy is a blend of private companies, the autonomous administration and [[worker cooperative]]s. Since the revolution, efforts have been made to transition the economy to one of self-sufficiency based on worker and producer cooperatives. This transition faces the major obstacles of ongoing conflict and an embargo from all neighboring countries: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and the various forces controlling nearby areas of Syria. This has forced people to rely almost exclusively on diesel-run generators for electricity. Additionally, strong emphasis is being placed on businesses that can bring about self-sufficiency to the region.

There are no required taxes in Rojava.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cooperativeeconomy.info/the-economy-of-rojava/|title=The Economy of Rojava|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the administration funds itself through the sale of oil and border commerce (which is clandestine because of the embargo). There are partnerships that have been created between private companies and the administration. The administration also funds the school system and distributes bread to all citizens at a below-market rate.&lt;ref name="Rojava's Threefold Economy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rojava's Threefold Economy |url=http://kurdishquestion.com/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/rojava-s-threefold-economy/675-rojava-s-threefold-economy.html |accessdate=3 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152441/http://kurdishquestion.com/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/rojava-s-threefold-economy/675-rojava-s-threefold-economy.html# |archive-date=22 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Movement for a Democratic Society]] Economic Committee has been helping businesses move towards a "community economy" based on worker cooperatives and self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="Rojava's Threefold Economy"/&gt;

Cooperatives first formed in the agricultural and infrastructure sectors. In the [[Jazira Canton]] there are 18 agricultural cooperatives, 12 general co-ops and six women-run co-ops.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumbnail|right|Syrians sewing garments in a worker cooperative]]
Other cooperatives involve bottled mineral water, construction, factories, fuel stations, generators, livestock, oil, pistachio and roasted seeds, and public markets.

Additionally there are several agricultural communes with families collectively working the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Experience of Co-operative Societies in Rojava|url=http://www.pasewan.com/English/Detail.aspx?Jimare=161|accessdate=17 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309104252/http://www.pasewan.com/English/Detail.aspx?Jimare=161|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct democracy===
The Rojava Cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils. District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents- one man and one woman. District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection, land distribution and cooperative enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tax |first1=Meredith |title=The Revolution in Rojava |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-revolution-in-rojava|publisher=Dissent Magazin|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil councils exist to promote social and political rights in the community.

===Ethnic minority rights===
Closely related to religious freedom and the protection of religious minorities is the protection of ethnic minorities. Kurds now have the right to study their language freely, as do Assyrians. For the first time, a Kurdish curriculum has been introduced to the public school system.

Residents are also now free to express their culture freely. Culture and music centers have formed, hosting dance classes, music lessons and choir practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Kurdish Spring in Syria|url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-kurdish-spring-in-syria/a-16828129|website=DW|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, in addition to the gender quota for councils, there is also an ethnic minority quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rojava: only chance for a just peace in the Middle East |url= http://roarmag.org/2015/03/rojava-kurdish-revolution-academic-delegation/ |date=March 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorative justice===
The criminal justice system is undergoing significant reforms, moving away from a punitive approach under the Assad government to one based on the principles of [[restorative justice]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Reconciliation Committees have replaced the Syrian government court system in several cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reconciliation Committee Solves 1977 cases in Serekaniye |url=http://en.hawarnews.com/reconciliation-committee-solves-1977-cases-in-serekaniye/ |accessdate=19 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130951/http://en.hawarnews.com/reconciliation-committee-solves-1977-cases-in-serekaniye/# |archive-date=22 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Committees are representative of the ethnic diversity in their respective area.

==Relations and conflicts==
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}

There are four major forces involved in the Rojava revolution. The [[People's Protection Units]] are working with the PYD and other political parties to establish self-rule in Rojava. Syrian government forces still maintain rule in some areas of Rojava under the leadership of the Assad regime. A collection of Sunni Islamist forces, the largest being the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), fought to rule the region by way of [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. Finally, there were several militias under the general banner of the [[Free Syrian Army]] whose intentions and alliances have differed and shifted over time. 

===Rojava-Syrian government relations and conflicts===
{{Main article|Rojava–Syria relations}}
{{See also|Federalization of Syria}}

While conflict between the YPG and the Syrian government has not been as active as fighting against Islamist forces, there have been several conflicts between the two forces. Territory once controlled by the Syrian government in both [[Qamishli]] and [[al-Hasakah]] has been lost to YPG forces. At the end of April 2016, clashes erupted between government forces and Kurdish fighters for the control of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/media/video/3297343.html|title=Fighting Escalates in Syria's Qamishli|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the beginning of August 2016, YPG fighters controlled two-thirds of the northeastern city of al-Hasakah, while pro-government militia controlled the remainder.  On 17 August 2016, heavy clashes broke out between Kurdish fighters and the pro-government militias, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, four Kurdish fighters, and three government loyalists. On 18 August, Syrian government aircraft bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakah, including three Kurdish checkpoints and three Kurdish bases.  Syrian Kurds had recently demanded that the pro-government National Defense Forces militia disband in al-Hasakah.  A government source told the AFP that the air strikes were "a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/syrian-regime-forces-bomb-kurds-in-north-for-first-time.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=102997&amp;NewsCatID=352|title=MIDEAST - Syrian regime forces bomb Kurds in north for first time|access-date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possible factor behind the fighting may have been the recent thaw in Turkish-Russian relations that began in July 2016; Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, had previously been supporting Syrian Kurdish forces as a means to apply pressure to Turkey.  After the recent setbacks suffered by ISIS in Syria and Iraq and improvements in the Turkish-Russian relationship, it is possible that Russia and its allies began to view a strong YPG as increasingly less useful.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/kurdish-militias-fight-syrian-forces-hasaka|title=Kurdish militias fight against Syrian forces in north-east city of Hasaka|last=Hawramy|first=Fazel|date=22 August 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the attacks by the Syrian aircraft on Kurdish positions near al-Hasakah, the United States scrambled planes over the city in order to deter further attacks.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

By 22 August, Syrian government troops, [[Hezbollah]] fighters, and members of the Iranian paramilitary [[Basij]] militia had become involved in the fighting against Kurdish forces in al-Hasakah.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On 28 December 2012, Syrian government forces opened fire on pro-FSA demonstrators in [[al-Hasakah]] city, killing and wounding several individuals. Arab tribes in the area attacked YPG positions in the city in reprisal, accusing the Kurdish fighters of collaborating with the government. Clashes broke out, and three Arabs were killed, though it was not clear whether they were killed by YPG forces or nearby government troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2728&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Hasakah: Deadly clashes between Arab tribes and PYD|date=9 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups throughout Western Kurdistan in late December as well. PYD supporters drove vehicles at low speeds through a KNC demonstration in Qamishli, raising tensions between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2726&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: PYD provokes supporters of the Kurdish National Council|date=4 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 to 4 January, PYD-led demonstrators staged protests in the al-Antariyah neighbourhood of Qamishli, demanding "freedom and democracy" for both Kurds and Syrians. Many activists camped out on site. On 4 January, approximately 10,000 people were participating in the rallies, which also included smaller numbers of supporters of other Kurdish parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2730&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: Youth groups organize three-day rally|date=10 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the KNC, which staged a rally in the Munir Habib neighbourhood. PYD organisers had planned for 100,000 people to participate, but such support did not materialise. The demonstrations were concurrent with rallies conducted across the country by the Arab opposition, though Kurdish parties did not use the same slogans as the Arabs, and also did not the same slogans amongst their own parties. Kurds also demonstrated in several other towns, but not across the entire Kurdish region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2731&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: PYD fails in attempt to mobilize one hundred thousand demonstrators|date=10 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, several armed incidents occurred between the dominant PYD-YPG and other Kurdish parties in the region, particularly the Kurdish Union ("Yekîtî") Party, part of a Kurdish political coalition called the [[Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union]] formed on 15 December 2012, which excludes the PYD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2727&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: Kurdish Democratic Political Union—Syria established|date=7 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January, PYD gunmen staged a drive-by shooting on a Yekîtî office in Qamishli. Armed Yekîtî members returned fire, injuring one PYD member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2732&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: Shots exchanged between PYD and Yekîtî|date=12 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, armed clashes broke out between YPG fighters and members of the newly formed Jiwan Qatna Battalion of Yekîtî in ad-Darbasiyah. Four Yekîtî members were abducted by the YPG, who accused them of being affiliated with Islamist groups, though Yekîtî activists alleged that the PYD wanted to prevent other Kurdish groups from arming themselves. Following demonstrations in the town demanding their release and an intervention by the KNC, the four men were released by the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2734&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Ad-Darbasiyah: YPG abducts armed Yekîtî members|date=15 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January, YPG forces raided an empty Yekîtî training ground near Ali Faru which had been built in early January, tearing down both the Kurdish and FSA flags that had been flying at the base. Though PYD members defended the raid by saying that the flags could have attracted government airstrikes, Yekîtî condemned the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/index.php?aid=2738&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: YPG storms Yekîtî military drill ground|date=20 January 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January, Kamal Mustafa Hanan, editor-in-chief of Newroz (a Kurdish-language journal) and a former Yekîtî politician, was fatally shot in the Ashrafiyah district of Aleppo. It was not clear if he was the victim of a stray bullet or of a politically motivated assassination. Yekîtî organised a funeral procession in the town of Afrin in the Kurdish-held northwest corner of Aleppo Province on 1 February, which members of both the PYD and KNC attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/?aid=2752&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Aleppo: Kurdish politician and writer fatally shot|date=7 February 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 1 February, Kurds staged demonstrations in several towns and villages across West Kurdistan concurrent with opposition demonstrations elsewhere in the country. The demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups, including the PYD and KNC. Demonstrators from the KNC demanded an end to fighting in Ras al-Ayn and the withdrawal of armed groups from the town, while PYD demonstrators stressed solidarity with their YPG units and the Kurdish Supreme Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/?aid=2753&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Qamishli: More demonstrations in the Kurdish regions|date=7 February 2013|publisher=Kurd Watch|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 to 5 February, YPG forces blockaded the village of Kahf al-Assad ({{lang-ku|Banê Şikeftê}}), inhabited by members of the Kurdish Kherikan tribe, after being fired upon by unknown gunmen in the village. YPG checkpoints were also established around other Kherikan villages. The Kherikan are traditionally supporters of the [[Massoud Barzani]] government of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and as oppose the PYD. The blockade was the third time in two years that hostilities had broken out between the PYD/YPG and locals from Kahf al-Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdwatch.org/?aid=2754&amp;z=en&amp;cure=1009|title=Al-Malikiyah: YPG ends siege of Kahf al‑Assad|date=11 February 2013|publisher=KurdWatch|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February, [[Osman Baydemir]], mayor of the city of [[Diyarbakır]] in Turkey, announced the initiation of a one-month humanitarian aid programme in which his city—along with the surrounding districts of [[Bağlar, Diyarbakır|Bağlar]], [[Yenişehir, Diyarbakır|Yenişehir]], [[Kayapınar, Diyarbakır|Kayapınar]], and [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]]—would provide food assistance to Kurdish areas in Syria affected by the war, which had received little of the humanitarian aid that other regions of Syria had received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.firatnews.com/news/news/diyarbakir-mayors-for-kurds-in-syria.htm|title=Diyarbakır mayors for Kurds in Syria|date=22 February 2013|publisher=Firat News|accessdate=27 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728074410/http://en.firatnews.com/news/news/diyarbakir-mayors-for-kurds-in-syria.htm|archivedate=28 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2016, PYD supporters attacked the offices of the [[Kurdish National Council]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria]] in Derbessiye and Qamishli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/04/12/pyd-increases-attacks-on-other-kurdish-groups-in-syria|work=[[Daily Sabah]]|title=PYD increases attacks on other Kurdish groups in Syria|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the Kurdish National Council told Turkey's [[TRT World]] channel the "PYD's oppressive attitude in Syria is forcing Kurds to leave the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2016/11/27/kurds-fleeing-syria-due-to-totalitarian-pyds-terror-acts-oppressive-attitude|work=[[Daily Sabah]]|title=Kurds fleeing Syria due to 'totalitarian' PYD's terror acts, oppressive attitude|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2017, more than 270 Syrian Kurdish activists signed an appeal calling for unity talks between the main Syrian Kurdish parties. In response, the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]] led by the PYD stated that they welcome unity and called on the Kurdish National Council to participate in federal project. The KNC led by the KDP-S, in response, demanded the release its political prisoners detained in Rojava. The KNC has rejected the federalism project launched by the [[Syrian Democratic Council]] and stated that it will participate in the [[Syrian peace process|peace talks]] in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]], with Turkey and Russia. The [[Kurdish National Alliance in Syria]], part of the SDC also welcomed the proposal of unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2017/01/despite-calls-unity-syrian-kurds-remain-divided/|title=Despite calls for unity, Syrian Kurds remain divided|work=ARA News|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2017, amidst [[Sinjar clashes (2017)|clashes]] between the KDP-S-affiliated [[Peshmerga]] group and the [[Sinjar Resistance Units]] in Sinjar, a KNC office was burned in Qamishli and another attacked in Dirbêsiyê. The KNC accused the pro-PYD youth group the Ciwanen Soresger of perpetrating the attacks. However, the perpetrators were reportedly arrested by the Asayish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2017/03/after-kurdish-tensions-in-sinjar-knc-offices-in-rojava-under-attack/|title=After Kurdish tensions in Sinjar, KNC offices in Rojava under attack|work=ARA News|date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2017, the Rojava Asayish arrested more than 40 members of the KNC in Syria while the KDP Asayish arrested 23 opposition protesters in Iraqi Kurdistan. 17 of them were later released but 6 were still imprisoned. By 16 March, more than 13 KNC offices and an [[Assyrian Democratic Organization]] office in Rojava were shut down by Rojava Asayish forces, reportedly for failing to register with PYD authorities. In response, the [[Human Rights Watch]] called on both sides to "immediately" release all "arbitrarily held political detainees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2017/03/human-rights-watch-calls-syrian-kurds-krg-release-political-prisoners/|title=Human Rights Watch calls on Syrian Kurds and KRG to release political prisoners|work=ARA News|date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mesopotamia National Council]] announced their support for TEV-DEM's requirement for parties to apply to licenses to operate in Rojava. However, the council also called for the self-management to give sufficient time for applications and denounced "random" closing of the parties' offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriacsnews.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AB-%D9%86%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%A8/|title=THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF BETH NAHRIN ISSUED A STATEMENT REGARDING THE CLOSURE OF UNLICENSED PARTY OFFICES|work=Syriac International News Agency|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2017, the Kurdish National Council called on the PYD to release 4 of its detainees: a [[Kurdish Future Movement in Syria]] member, a Kurdish Youth Movement member, and two KDP-S members. As of the same day, 6 detainees were still held by Iraqi Kurdish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2017/04/kurdish-national-council-calls-pyd-release-political-prisoners/|title=Kurdish National Council calls on PYD to release political prisoners|work=ARA News|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2017, an official in TEV-DEM met with [[Gabriel Moushe Gawrieh]], head of the [[Assyrian Democratic Organization]], and discussed the closure of the latter's offices since March. It was the first time TEV-DEM officials met with the ADO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aranews.net/2017/04/assyrian-faction-linked-syrian-opposition-meets-kurdish-tev-dem-office-closure/|title=Assyrian faction linked to Syrian opposition meets with Kurdish TEV-DEM after office closure|work=ARA News|author=Wladimir van Wilgenburg|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syrian Kurdish–Islamist conflict (2013–present)|Syrian Kurdish–Islamist conflict]] is a major theater in the [[Syrian Civil War]], starting in 2013 after fighting erupted between the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) and [[Islamist]] rebel factions in the city of [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah Governorate|Ras al-Ayn]]. Kurdish forces launched a campaign in an attempt to take control of the Islamist-controlled areas in the [[Governorates of Syria|governorate]] of [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|al-Hasakah]] and some parts of [[Raqqa Governorate|Raqqa]] and [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]] governorates after [[al-Nusra Front|al-Qaeda in Syria]] used those areas to attack the YPG. The Kurdish groups and their allies' goal was also to capture Kurdish areas from the [[Arab]] Islamist rebels and strengthen the autonomy of the region of [[Rojava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/824383/syrie-les-kurdes-combattent-les-jihadistes-pour-imposer-leur-autonomie.html|title=Syrie: les Kurdes combattent les jihadistes pour imposer leur autonomie - Dernières Infos - L'Orient-Le Jour|work=L'Orient-Le Jour|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YPG forces as well as later the broader [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) have clashed heavily with Islamist forces of all stripes in the following years, in particular with those representing the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). Most notable have been the [[Siege of Kobanî]] (2014), the [[Al-Hasakah offensive (February–March 2015)]], the [[Al-Hasakah offensive (May 2015)]], the [[Tell Abyad offensive (May–July 2015)]], the [[Battle of Sarrin (June–July 2015)]], the [[Battle of Al-Hasakah (June–August 2015)]], and the ongoing [[Raqqa campaign (2016–present)]] including the [[Battle of Tabqa (2017)]].

Turkey has long regarded the PYD as an alleged Syrian extension of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK), and has therefore taken a hardline stance against the group, the official talking point being that it would not allow a Kurdish state to form along their southern border with Syria. Turkey's policy towards Rojava is based on an economic blockade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-10-14/rojava-model|title=The Rojava Model|author=Meredith Tax|publisher=Foreign Affairs|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; persistent attempts of international isolation,&lt;ref name=OIC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/speech-by-h_e_-mevlut-cavusoglu_-minister-of-foreign-affairs-of-the-republic-of-turkey-at-the-meeting-of-council-of-foreign-mini.en.mfa|title=From Rep. of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs|website=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011325/http://www.mfa.gov.tr/speech-by-h_e_-mevlut-cavusoglu_-minister-of-foreign-affairs-of-the-republic-of-turkey-at-the-meeting-of-council-of-foreign-mini.en.mfa#|archive-date=5 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with Rojava militias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-president-erdogan-slams-us-over-ypg-support.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=99783&amp;NewsCatID=510|title=Turkish President Erdoğan slams US over YPG support|work=Hurryiet Daily News|date=28 May 2016|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support of [[Islamism|Islamist]] Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards Rojava,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/|title=How Can Turkey Overcome Its Foreign Policy Mess?|publisher=Lobolog (Graham E.

In March 2017, U.S. Lieutenant General [[Stephen Townsend]] said "I have seen absolutely zero evidence that they have been a threat to, or have supported any attacks on, Turkey from Northern Syria over the last two years." The top U.S. commander in the campaign against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) argued that the Peoples’ Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), does not pose a threat to Turkey. "Of those YPG fighters, I’ve talked to their leaders and we’ve watched them operate and they continually reassure us that they have no desire to attack Turkey, that they are not a threat to Turkey, in fact that they desire to have a good working relationship with Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ypg-no-threat-to-turkey-us-top-general-argues.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=110346&amp;NewsCatID=352|title=YPG no threat to Turkey, US top general argues|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural and cultural heritage==
Saoyú-ʔehdacho is {{convert|5587|km2}} in size, approximately the size of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]],&lt;ref name="Backgrounder"/&gt; and consists of two peninsulas: Saoyú (Grizzly Bear Mountain) and ʔehdacho (Scented Grass Hills).&lt;ref name="Outspan"/&gt;  The peninsulas are both characterized by flat summits, approximately {{convert|725|and|650|m}} [[Sea level|above sea level]] respectively.  The perimeters of both promontories feature a series of raised beaches, formed by the [[post-glacial rebound]], which contain the majority of the known evidence of human occupation of the lands, including archaeological resources related to [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-contact]] occupation from over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahoyúé-§ehdacho: Commemorative Integrity Statement|url=http://www.nwtpas.ca/areas/document-2004-sahoyue-commemorativeintegrity-summary.pdf|publisher=Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy|accessdate=15 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KOWTT4N3|archivedate=15 October 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==
[[File:Bear Mountain, Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories.jpg|thumb|left|Grizzly Bear Mountain in the 1920s]]
Saoyú-ʔehdacho was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in 1997, on the basis that the landscape, its cultural resources (including graves, trails and cabins) and its associated oral histories contribute to an understanding of the origin, spiritual values, lifestyle and land-use of the Sahtu [[Dene]].&lt;ref name="CRHP"/&gt; In 2001 and 2005, the federal government enacted withdrawal orders under the ''Territorial Lands Act'', prohibiting the registration of new mineral claims or other third party interests against the Saoyú-ʔehdacho lands.  In 2007, [[Parks Canada]] entered into an agreement with the Déline First Nation to permanently protect and cooperatively manage the site, with surface title to the [[Crown land]]s portion of the site (constituting 80% of the overall land) transferred to Parks Canada from [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Backgrounder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News release|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/APPS/CP-NR/release_e.asp?id=1078&amp;andor1=nr|work=Canada's New Government Takes Significant Step to Protect Major National Historic Site in the North|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=11 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KIUyWz3T|archivedate=11 October 2013|date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an [[Order in Council]] increased the legal protection for Crown-owned portions of the site by applying regulatory protections under the [[National Parks Act (Canada)|National Parks Act]] to the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Gazette|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2012/2012-01-04/html/sor-dors319-eng.html|work=P.C. 2011-1670 (Order Amending the National Historic Sites of Canada Order)|publisher=[[Public Works and Government Services Canada]]|accessdate=15 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KOV8yDd3|archivedate=15 October 2013|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saoyú-ʔehdacho is the largest National Historic Site of Canada in land area.&lt;ref name="Prentice news release"&gt;{{cite web|title=News Release|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/APPS/CP-NR/release_e.asp?id=1292&amp;andor1=nr|work=Government of Canada Announces the Protection of Canada's Largest National Historic Site|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saoyú-ʔehdacho is also:

*the first National Historic Site in [[Northern Canada]] cooperatively managed by Parks Canada and an aboriginal group;

*the first cultural landscape in Northern Canada commemorated by the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Backgrounder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prentice news release"/&gt;

Saoyú-ʔehdacho is also the first site to be protected under the territorial government's Protected Areas Strategy, a consultative process created with the involvement of the federal and territorial governments, aboriginal groups, environmental groups and industry, with the objective of establishing a network of [[protected areas]] across the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtpas.ca/index.asp|title=Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy|publisher=Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy|accessdate=15 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KOYVAojv|archivedate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
In the [[Slavey language]], "Saoyú" means "belonging to the bear" and "ʔehdacho" means "big point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahoyúé- § ehdacho Working Group Final Report|url=http://www.nwtpas.ca/areas/document-2007-sahoyue-workinggroup-report.pdf|publisher=The Sahoyúé- § ehdacho Working Group|accessdate=24 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Kblo8kD7|archivedate=24 October 2013|page=3|date=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the site was first designated a National Historic Site in 1997, it was named Scented Grass Hills and Grizzly Bear Mountain. It was subsequently renamed Sahoyúé-§ehdacho, and again renamed to Saoyú-Æehdacho in June 2008 in an attempt to better reflect the Slavey name for the site. In June 2010, the cooperative management board for the site, made up of representatives of Parks Canada, the Déline Renewable Resources Council and the Déline Land Corporation, adopted the spelling  Saoyú-ʔehdacho. The Status of Designation Committee of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada|national Historic Sites and Monuments Board]] approved the official name change for the National Historic Site in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order Amending the National Historic Sites of Canada Order|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2011/2011-04-02/html/reg5-eng.html|work=[[Canada Gazette]]|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051223/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2011/2011-04-02/html/reg5-eng.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|location=Footnote 1|date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3570">This is a list of the '''Flags of the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|Provinces]]'''. Provincial [[flag]]s for the modern provinces of Sri Lanka were first introduced in 1987, and 1988 for the [[North Eastern Province (Sri Lanka)|North Eastern Province]], which was at the time one entity. In 2007 with the separation of the North Eastern Province, into the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern]] and the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern]] provinces, two new flags were adopted.

Most of the flags are based upon ancient [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] flags, and or symbols for their respective regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald|first=Ian|title=Sri Lankan Provincial Flags|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/lk-.html|publisher=FOTW|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stac Levenish''' or '''Stac Leibhinis''' (sometimes simply called '''Levenish'''/'''Leibhinis''') is a [[sea stack]] in the [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] [[archipelago]] in [[Scotland]]. Lying {{convert|2.5|km|1|abbr=off}} off Village Bay on [[Hirta]], it is part of the rim of an extinct volcano that includes [[Dùn, St Kilda|Dùn]], Ruaival and Mullach Sgar.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The stack is {{convert|62|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} high. Its north cliff appears to have the profile of a human face, visible when travelling to St Kilda from the east. The [[skerry]] of Na Bodhan lies to the north east.

A '''surveyor's wheel''', also called a '''clickwheel''', '''hodometer''', '''waywiser''', '''[[trundle wheel]]''',  '''measuring wheel''' or '''perambulator''' is a device for measuring distance.

== Origin ==
[[File:Blind Jack statue, Knaresborough (19th March 2013).JPG|thumb|right|150px|An early surveyor's wheel depicted in the hand of late 18th century British road builder [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]].]]
The origins of the surveyor's wheel are connected to the origins of the [[odometer]]. While the latter is derived to measure distances travelled by a vehicle, the former is specialized to measure distances. Much of the material on the earliest stages in the development of the hodometer are adequately covered in [[odometer]].

In the 17th century, the surveyor's wheel was re-introduced and used to measure distances. A single wheel is attached to a handle and the device can be pushed or pulled along by a person walking. Early devices were made of wood and may have had an iron rim to provide strength. The wheels themselves would be made in the same manner as wagon wheels and often by the same makers. The measuring devices would be made by makers of scientific instruments and the device and handles would be attached to the wheel by them. The device to read the distance travelled would be mounted either near the hub of the wheel or at the top of the handle.

In some cases, double-wheel hodometers were constructed.

[[Francis Ronalds]] extended the concept in 1827 to create a device that recorded the distances travelled in [[graphics|graphical]] form as a survey plan.  The apparatus had a [[worm drive|worm]] on the axle of the two wheels that meshed with a toothed wheel to drive another transverse screw that carried a slider.  A pencil on the slider recorded the distance travelled along the screw on an attached drawing board at a chosen scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern surveyor's wheels are constructed primarily of [[aluminium]], with solid or [[pneumatic]] [[Tire|tyres]] on the wheel. Some can fold for transport or storage.

== How the surveyor's wheel works ==
[[Image:SurveyorsWheelAnimation.gif|thumb|A diagram of a surveyor's wheel taking a measurement.]]
The surveyor's wheel is marked in fractional increments of revolution from a reference position.  Thus its current position can be represented as a fraction of a revolution from this reference. If the wheel rotated a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] (360 angular degrees), the distance traveled would be equal to the circumference of the wheel.  Otherwise, the distance the wheel traveled is the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the fraction of a full turn.  In the figure on the right, the blue line is the reference starting point. As the wheel turns during measurement, it is seen that the wheel sweeps out an angle of &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} \pi&lt;/math&gt; radians, which is equal to 135 degrees or &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{8}&lt;/math&gt; of a full turn.

==Usage of the surveyor's wheel==

Each revolution of the wheel measures a specific distance, such as a [[yard]], [[metre]] or [[Rod (unit)|half-rod]]. Thus counting revolutions with a mechanical device attached to the wheel measures the distance directly.

Surveyor's wheels will provide a measure of good accuracy on a smooth surface, such as pavement. On rough terrain, wheel slippage and bouncing can reduce the accuracy. Soft sandy or muddy soil can also affect the rolling of the wheel. As well, obstacles in the way of the path may have to be accounted for separately. Good surveyors will keep track of any circumstance on the path that can influence the accuracy of the distance measured and either measure that portion with an alternative, such as a surveyor's tape or measuring tape, or make a reasonable estimate of the correction to apply.

Surveyor's wheels are used primarily for lower accuracy surveys. They are often used by road maintenance or underground utility workers and by farmers for fast measures over distances too inconvenient to measure with a surveyor's tape.

The surveyor's wheel measures the distance along a surface, whereas in normal land surveying, distances between points are usually measured horizontally with vertical measurements indicated in differences in elevation. Thus conventionally surveyed distances will be less than those measured by a surveyor's wheel.

'''The European Azerbaijan Society''' was an organization founded on 2 July 2008 in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], with the main goals of supporting the development of [[Azerbaijan]]i relations and promoting the country, while involving Azerbaijanis living and studying abroad into these activities. The organisation is now being liquidated as of 26 July 2018. 

== History ==
In 2006, [[Tale Heydarov]] established the London Azerbaijan Society. After that, in 2008, The European Azerbaijan Society (TEAS) was established in London.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/introduction|title=Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the society had two directors – Nijat Heydarov and Tale Heydarov. They were in this position from 2008 until May 2013. From that date to present, the society's director and company secretary has been Lionel David Zetter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duedil.com/company/gb/06635743/the-european-azerbaijan-society/directors|title=The European Azerbaijan Society|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahin Namati-Nasab was the company secretary from 2008 to 2011. From 2011 to 2013 this position was occupied by Nijat Heydarov. In 2013, the first corporate secretary showed up on the stage – Legis Secretarial Services Limited. In 2014, it was replaced by Nsm Services Limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The activities of TEAS are conducted in two main directions: [[culture]] and [[business]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ab.gov.tr/files/ardb/evt/1_avrupa_birligi/1_6_raporlar/1_3_diger/uk_tr_relations.pdf|title=UK–Turkey relations and Turkey's regional role|last=|first=|date=|website=Republic of Turkey, Ministry for EU Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
The main aim of this direction is to promote Azerbaijan's [[cultural heritage]], [[tradition]]s and [[history]], as well as to raise awareness about the country in the international area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/world-news/europe/the-european-azerbaijan-society-opens-new-office-in-brussels.html|title=The European Azerbaijan Society open Benelux office in Brussels|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of this program, TEAS organizes such events as book launches, various [[concert]]s and [[performance]]s and [[exhibition]]s. Azerbaijan's history, culture, music, art and news are highlighted in TEAS TV Channel and TEAS Magazine.

This program is especially directed towards spreading information about Azerbaijan's [[literature]], [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]]s, [[folklore]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[theatre]]. As part of this program, they hold specific thematic cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/culture|title=Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===
Business direction of TEAS helps new companies and already established ones to build and maintain their businesses. Thus, TEAS helps with many business-related issues, for example, conducting thorough market analysis based on the company's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/business|title=Business|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, TEAS offers broad range of services to its members, such as expert advice and consulting, business introductions and free access to all forums, networking events and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msm.nl/tag/the-european-azerbaijan-society/|title=Netherlands-Azerbaijan Business Forum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

=== Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ===
Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine is a publication that issues once in two months and raises awareness of readers about culture and history of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions.az/en/archieve/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers such topics as [[international relations]], [[international business]], business cooperation and the emerging [[Tourism|tourism industry]]. The magazine was founded in 2006 by Anglo-Azerbaijani Youth Society and is currently being published in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/visions-magazine|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other publications ===
TEAS also conducts its own [[research]] about Azerbaijan's history and concludes the research by publishing those findings as part of TEAS Books series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/books|title=Books|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEAS Brochures is another branch of TEAS Publications, which is directed into creating brochures that overview Azerbaijan's history, geography, politics, economics, business, trade and international relations.

== Outreach &amp; Engagement Programme ==
This program is aimed to collection and implementation of ideas that are directed to promotion of Azerbaijan's development. TEAS has supported and implemented the following projects:

=== Somali Aid ===
Victims of the Somali famine have been supported by TEAS, which helped to raise funds for providing necessary products to those people. More than 82,000 have been reached and helped out thanks to this programme.

=== Our Talent – Our Future ===
TEAS finances and supports the non-profit, non-governmental organization Our Talents - Our Future, which provides free education to academically talented children from low-income families in Sumgait, Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourtalents-ourfuture.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;lang=en|title=Thanks &amp; Acknowledgements (FF version)|last=|first=|date=|website=Our Talents - Our Future|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, around 200 children have benefited from this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teas.eu/our-talent-our-future|title=Our Talents - Our Future|last=|first=|date=|website=The European Azerbaijan Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photography Competition ===
The photography contest named "Azerbaijan Through the Lens" is an initiative of TEAS, which provides professional and amateur photographers to showcase their works while also demonstrating different aspects of Azerbaijan, such as its nature, history and culture. Overall, 750 photographs were received, with three of them being winners of the competition and presented during the opening of the exhibition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.apa.az/azerbaijan-politics/diaspora/azerbaijan-through-the-lens-competition-winners-announced-in-london-photo.html|title="Azerbaijan Through the Lens" competition winners announced in London|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TEAS School ===
In 2011, the European-Azerbaijani school (EAS) was founded by TEAS. This is a private school, with the primary language being Azerbaijani. The school also conducts classes in Russian language. EAS provides students, who have achieved high scores during entrance or studying process with a scholarship opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eas.az/en/node/57|title=Founder|last=|first=|date=|website=European Azerbaijan School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Vincennes'' (1826)''' was a 703-ton Boston-class [[sloop of war]] in the [[United States Navy]] from 1826 to 1865. During her service, ''Vincennes'' patrolled the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], explored the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], and blockaded the Confederate [[U.S. Gulf coast|Gulf coast]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Named for the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] [[Siege of Fort Vincennes|Battle of Vincennes]], she was the first U.S. warship to [[circumnavigate]] the globe.

==Built in Brooklyn==
''Vincennes''—the first American ship to be so named—was one of ten sloops of war whose construction was authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on 3 March 1825. She was laid down at [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|New York]] in 1825, launched on 27 April 1826, and commissioned on 27 August 1826, with [[Master Commandant]] [[William Compton Bolton]] in command.

== First world cruise ==
The ship set sail for the first time on 3 September 1826, from New York bound for the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] by way of [[Cape Horn]]. She cruised extensively in that ocean, visiting the [[Hawaiian islands]] in 1829 and made her way to [[Macau]] by 1830, under [[Commander]] [[William Compton Bolton|William B. Finch]].&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite book |last= Long |first= David Foster |authorlink= |title= Gold braid and foreign relations : diplomatic activities of U.S. naval officers, 1798–1883 |url= http://lccn.loc.gov/87034879 |year=1988 |origyear= |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= Annapolis |isbn= 978-0-87021-228-4 |pages= 207ff |chapter= Chapter Nine |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=yv2sdjw4SIYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Edmund+Roberts+royal%3B+navy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xMsi68ZBY7&amp;sig=_-#v=onepage&amp;q=Edmund%20Roberts%20royal%3B%20navy&amp;f=false|quote=|accessdate= 29 April 2012|laysummary= https://www.jstor.org/stable/2163133 |laydate= February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.208–9}} Her return voyage was made by way of [[China]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Ship chaplain Charles Samuel Stewart published a book about the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. ship Vincennes, during the years 1829 and 1830: with notices of Brazil, Peru, Manilla, the Cape of Good Hope, and St. Helena |edition = Second |publisher=Fisher, Son, &amp; Jackson |year=1832 |author=Charles Samuel Stewart |editor= [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd8NAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly four years, ''Vincennes'' arrived back in New York on 8 June 1830, becoming the first U.S. Navy ship to [[circumnavigate]] the [[Earth]]. Two days later the ship was decommissioned.

== West Indies and Guam operations ==
Following repairs and recommissioned, ''Vincennes'' then operated in the [[West Indies]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as part of the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]] in 1831–32. After a long bout of [[yellow fever]]&lt;!--by whom??--&gt;, she was decommissioned again for a time in 1833 before sailing once more.

She departed for a second Pacific deployment in 1833, becoming the first American warship to call at [[Guam]]. She again sailed around the globe to return to the [[U.S. East Coast]] in June 1836.

==Supporting the Wilkes Expedition==
[[File:Commodore Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition 1838 - 1842.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] 1838 - 1842]]
Decommissioned once again in 1836, while she underwent remodeling, she was refitted with a light spar deck and declared the [[flagship]] of the [[United States Exploring Expedition|South Sea Surveying and Exploring Expedition]] to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] region.

Commanded by Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]], the expedition sailed from [[Hampton Roads]] in August 1838, and made surveys along the [[South America]]n coast before making a brief survey of [[Antarctica]] in early 1839.  Entering into the South Pacific in August and September 1839, her cartographers drafted charts of that area that are still used today.

Following survey operations and other scientific work along the west coast of [[South America]] and in the South Pacific during the rest of the year, in late 1839 ''Vincennes'' arrived at [[Sydney, Australia]], her base for a pioneering cruise to [[Antarctica]]. She un-intentionally exposed the lack of defences and security at Sydney Harbour when she slipped un-noticed into Sydney Harbour on 30 November 1839 under the cover of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Boyce, 'The Wolves are at the door: Sydney's century of invasion fears', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Between mid-January and mid-February 1840, she operated along the icy coast of the southernmost continent. The coast along which the ship sailed is today known as [[Wilkes Land]], a name given on maps as early as 1841.

The remainder of her deployment included visits to the islands of the South Pacific, [[Hawaii]], the [[Columbia River]] area, [[Puget Sound]], [[California]], [[Wake Island]], the [[Philippine Islands|Philippines]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Narrative of the United States exploring expedition, during the years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842 |volume= 2 |author= Charles Wilkes |publisher= Ingram, Cooke, 1852 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=THEFAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This third voyage around the world ended at New York in June 1842.

==1842–1847 operations==
''Vincennes'' was next assigned to the [[Home Squadron]] and placed under the command of Commander [[Franklin Buchanan]], a distinguished officer destined to become the first Superintendent of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. She sailed to the [[West Indies]] and cruised off the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coast until the summer of 1844. Though this duty proved relatively uneventful, ''Vincennes'' did rescue two grounded English [[brig]]s off the coast of [[Texas]] and received the thanks of the British government for this service. Buchanan was also ordered to prevent any attempted invasion by Mexico of the new [[Republic of Texas]]. This eventuality never materialized; and ''Vincennes'' returned to [[Hampton Roads]] on 15 August to enter dry dock.

On 4 June 1845, ''Vincennes'' sailed for the [[Far East]] under command of Captain [[Hiram Paulding]]. She was accompanied by the ship-of-the-line {{USS|Columbus|1819|2}}, under the command of Captain [[Thomas Wyman]]; and the two vessels formed a little squadron under the command of Commodore [[James Biddle (commodore)|James Biddle]], who carried a letter from [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John C. Calhoun]] to [[Caleb Cushing]], American commissioner in [[China]], authorizing Cushing to make the first official contact with the [[Japan]]ese Government.

[[File:ColombusAndVincennesInJapan1848JohnEastley.jpg|thumb|The ''Vincennes'' and [[USS Columbus (1819)|''Columbus'']] in Japan.]]

The squadron sailed for [[Macau]] by way of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Commodore Biddle arrived safely in Macau only to find that Cushing had already left for home and that his successor, [[Alexander H. Everett]], was too ill to make the trip. Therefore, Biddle determined to conduct the negotiations himself.

Accordingly, ''Vincennes'' and ''Columbus'' sailed for [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] on 7 July 1846 and anchored off [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] on 19 July. The Japanese surrounded the vessels and allowed no one to land. Otherwise the visitors were treated with courtesy. However, Commodore Biddle's attempts to force the opening of feudal Japan to multinational trade were politely rebuffed, and the vessels weighed anchor on 29 July&lt;ref name="Van Zandt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Zandt|first=Howard|title=Pioneer American Merchants in Japan|year=1984|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9994648144|page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''Columbus'' returned to the United States by way of [[Cape Horn]], but ''Vincennes'' remained on the [[China Station]] for another year before returning to New York on 1 April 1847. Here, she was decommissioned on the 9th, dry-docked, and laid up.

==1849–1860 operations==
''Vincennes'' remained in ordinary until 1849. Recommissioned on 12 November 1849, she sailed from New York exactly one month later, bound for [[Cape Horn]] and the west coast of [[South America]]. On 2 July 1850, while lying off [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]], she harbored the Ecuadoran revolutionary General [[Jorge Antonio Elizalde|Elizalde]] for three days during one of that country's frequent civil disturbances. Sailing on to [[San Francisco, California]], the vessel lost 36 members of her crew to the [[California Gold Rush|gold fever]] sweeping [[California]] at the time. Turning south, ''Vincennes'' cruised off South America until late 1851, closely monitoring the activities of revolutionaries ashore.

She made a courtesy call to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] at the end of the year and proceeded thence to [[Puget Sound]] where she arrived on 2 February 1852. She anchored briefly there and returned via San Francisco and the Horn to New York where she arrived on 21 September and was decommissioned on the 24th.

Following repairs and a period in ordinary, ''Vincennes'' was recommissioned on 21 March 1853 and sailed into [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 13 May to join her [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition|second exploratory expedition]], serving as flagship to Commander [[Cadwalader Ringgold]]'s survey of the [[South China Sea|China Sea]], the North Pacific, and the [[Bering Strait]]. Comdr. Ringgold was a veteran of the Wilkes expedition. The squadron stood out of Norfolk on 11 June 1853, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and charted numerous islands and shoals in the [[Indian Ocean]] before arriving in China in March 1854. Here Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry]] relieved Ringgold for medical reasons and gave command of the expedition to Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]].

''Vincennes'' sailed on to survey the [[Bonin Islands|Bonin]] and [[Ladrone Islands]] and returned to [[Hong Kong]] in February 1855. The expedition sailed again in March and surveyed the islands between the [[Ryūkyū]] chain and Japan, and then the [[Kuril]]s. ''Vincennes'' left the squadron at [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk, Russia]], and entered the Bering Strait, sailing through to the northwest towards [[Wrangel Island]]. Ice barriers prevented the vessel from reaching this destination, but she came closer than any other previous ship. ''Vincennes'' returned to San Francisco in early October and later sailed for the Horn and New York, where she arrived on 13 July 1856 to complete yet another circumnavigation of the globe.

''Vincennes'' operated with the [[African Squadron]] in 1857–1860.

==American Civil War service==
[[File:Vincennes-sloop-Currier-Ives.jpeg|thumb|A colored lithograph of the USS ''Vincennes'']]
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861, ''Vincennes'' was recommissioned on 29 June and assigned to duty in the [[Gulf Blockading Squadron]]. She arrived off [[Fort Pickens, Florida]], on 3 September, and was ordered to assist in the occupation of [[Head of Passes]], [[Mississippi River]], and remain there on blockade duty. Though the Federal warships did successfully deploy, on 12 October 1861 the Confederate metal-sheathed ram {{ship|CSS|Manassas||2}} and armed [[steamship|steamer]]s {{ship|CSS|Ivy||2}} and {{ship|CSS|James L. Day||2}} drove the Union blockaders from Head of Passes in the [[Battle of the Head of Passes]], forcing the [[Propeller|Screw]] [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Richmond|1860|2}} and ''Vincennes'' aground. ''Vincennes'' was ordered abandoned and destroyed to prevent her capture, and her engineer set a slow match to the vessel's [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]] while her men took refuge on other ships. However, her engineer cut the burning fuse and threw it overboard before the magazine could explode and, after the Confederate vessels withdrew early in the afternoon, ''Vincennes'' was refloated.

After the Confederate attack, the Union sloop-of-war continued on blockade duty off the Passes of the Mississippi, capturing the blockade-running British [[barque|bark]] ''Empress'', aground at [[North East Pass]] with a large cargo of coffee on 27 November. On 4 March 1862, she was ordered to proceed to [[Pensacola, Florida]], to relieve {{USS|Mississippi|1841|2}} and spent the next six months shuttling between Pensacola and [[Mobile, Alabama]], performing routine patrol and reconnaissance duty. On 4 October, she was ordered to assume command of the blockade off [[Ship Island, Mississippi]], and to guard the pass out of Mississippi Sound. While so deployed, boat crews from the vessel and {{USS|Clifton|1861|2}} captured the barge ''H. McGuin'' in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], on 18 July 1863. ''Vincennes'' also reported the capture of two boats laden with food on 24 December.

==End-of-war service and decommissioning==
[[File:USS Vincennes (1826) monument.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to USS ''Vincennes'' in [[Vincennes, Indiana]]'s Patrick Henry Square]]

''Vincennes'' remained off [[Ship Island]] for the duration of the war and was laid up in ordinary at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] on 28 August 1865. The veteran world traveler was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in August 1865 and sold at [[public auction]] at Boston on 5 October 1867 for approximately $5,000.00, completing a career that made her one of the Navy's most widely traveled ships.

Huber, and B.E. Vieux, 2008, Hydrology and Floodplain Analysis, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 795 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs [[GIS]] maps for parameterization via a desktop interface.&lt;ref&gt;Vieux, B.E., Z. Cui, and A. Gaur, 2004, Evaluation of a physics-based distributed hydrologic model for flood forecasting. ''J. Hydrol.'', '''298'''(1-4): 155-177. DMIP special issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is suited for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations.  V''flo'' output is in the form of [[hydrograph]]s at selected [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]] grids, as well as [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil [[infrastructure]] operations and maintenance, [[stormwater]] prediction and [[emergency management]], continuous and short-term surface water [[runoff model (reservoir)|runoff]], recharge estimation, [[soil moisture]] monitoring, [[land use]] planning, [[water quality]] monitoring, and water resources management.

== History ==
V''flo'' considers the spatial character of the [[parameter]]s and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in [[Hydrological modelling|hydrologic modeling]].  Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] model database.&lt;ref&gt;Desconnets, J.-C., B.E. Vieux, B. Cappelaere, and F. Delclaux (1996), “A GIS for hydrologic modeling in the semi-arid, HAPEX-Sahel experiment area of Niger Africa.” ''Trans. in GIS'', '''1'''(2): 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[computation]]al speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from [[weather radar|radar]] and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and [[GIS]] technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible.&lt;ref&gt;ASCE, 1999, ''GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed'', Report, ASCE Task Committee, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, P.A. DeBarry, R.G. Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  V''flo'' is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] input, [[GIS]] datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics.  Because it is [[physics]]-based, it produces [[hydrograph]]s based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]], and can be employed in locations where there are no [[rain gauge]]s or previous modeling studies.  In addition, V''flo''’s network approach makes models scalable from upland [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] to river basins using the same [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]].

== Formulation ==
V''flo'' is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations.  V''flo'' models may be [[calibration|calibrated]] by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak [[hydrograph]]s to observed hydrographs.  Elevation data are taken from a [[digital elevation model]].  A vector channel representation is employed.  Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including [[LIDAR]] terrain data and other digital maps of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious area]], soils, and land use/cover.  V''flo'' is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from [[Weather radar|radar]], satellites, [[rain gauge]]s, or model forecasts.  The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a [[Drainage basin|watershed]].
