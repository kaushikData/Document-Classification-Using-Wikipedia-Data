The '''2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests''' was a series of protests of varying levels of violence which took place early in 2012 in response to the [[Quran desecration|burning of Islamic religious material]] by soldiers from the United States [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram Air Base]] in Afghanistan. On 22 February 2012, U.S. troops at Bagram Base disposed of copies of the [[Quran]] that had been used by Taliban prisoners to write messages to each other. As part of the disposal, parts of the books were burned. Afghan forces working at the base reported this, resulting in outraged Afghans besieging Bagram AFB, raining it with petrol bombs and stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koran Burning by US troops in Afghanistan provokes outrage and revolts|url=http://www.nationalturk.com/en/koran-burning-by-us-troops-in-afghanistan-provokes-outrage-and-revolts-16586|publisher=National Turk|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five days of protest, 30 people had been killed, including four Americans.

The protests included domestic riots which caused at least 41 deaths and at least 270 injuries.&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt;&lt;ref name=stripes/&gt;

== Background ==
[[Bagram Airfield]] is one of the largest American military bases in Afghanistan, about {{convert|40|km|mi}} northeast of the Afghan capital [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528003,00.html |title=Rocket Attack on U.S. Base in Afghanistan Kills 2 Troops, Wounds 6 Americans |publisher=Foxnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parwan Detention Facility]], located at the base, houses hundreds of [[Taliban]], [[al Qaeda]] and other captured militants.

In February 2012, two  Afghan-American interpreters at the base removed 1,652 damaged books and Islamic texts from the library at the Parwan Detention Facility (including 48 copies of the [[Quran]]), and boxed them for storage.  On 22 February, several members of the [[United States armed forces]]  sent them to an [[incineration|incinerator]] to be burned.  Several Afghan garbage collectors working at the base reported finding a number of charred books and quickly notified an [[Afghan National Army]] commander.&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Quinn And Rahim Faiez |url=https://news.yahoo.com/official-mistakes-led-afghan-quran-burnings-053758916.html |title=Official: Mistakes led to Afghan Quran burnings |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/21/u-s-general-apologizes-as-afghans-storm-bagram-airbase-over-desecrated-korans/ |title=U.S. apologizes for Koran burning as Afghans storm Bagram airbase &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nation.foxnews.com/koran/2012/03/01/obama-prosecuting-us-soldiers-koran-burning | work=Fox News | title=Obama Prosecuting U.S. Soldiers for Koran Burning? – Koran – Fox Nation | date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John R. Allen]], commander of ISAF and US forces in Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=stripes/&gt; said the books were taken from the library that is used by inmates at the detention facility. He said the religious material was removed from the library due to the presence of "extremist inscriptions" on them, further noting "an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-25/asia/world_asia_afghanistan-burned-qurans_1_qurans-protests-afghan-police?_s=PM:ASIA | work=CNN | title=Apology for Quran burning not enough, Muslim scholars say | date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, some {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated groups are exploiting the peaceful intentions.' 'We not only condemn the US for the burning of the Koran but also those who are committing crimes in the name of the Koran and its desecration,' he stated angrily. Yunus Fakoor, a political expert in Kabul, said radical religious groups were pouring oil on the fire for their own purposes. 'This is not a defense of faith. They are exploiting the religious feelings of people.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremist propaganda and illiteracy fuel Afghan protests|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15767031,00.html|author=Waslat Hasrat-Nazimi|work=Deutsche Welle|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Incident Investigation and perpetrator punishment==

===Investigation===

A joint investigation by U.S. and Afghan authorities as well as a second investigation by the U.S. army into was completed in early April 2012.&lt;ref name="CNN20120404"&gt;{{cite web|last=Starr|first=Barbara|title=Quran burning investigations completed|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/04/politics/quran-burning/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic20120419" /&gt; According to a U.S. Army investigation report released on 27 August 2012, members of the Military Police and Theater Intelligence Team had discovered that Bagram detainees were using library books to pass notes and messages and up to 100 Qurans and other religious materials were burned in the incinerator at Bagram Air Field on 20 February 2012.&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt;

Officers at the Parwan detention center on the edge of Bagram Air Base worried that some detainees were communicating through notes written in library books, potentially to plan an attack. As a precaution, the officers assigned two Afghan-American interpreters to sort through the library's books and identify those that might contain messages that could pose a security risk.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt;
By the time the interpreters were finished, nearly 2,000 volumes, including copies of the Quran and other religious texts, had been set aside for removal. According to the investigation, one interpreter reported that up to 75 percent of the books in the library contained extremist content. But high-ranking Afghan religious officials who conducted their own inquiry said at the time that they doubted the writing in the books was anything other than personal notations, and that some of it was simply notes of detainees' imprisonment, their names, their fathers' names and the locations and times of their arrest.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt; Still, the books were deemed "sensitive material" by American military officials, who said they decided to burn them because there was no place to store them all.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt; and so soldiers were ordered to remove the books as contraband.&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt;

In all, about 2,000 books, including Qurans and other religious material, were set to be destroyed. An Afghan National Army soldier and an interpreter warned the troops not to dispose of the religious texts, but soldiers took some 100 books to the burn pit anyway.&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt; As workers began heaving them into the flames, an Afghan laborer offered to help – and then started screaming when he realized what they were.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt; He grabbed a front-end loader and doused the entire burn pit to extinguish the flames.&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt; The Afghan laborer also called for help from other workers, and they turned off the burner and began to douse the flames with water.&lt;ref name="APUSAToday20120727" /&gt; The Americans immediately stopped, but by then at least four Qurans had been badly burned.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt; An angry crowd of Afghans gathered around the U.S. service members who drove the truck to the burn pit and were burning the material.&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt; The three service members disposing of the books "became frightened by the growing, angry crowd and rapidly departed the area" in the truck, the investigation said.&lt;ref name="APUSAToday20120727" /&gt;

"I absolutely reject any suggestion that those involved acted with any malicious intent to disrespect the Quran or defame the faith of Islam," an investigator, Brigadier General Bryan Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. troops punished over Koran burning, urination video|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/28/us-usa-afghanistan-idUSBRE87Q0PP20120828|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 September 2012|author=Phil Stewart and David Alexander|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote. "Ultimately, this was a tragic incident (that) resulted from a lack of cross-talk between leaders and commanders, a lack of senior involvement in giving clear guidance in a complex operation" and "distrust among our service members and our partners."&lt;ref name="NBCNews20120827" /&gt; The investigators of the incident concluded that the involved soldiers did not follow proper procedures, were ignorant of the importance of the Quran to Afghans and got no clear guidance from their leaders in a chain of mistakes.&lt;ref name="NYTNDTV20120828" /&gt; Specifically, the report found that the service members relied too heavily on one linguist's conclusion that the Qurans, which also had militant messages in them, were rewritten versions that were extremist and would not be considered real Qurans. It also said the service members mistakenly interpreted a commander's order to get rid of the books as permission to take them to the burn pit. The report also found that only one of the service members assigned to transport the books to the burn pit knew they were carrying religious books.

The punishments remain on a service member's permanent record and can prevent further promotion.&lt;ref name="ABCNews20120827" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8967">{{about||the novel|Advise and Consent|the 1962 film starring Henry Fonda and Don Murray|Advise &amp; Consent}}
 
'''Advice and consent''' is an English phrase frequently used in [[List of enacting formulae|enacting formulae]] of [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s and in other legal or constitutional contexts. It may describe two situations, either where a weak [[executive branch]] of a government [[enactment of a bill|enacts]] something previously approved of by the [[legislative branch]] or where the legislative branch concurs and approves something previously enacted by a strong executive branch.

==General==
The concept serves to moderate the power of one branch of government by requiring the concurrence of another branch for selected actions. The expression is frequently used in weak executive systems where the [[head of state]] has little practical power, and in practice the important part of the passage of a law is in its adoption by the [[legislature]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[constitutional monarchy]], bills are headed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;BE IT ENACTED by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the [[House of Lords|Lord]]s [[Lords Spiritual|Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]], in this present [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[enacting formula]] emphasizes that, although legally the bill is being enacted by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] (specifically, by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]]), it is not through her initiative but through that of Parliament that legislation is created.

==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wesley Clark]] --&gt;
{{United States Senate}}
{{Further|List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation}}

In the [[United States]], "advice and consent" is a power of the [[United States Senate]] to be consulted on and approve treaties signed and [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|appointments]] made by the [[President of the United States]] to public positions, including Cabinet secretaries, [[federal judge]]s, [[United States Attorney]]s, and ambassadors. This power is also held by several [[state Senate]]s, which are consulted on and approve various appointments made by the state's chief executive, such as some statewide officials, state departmental heads in the Governor's cabinet, and state judges (in some states).

=== Constitutional provision ===
{{Main|Appointments Clause}}

The term "advice and consent" first appears in the [[United States Constitution]] in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, referring to the senate's role in the signing and ratification of treaties. This term is then used again, to describe the Senate's role in the appointment of public officials, immediately after describing the president's duty to nominate officials. Article II, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the [[United States Constitution]] states:

{{quote|[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]], and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.}}

This language was written at the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] as part of a delicate compromise concerning the balance of power in the federal government. Many delegates preferred to develop a strong executive control vested in the president, while others, worried about authoritarian control, preferred to strengthen the Congress. Requiring the president to gain the advice and consent of the Senate achieved both goals without hindering the business of government.

Under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]], appointments to the office of Vice President are confirmed by a majority vote in both Houses of Congress, instead of just the Senate.

=== Historical development of power ===
While several framers of the U.S. Constitution, such as the Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, believed that the required role of the Senate is to advise the President ''after'' the nomination has been made by the President,&lt;ref&gt;Currie, David.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=nC4KbZVBeYgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA25 ''The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period, 1789–1801''], page 25 (University of Chicago Press 1997) via Google Books: "Madison, Jefferson, and Jay all advised Washington not to consult the Senate before making nominations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [http://www.votesmart.org/reference/fedlist/fed76.htm ''Federalist No. 76''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023075214/http://www.votesmart.org/reference/fedlist/fed76.htm |date=October 23, 2008 }} (1788): “In the act of nomination, his judgment alone will be exercised.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Sherman]] believed that advice ''before'' nomination could still be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_2_2-3s46.html Letter from Roger Sherman to John Adams] (July 1789) in ''The Founders Constitution'': "their advice may enable him to make such judicious appointments."&lt;/ref&gt; President [[George Washington]] took the position that pre-nomination advice was allowable but not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Nominations.htm U.S. Senate history on the power to advise and consent]: "In selecting nominees, Washington turned to his closest advisers and to members of Congress, but the president resolutely insisted that he alone would be responsible for the final selection. He shared a common view that the Senate's constitutionally mandated 'advice' was to come after the nomination was made."&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion that pre-nomination advice is optional has developed into the unification of the "advice" portion of the power with the "consent" portion, although several Presidents have consulted informally with Senators over nominations and treaties.

=== Use today ===
Typically, a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] is held to question an appointee prior to a committee vote. If the nominee is approved by the relevant committee, the nomination is sent to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The actual motion adopted by the Senate when exercising the power is "to advise and consent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXX U.S. Senate Rule 30]: "On the final question to advise and consent to the ratification in the form agreed to, the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be necessary to determine it in the affirmative."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXXI U.S. Senate Rule 31]: "the final question on every nomination shall be, 'Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?'"&lt;/ref&gt; For appointments, a majority of Senators present are needed to pass a motion "to advise and consent". A filibuster requiring a three-fifths vote to override, as well as other similar delaying tactics, have been used to require higher vote tallies in the past. 

On November 21, 2013, the Democratic Party, led by then-Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], overrode the filibuster of a nomination with a simple [[majority vote]] to [[nuclear option|change the rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/21/the-senate-just-got-rid-of-part-of-the-filibuster/ |title=It's official: The Senate just got rid of part of the filibuster |first=Brad |last=Plumer |date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, for instance, judicial nominees to federal courts and a president's executive-branch nominations can be freed up for a confirmation vote by a simple majority vote of the Senate. However, he left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees.

In April 2017, the Republican Party, led by Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], did the same for [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominations]], allowing [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Neil Gorsuch]] on the bench, despite what might have otherwise been a successful Democratic filibuster.

The '''Arabid race''' (also '''Orientalid race''') is a historical term for a morphological subtype of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid race]], as used in traditional [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Baker Race. — New York and London: Oxford University Press, 1974. — P. 625. {{ISBN|978-0-936396-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The Arabid race is thought to have originated within the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and it is currently predominant there as well. It is a major element in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Middle East]], and a minor element in other parts of [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref name=TROE1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI2.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in Arabia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type is known as ''Araboid'' in forensic pathology and anthropology. In the [[Near East]] region, it is heavily mixed with the [[Armenoid race]]. This Armenoid-Araboid hybrid type is alternatively known as the ''Assyrid''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, who were ancestral to the Lebanese and Syrians, also generally belonged to this type. Gulf Arabs, also known as [[Arabian]] Arabs or true Arabs, among whom are the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], [[Bahrain]]is, [[Kuwait]]is, southern Iraqis and the [[Bedouin]]s, are more frequently of classic Arabid type. In areas bordering the [[Iranian plateau]], the Arabid type also not seldom merges with the [[Irano-Afghan race]], a local Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name=TROE1/&gt;

In parts of [[North Africa]], primarily among the Arabic-speaking Bedouin herders of the deserts and oases of the [[Maghreb]] and [[Egypt]], the Arabid type fuses with another local Mediterranean subtype, the [[Hamitic]], to produce a new hybrid morphological type. The Hamitic type, however, predominates throughout, especially among the [[Berbers]] as well as the [[Copts]] and [[Fellah]]in, since it is the taxon to which belonged most [[Ancient Libyan]]s and [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, respectively.&lt;ref name=TROE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI9.htm|title=The modern Egyptians|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI12.htm|title=The Tuareg|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI13.htm|title=Eastern Barbary, Algeria and Tunisia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, minor Arabid element is found in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]], having been introduced from the [[Persian Gulf]] region in historic times by the first Islamic proselytizers as well as the adjacent [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] and [[Sabaeans]] of [[Hadhramaut]]. However, here again the Arabid element is secondary to the predominant Hamitic type of the region's first [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamito-Semitic]] speakers, who were ancestral to the [[Somalis]], [[Habesha people|Abyssinians]] and other [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI8.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in East Africa|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sudan]] area, classic Arabid types can be found among the [[Kababish]] and certain other Arabic-speaking desert tribes collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. Here, they often occur in solution with the local Hamitic Mediterranean type, which was the morphological taxon to which belonged the [[A-Group Culture|A-Group]], [[C-Group Culture|C-Group]] and [[Meroe|Meroitic]] culture makers, among certain other early populations in the region. Elsewhere, Arabid elements fuse with the [[Negroid]] type of the region's indigenous [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] speakers, the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]], thereby producing an [[Afro-Arab]] hybrid type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2843546|title=Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|first=C. G.|last=Seligmann|date=28 October 2017|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=43|pages=593–705|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/2843546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], a rather tall, gracile, progressive, procopomorphic and high-skulled South Mediterranean type related to the Hamitic variety of North Africa is the predominant element. However, instead of Arabid, it is usually mixed here with low-skulled, long-skulled ([[dolichocephalic]]), short-statured Berid and West Mediterranid subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races4.htm|title=Systematic Appendix: The Races of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races.htm|title=The living races and peoples of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
The Arabid race is distinguished from the West-Mediterranean race by some minor characteristic facial traits. The Arabid physical type had in earlier times a broader-formed Syrid subtype, which was found among the farmers of the [[Fertile Crescent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5456">[[File:Arne Anka (comic book).jpg|thumb|right|Arne Anka]]
'''Arne Anka''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[comic strip]] drawn by [[Charlie Christensen]] under the [[pseudonym]] ''Alexander Barks'' from 1983 to 1995 and 2006 and forward. The title character closely resembles [[Donald Duck]] (who is called ''Kalle Anka'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/christensen_charlie.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The likeness with Donald Duck is only feather deep, however; the comics often take place at a bar, ''Zeke's'', where Arne gets drunk while he cynically thinks about and discusses life. This usually happens in the company of his friend, ''Krille Krokodil'' ("''Krille [[Crocodile]]''"). In other situations, Arne is found walking, with friends or alone, and occasionally he is found in a completely different setting (albeit with the same group of friends), like ancient Rome or 18th century Paris. Always, however, he comments on life and (especially Swedish) society with sharp wit.

Some distinct features about Arne Anka is deep love for Swedish poetry and literature, his miserable economy, his very high alcohol consumption and his enthusiasm towards women - even though he has very little luck with any such connections.

Charlie Christensen uses his friends as inspiration for the characters and story's in Arne Anka. One of his friends has said that you sometimes notice that Charlie Christensen gets a particular look and then a few weeks later you read what you just said in an Arne Anka strip.

In 1997, a few pages were translated to English in connection with an exhibition of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] comics in France, and the publication of an English-language anthology. In this translation, the character was given the name "Arnie the Duck".

== The Disney threat ==
In the beginning of the 1990s, [[The Walt Disney Company]] threatened to sue the author, [[Charlie Christensen]], due to Arne Anka's similarity with [[Donald Duck]]. As a response, Charlie Christensen drew a comic strip about Arne faking his own death, so that he could have plastic surgery done to his beak in secrecy. Arne then returned with a new, pointed beak, and the pseudonym ''Alexander Barks'' was changed to ''Alexander X''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/christensen_charlie.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
After a while though, Arne went to a novelty store to buy a fake beak, which looked exactly like his old one. This new beak was drawn showing a small rubber band holding it in place until the threat of being sued was withdrawn. In the meanwhile, however, Disney's threat of a lawsuit, which received very extensive publicity in Sweden, had turned Arne Anka into a Swedish independence hero and increased his popularity manyfold.

== Theater play ==
In 1995, Arne Anka was produced as a play at [[Stockholm City Theatre]] (Stockholms Stadsteater). The play was written by Christensen himself, and it was called "Arne Anka - en afton på Zekes" ("''Arne Anka - an evening at Zeke's''"), starring [[Robert Gustafsson]] as Arne.

== Comeback ==
In December 2006, after more than ten years of absence, Arne made his comeback in Christensen's ''Arne Anka, Part V: Återuppståndelsen (The resurrection)''.
When we meet him now, he is divorced with two kids, pays child support and, if possible, has even worse finances than in the past.

'''Belizean Americans''' are [[Americans]] who are of [[Belizean people|Belizean]] ancestry. These ancestors might be from [[Belize]] or of its diaspora.

==Diaspora==
About one out of every three Belizeans now live overseas and outside of Belize; the majority have migrated to [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, especially the [[United States]], where there are some 54,925 Belizeans,&lt;ref name="2010census"/&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]], with around 3,000 Belizeans. Smaller numbers now live in Canada.

Kriols and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest [[U.S. Census]], Belizeans in the United States are primarily of the [[Belizean Creole people|Kriol]] and [[Garifuna people|Garinagu]] ethnic groups of African, Native American and European descent, who are considered Black in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov "Diaspora of Belize"] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, there were about 10,000 Belizean Americans citizens in the United States.&lt;ref name="1990census"/&gt;

'''Bridge law''' is the body of laws which apply to [[bridge]]s in a particular jurisdiction.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], legislative authority to erect a bridge is necessary in three cases: first, when toll is demanded for its use—the right to take toll being a [[Franchising|franchise]] which cannot be claimed without express grant from the [[U.S. state|state]]; second, when the state owns the bed of the stream over which the bridge extends, as is the case in all public or navigable streams; third, when the structure interferes or threatens to interfere with navigation. In the last case the authority of state governments is subject to the power given to [[United States Congress|Congress]] by the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] to “regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states.” (Art. I., §8.) The states may authorize bridges over navigable streams, and may regulate their size, form, and manner of construction. Until Congress intervenes in such cases the power of the states is unlimited. When it does intervene, however, its will is supreme, and its legislation, within the limits of the constitutional grant, overrides that of any state. A bridge constructed over a navigable river in accordance with an act of Congress is a lawful structure, however much it may interfere with the public right of [[navigation]].

'''''Bullshot Crummond''''' is a [[parody]] [[Play (theatre)|stage play]] of the British pulp hero [[Bulldog Drummond]]. The play was based on an idea by [[Ron House|Ronald E. House]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396697&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samuelfrench.com/author/2113/ron-house&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diz White]], was written in 1974 and first performed that year, by [[Ron House|House]], [[Diz White|White]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924716&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Neville-Andrews]], [[Alan Shearman]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790474&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Derek Cunningham]] at the Palladium Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was later made into a 1983 [[film]], ''[[Bullshot (film)|Bullshot]]''

==Synopsis==
The play concerns a pre-WWII plot by the dastardly Count Otto Von Brunno and his ambiguous relation Lenya Von Brunno to ruin the international diamond market by kidnapping Professor Rupert Fenton.  Working against them are Hugh "Bullshot" Crummond and Rosemary Fenton (the professor's daughter).  The characters are highly stereotypical: Otto a [[Germany|German]] [[supervillain]], Lenya a [[femme fatale]], Fenton an [[absent-minded professor]], Rosemary a [[damsel in distress]] who faints and runs around in her underwear, and Crummond a highly intelligent and quick-witted hero.  (However, at many times during the play, humor arises because Crummond fails to notice something very obvious, or because he is easily defeated in a fight.)

Much of the play's humor comes from its audacious (and intentionally failed) efforts to recreate film effects onstage.  Examples include:
*At the beginning of the show, the Von Brunnos are piloting an airplane to England, then parachute out.  This is represented by a model of a German aircraft dangling in front of the theatre curtain, then two dolls being tossed onto the stage from behind the curtain.  The lights black out, and when they come back on, the actors playing Otto and Lenya are onstage, covered by parachutes.
*There is an onstage "car chase" between the heroes and villains.  Lenya and Otto stand behind a large cut-out of a car and "see" Crummond following them on the road.  Then, a quick change takes place, leaving Rosemary and Crummond standing behind exactly the same cutout.  This effect repeats itself until Crummond's car plunges over a cliff.
*Lenya has a pet falcon named Fritz—really a mechanical bird that flaps its wings when the actress moves her arm.
*At one point, Otto "mimics" the Professor's voice to trick Crummond.  In reality, the actor playing the Professor speaks with his mouth hidden from view, and the Otto actor lip-synchs.

Other humor arises from the plot, which relies on bizarre coincidences and unlikely events.  For instance, when Crummond and Rosemary are in a tight spot, they manage to catch a wild carrier pigeon and have it convey a message from them; or a mysterious assassin steals an important letter, but because the letter had tea spilled on it, its ink stained a cloth napkin, so that Crummond can still figure out what it said.  Otto's plots to kill Crummond include poison, a tarantula's bite, a stick of dynamite triggered by the "Converse Force Field," and a sword fight.  The play is structured more as an excuse for comic gags than as an actually coherent plot.

The show is designed to be performed by only five actors, one of whom plays seven characters: Professor Fenton; Crummond's friend Algy; a Chinese assassin; a local police officer; a waiter in a hotel restaurant; a one-armed Scotland Yard inspector (who is really one of Otto's henchmen in disguise); and a Cockney crook.  In addition, the actor playing Otto plays Salvatore Scalicio, a [[Chicago]] [[gangster]], in a [[quick-change (stage)|quick-change]] scene where he repeatedly switches between Otto and Salvatore.

The '''Calico Early Man Site''' is an archaeological site in an ancient Pleistocene lake located near [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] in [[San Bernardino County]] in the  central [[Mojave Desert]] of southern [[California]]. This site is on and in late middle-[[Pleistocene]] [[fanglomerate]]s (now-cemented alluvial debris flow deposits) known variously as the Calico Hills, the Yermo Hills, or the Yermo formation. Holocene evidence includes petroglyphs and trail segments that are probably related to outcrops of local high-quality siliceous rock (primarily [[chalcedony]] in freshwater [[limestone]]).

The Calico Early Man Site includes:
* Artifacts of the [[Lake Manix]] [[Lithic technology|Lithic]] Industry (LMLI) found on and just below the surface at elevations greater than {{convert|543|m|abbr=on}}, the shoreline elevation of a {{convert|236|km2|abbr=on}} freshwater Pleistocene lake which emptied approximately 18,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Material recovered from nested [[Pleistocene]] [[Alluvium|alluvial deposits]] stratigraphically beneath a 100,000-year-old soil profile: a 'rock ring' (not a fire hearth) dated to 135,000 years by [[thermoluminescence]] (TL), about 200,000 years by uranium-series analysis, and about 197,000+/- 20,000 years by surface beryllium-10 (&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be) dating.
* The Rock Wren [[Biface]], a large well-formed biface tool recovered from a younger nested-inset alluvial deposit at Calico: dated by sediment thermoluminescence (sediment TL) to 14,400 ±2,200 years year ago.  A test pit located near the discovery location is currently being excavated and is yielding artifactual material.

The tools and flakes of LMLI and those found in the nested inset known as the Rock Wren Locality were probably made by modern man (''Homo sapiens sapiens'').

==Introduction==
The stone tools of these industries, along with [[Lithic reduction#Preform|preforms]], [[lithic core]], [[Lithic flake|technical flakes]], and pieces of angular [[debitage]], mainly of [[chalcedony]], are found on and in late middle Pleistocene-age [[fanglomerate]]s and younger inset [[Fluvial terrace|alluvial terrace]]s in the Calico Hills (also known as the Yermo Hills) east of the [[Calico Peaks]] and the [[Calico Mountains (California)|Calico Mountains]].  The location is in the central portion of southern California's [[Mojave Desert]]. Historically, this archaeological project has also been known as "The Calico Mountains Archaeological Site" and "The Calico Hills Archaeological Site".  Today, it is called "The Calico Early Man Site".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/barstow/calico.html U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Calico Early Man Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manix Basin ===
In most of the [[Great Basin]] region, [[Late Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] [[Alluvium|alluviation]] has effectively buried and sealed earlier [[Pleistocene]] [[sediment]]s and possible evidence of pre-[[Clovis culture]]s. In the Manix Basin (Lower Mojave Valley) of [[San Bernardino County, California]], however, a fortuitous ensemble of environmental factors relating to mountain building; climatically controlled conditions for lake formation, alluviation, and [[erosion]]; faulting and folding; and significant erosion of ancient [[lacustrine plain]] sediments by the modern drainage have rendered relatively accessible for archaeological investigation a series of deposits that represent more than 350,000 years of [[Quaternary]] history.

The Manix Basin, a [[structural basin]] in the central [[Mojave Desert]], is the third and lowest major valley of the [[Mojave River]], presently an exotic stream with episodic flow, which has its source in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]], some {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast.

A freshwater lake developed in the basin about 400,000 – 500,000 years ago near the Calico Archaeological Site. The lake was present until the late [[Pleistocene]].  The last high stand of [[Lake Manix]] was at {{convert|543|m|abbr=on}} and had a surface area of approximately {{convert|236|km2|abbr=on}}. This lake drained, probably catastrophically, approximately 18,100 years ago, probably as a result of a major increase in river inflow or tectonic movement on the Manix fault.&lt;ref name=CEMS&gt;[http://www.calicodig.org/text?page=4 Calico Early Man Site: The Setting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossils==
The lacustrine, fluvial, and alluvial sediments of the Pleistocene Manix Formation contain remains of numerous [[Rancholabrean]] animals ranging in age from approximately 20,000 years to well in excess of 350,000 years before present.&lt;ref name=CEMS/&gt; Fossils recovered from the section include: camel, horse, mammoth, saber-tooth cat, dire wolf, short-faced bear, coyote, flamingo, pelican, eagle, swan, geese, mallard duck, ruddy duck, canvas backed duck, double-crested cormorant, grebe, crane, seagull and stork.&lt;ref name=CEMS/&gt;

==Prehistoric tools==
Thousands of rocks that bear a strong resemblance to [[Stone tool|prehistoric tools]] have been found at the site, both on the surface, and up to {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} below the surface. A stone from the Master Pit had been dated to over 200,000 [[years before present|BP]]. However, this date could have been the result of contamination from other elements in the soil, so currently there is an effort to date verified lithics through thermoluminesence dating. While the results are still pending, the styles suggest 20,000 to 30,000 BP.

The debate centers on whether the "tools" were made by humans (i.e., [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]), or through typical [[geological]] processes (i.e. [[geofact]]s). The general scientific consensus is that the subsurface items are geofacts.&lt;ref&gt;See Haynes, as one example. Published studies in peer-reviewed journals consistently support the "geofact" explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artifacts or geofacts?==
The artifactual character of the Calico lithic assemblage has been questioned (Haynes 1973; Payen 1982a, 1982b; Taylor and Payen 1979; Duvall and Venner 1979).  Haynes (1973) postulated that rock fracturing by tectonic stresses, weather, rock-on-rock percussion in streams and mudflows, pressure retouch of buried cobbles, and successive generations of flake removal and separation from cores through cycles of erosion and redeposition could have occurred during deposition of the alluvial deposits at Calico and produced specimens indistinguishable from artifacts.

Specimens collected from earlier excavations up to the present are under analysis by archaeologists volunteering at the Calico site. Many have been confirmed to be geofacts, but some are believed to be potential artifacts and have been cataloged and submitted for thermoluminescent dating. Currently work is being done on compiling and publishing the most recent finds at the site to be submitted to the local tribes, community and journals for peer review.

=== Flake scar angles ===
Payen (1982) studied flake scar angles as traits for distinguishing artifacts from geofacts.  He tested a method developed by Barnes (1939) who had compared frequency of obtuse angles on eoliths, natural fractures, and artifacts.  Barnes found obtuse angles on 72% of eoliths, 75% of natural fractures, and 18% of artifacts and concluded that “The flaked tools of an industry…may be considered to be of human origin if not more than 25% of the angles scar-platform are obtuse (90° and over)” (Barnes 1939:111).  Payen measured all flake angles on each Calico specimen in his sample.  It is conceivable that flake scars were confused for striking platforms.  Flaking from one side of a specimen can often remove earlier platform areas on the other side.  Angles between two flake scars are different from angles between platforms and derivative flake scars.

Payen compared mean angle values for Calico specimens with those on specimens selected as representing controlled and uncontrolled fracture.  He found that “Statistically, there is no significant difference between the sample of alleged tools and the uncontrolled fracture series.”  (Payen 1982:200).

Duvall and Venner (1979:462) examined a sample of Calico artifacts and concluded they were form-selected examples of naturally flaked rocks.  Their assessment was based on variances in seven attributes (length, width, thickness, flake angle, medial axis angle lateral edge angle, and distal edge angle) and comparison with comparable attributes on specimens in eight Paleoindian collections reported by Wilmsen (1970).

=== Current consensus ===
Both the Duvall/Venner and the Payen papers have been criticized on a number of levels, and analyses supporting the pro-artifact argument have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The present consensus is that there is no evidence of human activity at the Calico Early Man site. This consensus developed based on a number of factors, including:

*The lack of other evidence of human activity (e.g. human or animal remains, or non-tool artifacts).
*The deep antiquity of the site (the next oldest date for human artifacts in the Americas is 30,000 BP, and that date itself is controversial).
*The sheer number of possible tools, up to 60,000 by one account.&lt;ref&gt;AmericanWest's Calico Site Update&lt;/ref&gt;
*The research by Duvall/Venner, Payen, and others providing possible natural explanations for the stone objects.

=== Current research ===
Archaeologists volunteering at the site have painstakingly gone through previous findings, and believe that some show enough evidence to rule them out as geofacts. These findings need to be published and undergo peer review before it can be determined whether there is a new consensus. Present focus is on:

*Looking for habitation sites and human activity near the site.
*Submitting confirmed artifacts for dating analysis.
*Taking into account that there are geofacts on the site and removing them from the findings.
*Writing current and informative articles on what is being found on the site.
 
Favoring the interpretation of the questionable objects as stone tools is the fact that they closely resemble classic Paleolithic artifacts (Acheulean, Clactonian), and are sharp-edged and thus not "flaked" by attrition in streams or debris flows where random impacts blunt sharp edges rather than creating them.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In the best examples multiple flakes have been removed in a patterned manner designed to produce serrate or denticulate edges not seen in natural rock breakage.  The presumed chalcedony artifacts are found in close association with andesitic cobbles that are thoroughly decayed and friable, attesting to a greater-than-100,000-year-age for the enclosing deposit, based on universally-accepted geologic and geomorphologic criteria.

==History of excavations==
[[File:CalicoVisitorCenter 8521.jpg|thumb|Visitor center, June 2010]]
In 1959 [[Louis Leakey]], while at the [[British Museum of Natural History]] in [[London]], received a visit from [[Ruth DeEtte Simpson]], an archaeologist from California. Simpson had acquired what looked like ancient [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s from a site in the Calico Hills and showed it to Leakey.

Leakey viewed it as important to study the Calico Hill site,&lt;ref name=morell266-267&gt;Morell, pp. 266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; as he was convinced that the number and distribution of native languages in the Americas required more time than 12,000 years to evolve and acquire their current distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Calico Site Update.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Leakey obtained funds from the [[National Geographic Society]] and commenced [[archaeological excavation]]s with Simpson. Excavations in an area stratigraphically separate from a verified 10,000-year-old Paleoindian site were carried out by Leakey and Simpson, who believed that they had located stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that were dated 100,000 years or older, suggesting a human presence in North America much earlier than estimated.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron B. Wesson ''Historical dictionary of early North America'' 2005, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Jeffrey Goodman]] who worked at the site with Leakey had also claimed the stone artifacts to be human made. Goodman has also made controversial statements that the artifacts found at Calico Hills may be as old as 500,000 years and if proven would be the oldest human artifacts in the world, which would place [[human evolution|human origins]] in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Regal ''Human evolution: a guide to the debates'' 2004, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; However the majority of scientists have rejected these claims, according to [[Kenneth Feder]] "Goodman's claims were not backed up with even a shred of evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Feder ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum'' 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The geologist [[Vance Haynes]] had made three visits to the site in 1973 and had claimed that the artifacts of Leakey were naturally formed [[geofacts]]. According to Haynes, the geofacts were formed by stones becoming fractured in an ancient river on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen ''After the ice: a global human history, 20,000-5000 BC'' 2006, p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

In her autobiography, [[Mary Leakey]] wrote that because of Louis's involvement with the Calico Hills site she had lost academic respect for him, and that the Calico excavations was "catastrophic to his professional career and was largely responsible for the parting of our ways".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Leakey ''Disclosing the past'' 1984 pp. 142-144&lt;/ref&gt; She did not share his visionary views about the Calico site. She regarded Louis as often slipping into incompetence and often publicized that opinion.&lt;ref name="morell266-267" /&gt; Louis Leakey continued to visit the site several times a year and was connected with the project until his death in 1972. The site was taken over by California's [[Bureau of Land Management]] and was opened to the public.

Presently, the site is open to the public and offers a visitor center, gift shop, and guided walking tour. It also provides students and volunteers interested in archaeology the opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation. Archaeologists on the site provide instruction in excavation techniques and give a hands-on education to those who are interested and willing to get their hands dirty. More information on these digs can be found on the Calico Mountains Archaeological Site under events.&lt;ref&gt;http://calicoarchaeology.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24671">'''Corporate welfare''' is a term that [[Analogy|analogizes]] corporate [[subsidy|subsidies]] to [[Welfare|welfare payments]] for the poor.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristof |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |title=A Nation of Takers? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/opinion/kristof-a-nation-of-takers.html |date=March 27, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to describe a government's bestowal of [[Grant (money)|money grants]], [[tax break]]s, or other special favorable treatment for [[corporation]]s. It highlights how wealthy corporations are less in need of such treatment than the poor.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"/&gt;

The definition of corporate welfare is sometimes restricted to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions, which, in practice, could be worth much more than any direct subsidies.

== Origin of term ==
The term "corporate welfare" was reportedly invented in 1956 by [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== "Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor" ===
Believed to have been first popularised by [[Michael Harrington]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Other America]]''&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1962, p.170, quote: "socialism for the rich and private enterprise for the poor"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P.

=== "Privatizing profits and socializing losses" ===
"Privatizing profits and socializing losses" refers to the idea that corporations want to reserve financial gains for themselves and pass along losses to the rest of society, potentially through lobbying the government for assistance. This practice was criticized in the [[Wall Street bailout]] of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatizing-profits-and-socializing-losses.asp|title=Privatizing Profits And Socializing Losses|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=15 April 2012|website=investopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
[[Subsidies]] considered excessive, unwarranted, wasteful, unfair, inefficient, or bought by [[lobbying]] are often called corporate welfare.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; The label of corporate welfare is often used to decry projects advertised as benefiting the general welfare that spend a disproportionate amount of funds on large corporations, and often in uncompetitive, or [[anti-competitive]] ways. For instance, in the United States, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] are usually portrayed as helping independent farmers stay afloat. However, the majority of income gained from commodity support programs actually goes to large [[agribusiness]] corporations such as [[Archer Daniels Midland]], as they own a considerably larger percentage of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm USDA: American Farms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210035144/http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm |date=2007-02-10 }} www.USDA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Independent ====
Daniel D. Huff, [[professor emeritus]] of [[social work]] at [[Boise State University]], published a comprehensive analysis of corporate welfare in 1993.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phantom Welfare: Public Relief for Corporate America |journal=Social Work |date=May 1993 |first=Daniel D. |last=Huff |author2=David A.

{{quote|In 1990 the federal government spent 4.7 billion dollars on all forms of international aid. Pollution control programs received 4.8 billion dollars of federal assistance while both secondary and elementary education were allotted only 8.4 billion dollars. More to the point, while more than 170 billion dollars is expended on assorted varieties of corporate welfare the federal government spends 11 billion dollars on Aid for Dependent Children. The most expensive means tested welfare program, Medicaid, costs the federal government 30 billion dollars a year or about half of the amount corporations receive each year through assorted tax breaks. S.S.I., the federal program for the disabled, receives 13 billion dollars while American businesses are given 17 billion in direct federal aid.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;}}

Huff argued that deliberate [[obfuscation]] was a complicating factor.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
In 2015, Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer in [[Social Policy]] at the [[University of York]] published a paper in which he claimed that the government was providing corporate subsidies of £93 billion.&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SPERI-Paper-24-The-British-Corporate-Welfare-State.pdf |title=The British Corporate Welfare State: Public Provision for Private Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake |title=The £93bn handshake: businesses pocket huge subsidies and tax breaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount includes the role of the government in increasing trade, tax relief for businesses that invest in new plants and machinery (estimated by Farnsworth at £20 billion), not charging fuel duty on fuel used by railways or airlines, green energy subsidies, a lower corporation tax rate for small companies, [[regional development]] grants and government procurement for businesses (which Farnsworth suggests often favours British businesses even when these are not the best value option available).&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper /&gt; However, ''[[The Register]]'' wrote that Farnsworth's figure for tax relief for investment was incorrect and that he had made mistakes in his calculations, noting that he was not an accountant. It also stated that not charging businesses taxes under certain circumstances (when the reliefs applied) was not the same as giving them a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/12/political_memes_economics_corporate_welfare/?page=1 |title=Taxpayers are NOT giving businesses £93bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel duty is not charged on airlines due to the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|Convention on International Civil Aviation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/doc7300.aspx |title=Convention on International Civil Aviation}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[United Nations|UN agency]]) which specifies that aeroplanes should be exempt from fuel duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/factchecks/airline_industry_subsidies_green_taxes-3256 |title=Does the government subsidise airlines by £10 billion?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political discussion ===
In 2015, [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said he would “strip out” the £93bn of “corporate tax relief and subsidies” Farnsworth referred to and use the proceeds for public investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-allies-accuse-chris-leslie-of-deliberately-misrepresenting-labour-leader-contenders-economic-policies-10436258.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn allies accuse Chris Leslie of deliberately misrepresenting Labour frontrunner's economic policies | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Andrew|last=Grice|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbyn did not say which specific policies he would change. ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote the policy "sounds wonderful, but careful scrutiny of 'corporate welfare' shows that it includes capital allowances designed to persuade companies to invest, regional aid to boost growth in rundown parts of the UK, and subsidies to keep bus and rail routes open – none of which Corbyn would presumably like to see stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tory-economy-plans |title=Jeremy Corbyn has the vision, but his numbers don’t yet add up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
The [[New Democratic Party]] in [[Canada]] picked up the term as a major theme in its [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 federal election]] campaign. Its leader, [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], used the term in the title of his 1972 book, ''Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louder voices: the corporate welfare bums|last=Lewis|first=David|publisher=James Lewis &amp; Samuel|year=1972|isbn=9780888620316|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor the [[Canadian Alliance]] were known for opposing mostly business subsidies. However, after their merger with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidates, 1997 Canadian federal election|Progressive Conservative]] party, they dropped their opposition  to it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zxjshaowfeYC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;dq=reform+party+corporate+welfare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDUyasx11z&amp;sig=B8UXPouQ_G4D-7uKOFfwNe5J3Ok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-k5v3oa3dAhXJmVkKHVqVCT04FBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=reform%20party%20corporate%20welfare&amp;f=false|title=A Nation of Serfs: How Canada's Political Culture Corrupts Canadian Values|last=Milke|first=Mark|date=2010-01-14|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470675175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
It was observed by [[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]] that the [[Effective tax rate]] was low for the larger corporations which meant companies making smaller profits are competing in an unequal environment against bigger companies with substantial taxation benefits, with the gap in effective tax rates widening over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewire.in/economy/why-52911-profitable-indian-companies-pay-0-tax|title=Why 52,911 Profitable Indian Companies Pay 0% Tax |website=The Wire|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's Union government's prime minister criticised this practice and said
{{quote| "Why is it that subsidies going to the well-off are portrayed in a positive manner? Let me give you an example. The total revenue loss from incentives to corporate tax payers was over Rs 62,000 crore…I must confess I am surprised by the way words are used by experts on this matter. When a benefit is given to farmers or to the poor, experts and government officers normally call it a subsidy. However, I find that if a benefit is given to industry or commerce, it is usually an ‘incentive’ or a ‘subvention'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/modi-calls-for-targeted-subsidies-questions-corporate-tax-breaks/story-IP1WX17PvJeyOfyLf0ZXxJ.html|title=Modi calls for targeted subsidies, questions corporate tax breaks|date=2016-01-30|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Fair Housing Act''' is a federal act in the [[United States]] intended to protect the buyer or renter of a dwelling from seller or landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=legal-dict&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fair+Housing+Act+of+1968 Definition of ''Fair Housing Act of 1968'' ], Legal Dictionary at TheFreeDictionary.com, Farlex Company. Accessed 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after [[World War II]] that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The legislation was the culmination of a [[civil rights]] campaign against [[housing discrimination in the United States]] and was approved by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] one week after the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

The Fair Housing Act was enacted as Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], and codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_45_20_I.html 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619], with penalties for violation at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3631 42 U.S.C. 3631]. It is enforced by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights |title=Fair Housing - It's Your Right - HUD |publisher=Portal.hud.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The ''Fair Housing Act'' (Title VIII of the ''Civil Rights Act of 1968'') introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlaws:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Human skin color|color]], disability, [[religion]], [[sex]], familial status, or [[national origin]].
* Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin in the terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling.
* Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, disability or national origin.
* Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.

When the ''Fair Housing Act'' was first enacted, it prohibited [[discrimination]] only on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.&lt;ref name=hud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8 |title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity - HUD |publisher=Portal.hud.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex was added as a protected characteristic in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlihc.org/article/40-years-ago-fair-housing-act-amended-prohibit-discrimination-basis-sex|title=40 Years Ago: Fair Housing Act Amended to Prohibit Discrimination on Basis of Sex|author=|date=4 August 2014|website=nlihc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[disability]] and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990).&lt;ref name=hud/&gt; In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fairhousing.foxrothschild.com/2011/01/articles/fha-basics/exemptions-to-the-fair-housing-act-not-many-but-here-are-some/| title = Exemptions to the Fair Housing Act?

In 2017, a federal judge ruled that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected classes under the Fair Housing Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barbash|first1=Fred|title=Federal fair housing law protects LGBT couples, court rules for first time|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/06/federal-fair-housing-law-protects-lgbt-couples-court-rules-for-first-time/|accessdate=27 May 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fair housing ruling: Denver federal Judge Raymond Moore ruled that a landlord’s refusal to rent to a lesbian couple violated federal housing law|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/fair-housing-ruling/2400/|accessdate=27 May 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2018, there is an additional pending effort to amend the Fair Housing Act to make this explicit (HR 1447).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.1447 - Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2017|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1447|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meeting on May 16, 2018 with the [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR), Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who is campaigning for his 16th term, said he believed that homeowners should be allowed to refuse to sell their home to gay and lesbian homebuyers. NAR disagreed and withdrew its endorsement of the Congressman over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Amy|title=Refusing to sell homes to gay people is okay, GOP congressman says. Realtors disagree.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/26/refusing-to-sell-homes-to-gay-people-is-okay-gop-congressman-says-realtors-disagree/|accessdate=27 May 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the ''Fair Housing Act''. The [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] (FHEO) and HUD's Office of General Counsel.  FHEO is one of the United States' largest federal civil rights agencies.  It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of August 2017, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity [[Anna Maria Farias]], whose appointment was confirmed on August 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PN1349 — Anna Maria Farias|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/113th-congress/1349http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/senate-clears-trump-economic-nominees-before-clearing-out-of-washington/article/2630564|website=washingtonexaminer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and [[local government]]al agencies where "substantially equivalent" fair housing laws are in place. Under these agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO.  This is known as FHEO's [[Fair Housing Assistance Program]] (or "[[FHAP]]").

There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country.  Some are funded by FHEO's [[Fair Housing Initiatives Program]] (or "[[FHIP]]"), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources.

Victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights, however. The ''Fair Housing Act'' confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process.

The ''Fair Housing Act'' applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their [[primary residence]] only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house.

==Enforcement==
The ''Fair Housing Act'' has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the [[Government Accountability Office]], enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Government Accountability Office|title=Housing and community grants: HUD needs to enhance its requirements and oversight of jurisdictions’ fair housing plans|year=2010|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fontaine de Leda Paris..JPG|thumb|right|250px|Fontaine de Léda (1807)]]

The '''Fontaine de Léda''', also sometimes referred to as the '''Fontaine du Regard''', is a [[Paris|Parisian]] sculptural wall fountain built in 1806&amp;ndash;1808 during the reign of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The fountain depicts the legend of [[Leda and the Swan]], with a central bas-relief panel by [[Achille Valois]]. It was originally located at the corner of the [[rue de Vaugirard]] and rue du Regard, hence the alternative name; however, in 1864, during the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|reconstruction of Paris]] by Emperor [[Louis Napoleon]], the fountain was moved to the back side of the [[Medici Fountain]] in the [[Luxembourg Garden]], where it remains.

== History ==
The Fontaine de Léda was one of fifteen new Paris fountains commissioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in his decree of Saint Cloud on May 2, 1806. It was the project of the engineer responsible for the water supply of Paris, [[François-Jean Bralle]], and the young sculptor Achille Valois (1785&amp;ndash;1862). It was built against the wall of a private garden.&lt;ref&gt;Katia Frey, ''L'Enterprise napoléonienne'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fountain is composed of a bas-relief sculpture raised on a pedestal, between two pilasters with a pediment on top. An eagle, wings outspread and holding a crown of laurel, once decorated the pediment; it represented Napoleon's empire. The pilasters are decorated with sculptures of two intertwined dolphins: the one on the right around a ship's help, and the one on the left around a trident.

The bas-relief itself shows Leda and the swan surrounded by roses. In one corner, Cupid shoots an arrow from his bow. Leda holds the swan on her knees and the water flows from the beak of the swan, which is made of bronze. The water falls into a semi-elliptical basin at the foot of the fountain.

The fountain was condemned by the critic Amaury Duval in 1812 because of the subject of the bas-relief, [[Jupiter]] transforming himself into a swan to seduce Leda. He said, "Because of the ideas it calls to the imagination, this is hardly a suitable subject for a monument placed before the eyes of the public.".&lt;ref&gt;Katya Frey, Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the fountain was popular with the public. Its major failing was a lack of abundant water. Like all of the Paris fountains built before the completion of the canals and aqueducts commanded by Napoleon, it lacked water pressure; the water could only trickle in a thin stream from the Swan's beak.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the water problems of Paris fountains, see [[Fountains in Paris]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1850s, during Emperor [[Louis Napoleon]]'s reconstruction of the center of Paris, the Rue de Rennes was extended, and the wall against which the fountain was placed needed to be demolished. The architect of city parks and promenades, [[Gabriel Davioud]], himself a sculptor, sought a way to preserve the fountain. He searched in vain for a public park or building where he could put it, and finally settled upon the [[Luxembourg Garden]], where the [[Medici Fountain]] was in the process of being moved and rebuilt. The architect [[Alphonse de Gisors]] installed the Léda Fountain in its new home in 1864,&lt;ref&gt;The 1864 date is given by Poisson (1999), in his entry "Fontaine du Regard" on p. 209. He also mentions that the Klagmann sculptures were installed at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; attaching it to the back of the Medici Fountain and adding a demi-cupole on top and two [[naiades]] by the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann|fr}}, and three bronze masquerons, or spouts in the form of masks, at the bottom. It appears that another sculptor modified the pediment of the fountain to eliminate the eagle, the symbol of Napoleon's empire.&lt;ref&gt;See Home Page of the French Senate, http://www.senat.fr/visite/fontaine/orientale.html, the owner of the Gardens. This site has a picture of the fountain as it looked before it was moved to the Luxembourg Gardens. Gisors and Klagmann both died before the fall of Napoleon III in 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Globe Theatre''' was a theatre in London associated with [[William Shakespeare]]. It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare's [[playing company]], the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], on land owned by [[Thomas Brend]] and inherited by his son, [[Nicholas Brend]] and grandson [[Matthew Brend|Sir Matthew Brend]], and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler 1958, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed by an [[London theatre closure 1642|Ordinance issued on 6 September 1642]].&lt;ref name=britannica_globe&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1998 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named "[[Shakespeare's Globe]]", opened in 1997 approximately {{convert|230|m|ft|order=flip}} from the site of the original theatre.&lt;ref name="Measuredusing"&gt;Measured using [[Google earth]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1909, the current [[Gielgud Theatre]] was called "Globe Theatre", until it was renamed (in honour of [[John Gielgud]]) in 1994.

==Locations==
Examination of old property records has identified the plot of land occupied by the Globe as extending from the west side of modern-day [[Southwark Bridge Road]] eastwards as far as Porter Street and from Park Street southwards as far as the back of Gatehouse Square.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne; Shewring (1997: 69)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Braines|1924|pp=17–45}} However, the precise location of the building remained unknown until a small part of the foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now [[Museum of London Archaeology]]) beneath the car park at the rear of [[Anchor Terrace]] on Park Street.{{sfn|McCudden|1990}} The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface. As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67—70 Anchor Terrace, a [[listed building]], no further excavations have been permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Bowsher and Miller (2009: 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hollar Long View detail.png|thumb|left|Second Globe Theatre, detail from Hollar's ''View of London'', 1647. Hollar sketched the building from life (see top), but only later assembled the drawings into this ''View''; he mislabelled his images of The Globe and the nearby [[Hope Theatre|bear-baiting enclosure]]. Here the correct label has been restored. The small building to the left supplied food- and ale-sellers at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Cooper2006&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |editor=Cooper, Tarnya|title=Searching for Shakespeare |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-300-11611-3 |pages=92–93 |chapter=A view from St Mary Overy, Southwark, looking towards Westminster, c.1638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowsher; Miller (2009:112)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:London theatres C16—C17, after Redwood.png|thumb|The Globe Theatre is shown at the bottom centre of this London street map&lt;ref&gt;Location taken from Bowsher; Miller (2009:107)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Globe was owned by actors who were also shareholders in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. Two of the six Globe shareholders, [[Richard Burbage]] and his brother [[Cuthbert Burbage]], owned double shares of the whole, or 25% each; the other four men, [[Shakespeare]], [[John Heminges]], [[Augustine Phillips]], and [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], owned a single share, or 12.5%. (Originally [[William Kempe]] was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority sharers, leaving them with more than the originally planned 10%).&lt;ref&gt;Gurr (1991: 45–46)&lt;/ref&gt; These initial proportions changed over time as new sharers were added. Shakespeare's share diminished from 1/8 to 1/14, or roughly 7%, over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, pp. 648–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Globe was built in 1599 using [[Lumber|timber]] from an earlier theatre, [[The Theatre]], which had been built by Richard Burbage's father, [[James Burbage]], in [[Shoreditch]] in 1576. The Burbages originally had a 21-year [[lease]] of the site on which the theatre was built but owned the building outright. However, the landlord, Giles Allen, claimed that the building had become his with the expiry of the lease. On 28 December 1598, while Allen was celebrating Christmas at his country home, carpenter [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]], supported by the players and their friends, dismantled The Theatre beam by beam and transported it to Street's waterfront warehouse near [[Bridewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shapiro |first=James |authorlink=James S. Shapiro |year=2005 |title=1599—a year in the life of William Shakespeare |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |page=7 |isbn=0-571-21480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the [[River Thames|Thames]] to reconstruct it as The Globe on some marshy gardens to the south of Maiden Lane, Southwark. While only a hundred yards from the congested shore of the Thames, the piece of land was situated close by an area of farmland and open fields.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro (2005:  122–3; 129)&lt;/ref&gt; It was poorly drained and, notwithstanding its distance from the river, was liable to flooding at times of particularly high tide; a "wharf" (bank) of raised earth with timber [[revetment#Freshwater revetments|revetments]] had to be created to carry the building above the flood level.&lt;ref name =BM90&gt;Bowsher and Miller (2009: 90)&lt;/ref&gt; The new theatre was larger than the building it replaced, with the older timbers being reused as part of the new structure; the Globe was not merely the old Theatre newly set up at Bankside.&lt;ref&gt;Allen's court proceedings against Street and the Burbages noted that the timber from The Theatre was "sett up…in an other forme" at Bankside. Quoted in Bowsher and Miller (2009: 90)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Adams |first=John Cranford |year=1961 |title=The Globe Playhouse. Its design and equipment |edition=2 |publisher=John Constable |location=London |oclc=556737149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably completed by the summer of 1599, possibly in time for the opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and its famous reference to the performance crammed within a "wooden O".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bate |first1=Jonathan |authorlink1=Jonathan Bate |year=2007 |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Eric |title=William Shakespeare Complete Works |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=978-0-230-00350-7 |page=1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dover Wilson]], however, defers the opening date until September 1599, taking the "wooden O" reference to be disparaging and thus unlikely to be used in the Globe's inaugural staging. He suggests that a Swiss tourist's account of a performance of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' witnessed on 21 September 1599 describes the more likely first production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dover Wilson |first=John |authorlink=John Dover Wilson |year=1968 |title=The Works of Shakespeare—Julius Caesar |series=Cambridge New Shakespeare |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-09482-8 |page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first performance for which a firm record remains was [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]''—with its first scene welcoming the "gracious and kind spectators"—at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="BM90" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Sanders2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stern |first=Tiffany |year=2010 |editor=Sanders, Julie |title=Ben Jonson in Context |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-89571-5 |page=113 |chapter=The Globe Theatre and the open-air amphitheatres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 1613 the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a performance of ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''. A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man whose burning breeches were put out with a bottle of ale.&lt;ref name="wotton"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wotton |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Wotton |date=2 July 1613 |title=The Life and Letters of Sir Henry Wotton |editor=Smith, Logan Pearsall |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, England |volume=Two |pages=32–33 |chapter=Letters of Wotton |editor-link=Logan Pearsall Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt in the following year.

Like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the [[Puritan]]s in 1642. It was pulled down in 1644–45; the commonly cited document dating the act to 15 April 1644 has been identified as a probable forgery—&lt;!-- Or slightly later? Someone please confirm the date! --&gt;to make room for [[tenement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne; Shewring (1997: 75)&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern reconstruction of the theatre, named "[[Shakespeare's Globe]]", opened in 1997, with a production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.  It is an academic approximation of the original design, based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas.

In February 2016, a temporary full-scale replica of the Second Globe Theatre, called the [[Pop-up Globe]] and based on scholarly reanalyses of the surviving evidence for the 1614 building, opened in downtown [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], and presented a three-month season of Shakespeare's plays performed by a house company and by visiting local production groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Awde|first1=Nick|title=Shakespeare's Other Home in the Southern Hemisphere|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2016/shakespeares-other-home-in-the-southern-hemisphere/|website=thestage.co.uk|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reconstructed in a second Auckland location to host a three-month 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pop-up Globe to rise in the gardens at Ellerslie Racecourse|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/stage-and-theatre/85703490/popup-globe-to-rise-in-the-gardens-at-ellerslie-racecourse|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=Stuff|publisher=Fairfax NZ Ltd|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hodge's conjectural Globe reconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|Conjectural reconstruction of the Globe theatre by C. Walter Hodges based on archaeological and documentary evidence]]
The Globe's actual dimensions are unknown, but its shape and size can be approximated from scholarly inquiry over the last two centuries.&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;{{harvnb|Egan|1999|pp=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that it was a three-storey, open-air [[amphitheatre]] approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter that could house up to 3,000&amp;nbsp;spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orrell|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globe is shown as round on [[Wenceslas Hollar]]'s sketch of the building, later incorporated into his etched ''[[Long View of London from Bankside]]'' in 1647. However, in 1988–89, the uncovering of a small part of the Globe's foundation suggested that it was a polygon of 20&amp;nbsp;sides.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne; Shewring (1997: 37; 44)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Egan2&gt;{{harvnb|Egan|2004|pp=5.1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the base of the stage, there was an area called the ''pit'',&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Student: The Theater past to present &gt; Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Theater''&lt;/ref&gt; (or, harking back to the old [[Inn-yard theatre|inn-yards]], ''yard'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Dekker, Thomas]] (1609), reprinted 1907, {{ISBN|0-7812-7199-1}}. ''The Gull’s Hornbook'': "the stage...will bring you to most perfect light... though the scarecrows in the yard hoot at you".&lt;/ref&gt; where, for a penny, people (the "groundlings") would stand on the [[Juncaceae|rush]]-strewn earthen floor to watch the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dekker (1609)&lt;/ref&gt; During the excavation of the Globe in 1989 a layer of nutshells was found, pressed into the dirt flooring so as to form a new surface layer.{{sfn|McCudden|1990}} Vertically around the yard were three levels of [[Stadium-style seating|stadium-style seats]], which were more expensive than standing room. A rectangular [[thrust stage|stage platform]], also known as an [[apron stage]], thrust out into the middle of the open-air yard. The stage measured approximately {{convert|43|ft|m|1}} in width, {{convert|27|ft|m|1}} in depth and was raised about {{convert|5|ft|m|1}} off the ground. On this stage, there was a [[trap door]] for use by performers to enter from the "cellarage" area beneath the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler 1958, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The back wall of the stage had two or three doors on the main level, with a curtained inner stage in the centre (although not all scholars agree about the existence of this supposed "inner below"),&lt;ref name="Kuritz1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuritz |first=Paul |year=1988 |title=The making of theatre history |publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |isbn=0-13-547861-8 |pages=189–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a balcony above it. The doors entered into the "tiring house"&lt;ref&gt;from ''attiring''—dressing: {{cite book |year=1989 |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=2 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |chapter=tiring, n.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; (backstage area) where the actors dressed and awaited their entrances. The floors above may have been used as storage for costumes and [[Theatrical property|props]] and management offices.&lt;ref&gt;Bowsher and Miller (2009: 136–137)&lt;/ref&gt; The balcony housed the musicians and could also be used for scenes requiring an upper space, such as the balcony scene in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Rush matting covered the stage, although this may only have been used if the setting of the play demanded it.&lt;ref name="wotton" /&gt;

Large columns on either side of the stage supported a roof over the rear portion of the stage. The ceiling under this roof was called the "heavens," and was painted with clouds and the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne; Shewring (1997: 139)&lt;/ref&gt; A trap door in the heavens enabled performers to descend using some form of rope and harness.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne; Shewring (1997: 166)&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was set in the south-east corner of the building, so as to be in shade during afternoon performances in summer.&lt;ref name= "lighting"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Egan |first=Gabriel |year=2015 |editor=Wells, Stanley |title=The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Lighting|edition=2|isbn= 9780198708735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name of the Globe supposedly alludes to the Latin tag ''totus mundus agit histrionem'', in turn derived from ''quod fere totus mundus exerceat histrionem''—"because all the world is a playground"—from [[Petronius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ingleby |first1=Clement Mansfield |year=1909 |last2=Toulmin Smith |first2=Lucy |authorlink2=Lucy Toulmin Smith |last3=Furnival |first3=Frederick |authorlink3=Frederick Furnival |editor=Monro, John |title=The Shakespere allusion-book : a collection of allusions to Shakespere from 1591 to 1700 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |location=London |volume=2 |page=373 |oclc=603995070}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had wide circulation in England in the Burbages' time. ''Totus mundus agit histrionem'' was, according to this explanation, therefore adopted as the theatre's motto. Another allusion, familiar to the contemporary theatre-goer, would have been to ''Teatrum Mundi'', a meditation by the twelfth-century classicist and philosopher [[John of Salisbury]], in his ''[[Policraticus]]'', book three.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt; In either case, there would have been a familiar understanding of the classical derivation without the adoption of a formal motto.&lt;ref name=Gillies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillies|first1=John|title=Shakespeare and the Geography of Difference|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9780521417198|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely that the link between the supposed motto and the Globe was made only later, originating with the industrious early Shakespeare biographer [[William Oldys]], who claimed as his source a private manuscript to which he once had access. This was repeated in good faith by his literary executor [[George Steevens]], but the tale is now thought "suspicious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stern |first=Tiffany |year=1997 |title=Was 'Totus mundus agit histrionem' ever the motto of the Globe Theatre? |journal=Theatre Notebook |publisher=The Society for Theatre Research |volume=51 |issue=3 |page=121 |issn=0040-5523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Egan |first=Gabriel |year=2001 |editor=Dobson, Michael |editor2=[[Stanley Wells|Wells, Stanley]] |title=The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |isbn=978-0-19280614-7 |page=166 |chapter=Globe theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">A '''gnome''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek:]] γνώμη ''gnome'', from γιγνώσκειν ''gignoskein'' "to know") is a type of [[saying]], especially an [[aphorism]] or a [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] designed to provide [[Education|instruction]] in a compact form (usually in the form of [[hexameter]]).

The term ''gnome'' was introduced by [[Klaus Berger (theologian)|Klaus Berger]] in the ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments''. He used this traditional term from the antique rhetoric and attempted to identify this rhetorical method in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, K.  1984  ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments'' (Heidelberg: Quelle &amp;  Meyer). 1987 Einführung in die Formgeschichte (UTB, 144; Tübingen: Franke).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|gringo}}
A '''''gringo''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|ɪ|ŋ|g|oʊ|}}, {{IPA-es|ˈɡɾiŋɡo|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈɡɾĩɡu|lang}}) or '''''gringa''''' (female) is someone considered a foreigner from the perspective of [[Hispanophone|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese-speaking]] countries in [[Latin America]]. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and English, ''gringo'' usually refers to an [[English language|English-speaking]] foreigner, especially one from the [[United States]]. It often carries a derogatory connotation, particularly in English. Possible other connotations may include [[monolingualism]], a lack of understanding of [[Hispanic]] culture, and [[blond]] hair.&lt;ref&gt;English dictionaries:

==Etymology==
The word ''gringo'' originally referred to any kind of foreigner. It was first recorded in 1787 in the Spanish ''Diccionario castellano con las voces de Ciencias y Artes'':&lt;ref name=Varela&gt;Beatriz Varela, "Ethnic Nicknames of Spanish Origin", in {{cite book|last=Rodríguez González|first=Félix|title=Spanish Loanwords in the English Language: A Tendency Towards Hegemony Reversal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09NEuGHh2R8C&amp;pg=PA143|year=1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-014845-9|page=143}} (''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5XtdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 backup link]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite book|author=Esteban Terreros y Pando (S.I.)|title=Diccionario castellano con las voces de ciencias y artes y sus correspondientes en las tres lenguas francesa, latina é italiana: E-O|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SU3vKYK7pcC&amp;pg=PA240|year=1787|publisher=en la imprenta de la Viuda de Ibarra, Hijos y Compañia|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"Castilian Dictionary including the Words of the Sciences and the Arts, and their Correspondents in Three Languages: French, Latin, and Italian"}}

{{quote|GRINGOS, llaman en Málaga a los extranjeros, que tienen cierta especie de acento, que los priva de una locución fácil, y natural Castellana; y en Madrid dan el mismo, y por la misma causa con particularidad a los Irlandeses.
''Gringos'' is what, in Malaga, they call foreigners who have a certain type of accent that prevents them from speaking Castilian easily and naturally; and in Madrid they give the same name, and for the same reason, in particular to the Irish.}}

The most likely theory is that it originates from ''griego'' ('Greek'), used in the same way as the English phrase "it's [[Greek to me]]".&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gringo/|title=Etymology of Gringo|date=17 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tschudi1847"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Jakob von Tschudi|authorlink=Johann Jakob von Tschudi|title=Travels in Peru, During the Years 1838-1842: On the Coast, in the Sierra, Across the Cordilleras and the Andes, Into the Primeval Forests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrECAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|year=1847|publisher=D. Bogue|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is known to have used Greek as a stand-in for incomprehensibility, though now less common, such as in the phrase ''hablar en griego'' (lit. 'to speak Greek'). The 1817 ''Nuevo diccionario francés-español'',{{efn|"New French–Spanish Dictionary"}} for example, gives ''gringo'' and ''griego'' as synonyms in this context:&lt;ref name="Montpalau1817"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio de Capmany y de Montpalau|author2=Imprenta de Sancha (Madrid)|title=Nuevo diccionario francés-español: en este van enmendados, corregidos, mejorados, y enriquecidos considerablemente los de Gattel, y Cormon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRDCjVSNUeYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA448|year=1817|publisher=Imprenta de Sancha|location=Under ''Hebreu'' and ''Parler''|pages=448, 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{verse translation|... hablar en griego, en guirigay, en gringo.
Gringo, griego: aplícase a lo que se dice o escribe sin entenderse.
|... to speak in Greek, in gibberish, in gringo.
Gringo, Greek : applied to what is said or written but not understood.}}

This derivation requires two steps: ''griego'' &gt; ''grigo'', and ''grigo'' &gt; ''gringo''. Corominas notes that while the first change is common in Spanish (e.g. ''[[wikt:priesa|priesa]]'' to ''[[wikt:prisa|prisa]]''), there is no perfect analogy for the second, save in [[Old French]] (''Gregoire'' to ''Grigoire'' to ''Gringoire'').&lt;ref name=cor&gt;''Griego'' at ''[[Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana]]'', Vol. II, pag. 784 (25), [[Joan Corominas]], Francke Verlag, Berna, 1954, {{ISBN|978-84-249-1361-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other Spanish words whose colloquial form contains an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''n'', such as ''[[wikt:gordiflón|gordiflón]]'' and ''[[wikt:gordinflón|gordinflón]]'' ('chubby'), and ''[[wikt:Cochinchina|Cochinchina]]'' and ''[[wikt:Conchinchina|Conchinchina]]'' ('South Vietnam'). It is also possible that the final form was influenced by the word ''[[jeringonza]]'', a game like [[Pig Latin]] also used to mean "gibberish".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt;

Alternatively, it has been suggested that ''gringo'' could derive from the [[Caló language]], the language of the [[Romani people in Spain|Romani people of Spain]],  as a variant of the hypothetical *''peregringo'', 'peregrine', 'wayfarer', 'stranger'.&lt;ref&gt;Irving L. Allen, ''The Language of Ethnic Conflict: Social Organization and Lexical Culture'', 1983, {{ISBN|0-231-05557-9}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sayers"&gt;William Sayers, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14753820902937946 "An Unnoticed Early Attestation of gringo 'Foreigner': Implications for Its Origin"], in the ''Bulletin of Spanish Studies'' '''86''':3:323 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk etymologies===
There are several conjectures within [[folk etymology]] that purport to derive the origin of ''gringo'' from word coincidences.

Many theories date the word to the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), as a result of American troops singing a song which began with "Green grows..." such as "[[Green Grow the Rushes, O]]", "[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]", and various others.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article120522.html|title=Origen de la palabra "gringo", por  Roberto Ponce|first=Roberto Ponce,Red|last=Voltaire|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories involve locals yelling "Green, go!" at invading American soldiers (sometimes in conflicts other than the Mexican–American War), in reference to their supposedly green uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Colorful Origin Stories of "Gringo" |url=https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/the-colorful-origin-stories-of-gringo/ |website=www.visualthesaurus.com |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another derives it from Irish "[[Erin go bragh]]" ("Ireland forever"), which served as the motto for [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]] who fought alongside the Mexican army.&lt;ref name="Nipongo2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikito Nipongo|title=Perlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huZsN0oQOkUC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2001|publisher=LD Books|isbn=968-5270-38-4|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernández1925"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Hernández|title="Martín Fierro", comentado y anotado|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dmgCAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Erin+go+bragh|year=1925|page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
===Spain===
In modern [[Spain]], the word ''gringo'' is understood but rarely used. Nowadays, the closest equivalent vernacular is ''[[guiri]]'', or ''yanqui'' ([[yankee]]) for [[United States|U.S. Americans]] of any regional origin, including Southerners. ''Gringo'' is only heard among [[Latin America]]n immigrants or native Spaniards imitating their speech for fun or solidarity. These terms can be merely descriptive, derogatory or friendly depending on the context and situation.

===Argentina===
The word ''gringo'' is mostly used in rural areas following the original Spanish meaning. ''Gringo'' in Argentina was used to refer to non-Spanish European immigrants who first established agricultural colonies in the country. The word was used for Swiss, German, Polish, Italian and other immigrants, but since the Italian immigrants were the larger group, the word used to be mostly linked to [[Italians]] in the ''[[lunfardo]]'' [[argot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fhuc.unl.edu.ar/portalgringo/crear/gringa/elportal/pdf/editoriales/gringo1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Barcelona Argentina: migrantes, obreros y militantes en Rosario, 1870-1912|last=Falcón|first=Ricardo|publisher=Laborde Editor|year=2005|isbn=9879459962|location=|pages=221|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also found use in the intermittent exercise [[Gringo-Gaucho]] between [[Argentine Naval Aviation]] and [[USN]] aircraft carriers.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], the word gringo means simply foreigner, and has no connection to any physical characteristics or specific countries. Unlike most Hispanic American countries, in which gringo is never used to refer to other Latin Americans, in Brazil there is no such distinction in the use of the term. Most foreign [[Association Football|footballers]] in the [[Brasileirão|Brazilian Championship]] that came from other Latin American countries are nevertheless referred as "gringos" by the sport media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gringo footballers in Brazil 2015|url=http://www.lancenet.com.br/minuto/Confira-gringos-pintar-futebol-brasileiro_0_1268273211.html|publisher=Lance Net|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word being used for Hispanic American footballers in Brazil.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150211075055/http://www.lancenet.com.br/minuto/Confira-gringos-pintar-futebol-brasileiro_0_1268273211.html|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gringo footballers in Brazil 2015 (ESPN)|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/post/467443_conheca-gringos-que-podem-reforcar-times-brasileiros-na-temporada-2015|publisher=Lance Net|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word being used for Hispanic American footballers in Brazil.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by sport fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded "gringo" limit in Brazilian Championship|url=http://doentesporfutebol.com.br/2014/07/novo-limite-faz-numero-de-gringos-aumentar-no-brasil/|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word being used by a fan as a synonym of foreigner in the Brazilian Championship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists are called gringos, and there is no differentiation in the use of the term for Latin Americans or people from other regions, like Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=turistas gringos|url=http://www.redebomdia.com.br/noticia/detalhe/69817/torcedores-gringos-elogiam-e-reclamam-do-brasil|publisher=Terra|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word being used for European and Latin American tourists in Brazil.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125230641/http://www.redebomdia.com.br/noticia/detalhe/69817/torcedores-gringos-elogiam-e-reclamam-do-brasil|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the word has no connection to physical appearance in Brazil, [[Black people|black African]] or [[African Americans|African American]] foreigners are also called gringos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cameroon gringos|url=http://migramundo.com/2014/06/09/camaroes-conquista-copa-gringos-mas-o-futebol-e-os-migrantes-saem-como-vencedores/|publisher=Migra Mundo|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=Black immigrants from Cameroon play the "Copa Gringos" in Brazil.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202181131/http://migramundo.com/2014/06/09/camaroes-conquista-copa-gringos-mas-o-futebol-e-os-migrantes-saem-como-vencedores/|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike some other countries in which the term implies fair skin. Popularly used terms for fair-skinned and blond people are generally based in specific nationalities, like "alemão" (i.e., [[germans|German]]), "russo" ([[Russians (ethnic group)|Russian]]) or, in some regions, "galego" ([[Galician people|Galician]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Significado de "galego"|url = http://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/galego/|website = www.dicionarioinformal.com.br|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used for both Brazilians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian reality show celebrity nicknamed Alemão|url=http://extra.globo.com/famosos/ex-bbb-diego-alemao-reaparece-irreconhecivel-durante-festa-no-rio-15147097.html|publisher=Extra|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word Alemão as nickname for non-German Brazilian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian footballer nicknamed Alemão|url=http://terceirotempo.bol.uol.com.br/que-fim-levou/alemao-1582|publisher=Bol|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word Alemão as nickname for non-German Brazilian Footballer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and foreigners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complexo do Alemão|url=http://www.encontrapenharj.com.br/penha/complexo-do-alemao.shtml|publisher=Encontra Penha RJ|accessdate=10 February 2015|quote=The word Alemão as nickname for Polish Immigrant Leonard Kaczmarkiewicz eventually lead a whole community to be known as Complexo do Alemão(German's Complex).}}&lt;/ref&gt; with such characteristics, regardless of their real ethnic origins.

===Activism===
In 1969, [[Jose Angel Gutierrez]] (one of the leaders of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]]) said his and MAYO's use of the term, rather than referring to non-Latinos, referred to people or institutions with policies or attitudes that reflect racism and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917033004/http://www.uta.edu/public-affairs/official-statements/stories.php?id=2133 |archive-date=17 September 2007 |url=http://www.uta.edu/public-affairs/official-statements/stories.php?id=2133 |website=UTA.edu |first=Kemper |last=Diehl |date=26 April 2006 |title=STATEMENTS BY JOSE ANGEL GUTIERREZ, SAN ANTONIO EVENING NEWS, APRIL 11, 1969 |quote=A person or an institution who has a certain policy or program or attitudes that reflect bigotry, racism, discord and prejudice and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In [[Mexican cuisine]], a ''[[gringas|gringa]]'' is a flour tortilla with [[al pastor]] pork meat with cheese, heated on a ''[[comal (cookware)|comal]]'' and optionally served with a ''salsa de chile'' (chilli sauce). The name is either a reference to the white flour used,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lamag.com/digestblog/tacopedia-a-complete-taco-encyclopedia-of-l-a/|title=Tacos in LA: A Complete Taco Encyclopedia of L.A.|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2015|work=Los Angeles Magazine|access-date=February 10, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or its creation, when two women from the United States asked a Mexico City ''[[taquería]]'' for a Mexican dish but disliked corn tortillas.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Guillemette Andreu-Lanoë''' (born August 3, 1948 in Paris), is a French [[Egyptologist]] and [[archaeologist]]. A former member of the [[French Institute of Oriental Archaeology]] of Cairo, she has been a curator and director of the Department of Egyptian Antiquities of the [[Louvre Museum]] since May 2007.

==Biography==
After studying history, Andreu specialized in Egyptology (hieroglyphs, hieratic, Coptic) and produced a thesis on the law and order in Ancient Egypt at [[Sorbonne]] in 1978 under the direction of Professor Jean Leclant. Following this academic work, she was appointed scientific member of the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology in Cairo in 1978-1982.

There, for four years, she participated in excavations of this institute in the [[Nile Valley]] ([[Deir el-Medina]]), in the oases of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] ([[Balat, Dakhla|Balat]] at [[Dakhla Oasis]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nécropole de Douch|fr}} at [[Kharga]], and a Christian monastic site in the [[Nile Delta]] (the [[Kellia]]). Meanwhile, she continued research on Pharaonic Egypt and civil and administrative measures likely to have been taken during the daily lives of Egyptians at the Pharaonic era.

'''Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga''' (previously until 2014 named the '''New Zealand Historic Places Trust''') ({{lang-mi|Pouhere Taonga}}) is a [[Crown entity]] with a membership of around 20,000 people that advocates for the protection of  ancestral sites and heritage buildings in [[New Zealand]]. It was set up through the [[Historic Places Act 1954]] with a mission to "...promote the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand" and is an autonomous Crown entity. Its current enabling legislation is the [http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0026/latest/DLM4005414.html Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014].
==Governance ==
It is governed by a Board of [[Trustees]], currently chaired by Shonagh Kenderdine, and a [[Māori people|Māori]] Heritage Council, currently chaired by Sir [[Tumu Te Heuheu]].  Past chairs include Dame [[Anne Salmond]]. The head office is in [[Antrim House]], [[Wellington]], while regional and area offices are in [[Kerikeri]], [[Auckland]], [[Tauranga]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]].

==Publication==
It publishes the quarterly magazine ''New Zealand Heritage''.
==Listings==
Buildings owned by Heritage New Zealand include the [[Mission House]], the [[Stone Store]], and the [[Te Waimate mission]] house.

==The List==
The New Zealand Heritage List/Rārangi Kōrero (formerly known as the register of historic places) is divided into four main areas:

*'''Historic Places'''
*'''Historic Areas'''
*'''Wahi Tapu''' (Māori sacred sites)
*'''Wahi Tapu Areas'''

The historic places are organised in two categories:

*'''[[:Category:New Zealand Historic Places Trust Category I listings|Category I]]'''  - "...places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'"
*'''[[:Category:New Zealand Historic Places Trust Category II listings|Category II]]''' - "...places of 'historical or cultural heritage significance or value'"

{{as of|2013}}, the register contains over 5,600 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Register |url=http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/AboutTheRegister.aspx |publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust |accessdate=10 February 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6B2TmISuy?url=http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/AboutTheRegister.aspx# |archive-date=29 September 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canterbury earthquakes of [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|September 2010]] and [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake|February 2011]] resulted in damage to a number of historic buildings in Christchurch.  Post-earthquake redevelopment has caused a significant loss of [[List of historic places in Christchurch|heritage buildings in Christchurch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Lost Canterbury Earthquakes|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/theregister/heritagelost/lostheritagecantyearthquakes.aspx|publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust|accessdate=25 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625193349/http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/HeritageLost/LostHeritageCantyEarthquakes.aspx#|archive-date=25 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iaat''' ({{lang-ar|إيعات}} also transliterated as '''Ya'ad''', '''Yaad''', '''Yaat''', or '''Iaad''') is a small town and municipality located in the [[Beqaa Valley]] of [[Lebanon]] mostly famous for its [[Corinthian order|Corinthian column]]: it is a single column of unknown date approximately half way between Baalbek and Qasr el Banat with a cartouche on the 6th drum but no inscription. 

==The Iaat column==

The column stands at 18 meters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon.com/tourism/iaat.htm Iaat],  Lebanon.Com&lt;/ref&gt; (59.1&amp;nbsp;feet) it is installed on a 4-step base.  The location of the Pillar is 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of the Baalbek ruins, between the towns of [[Baalbek]] and Chlifa.  At one point a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] was installed on the northern side of the monument; however, it has been removed and no other history is known of the column, which is believed to be a funerary or celebrative monument.  The column is also widely believed in local legend to be related to St. Helena.&lt;ref name="Verlag1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelles Verlag|title=Syria Lebanon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCTszTdofMkC|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=1 December 1999|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-3-88618-105-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrenckerZschietzschmann1938"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Krencker|author2=Willy Zschietzschmann|title=Römische Tempel in Syrien|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR1IAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=1938|publisher=W. de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-004989-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George F. Taylor classified it among a group of [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]] and noticed that the position of the '''Iaat column''' was equidistant between the temples of [[Heliopolis in Phoenicia|Baalbek]] and [[Qasr el Banat, Lebanon|Qasr el Banat]]. 

Whilst technically not being a temple, Taylor suggested that the column might have been placed by the Romans where it is as a [[victory column]] to mark the site of a great ancient battle. He also noted a [[cartouche]] on the sixth cylinder of the column.&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXchNqgyNdkC|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=1967|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is a unit of the University of Michigan's [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]].&lt;ref name="Kelsey"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/ Discover the Kelsey Museum], Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a collection of more than 100,000 [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from the [[History of the Mediterranean region|civilizations of the Mediterranean]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kelsey"/&gt; In addition to displaying its permanent and special exhibitions, the museum sponsors research and [[fieldwork]] and conducts educational programs for the public and for schoolchildren.&lt;ref name="Kelsey"/&gt; The museum also houses the University of Michigan Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Archaeology.&lt;ref name="Kelsey"/&gt;

The history of the museum begins before the museum was established. The founder of the university's collection of artifacts was [[Francis Kelsey]], a professor of Latin at the University of Michigan from 1889 until his death in 1927.&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis W. Kelsey"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/aboutus/history/franciskelsey Francis Kelsey], Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsey began acquiring artifacts in 1893 in order to help his students understand the ancient world.&lt;ref name="Collections History"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/collections/collectionshistory Collections History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140030/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/collections/collectionshistory |date=2013-02-16 }}, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, he made his first acquisitions: 108 [[Oil lamp|lamp]]s, [[vase]]s, and building materials from [[Alfred Louis Delattre]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]] and archaeologist who was conducting an [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at [[Carthage]] in [[Tunisia]], and another 1,096 objects from dealers in [[Tunis]], [[Rome]], [[Capri]], and [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt; Together with several thousand coins donated to the University of Michigan in the 1880s, these objects formed the core of the university's archaeological collections.&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt; Kelsey continued to acquire objects (by gift and purchase) for the university until he died in 1927.&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt;  These artifacts included [[pottery]], [[terracotta]] figurines, painted [[stucco]], inscribed [[tombstone]]s, daily life objects, [[glass]], [[tomb]]s, and [[Papyrus|papyri]].&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt;

In 1924, Kelsey secured funding for excavations at sites around the [[Mediterranean]] and began to ship a large number of artifacts back to Ann Arbor.&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt; In 1924, he sent nearly 45,000 objects from [[Karanis]], illustrating "in detail how daily life was lived in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt under Roman rule]]."&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt;  The same year, excavations at [[Seleucia-on-the-Tigris]] in [[Iraq]] yielded another 13,000 objects.&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt; In 1925, Kelsey [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] the Italian artist Maria Barosso to paint a set of [[watercolor]] [[replica]]s of the [[mural]]s of the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] at [[Pompeii]], which now are housed in a special room in the Upjohn Exhibit Wing.&lt;ref name="Collections History"/&gt;

The building that now houses the museum was originally built for the Students' Christian Association for religious services and other meetings and activities.&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/aboutus/faqs FAQs], Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by the [[Detroit]] [[architectural firm]] of [[Spier &amp; Rohns]].&lt;ref name="MSO"&gt;[http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/14489.htm Newberry Hall], State Historic Preservation Office, [[Michigan State Housing Development Authority]].&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1888 and was completed in 1891.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/aboutus/history/buildinghistory Building History], Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is described as a "massive, asymmetrical [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] building of rough-cut, randomly placed local [[fieldstone]]."&lt;ref name="MSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; The building has a [[hip roof]] broken by [[parapet]]ed cross-[[gable]]s, with a [[facade]] "dominated by a projecting three-story corner [[turret]] topped by a conical roof"; "decorative [[colonette]]s, [[arch]]es, and regularly coursed variegated brick [[Course (architecture)|bandcourses]] break the heaviness of the imposing stone structure."&lt;ref name="MSO"/&gt; The building was dedicated on July 21, 1891 at a cost of $40,000 and was named '''Newberry Hall'''&amp;mdash;a name still engraved on the building's front&amp;mdash;in honor of railroad [[Business magnate|magnate]] John S. Newberry, whose widow Helen Newberry contributed $18,000 toward the building's construction.&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt;

The university [[lease]]d Newberry Hall in 1921 for classroom space, housed its collection of ancient artifacts there from 1928,&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; and finally purchased the building in 1937.&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt; In 1953, the museum was named in honor of Kelsey.&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis W. Kelsey"/&gt; Newberry Hall was designated as a [[List of Michigan State Historic Sites|Michigan State Historic Site]] on August 13, 1971, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 24, 1972. It is one of the oldest still-standing buildings on the University of Michigan campus.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;

By the early 1990s the museum was experiencing overcrowding, deterioration of artifacts, and lack of adequate storage space.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; It was closed in July 1993 for renovations and reopened in October 1994.&lt;ref name="Arron"&gt;Sage Arron, [http://ur.umich.edu/9495/Oct17_94/20.htm Kelsey Slated to Reopen Thursday] (October 17, 1994), ''University Record''.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, a new third floor was added in space formerly occupied by a [[choir]] loft (from the building's Christian Association period) and a new climate-controlled Sensitive Artifact Facility and Environment space was added to maintain "appropriate storage, [[humidity]], and temperature requirements for optimal artifact longevity."&lt;ref name="Arron"/&gt; A new registry, [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] lab, objects study area, [[Fire sprinkler system|water-sprinkler fire control system]], [[security system]], and elevator to the new third floor were added.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arron"/&gt; The building was also made more [[handicapped accessible]].&lt;ref name="Arron"/&gt; The $1.3 million project was funded by a $250,000 gift from Eugene M. and Emily Grant of [[New York City]], along with grants from the University of Michigan and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], as well as funding from the Kelsey Museum Associates and other private contributions.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arron"/&gt;

In 2003, [[Edwin Meader|Edwin]] and [[Mary Meader]] of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], longtime benefactors of the university, gave an $8 million gift to expand the museum by the addition of a new wing in the back of the museum.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinch"&gt;John Kinch, [http://www.ur.umich.edu/0304/Apr19_04/01.shtml $8M Gift to Fund New Wing at Kelsey Museum] (April 19, 2004), ''University Record''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this was the largest gift in the history of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.&lt;ref name="Kinch"/&gt; The Meader gift, along with a $200,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, covered all of the project's $8.2 million cost.&lt;ref name="Nesbit"&gt;Joanne Nesbit, [http://www.ur.umich.edu/0304/July19_04/09.shtml Architect Tapped for Kelsey Museum Project] (July 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago]]-based architectural firm of Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Inc. designed the new addition.&lt;ref name="Nesbit"/&gt; In 2009, the '''William E. Upjohn Exhibit Wing''' was completed, adding more than 20,000 feet of study, storage, and display space in a climate-controlled facility; the new space allowed the museum, which previously had been displaying less than 1 percent of its collection, to dramatically expand the number of artifacts on public display.&lt;ref name="FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis W. Kelsey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eberba"&gt;Jennifer Eberba, [http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/kelsey-museum/ Kelsey Museum's Expansion Moves More Treasures Out of Storage] (October 31, 2009), AnnArbor.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The wing was named after Mary Meader's grandfather [[William E. Upjohn]], the noted pharmacist.&lt;ref name="Eberba"/&gt; The building reopened to the public in November 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ur.umich.edu/0910/Nov09_09/07.php Photo: Kelsey Museum Upjohn Wing Opens] (November 9, 2009), ''University Record''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''lifeway''' is a fairly new{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} technical term that is not yet in most general dictionaries and for which most textbooks instead still use "way of life". The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines a lifeway as: "1. A customary manner of living; a way of life. 2. A custom, practice, or art: ''the traditional lifeways of a tribal society.''"

In several disciplines{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, ''lifeway'' is used in the sense of the ecological position of human beings within a larger [[ecosystem]] - such as a [[food web]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.   It is studied by [[cultural ecology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. The most basic distinction usually made{{by whom?|date=November 2014}} between lifeways is that between the [[hunter-gatherer]] (including [[Fisherman|fisher]]s) and that of the [[farmer]] (including the [[shepherd]], [[goatherd]] or [[rancher]]) who [[domesticated animal|domesticates wildlife to raise for food and clothing]].

[[Urban area|Urban]] lifeways (trading on [[social capital|relationships]] or [[instructional capital|information]], [[manufacturing]] which requires [[infrastructural capital]] at hand, etc.) are studied by [[urban economics]] but are also technically lifeways in the same sense as that of the [[hunter-gatherer]] and [[farmer]].

According to most adherents of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the [[Book of Mormon]] is a 19th-century translation of a record of ancient inhabitants of the American continent, which was written in a script which the book refers to as "[[reformed Egyptian]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mormon|chapter=9|verse=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dallin H.

Both critics and promoters of the Book of Mormon have used linguistic methods to analyze the text. Promoters have published claims of stylistic forms that [[Joseph Smith]] and his contemporaries are unlikely to have known about, as well as similarities to [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Critics of the Book of Mormon claim there are places where the language is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] and suggestive of a 19th-century origin consistent with Smith's upbringing and life experience, as well as the books and other literature published&lt;!-- Please don't revert to "available to him" unless you have a very specific reference proving that Joseph Smith either owned or checked out of the library, etc. any of the books in question. --&gt; just preceding the time that the Book of Mormon was published.&lt;ref name="irr"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111215183046/http://www.irr.org/mit/bom-ancient-or-modern.html The Book of Mormon: Ancient or Modern].&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem with linguistic reviews of the Book of Mormon is that the claimed original text is either unavailable for study or never existed. Smith said that he returned the [[golden plates]] to [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] after he finished the translation.

==Native American language-development==
In 1922, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] [[general authority]] [[B. H. Roberts]] conducted an in-depth review of the research regarding language development and dialects among the Native American peoples; Roberts's study which was published posthumously in 1985 as ''[[Studies of the Book of Mormon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham D. Madsen, ed., B. H. Roberts: ''[[Studies of the Book of Mormon]]'', Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the assumption that the majority of Native Americans descend from the peoples described in the Book of Mormon, Roberts noted that linguistic evidence among the Native American peoples does not appear to support the Book of Mormon narrative, inasmuch as the diverse language stocks and dialects that exist would not have had enough time to develop from a single language dating from A.D. 400 (the approximate date of the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record). Roberts noted:

{{quote|
The facts ... developed up to this point seem to be—

1. That there are a large number of separate language stocks in America that show very little relationship to each other.

2. That it would take a long time—much longer than that recognized as "historic times"—to develop these dialects and stocks where the development is conceived of as arising from a common source of origin—some primitive language.

3. That there is no connection between the American languages and the language of any people of the Old World. New World languages appear to be indigenous to the New World.

4. That the time limits named in the Book of Mormon—which represents the people of America as speaking and writing one language down to as late a period as 400 A.D.—is not sufficient to allow for these divergences into the American language stocks and their dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. H. Studies of the Book of Mormon. Signature Books, Inc. Salt Lake City. 2nd Edition. 1992. pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mormon apologetics|Apologists]] from [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] have published studies that claim that the linguistic evidence cited by Roberts does not necessarily contradict the narrative of the Book of Mormon. Specifically, if one adheres to the [[limited geography model]], then it is possible that many of the peoples of the Book of Mormon are not the principal ancestors of the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1997}}. See citations in note 4 therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic anachronisms==
{{Main|Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon}}
Critics of the Book of Mormon have claimed that a variety of linguistic [[anachronisms]] exist in it which cast doubt upon its historical authenticity. Linguistic anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are words that represent concepts that are not believed to have existed in the Americas between 2500&amp;nbsp;B.C. and A.D. 400, or in the Jewish world of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi's]] time—the period of history covered by the narrative of the Book of Mormon. Mormon apologists dispute these claims, with some arguing that during the translation of the [[golden plates]], Smith may have chosen words that he knew that were closest in meaning to the original concept written on the plates (i.e., a "translator's anachronism").{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==="Christ" and "Messiah"===
The words "[[Christ]]" and "[[Messiah]]" are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon. The first instance of the word "Christ" dates to between 559 and 545&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref&gt;See 2 Nephi 10:3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first instance of the word "Messiah" dates to about 600&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref&gt;1 Nephi 1:19.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Christ" is the English transliteration of the Greek word Χριστός (transliterated as Christós); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word משיח, pronounced {{IPA-he|maˈʃi.aχ|}} and rendered "Messiah"." Both words have the meaning of "anointed," and are used in the Bible to refer to "the Anointed One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=510&amp;letter=M|title=MESSIAH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek translations of the Old Testament (including the [[Septuagint]]), the word "Christ" is used for the Hebrew "Messiah", and in Hebrew translations of the New Testament, the word "Messiah" is used for the Greek "Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/ BibleGateway.com: A searchable online Bible in over 50 versions and 35 languages] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QdI0KC7q?url=http://www.biblegateway.com/ |date=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any passage in the Bible that uses the word "Christ" can substitute the word "Messiah" or "the Messiah" with no change in meaning (e.g., {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=1|verse=1|range=, 16, 18}}).

The Book of Mormon uses both terms throughout the book. In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it does not matter which word is used:

{{quote|And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation". ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=5|verse=12}}).}}

{{quote|And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins of the world." ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=10|verse=10}}).}}

Richard Packham argues that the Greek word "Christ" in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; since Smith clearly stated that "there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Apologists note that the word "Christ" is a translational equivalent to the term "Messiah", arguing that "it is no more anachronistic for pre-Christian era Book of Mormon peoples to believe in a coming Messiah/Christ than it was for Old Testament prophets to believe in a coming Messiah/Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Pre-Christian_Christianity|title=Question: Is it an anachronism that the Book of Mormon teaches that Christians existed before Christ's birth? - FairMormon|website=en.fairmormon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley]], ''Since Cumorah'', pp. 167–68, discusses the origin, interchangeability, and translated use of the terms "Messiah" and "Christ" as they appear in scripture. Nibley points out that the Arabic word ''al-masih'', for instance, could be translated using the Hebrew term "Messiah" or the New Testament term "Christ" depending on the context and translator. See also "Meshiach" (מָשִׁיחַ), "anointed", Hebrew–Aramaic Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Church" and "synagogue"===

The word "church" first occurs in [[First Book of Nephi|1 Nephi]] 4:26, where a prophet named [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]] disguises himself as [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Laban]], a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And he [Laban's servant], supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=26}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600&amp;nbsp;B.C. The meaning of the word "church" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the [[Bible]] than Modern English. The concept of a church, meaning "a convocation of believers", existed among the [[House of Israel]] prior to Christianity. For instance, [[Psalms]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Psalms|nobook=|chapter=89|verse=5}} speaks of praising the Lord "in the congregation of the saints"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word ''ecclesia'' for "congregation," which is also translated as "church" in the [[New Testament]].&lt;!--this is easily accessible in any Septuagint. Do we really need a link to a specific edition here? Yes. Yes we do.--&gt;

A similar question regards the word "synagogue", found in [[Book of Alma|Alma]] 16:13:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=16|verse=13}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} of the Book of Mormon note that synagogues did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the [[Babylonian captivity]]. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref&gt;The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered," Monika Trümper Hesperia, Vol. 73, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 2004), pp. 513–598&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon apologist William J. Adams cites archaeologist [[Lee I. Levine]] in suggesting that synagogues did in fact exist before the Babylonian captivity, though in a different form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=William J. Adams Jr.| title=Synagogues in the Book of Mormon | journal =Journal of Book of Mormon Studies | volume=9 | issue=1 | year= 2000 | pages = 4–13 | quote = Lee I.

===Other anachronisms===
Critics [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and Marvin W. Cowan contend that certain linguistic properties show possible anachronisms in the text which question its claim as a historical document.&lt;ref&gt;

These critics cite linguistic [[anachronisms]] such as:
* The Americanized name "Sam" {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=2|verse=5}} and 17
* The French word "''adieu''" {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Jacob|chapter=7|verse=27}}
* Exact copies of many verses of the [[King James Bible|King James version of the Bible]], which was not published until 1611

Gee, Roper and Tvedtnes report that the name "Sam" is found on a bronze ringmounted seal dated in the 7th century B.C.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} They also note that the name "Samuel" in Hebrew is a combination of two words—''Shem'' and ''El''. In early Hebrew, the same letter was used for "s" and "sh" and vowels were not specified. Judges 12:6 demonstrates that the [[tribe of Joseph]] pronounced the letter that Shem began with as "s". The Book of Mormon states that Lehi was a descendant of Joseph.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Apologists contend that the anachronism of the French word ''adieu'', and others, may have been the result of Smith choosing the best word available to convey the meaning of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], ''A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = brandt&gt;Edward J. Brandt, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/10/i-have-a-question "I Have a Question"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig L. Blomberg has pointed out several verses in the Book Mormon apparently similar to biblical verses in the King James version of the Bible. According to Blomberg, {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=31|verse=13}} includes overt references to {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Acts|chapter=2|verse=38}}, {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=3|verse=11}}, {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=13|verse=2}}, and were most likely written with their direct influence in mind. Furthermore, Blomberg claims that {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=31|verse=21}} contains allusions to {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Acts|chapter=4|verse=12}}. Blomberg summarizes his overall position on Book of Mormon anachronisms as follows: "Indeed, the entire Book of Mormon abounds with explicit references to Christ, to his life and ministry and to the three persons of the Godhead long before New Testament times ... even though none of these concepts or terms ever appear in these forms in the Old Testament or any other ancient Jewish literature."&lt;ref&gt;

==Chiasmus==
[[Chiasmus]] is a form of [[rhetoric]]al parallelism wherein key ideas familiar to the reader are inverted, usually for some kind of emphasis. Chiasmus appears in many languages, including English,&lt;ref&gt;Chiasmus appears in Shakespeare: Romeo (lines 175–76, lines 175–82, lines 159–70)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, William L. "Better a Witty Fool Than a Foolish Wit: The Art of Shakespeare's Chiasmus." Text and Performance Quarterly 23 (2003): 311-30&lt;/ref&gt; Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morethancake.org/2008/06/chiastic-structures-in-scripture.html More Than Cake: Chiastic Structures in the Scripture].&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic, Greek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Cedric M. |last= Whitman |title= Homer and the Heroic Tradition |location= Cambridge, Mass. |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |year= 1958 |oclc= 310021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Chiasms have been identified in [[Cicero]]'s oration [[Pro Archia Poeta]] and [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Thyestes]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in the Bible and other ancient Middle Eastern poetry

===Book of Mormon===
Examples of chiasmus can be found in the Book of Mormon. Some have argued chiasmus is evidence of the text's historical authenticity, suggesting it reflects the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] background of [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]] and other authors of the Book of Mormon. They claim that such findings support claims of Hebrew origins in the text on the basis that chiasmus is often found in Hebrew texts such as the Bible.

In 1969, [[John W. Welch]] discovered a variety of instances of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon and along with his discovery came attention to the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welch|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly cited example of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is the prophet [[Alma, son of Alma|Alma's]] religious experience, as recorded in {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=36}}. Welch claims that it is unlikely, although not impossible,&lt;ref&gt;John W. Welch, "How Much Was Known about Chiasmus in 1829 When the Book of Mormon Was Translated?," FARMS Review 15/1 (2003): 47–80.&lt;/ref&gt; that Smith knew about chiasmus at the time of the Book of Mormon's publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that chiasmus could only be present in the text if indeed the text is a translation and not a fabrication.

Others argue that chiasmus is not necessarily evidence of Hebrew origin.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Patterson, [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N04_173.pdf "Hebraicisms, Chiasmus, and Other Internal Evidence for Ancient Authorship in ''Green Eggs and Ham''"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 33, no. 4, Winter 2000, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others disagree on the extent to which chiasmus occurs in the text. With regard to the Alma chapter 36 chiasmus, one critic alleges that Welch "fashioned a chiasm by selecting elements from repetitious language, creatively labeling elements, ignoring text, pairing unbalanced elements, and even including asymmetrical elements".&lt;ref&gt;Earl M. Wunderli, [https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V38N04_105.pdf "Critique of Alma 36 as an Extended Chiasm"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Welch himself offers the following caution regarding a tendency of enthusiastic readers to see chiasmus where it is not actually present:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people, of course, have gone overboard with this search, and caution must be employed; otherwise, it is possible to find chiasmus in the telephone book, and the effort becomes meaningless . ... One must be careful in this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the 'hammer syndrome'—to the person holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the person who knows only chiasmus and no other form of literary composition, everything may start looking like a chiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welch|1997|pp=200, 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hugh W. Pinnock]], an LDS Church [[general authority]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because the study of Hebrew writing forms in the Book of Mormon can strengthen testimony and be quite exciting, a number of researchers and laypersons have become overly enthusiastic, much to the detriment of the subject and integrity of their studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Pinnock, "Finding Biblical Hebrew and Other Ancient Literary Forms in the Book of Mormon," Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (1999): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics argue that there is no correlation between the appearance of chiasmus and the authenticity of the Book of Mormon because, among other things, chiasmus appears in many languages including eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English literature.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Occurrence in other LDS scriptures===
Some claim writings in the form of chiasmus can also be found in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], two other works of [[scripture]] in the [[standard works|LDS canon]] that were dictated by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Possible chiasmus in other LDS scripture: {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|88|34-38}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|18|-38}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|132|19-26}}, and {{lds|Abraham|abr|3|16-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics believe this supports their claim that Smith knew about chiasmus, and that it may have been a characteristic of his personal writing style.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Apologists argue these examples should be considered a type of sporadic repetition rather than the full-fledged chiasmus that is claimed to be found in {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=36}}. Charles G. Kroupa and Richard C. Shipp are notable for publishing arguments for chiasmus in the Doctrine and Covenants in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kroupa|Shipp|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Shipp also produced a masters thesis titled, "Conceptual Patterns of Repetition in the Doctrine and Covenants and Their Implications" claiming that writings found in the Doctrine and Covenants had literary patterns similar to chiasmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipp|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a study was published by LDS researchers which used statistical analysis to determine the likelihood that a chiastic structure in LDS works appeared by chance as opposed to being created deliberately. Mathematical formulas were used to calculate a set of probabilities that provided the ability to distinguish between strong and weak chiastic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Edwards|2004|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on these estimates, we conclude that the likelihood is high that chiastic structure appeared by design in the Pentateuch and in the Book of Mormon. Our estimates do not support such a conclusion for the Doctrine and Covenants [or] the Book of Abraham ... indicating instead that chiasms could have appeared in these works by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Edwards|2004|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other works containing chiasmus===
Chiastic patterns have also been found in the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangite.org/Chiasmus.htm|title=Chiasmus}}&lt;/ref&gt; a purported translation of an ancient text by [[James J. Strang]]. This book is not considered authentic by most Latter Day Saints.

Critics point out that the presence of chiasmus in Strang's writing as well as in the literature of other cultures implies that the source could be non-Hebrew. Additionally, they claim that the examination of a post-translation text might make identifying chiasmus in the original language difficult, and that the presence of chiasmus is not necessarily indicative of ancient origins.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cgi-bin/docviewer.exe?CISOROOT=/dialogue&amp;CISOPTR=20466 Ancient Chiasmus Studied (scroll to p 147)] or [http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/chiasmusandthebom.htm Chiasmus and the Book of Mormon].   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510014203/http://content.lib.utah.edu/cgi-bin/docviewer.exe?CISOROOT=%2Fdialogue&amp;CISOPTR=20466 |date=May 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylometry (wordprint studies)==

===Statistical analysis===
[[Stylometry]] is a method of statistical analysis used to determine authorship of various texts. It has been used to analyze disputed works of [[Shakespeare]], contrast books of the Bible, identify the authors of twelve disputed ''[[Federalist Papers]]'', and compare styles of various authors such as [[Jane Austen]]. In 1980, researchers at [[Brigham Young University]] used stylometric techniques they called "wordprint analysis" to examine the possible authors of the Book of Mormon. They reached the conclusion that none of the Book of Mormon selections they studied resembled writings of any of the suggested nineteenth-century authors, including Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|Rencher|Layton|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] challenged these findings on various points, most notably questioning the reliability of the data sources used and the methodology of the "wordprint analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|Tanner|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, D. James Croft wrote in ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'' that there were several flaws in the methodology that were vulnerable to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;D. James Croft, "Book Of Mormon 'Wordprints' Reexamined", ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'', March 1981, vol. 6:2, pp. 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more sophisticated approach was taken by Mormon researcher John Hilton and his non-LDS colleagues at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; who "went to great pains to immunize the methodology from criticism" through the use of control tests.&lt;ref name = barney&gt;Kevin L. Barney, [http://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N01_79.pdf "Reflections on the Documentary Hypothesis"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 33, no. 1, Spring 2000, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley group first used a variety of control tests with non-disputed authors (e.g., works by [[Mark Twain]], and translated works from German) in an effort to:

# Demonstrate the persistence of wordprints despite an author's effort to write as a different "character", and
# Demonstrate that wordprints were not obliterated by translation (e.g., two different authors rendered by the same translator would still have different wordprints).

Hilton concluded that, if wordprinting is a valid technique, then this analysis suggests that it is "statistically indefensible" to claim that Smith, [[Oliver Cowdery]], or [[Solomon Spalding]] wrote the 30,000 words in the Book of Mormon attributed to Nephi and Alma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hilton|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent Mormon scholar, [[John A. Tvedtnes]], has rejected the use of wordprint evidence as the foundation for a testimony of the Book of Mormon's validity, though he did not dismiss its possible usefulness as a scientific tool to investigate the book's origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barney|2000|pp=85–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon review of the Berkeley study, another scholar, Kevin L. Barney, remains unconvinced of the validity of wordprint analysis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always felt that the basis assumptions underlying Book of Mormon wordprint studies are faulty. I concur with the assessment of John Tvedtnes, who points out that (1) an English translation should reflect the language of the translator rather than the original author, and (2) the particles used in wordprint studies (such as "of") are often non-existent in Hebrew, which tends to use syntax to express the meaning of English particles.&lt;ref name = barney/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the same article, Barney confessed, "I frankly do not understand the statistics well enough to offer a useful critique of the studies."&lt;ref name = barney/&gt;

In a peer-reviewed study using a traditional authorship method and a new pattern-classification technique, several researchers at [[Stanford University]] concluded that [[Sidney Rigdon]], [[Solomon Spalding]], and [[Oliver Cowdery]] were more likely to have written the book out of a pool of authors that also included [[Parley P. Pratt]] and two statistical control authors ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Joel Barlow]]). Smith was not included in the pool of authors because a set of original works written by Smith alone could not be identified with confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jockers, M. L., D. M. Witten, and C. S. Criddle, 2008. [http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/4/465.abstract "Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification"]. ''Literary and Linguistic Computing'' (2008) '''23'''(4): 465–91.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only examined the relative likelihood of the five above-mentioned authors writing the Book of Mormon, not the possibility of an author or authors outside the five-person pool .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeongoldplates.com/2008/12/new-book-of-mormon-wordprint-analysis.html Life On Gold Plates: A New Book of Mormon Wordprint Analysis].&lt;/ref&gt; Another study was published in the same journal that critiqued the methodology used in the earlier study and, using Smith's personal writings written in his own handwriting, concluded that stylometric evidence supports neither Smith nor a [[Spalding–Rigdon authorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaalje, G. Bruce, Paul J. Fields, Matthew Roper, Gregory L. Snow. [http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/01/18/llc.fqq029.full "Extended nearest shrunken centroid classification: A new method for open-set authorship attribution of texts of varying sizes"], ''Literary and Linguistic Computing'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallels===
Non-Mormon Thomas Donofrio has found hundreds of parallels between peculiar wordings in the Book of Mormon and the writings of well-known historical and religious figures of the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postmormon.org/tories.htm|title=PostMormon.org: Tories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earlier studies, Donofrio's research has not been peer-reviewed. Respondents to this study point out that the use of parallels to prove derivation can be used to illogical extremes.

Latter-day Saints claim that the Book of Mormon is a translation, not originally written by Smith, but translated into the language with which he was familiar. While wordprint studies may be compelling, apologists argue that the inclusion of modern phraseology should not surprise anyone. The word "book", for example, was not used by the ancient Hebrews. Yet both in the King James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon, the word appears anachronistically. Mormon apologists also point out that this could well be the logical result of an ancient work translated by a modern man using the wording best suited to convey the ideas to a modern reader.&lt;ref name = brandt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ash, [http://www.mormontimes.com/article/6949/Mike-Ash-Translation-of-the-Book-of-Mormon "Challenging Issues, Keeping the Faith: Mike Ash: Translation of the Book of Mormon"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 2009-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proper names==

===Hebrew names===
Apologists note that many of the proper names in the Book of Mormon are Hebrew names found in the Bible (e.g., "Lehi", "Lemuel", "Ammon", and "Enos").  Tvedtnes, Gee and Roper argue that there are a number of Hebrew names found in the Book of Mormon which do not appear in the Bible but occur in other ancient sources. Examples of these are "Aha", "Ammonihah", "Chemish", "Hagoth", "Himni", "Isabel", "Jarom", "Josh", "Luram", "Mathoni", "Mathonihah", "Muloki", and "Sam".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tvedtnes|Gee|Roper|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Nibley]] also states that many non-biblical names found in the Book of Mormon resemble words from ancient Hebrew (e.g., "Sariah", "Jarom", and "Josh").&lt;ref&gt;''Since Cumorah'', pp. 171, Nibley discusses non-biblical Hebrew names present in the Book of Mormon.&lt;/ref&gt; Some names, like "[[Alma (given name)|Alma]]", are attested Hebrew names. [[Milton R. Hunter]] and Thomas Ferguson allege that Hebraic fragments and roots appear discernible in [[Nephite]]/[[Mulekite]] names such as "[[Zarahemla]]".&lt;ref&gt;Milton R. Hunter and Thomas Stewart Ferguson, ''Ancient America and the Book of Mormon'', pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; These names are often interpreted as evidence in favor of the Book of Mormon, since Smith's knowledge of Hebrew was limited to names found in the Bible.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Critics have pointed out that many of the names in the Book of Mormon that are not drawn from the King James Bible are found in the local environment around [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], and would have been known to Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#NAMES A Linguist Looks at Mormonism, More on ''Book of Mormon'' Names]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Packham has pointed out that several Biblical Hebrew names, including "Aaron",&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|1|15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ephraim",&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Levi"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|1|20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; are listed as [[Jaredites]] in the [[Book of Ether]]. He argues that these are [[anachronisms]], since the Jaredites are supposed to have originated from the time of the [[Tower of Babel]], and presumably did not speak Hebrew.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Packham, Richard. [http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm "A Linguist Looks at Mormonism"]. April 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican names===
Mormon archaeologist [[Bruce W. Warren]] has noted that some [[Jaredite]] names may have become a part of later Nephite culture, suggesting that there may have been survivors or refugees of the great Jaredite battle besides [[Coriantumr]]. He cites the names "Kib", "Kish", "Shule", and "Com" as examples of Jaredite names that are similar to names found in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Warren |first=Bruce |url=http://www.ldsmag.com/ancients/050526mesoamerica.html |title=Surviving Jaredite Names in Mesoamerica |website=Meridian Magazine |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214125454/http://www.ldsmag.com/ancients/050526mesoamerica.html |archivedate=December 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian names===
[[John Gee]], John A. Tvedtnes, and [[Hugh Nibley]] argue that some Book of Mormon names appear to be [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. Tvedtnes, Gee, and Roper note that [[William F. Albright]] considered the names "[[Paanchi]]" and "[[Pahoran]]" to be Egyptian names.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In his book ''Lehi in the Desert'', Nibley compares names found in the Book of Mormon with ancient Egyptian names from [[Upper Egypt]]. The comparisons show that many names in the Book of Mormon are similar to names in a certain region and era of ancient Egypt. Nibley postulates that names do not match exactly due to the process of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]. Parallels drawn by Nibley between Egyptian names and Book of Mormon names include "Paanchi" and "Pahoran", and further include several others including "[[Korihor]]" (Kherihor, a high priest at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]) and "[[Morianton]]" (Meriaton, an Egyptian prince),&lt;ref&gt;''Lehi in the Desert'', p. 27. His source for the Egyptian name is [[Hermann Ranke]], ''Die Agyptischen Personennamen'' ["The Egyptian Personal Names"], Gluckstadt: Augustin, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ammon" (Amun, the most common name in ancient Egypt).&lt;ref&gt;''Lehi in the Desert'', pp. 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Finley has disagreed with these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Thomas, "Does the Book of Mormon Reflect a Near Eastern Background", in Beckwith, Mosser and Owen, ''New Mormon Challenge: Responding to the Latest Defenses of a Fast-Growing Movement'', Zondervan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that the parallels drawn by Nibley and others ignore the possibility of simple coincidence and lack a defined methodology for assessing the importance of the parallels. Tvetdnes and Roper responded by noting that there are too many coincidences for such an assessment to be credible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=15&amp;num=1&amp;id=472 One Small Step - Matthew Roper, and John A. Tvedtnes - FARMS Review - Volume 15 - Issue 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith, in a letter written in 1843 to the Mormon publication ''[[Millennial Star]]'', wrote that the name "Mormon" came from "the Egyptian Mon, hence with the addition of more, or the contraction, mor, we have the word Mormon, which means, literally, more good."&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher, Stuart A, "Mormon: An example of folk etymology", ''Western Folklore'', vol. 8, no. 1, January 1949, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Urrutia]] suggests the name "Mormon" is derived from Egyptian "mor" ("love") and ''mon'' ("firmly established"), rendering "Mormon" as "love is firmly established."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Urrutia, [http://www.lds.org/new-era/1983/06/the-name-connection "The Name Connection,"] ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', June 1983, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Packham criticizes Smith's interpretation, stating that the English word "more" or "mor" is out of place in an Egyptian name.&lt;ref&gt;Packham, Richard. [http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#MORMON "A Linguist Looks at Mormonism: Notes on linguistics problems in Mormonism"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek names===
Smith stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', "there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'', vol.4, no. 13 (May 15, 1843) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian D. Stubbs has stated that though the language of the [[Mulekites]] isn't put forward in the Book of Mormon, it could have consisted of Phoenician, Greek, or Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stubbs|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Packham has pointed out that the Book of Mormon contains some Greek and Latin names, some of which are [[hellenization]]s of Hebrew names (e.g., "Antipas", "Archeantus", "Esrom", "Ezias", "Judea", and "Zenos") and some of which are Greek or Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#GKNAMES A Linguist Looks at Mormonism, More Greek Names].&lt;br /&gt;[http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#LUCIFER A Linguist Looks at Mormonism, Lucifer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I think I know what this sentence is trying to say, but I don't think the link is appropriate; the wording is also difficult to understand ("outside of a demonstration of a systemetized influence"): "As with chiasmus, the method of identifying apparent similarities between Book of Mormon names and known proper names from a variety of sources outside of a demonstration of a systemetized influence, has been criticized with humor, as in the article ''Lehi in the Pacific: Powerful New Evidence for the Book of Mormon.'' [http://home.teleport.com/%7Epackham/pacific.htm LEHI IN THE PACIFIC]"--&gt;

==Word choice in translation==

The mechanics of the method by which the Book of Mormon was claimed to have been translated have been examined by various scholars in order to determine how words were chosen. Various accounts from witnesses to the translation process exist, including [[David Whitmer]] and [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], two of the [[Three Witnesses]]. Statements of the exact methods used in translation vary depending upon the account. A number of these accounts were written many years after the events occurred.

===Method of translation===
LDS Church authorities do not claim to know the exact method by which translation and word choice was accomplished. In an address given in 1992 at a seminar for new [[mission president]]s at the [[Missionary Training Center]], church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Russell M. Nelson]] stated that "[t]he details of this miraculous method of translation are still not fully known." In order to illustrate this, Nelson quoted the words Whitmer, who wrote regarding the use of a [[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]] in the translation process over 50 years after it had occurred,&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|1993|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.&lt;ref&gt;David Whitmer, "An Address to All Believers in Christ", Richmond, Missouri: n.p., 1887, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nelson also noted statements made by Smith's wife [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]], who gave her account of the translation method in 1856:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.&lt;ref&gt;(Edmund C. Briggs, "A Visit to Nauvoo in 1856", ''Journal of History'', January 1916, p. 454.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] (as quoted by [[Edward Stevenson]] in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' in 1881) described the translation process as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By aid of the seer stone, sentences would appear and were read by the Prophet . ... [W]hen finished [Smith] would say "Written," and if correctly written that sentence would disappear and another appear in its place, but if not written correctly it remained until corrected, so that the translation was just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the language then used.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stevenson, "One of the Three Witnesses," reprinted from Deseret News, 30  November 1881 in ''[[Millennial Star]]'', '''44''' (6  February 1882): 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Word substitution===
One challenge in performing a linguistic analysis of the Book of Mormon is that no original text is available for analysis; only handwritten printers' copies transcribed from the original handwritten copies of the original English text, and a few pages of the original translation produced by Smith are available. As with any translation, the influence of the translator is inextricably part of the translated text in matters of word choice. Some Mormon scholars have theorized that when words are found in the Book of Mormon that seem anachronistic, or that refer to items not known to have existed in the pre-Columbian Americas during the period of time covered by the Book of Mormon (e.g., horse, elephant, chicken, cattle, swine, barley, bull, calf, and hilt), these words could be an approximation "in translation" to things that ''did'' exist in pre-Columbian America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1985|pp=293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common criticism of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is the belief that, if the accounts of the translation process are accurate, then there is very little room for error in the word choices used in the translation of the Book of Mormon (since each word was believed to be divinely approved and could not be written incorrectly)&lt;!-- For example, http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/162-6a.htm, http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/3913intro.htm, http://www.apologeticspress.org/rr/reprints/Book-of-Mormon.pdf to name a few --&gt;. In other words, "steel" must mean steel, "hilt" must mean hilt, "elephant" must mean elephant, and so forth.&lt;!-- Again, there are numerous internet references that make this claim, which is probably sufficient to establish an this criticism as being common. --&gt; However, as Whitmer was never directly involved in the translation and Harris was involved for only a brief period of time, Mormon apologists consider it unlikely that either of these accounts is as accurate as the accounts of Smith and Cowdery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ricks|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
Several critics have pointed to grammatical errors in the [[Early Modern English]] style of the Book of Mormon and made the argument that because the original MS, the printer's MS, and the first edition of the Book of Mormon appear to have contained hundreds of grammatical errors, the book was therefore fabricated by Smith and not divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Benjamin Pierce, 1899, "The Origin of the 'Book of Mormon'", ''American Anthropologist'' n.s. 1:675–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abanes"&gt;{{Cite book|

* "Adam and Eve, which was our first parents" (1 Nephi 5:11)
* "And this he done that he might subject them to him" (Alma 2:10)
* "that they did not fight against God no more"  (Alma 23:7)
* "thou remembereth the twelve apostles of the Lamb" (1 Nephi 12:9)
* "and I have not written but a small part of the things I saw" (1 Nephi 14:28)
* "therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they had ought" (1 Nephi 15:3)
* "and the words of Amulek which was declared unto the people" (Alma 9 (preface))
* "Now the object of these lawyers were to get gain" (Alma 10:32)
* 2 Nephi 1:30–32, Lehi speaks to Zoram: "And now, Zoram, I speak unto '''you''': Behold, '''thou''' art the servant of Laban ... if '''ye''' shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of '''thy''' seed with the seed of my son."  ''You/ye'' are plural pronouns and ''thou/thy'' are singular pronouns, but the text switches back and forth between them.
* 2 Nephi 3:1, Lehi says: "And now I speak unto '''you''', Joseph, my last-born. '''Thou''' wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions ..."  ''You'' is incorrectly used when addressing a single individual.
* Mosiah 2:19–20, King Benjamin says: "O how '''you''' ought to thank your heavenly King! ... if '''you''' should render all the thanks and praise".  ''You'' is the object form of the second person plural pronoun; ''ye'' is the subject form, but the object form is incorrectly used in subject position here and also in dozens of other places throughout the text.

Apologist Stanford Carmack has responded to this issue by providing evidence of Early Modern English usage of the above forms: "many ostensibly defective forms reflect usage from earlier stages of the English language. Most of these are clearly attested in the textual record of EModE and even late ME—some frequently, some rarely. ... BofM language is, generally speaking, only nonstandard from our standpoint, centuries after the Elizabethan era, which appears to be the epicenter of the book's syntax."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carmack|2014|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDS Church apostle [[George A. Smith]] responded to this issue: "[when] the Lord reveals anything to men He reveals it in language that accords with their own. If any of you were to converse with an angel, and you used strictly grammatical language he would do the same. But if you used two negatives in a sentence the heavenly messenger would use language to correspond with your understanding, and this very objection to the Book of Mormon is an evidence in its favor."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''12''':335 (15 November 1868).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallelomania==
Critics of Book of Mormon linguistic studies often reject the claims of Mormon scholars on the grounds that the parallels they draw between Book of Mormon and other sources amounts to "[[parallelomania]]", which is defined as the "over use or improper use of parallels in the exposition of a text."

One researcher, Douglas F. Salmon, alleged that Mormon scholars' work in drawing parallels between the Book of Mormon and other sources fits this classification.&lt;ref name = salmon&gt;Salmon, Douglas F., [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fdialogue&amp;CISOPTR=11018&amp;REC=3&amp;CISOBOX=names "Parallelomania and the Study of Latter-day Saint Scripture: Confirmation, Coincidence, or the Collective Unconscious?"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', volume 33, number 2, Summer 2000, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Salmon notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been an exegetical trend during the last several decades to draw endless parallels to text from the ancient Near East and beyond in an attempt to validate the writings in the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. The pioneer and leader in this effort has been the great LDS scholar Hugh Nibley. In recent years the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) has continued this legacy. The number of parallels that Nibley has been able to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources is truly staggering. Unfortunately, there seems to be a neglect of any methodological reflection or articulation in this endeavor.&lt;ref name = salmon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Salmon also notes that Nibley was a critic of parallelomania where it is used to disparage the Book of Mormon, despite his extensive scholarship on the subject in defense of the Book of Mormon, noting that Nibley "ignores" the fact that parallels may suggest a unity of religious thought, or simple coincidence.&lt;ref name = salmon/&gt; He also goes on to demonstrate several instances where Nibley misrepresented the parallels and jumped to conclusions regarding the significance of his examples.

Salmon's analysis of Nibley was itself later critiqued in a response to his article from William Hamblin of FARMS.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Hamblin, [http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=13&amp;num=2&amp;id=391 "Joseph or Jung? A Response to Douglas Salmon"], ''[[FARMS Review]]'', volume 13, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Hamblin criticized Salmon for critiquing a few weakly supported parallels made by Nibley while ignoring both much more strongly supported parallels made by Nibley and "a broader analysis" of Nibley's arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38861">Nineteen of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays first appeared in [[quarto]] before the publication of the [[First Folio]] in 1623, eighteen of those before his death in 1616. One play co-authored with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'', was first published in 1634, and one play first published in the First Folio, ''The Taming of the Shrew'', was later published in quarto. Following are listed the '''Shakespeare plays that appeared in quarto''' up to 1642 with complete [[title page]] information from each edition.

'''Multimodal anthropology''' is an emerging subfield of social [[cultural anthropology]] that encompasses anthropological research and knowledge production across multiple traditional and new media platforms and practices including [[film]], [[video]], [[photography]], theatre, design, [[podcast]], mobile apps, interactive games, web-based social networking, immersive [[360-degree video|360 video]] and [[augmented reality]]. As characterized in [[American Anthropologist]]'','' multimodal anthropology is an "anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms" (Collins, Durington &amp; Gill).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Samuel Gerald|last2=Durington|first2=Matthew|last3=Gill|first3=Harjant|date=2017-01-12|title=Multimodality: An Invitation|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=142–146|doi=10.1111/aman.12826|issn=0002-7294}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimodal approach also encourages [[anthropologist]] to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.

== History and background ==
Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and [[Field research|fieldwork]] from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the [[20th century|twentieth century]] whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as [[psychotherapy]], [[phonetics]], [[genetics]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]] to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media.

Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to [[photography]], [[film]] cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of [[visual anthropology]] as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of [[21st century|twenty-first century]] including mobile networking, [[social media]], [[Geotagging|geo-mapping]], [[virtual reality]], [[Podcast|podcasting]], [[interactive design]], along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within [[visual anthropology]], such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and [[Harjant Gill]] note in their introductory essay on title "Multimodality: An Invitation," published in [[American Anthropologist]], "multimodal anthropologies does not attempt – or desire – to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of [[visual anthropology]] while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience''' (NAYLE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAYLE - National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience|url = http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/Resources/NAYLE.aspx|website = www.scouting.org|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a training program of  [[Boy Scouts of America]]. The format is a week-long, leadership development experience, providing young men and women aged 14 through 20 the environment to enhance their leadership skills.

==Program content==

Initially developed for [[Philmont Training Center]] (PTC) at Rayado Ridge Leadership Camp in Cimarron, New Mexico, the program has been offered regionally and at other high adventure bases. NAYLE is an element of the [[BSA Youth Training|Youth Leadership Training Continuum]].

NAYLE expands upon the team-building and ethical decision-making skills learned in [[National Youth Leadership Training]] (NYLT), which is a pre-requisite for NAYLE. NAYLE uses the Philmont Ranger training and advanced search-and-rescue training to teach leadership, teamwork, and the lessons of selfless service. NAYLE is included in the overall [[Leadership training (Boy Scouts of America)|leadership training]] program.

NAYLE replaces the National Youth Leader Instructor Camp (NYLIC), which itself replaced the previous National Junior Leader Instructor Camp (NJLIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scouting Magazine: Philmont Begins New Boy Scout Leadership Course |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0601/a-lern.html#sbara |date=January–February 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |author=Boy Scouts of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike NYLIC, NAYLE is not intended to specifically train youth staff for local NYLT courses.

As of 2018, challenging program is based at two of the four Boy Scout High Adventure bases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAYLE - National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience - Boy Scouts of America |url=https://www.scouting.org/programs/boy-scouts/resources/nayle/ |website=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prior years (2011 to 2013), NAYLE was conducted regionally at Boy Scout camps including [[Onteora Scout Reservation]] in Livingston Manor, NY, but these courses have since been discontinued.

==Program goals==

The program promises a number of [[Subjectivity|subjective outcomes]] focusing on an individual's perspective, opinion, and feelings, including "growing self-awareness, growing self-confidence, growing creativity, the happiness from helping others succeed, understanding that everyone is a leader, everyone in the group contributes in a significant way to team success, knowing leadership is a way of life."

The program's goals are to:

* Encourage others to a life of leadership service
* Act as a servant leader who shares the skills of [[National Youth Leadership Training|NYLT]] and helps develop other leaders through their enhanced understanding of the material
* Intuitively use the leadership skills in all aspects of their lives
* Be an advocate for [[Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops|ILST]], [[Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews|ILSC]] and [[National Youth Leadership Training|NYLT]] in their local environment
* Use positive reinforcement to help others do their best

NAYLE is designed to equip participants with the skills to return to their local council and serve as staff on their local NYLT course, as summer camp staff, and as better troop leaders. NAYLE is designed to teach participants servant leadership skills in Scouting and for later life so they can lead for the good of others.

==Program activities==

During the week-long backcountry experience, participants are challenged with various activities linked to the skills of leadership defined in NYLT:

==Requirements==

Attendees must meet these qualifications:

* Be a graduate of their home unit's leadership training program&lt; (either [[Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops]] or its [[Venturing]] equivalent, [[Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews]], and have completed [[National Youth Leadership Training]] (NYLT).
* Be in good physical condition (Parts A, B, C, and D of the BSA Annual Health and Medical Record is required).
* Be at least 14 years of age by the first day of the program (and less than 20 years old).
* Currently hold a leadership position in their home unit.

In 2010, program attendance was opened to females.  The NYLT to NAYLE Bridge Course was available during the first quarter of 2010 for Venturing youth who were not previously able to take NYLT. Venturing Crew members must now take NYLT to attend NAYLE.

The cost of the program varies by venue. Travel to each location is the responsibility of the participant.

[[File:1600 Himmelsscheibe von Nebra sky disk anagoria.jpg|thumb|Another photograph, at the [[Pergamon Museum]] ]]

The '''Nebra sky disk''' is a [[bronze]] disk of around {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} diameter and a weight of {{convert|2.2|kg|lb}}, with a blue-green [[patina]] and inlaid with gold symbols. These are interpreted generally as a sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars (including a cluster interpreted as the [[Pleiades]]). Two golden arcs along the sides, marking the angle between the [[solstice]]s, were added later. A final addition was another arc at the bottom surrounded with multiple strokes (of uncertain meaning, variously interpreted as a [[Solar Deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|Solar Barge]] with numerous oars, as the [[Milky Way]], or as a [[rainbow]]).

The disk is attributed to a site near [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], in Germany, and [[Archaeological association|associatively]] [[Chronological dating|dated]] to {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1600 BC. It has been associated with the [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] [[Unetice culture]].

The style in which the disk is executed was unlike any artistic style then known from the period, with the result the object was initially suspected of being a [[forgery]], but it is now widely accepted as authentic.

The Nebra sky disk features the oldest concrete depiction of the [[cosmos]] yet known from anywhere in the world. In June 2013 it was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] and termed "one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-6/nebra-sky-disc/ | work=Unesco memory of the World  | title=Nebra Sky Disc | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The disk, two bronze swords, two hatchets, a chisel, and fragments of spiral bracelets were discovered in 1999 by Henry Westphal and Mario Renner while they were treasure-hunting with a metal detector. Archaeological artifacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt. The hunters were operating without a license and knew their activity constituted looting and was illegal. They damaged the disk with their spade and destroyed parts of the site. The next day, Westphal and Renner sold the entire hoard for 31,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] to a dealer in [[Cologne]]. The hoard changed hands within Germany over the next two years, being sold for up to a million&amp;nbsp;DM. By 2001 knowledge of its existence had become public. In February 2002 the state archaeologist Harald Meller acquired the disk in a police-led sting operation in [[Basel]] from a couple who had put it on the black market for 700,000&amp;nbsp;DM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H.|date=January 2004|title=Star search|journal=National Geographic|pages=76–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original finders were eventually traced. In a plea bargain, they led police and archaeologists to the discovery site. Archaeologists opened a dig at the site and uncovered evidence that supports the looters' claims. There are traces of bronze artifacts in the ground, and the soil at the site matches soil samples found clinging to the artifacts. The disk and its accompanying finds are now held at the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|State Museum of Prehistory]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

The two looters received sentences of four months and ten months, respectively, from a [[Naumburg]] court in September 2003. They appealed, but the appeals court raised their sentences to six and twelve months, respectively.

The discovery site is a [[prehistoric enclosure]] encircling the top of a {{convert|252|m}} elevation in the [[Ziegelroda Forest]], known as ''Mittelberg'' ("central hill"), some 60&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Leipzig]]. The surrounding area is known to have been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era, and Ziegelroda Forest contains approximately 1,000 [[tumulus|barrows]].

The enclosure is oriented in such a way that the sun seems to set every [[solstice]] behind the [[Brocken]], the highest peak of the [[Harz]] mountains, some 80&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west. The treasure-hunters claimed the artifacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.

==Dating==
[[Image:Nebra Schwerter.jpg|thumb|The [[Bronze Age sword|swords]] found with the disk]]
[[Image:Nebra Hort.jpg|thumb|Other associated finds: chisel, axeheads, bracelets]]
The precise [[Chronological dating|dating]] of the Nebra sky disk depended upon the dating of a number of Bronze Age weapons, which were offered for sale with the disk and said to be from the same site. These axes and swords can be dated typologically to the mid 2nd millennium BC. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a birchbark particle found on one of the swords to between 1600 and 1560 BC confirmed this estimate. This corresponds to the date of burial, at which time the disk had likely been in existence for several generations.

==Origin of the metals==
According to an initial analysis of trace elements by [[x-ray fluorescence]] by E. Pernicka, then at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|University of Freiberg]], the copper originated at [[Bischofshofen]] in Austria, while the [[gold]] was thought to be from the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Pernicka, E.|author2= Wunderlich, C-H.|last-author-amp= yes|title=Naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen an den Funden von Nebra|journal=Archäologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent analysis found that the gold used in the first phase was from the [[river Carnon]] in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ehser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehser|first=Anja |first2=Gregor|last2=Borg |first3=Ernst|last3=Pernicka |title=Provenance of the gold of the Early Bronze Age Nebra Sky Disk, central Germany: geochemical characterization of natural gold from Cornwall|journal=European Journal of Mineralogy|date=2011|volume=23|issue=6|pages=895–910|doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2011/0023-2140|url=http://eurjmin.geoscienceworld.org/content/23/6/895.short|accessdate=12 November 2013|bibcode=2011EJMin..23..895E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tin present in the bronze was also of Cornish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4754.2010.00515.x | volume=52 | title=Tin isotopy: a new method for solving old questions | year=2010 | journal=Archaeometry | pages=816–832 | last1 = Haustein | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The disk as preserved was developed in four stages (Meller 2004):
# Initially the disk had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached. The circular plate is interpreted as either the [[Sun]] or the [[full Moon]], the crescent shape as the [[Lunar phase|crescent Moon]] (or either the Sun or the Moon undergoing [[eclipse]]), and the dots as [[star]]s, with the cluster of seven dots likely representing the [[Pleiades]].
# At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disk. To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible. The two arcs span an angle of 82°, correctly indicating the angle between the positions of sunset at summer and winter [[solstice]] at the latitude of the Mittelberg (51°N)&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lost Treasures; Civilization's Great Riches Rediscovered | publisher=Carlton Books | author=McIntosh, Jane | year=2010 | location=London | pages=16 | isbn=9781847322999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given that the arcs relate to solar phenomena, it is likely the circular plate represents the Sun not the Moon.
# The final addition was another arc at the bottom, the "[[solar barge|sun boat]]", again made of gold from a different origin.
# By the time the disk was buried it also had thirty-nine holes punched out around its perimeter, each approximately 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance==
The disk may be an [[archaeoastronomy|astronomical]] instrument as well as an item of [[prehistoric religion|religious]] significance. The blue-green patina of the bronze may have been an intentional part of the original artifact.&lt;ref name=meller2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H|date=2002|title=Die Himmelsscheibe von Nebra – ein frühbronzezeitlicher Fund von außergewohnlicher Bedeutung|journal=Archäeologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=7–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find is regarded as reconfirming that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the [[European Bronze Age]] included close observation of the yearly course of the [[Sun]], and the angle between its rising and setting points at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s. While much older [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] and [[megalithic]] [[astronomical complex]]es such as the [[Goseck circle]] and [[Stonehenge]] had already been used to mark the solstices, the disk is the oldest known "portable instrument" to allow such measurements. Pásztor, however, sees no evidence that the disk was a practical device for solar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Emilia | last = Pásztor | author-link = | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L. N. | chapter = Nebra Disk | title = Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy | date = 2015 | pages = 1349–1356 | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_128 | isbn = 978-1-4614-6140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euan MacKie]] suggests that the Nebra disk may be linked to the solar calendar reconstructed by [[Alexander Thom]] from his analysis of standing stone alignments in Britain.&lt;ref name="MacKie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=MacKie, E|date=2006|chapter=New evidence for a professional priesthood in the European Early Bronze Age?|title=Viewing the Sky Through Past and Present Cultures: Selected Papers from the Oxford VII International Conference on Archaeoastronomy|editor=Todd W. Bostwick|editor2=Bryan Bates|series= [[Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites|Pueblo Grande Museum]] Anthropological Papers |volume=15|publisher=City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department|pages=343–362|isbn=1-882572-38-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
There were initial suspicions that the disk might be an [[archaeological forgery]]. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disk was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disk could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disk in his own hands, unlike eighteen scientists who had actually examined the disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCD175863466D41BB9A6A93D460B81174/Doc~E4115FE522E3C4CDD89890E5C3B4A9106~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Himmelsscheibe von Nebra - Eine Komödie der Irrungen|date=March 17, 2005|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=German|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the [[University of Bristol]] and an expert on the [[Beaker people]], allowed his initial reaction to be quoted in a [[BBC]] documentary:&lt;ref name=BBC2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/stardisctrans.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Secrets of the Star Disc|date=2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery. Because it’s such an extraordinary piece that it wouldn’t surprise any of us that a clever forger had cooked this up in a backroom and sold it for a lot of money."
Although Harrison had not seen the skydisk when he was interviewed, his skepticism was reasonable at that point, but the disk is widely accepted now as authentic and is dated to roughly 1600 BC on grounds of typological classification of the associated finds.
As the item was not excavated using archaeological methods, even its claimed provenance could have been fictitious - hence its authentication has depended on microphotography of corrosion crystals,&lt;ref name=BBC2008 /&gt; which has produced images of structures that could not be reproduced by a faker.
[[Image:SkyDiscVisitorsCentre.JPG|thumb|The Sky Disc Visitor Center near Nebra]]

Harald Meller, lecturing to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in April 2008, gave a list of facts supporting the authenticity of the disc, and for its having been found at the site on the Mittelberg. The most persuasive of the latter was the discovery by the archaeologists — in the pit in which the looters said they had found the metalwork — of a fragment of gold leaf exactly fitting the gap present in the gold leaf covering of the 'sun' symbol when it was originally recovered.

==Exhibition==
The disk was the center of an exhibition entitled ''Der geschmiedete Himmel'' (German "The [[smithing|smithied]] sky"), showing 1,600 Bronze Age artifacts, including the [[Trundholm sun chariot]], shown at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] from 15 October 2004 to 22 May 2005, from 1 July to 22 October 2005 in [[Copenhagen]], from 9 November 2005 to 5 February 2006 in [[Vienna]], from 10 March to 16 July 2006 in [[Mannheim]], and from 29 September 2006 to 25 February 2007 in [[Basel]].

On 20 June 2007 a multimedia visitor center was opened near the discovery site at Nebra.

The disk is part of the permanent exhibition in the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory)]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

==Legal issues==
The [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has registered the disk as a [[trademark]], which has resulted in two lawsuits. In 2003, Saxony-Anhalt successfully sued the city of [[Querfurt]] for depicting the disk design on souvenirs. Saxony-Anhalt also successfully sued the publishing houses [[Piper Verlag|Piper]] and Heyne over an abstracted depiction of the disk on book covers.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelsscheibe von Nebra {{cite web |url=http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051336/http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magdeburg]] court assessed the case's relevance according to [[German copyright law]]. The defenders argued that as a cultic object, the disk had already been "published" in the Bronze Age, and that consequently, all protection of [[intellectual property]] associated with it has long expired. The plaintiff on the other hand, argued that the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the disk is recent, and according to German law protected for 25 years, until 2027. Another argument concerned the question whether a notable work of art may be registered as a trademark in the first place.

[[File:Howdy Doody peanut gallery circa 1940 1950s.JPG|thumb|325px|Howdy Doody peanut gallery {{circa|1940}} to the 1950s]]

A '''peanut gallery''' was, in the days of [[vaudeville]], a nickname for the cheapest and ostensibly rowdiest seats in the theater, the occupants of which were often known to [[Heckler|heckle]] the performers.&lt;ref name=TSD_1999&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowland|first=Ian|title= What's the origin of the expression ‘peanut gallery’?|url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1538/whats-the-origin-of-the-expression-peanut-gallery |work= The Straight Dope| accessdate= March 28, 2013| authorlink = Ian Rowland |date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The least expensive snack served at the theatre would often be [[peanut]]s, which the patrons would sometimes throw at the performers on stage to convey their disapproval.  Phrases such as "no comments from the peanut gallery" or "quiet in the peanut gallery" are extensions of the name.&lt;ref name =TSD_1999 /&gt;

In 1943 the ''[[Howdy Doody]]'' children's radio show adopted the name for its live audience of children.&lt;ref name=Smith_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith | first =Andrew F.|title=Peanuts: The Illustrious History of the Goober Pea|year=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn= 978-0-252-02553-2 |page=129|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JbOsI9RG8fYC&amp;lpg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howdy Doody is most remembered for its later transition to television, which continued the Peanut Gallery audience, now on camera.

==In popular culture==

In recent times, the term has taken on new meanings with the advent of [[Social networking service|social networks]] and online [[chat room]]s. "Peanut gallery" may also refer to the stream of open comments visible on certain types of blogs.&lt;ref name = "BIO230 Blog Archives"&gt;{{cite web| work = BIO230 | type = Web log | title = Bacteriophages | publisher = Word press |date=Fall 2010 | url = http://bio230fall2010.wordpress.com/tag/bacteriophage/|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar term was introduced to Brazilian football by coach [[Luis Felipe Scolari]]. He called [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]]' complaining audience that sat in the closest seats "''Turma do Amendoim''" ("peanut gang").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = Folha da manhã | title=Felipão criou o apelido "Turma do Amendoim" no Palmeiras; leia trecho |trans-title=Felipão created the ‘Peanut gang’ nickname: read passage | url= http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/esporte/ult92u649799.shtml|accessdate=March 28, 2013 |newspaper=Folha de S.

The '''Philippine Commission on Women''' (formerly the '''National Commission on the Role of the Filipino Women'''), is a government agency run by the government of the [[Philippines]] with the intention of promoting and protecting the rights of the [[Women in the Philippines]]. It was established on January 7, 1975 through Presidential Decree No. 633.

On August 14, 2009, the '''Magna Carta of Women''' was signed into law providing better protection for women. According to the United Nations' 2009 Human Development Report, the Philippines is 40th out of 155 nations when the gender-related development index is compared directly to the human development index, While the [[World Economic Forum]]'s [[Global Gender Gap Report]] for 2009 lists the country at a ranking 9 among of about 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/Communities/Women%20Leaders%20and%20Gender%20Parity/GenderGapNetwork/GenderGapNetwork Gender Gap Index 2009]. October 27, 2009. [[World Economic Forum]]. Retrieved on January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2016, PCW was among the 12 agencies, formerly from the Office of the President reassigned to the [[Cabinet Secretariat of the Philippines|Office of the Cabinet Secretary]], based on Executive Order No. 1 issued by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/138583-duterte-first-executive-order-poverty|title=Duterte's 1st EO: Simpler, faster anti-poverty services|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Ranada|first=Pia|date=July 4, 2016|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2018, through Executive Order No. 67, the Commission, along with the [[National Commission on Muslim Filipinos]] and the [[National Youth Commission (Philippines)|National Youth Commission]], was transferred from the Office of the Cabinet Secretary to the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]].

==Organization==
[[Image:Young Filipinas of Marigondon, early 1800s.jpg|260x260px|thumb|right|Young Filipinas of Marigondon, early 1800s. From ''Aventures d'un Gentilhomme Breton aux iles Philippines'' by [[Paul de la Gironière]] (1855). Filipino women often had better rights than their counterparts elsewhere even during colonial times.]]

The Commission initially established as an advisory body to the [[President of the Philippines|President]] and the Cabinet on policies and programs for the advancement of women. It is mandated ''"to review, evaluate, and recommend measures, including priorities to ensure the full integration of women for economic, social and cultural development at national, regional and international levels, and to ensure further equality between women and men.''&lt;ref name = "role" &gt;[http://www.ncrfw.gov.ph/index.php/ncrfw-profile About Us]. National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women. Retrieved on January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the organization included the following:
*Organizing women into a nationwide movement called ''"Balikatan sa Kaunlaran"'' (now registered as an independent [[feminism|women's organization]]).
*Conducting policy studies and lobbying for the issuance of executive and legislative measures concerning women.
*Establishing a clearinghouse and information center on women
*Monitoring the implementation of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW)

==History==
[[File:Ismelda Marcos.PNG|right|thumb|487x487px|[[Imelda Marcos]]. The Commission was established during the presidency of [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]]

The Commission was established by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on January 7, 1975, with the intention of promoting the rights of women. After the [[People Power Revolution]], which installed [[Corazon Aquino]] into power, in 1986, the agency focused on women's concerns on policymaking in the government. This included the integration of the principle of [[gender equality]] in the 1987 [[Philippine Constitution]].&lt;ref name = "role" /&gt;

During this period Philippine Development Plan for Women (PDPW) (1989–1992) was adopted through Executive Order No. 348. Shortly after, the "Women in Nation-Building Act" (RA 7192) was enacted, which promotes "the integration of women as full and equal partners of men in development and nation-building". A campaign, supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), was initiated to help government officials and staff with training in promoting equality under a program called [[Gender and Development]] (GAD).

The Commission continued to push for stronger policies and programs on gender equality, with projects such as the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD) (from 1995–2025), a 30-year perspective plan that outlines the policies that enable women to participate benefit from national development. It was the country's main vehicle for implementing the 1995 [[Beijing Declaration]] and [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action (BPfA)]] adopted at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women]].

Since 1998, the commission's focus has been on [[poverty alleviation]], along with the advancement and protection of women's human rights, promoting women's economic empowerment, and promoting gender-responsive governance.

===Magna Carta of Women===
On August 14, 2009, Philippine President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed Republic Act 9710, also known as the Magna Carta of Women. Under the law, the "National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women" would be renamed the "Philippine Commission on Women". It will give way to the creation of the Gender Ombudsman under the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]] that will specifically handle [[women's rights]] concerns. The law will also provide penalties for the violation of the provisions of the magna carta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=496127 Magna Carta of Women signed]. August 15, 2009. The [[Philippine Star]]. Retrieved on January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenousportal.com/Gender/Philippines-President-signs-the-Magna-Carta-of-Women-into-law.html PGMA tasks PCW to ensure implementation of Magna Carta of Filipino Women.

Features of the law include:
*Review amendment or repeal of laws that are discriminatory to women.
*Ensure women’s equitable participation and representation in government, political parties, international bodies, civil service, and the private sector.
*Afford equal opportunities to women in relation to education, employment, livelihood, social protection, and others, and including [[women in the military]].
*Mandate access to information and services pertaining to women's health.

The Magna Carta of Women guarantees the rights of women, including farmers and [[Provinces of the Philippines|rural worker]]s, [[underground economy|informal sector]] workers and the [[shanty towns|urban poor]], [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous women]], and those with disabilities, as well as older women and girls. These guarantees rights that include those involving food security, affordable and secure housing, employment, the recognition and preservation of cultural identity, and to women's inclusion in discussions pertaining to development and peace issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49029 Philippines: Women's Rights Laws in Place].

==Functions ==
The functions of the Commission include the institution of gender responsiveness in national development plans, by preparing, assessing, and updating the National Plan for Women and by ensuring its implementation and monitoring its performance among the government agencies it is involved with. It also undertakes the advocacy of promoting economic, social and political [[feminism|empowerment of women]] by providing technical assistance in the strengthening of mechanisms on gender mainstreaming. Aside from this, the Commission ensures contributions by Filipino women to [[Culture of the Philippines|Philippine culture and traditions]] be preserved and enhanced in the process of modernization.&lt;ref name = "role" /&gt;

The Commission also coordinates with the provisions of the NCRFW by preparing plans for the development of the lives women, with continuous monitoring and assessment with the cooperation of relevant agencies. It also provides a database for information relating to women. Other activities include: gender-consciousness awareness programs, policy studies, legislation reviews that integrate women's concerns, technical services that ensure the development of institutional capabilities for gender and development (GAD) mainstreaming in government agencies and selected partners, monitoring and assessment of the implementation of laws and policies on women including the implementation of international conventions such as the [[Beijing Platform for Action]], and the implementation of pilot projects for the delivery of services for women as basis for policy formulation and program recommendations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">A '''Planning and Zoning Commission''' is a local [[election|elected]] or appointed [[government]] board charged with recommending to the local town or city council the boundaries of the various original [[zoning]] district and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein and any proposed amendments thereto and shall collect data and keep itself informed as to the best practices generally in effect in the matter city planning and zoning to the end that it may be qualified to act on measures affecting the present and future movement of traffic, the segregation of residential and business districts and the convenience and safety of persons and property in any way dependent on city planning and zoning. Some jurisdictions may refer to them also planning commissions, planning boards, zoning commissions, and zoning boards.

The [[chairman]] of the Planning and Zoning Commission (or a staff member) is responsible for publishing public hearing in the newspaper about certain matters that come before the commission.  Most [[municipal]] or [[County (United States)|county]] Planning and Zoning Commissions consist of five to seven members.  This number does not include alternates. In some states, planning and zoning commissions are regional or county.

Some communities elect planning and zoning commission members.  In other [[jurisdictions]], the Planning and Zoning Commissioners are appointed by the [[Mayor]] or [[First Selectman]] of the [[city]] or [[town]] and approved by the city's legislative body, i.e. [[city council]], [[board of aldermen]], etc. (some planning commissioners are appointed by the City Commission as a whole). 

Please note that planning and zoning commissions may also be approving agencies for development permits, variances to the zoning code. Other jurisdictions may have separate zoning board of adjustments or appeals appointed by the governing body that perform the function instead of the planning and zoning commission doing it. Some jurisdictions have featured court appointed zoning boards/boards of adjustment and appeals due to the quasi-judicial functions.

'''Retrogaming''', also known as '''classic gaming''' and '''old school gaming''', is the playing or collecting of older [[computer game|personal computer]], [[video game console|console]], and [[arcade game|arcade]] video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued.

Retrogaming has three main activities; vintage retrogaming, retrogaming emulation, and ported retrogaming. Vintage retrogaming includes games that are played on the original hardware. [[emulator|Emulation]] involves newer systems simulating old gaming systems, while ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations. Additionally, the term could apply to a newer game, but with features similar to those of older games, such as an "retro [[Role-playing video game|RPG]]" which features turn-based combat and an isometric camera perspective.

Participants in the hobby are sometimes known as retrogamers in the United Kingdom, while the terms "classic gamers" or "old school gamers" are more prevalent in the United States. Similarly, the games are known as retrogames, classic games, or old school games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/old-school-iphone-games-2011-10] GOING RETRO: 14 Old School Games You Can Play On Your iPhone Right Now&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the popularity of the Internet and emulation technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retrogaming as Nostalgia by D. S. Heineman|url = http://gamescriticism.org/articles/heineman-1-1/|website = Journal of Games Criticism|date = 2014-01-22|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Heineman, David|last = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras,&lt;ref name=NGenFit&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Revival of the Fittest |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=36-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that older games are more innovative and original,&lt;ref name=NGenFit/&gt; and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay.

Retrogaming and [[retrocomputing]] have been described as [[Digital preservation|preservation]] activity and as aspects of the [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/38392/230.pdf?sequence=4|title=Retrocomputing as Preservation and Remix|authors=Yuri Takhteyev, Quinn DuPont|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|quote=''This paper looks at the world of retrocomputing, a constellation of largely non-professional practices involving old computing technology. Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting “preservation.” At the same time, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that “remix” fragments from the past with newer elements or joining together historic components that were never combined before. While such “remix” may seem to undermine preservation, it allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative “situated knowledges” and histories of computing, which can sometimes be quite sophisticated. Recognizing such alternative epistemologies paves the way for alternative approaches to preservation.''|date=2013 |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-26 |work=iConference 2013 Proceedings (pp. 422–432). doi:10.9776/13230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
Retro games are generally those produced from the 1970s to early 2000s, and can include [[video game]]s for systems and consoles from the [[First generation of video game consoles|1st]] through [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|6th]] generations of [[Video game console|video game consoles]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40427838|title=Retro gaming: Why players are returning to the classics|last=Scott|first=Jennifer|date=2017-06-28|website=[[BBC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726221024/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40427838|archive-date=2017-07-26|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[personal computer game]]s for [[retrocomputing]] platforms. [[Arcade game]]s are also popular, and were frequently attributed to individual programmers. The transition between the retro and modern era coincides with the shift from 2D to 3D games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Retro-gaming, what is it? [Le retro-gaming, qu'est-ce-que c'est?] | publisher =grospixels.com | url =https://translate.google.ca/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grospixels.com%2Fsite%2Fdosretro1.php&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url | accessdate =2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some games are played on the original hardware; others are played through [[emulator|emulation]]. Some retro games can still be played online using just the internet browser via DOS emulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =10 best retro games you can play online | publisher =Mwave.com.au | url =http://www.mwave.com.au/blog/2014/6/18/10-best-retro-games-you-can-play-online-now | accessdate =2014-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, entirely new versions of the games are designed, or [[Video game remake|remade]]. As well as playing games, a subculture of retrogaming has grown up around the [[Video game music|music in retro games]].

== Retrogaming methods ==
In the wake of increasing nostalgia and the success of retro-compilations in the fifth, sixth, and seventh generations of consoles, retrogaming has become a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in modern games, as well. Modern retrogames impose limitations on color palette, resolution, and memory well below the actual limits of the hardware in order to mimic the look of older hardware. These may be based on a general concept of retro, as with ''[[Cave Story]]'', or an attempt to imitate a specific piece of hardware, as with ''[[La Mulana]]'' and its [[MSX]] color palette.

This concept, known as Deliberate Retro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Deliberately Retro | publisher =giantbomb.com | url =https://www.giantbomb.com/deliberately-retro/3015-996/ | accessdate =2017-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and NosCon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =NosCon | publisher =giantbomb.com | url =https://www.giantbomb.com/noscon/3015-4537/ | accessdate =2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began to gain traction thanks in part to the independent gaming scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =9 indie games shamelessly inspired by retro ancestors | publisher =gamesradar.com | url =http://www.gamesradar.com/9-indie-games-shamelessly-inspired-retro-ancestors/ | accessdate =2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the short development time was attractive and commercial viability was not a concern. Major publishers have embraced modern retrogaming with releases such as ''[[Mega Man 9]]'', an attempt to mimic NES hardware; ''[[Retro Game Challenge]]'', a compilation of new games on faux-NES hardware; and Sega's ''[[Fantasy Zone II]]'' remake, which uses emulated [[System 16]] hardware running on [[PlayStation 2]] to create a 16-bit reimagining of the 8-bit original.

=== Vintage retrogaming ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=|image2=|image3=Used Super Famicom consoles.jpg|width=220||caption3=Used Super Famicom consoles and games sold in like new condition in Akihabara. Used games are sold with or without packaging.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-12-crippled-by-nostalgia-the-fraud-of-retro-gaming&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vintage retrogaming involves players collecting the original hardware, cartridges, and discs the video games were originally released on.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Retrogaming?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-retrogaming.htm|website = wiseGEEK|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware collected includes arcade systems, old home consoles, and their cartridges and discs. Some of these collectables can be fairly expensive and hard to find, limiting the access to these old games.&lt;ref&gt;http://igcritic.com/what-happened-to-classic-video-game-packaging/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racketboy.com/retro/nintendo/snes/the-rarest-and-most-valuable-super-nintendo-snes-games&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority, however, sell for much less than their retail price.&lt;ref name=NGenReal&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Real Thing |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of vintage retrogaming has led to the circulation of pirated copies of retro games, which are generally considered to lack the collector value of the original cartridges and discs.&lt;ref name=NGenReal/&gt;

=== Retrogaming emulation ===
{{Main|Video game console emulator|l1=Video game emulator}}

Retrogaming emulation involves older gaming systems being emulated on new hardware. It bypasses the need to collect old consoles and original games. ROMs, read only memory files, are taken directly from the original cartridge or disc from third parties. They are then typically put online through file sharing sites and played via emulators on modern hardware.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are also often sold as re-releases, typically in compilations containing multiple games running on emulation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Classic Game Collections |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=40-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since emulation is a more accessible way to take part in retrogaming, it helped to popularize and expand on the hobby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ported retrogaming ===
Ported retrogaming involves old games being played on new systems, just as emulation. It differs from emulation because the games are being rewritten for the new system and don't use the original ROM files.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ported games are available through official collections, console-based downloads, and [[Handheld TV game|plug and play systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ported retrogaming is comparatively rare, since emulation is a much easier and more accurate method of running retro games on modern hardware.

==== Remakes ====
{{Main|Video game remake}}
Modern retrogaming may sometimes be more broadly applied to games that feature retro-style designs and reimaginings with more modern graphics. These enhanced [[Remake (software)|remakes]] include ''[[Pac-Man: Championship Edition]]'', ''[[Space Invaders Extreme]]'', ''[[Super Mega Worm]]'', ''[[3D Dot Game Heroes]]''. Some are based directly upon the enhanced emulation of original games, as with Nintendo's ''[[NES Remix]]''.

[[File:Paku-paku4-dos.png|thumb|Screenshot of ''Paku Paku'', a ''[[Pac-Man]]'' remake that targets the obscure and seldom used 160×100×16 mode of the [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] [[graphic card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathshadow.com/pakuPaku |title=Paku Paku – A game for early PC/MS-DOS Computers |first=Jason |last=Knight |publisher=deathshadow.com |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When remakes are created by an individual or a group of enthusiasts without commercial motivation, such games sometimes are also called [[fangames]]. These are often motivated by the phenomenon of [[abandonware]], which is the discontinuation of sales and support by the original producers. Examples of [[fan-made]] remakes are ''[[King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown (AGD Interactive)|King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown]]'', ''[[King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones]]'', and ''[[Freeciv]]''.

The nostalgia-based revival of older game styles has also been accompanied by the development of the modern [[Chiptunes#Today|chiptune genre]] of game music. Chiptunes are characterized by severe limitations of sound imposed by the author's self-restriction to using only the original sound chips from 8-bit or 16-bit games. These compositions are featured in many retro-style modern games and are popular in the [[demoscene]].

==== Re-releases ====
With the new possibility of the [[digital distribution]] in mid-2000 the commercial distribution of old classical game titles became feasible again as deployment and storage costs dropped significantly: {{Quote|'' [...] we can put something up on Steam [a digital distributor], deliver it to people all around the world, make changes. We can take more interesting risks.[...] Retail doesn’t know how to deal with those games. On Steam there’s no shelf-space restriction. It’s great because they’re a bunch of old, orphaned games''|[[Gabe Newell]]|[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]&lt;ref name=newell2007&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/11/21/rps-exclusive-gabe-newell-interview/|title=RPS Exclusive: Gabe Newell Interview |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |first=John |last=Walker |quote=''The worst days [for game development] were the cartridge days for the NES. It was a huge risk – you had all this money tied up in silicon in a warehouse somewhere, and so you’d be conservative in the decisions you felt you could make, very conservative in the IPs you signed, your art direction would not change, and so on. Now it’s the opposite extreme: we can put something up on Steam, deliver it to people all around the world, make changes. We can take more interesting risks.[...] Retail doesn’t know how to deal with those games. On Steam [a digital distributor] there’s no shelf-space restriction. It’s great because they’re a bunch of old, orphaned games.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A digital distributor specialized in bringing old games out of abandonware is ''[[GOG.com]]'' (formerly called ''Good Old Games'') who started 2008 to search for copyright holders of classic games to re-release them legally and [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free.&lt;ref name="arspreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age.ars |title=First look: GOG revives classic PC games for download age |accessdate=2012-12-27 |first=Frank|last=Caron |date=2008-09-09 |publisher=Ars Technica |quote=''[...] [Good Old Games] focuses on bringing old, time-tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable online platforms for classic video game re-releases include Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] and Sony's [[List of PlayStation Store games|PlayStation Network]].

Mobile application developers have been purchasing the rights and licensing to re-release vintage arcade games on iOS and Android operating systems. Some publishers are creating spinoffs to their classic games, keeping the core gameplay while adding new features, levels, and styles of play.

==== Plug-and-play systems ====
[[Handheld TV game|Plug-and-play systems]] have been released or licensed by companies such as [[Atari Flashback|Atari]], Sega, and [[NES Classic Edition|Nintendo]]. These systems include stand-alone game libraries and plug directly into the user’s television.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Retrogaming community ==
[[File:Logo - The Art of Video Games - Smithsonian American Art Museum.jpg|thumb|''The Art of Video Games'' premiered at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012.]]The video game industry has an active audience, including the retrogaming sector. The retrogaming community has both online and physical spaces where retrogames are discussed, collected, and played.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Online retrogaming community ===
There are several websites and online forums devoted to both retrogaming and video games in general. The content on these online platforms typically includes reviews of older games, interviews with developers, fan-made content, game walkthroughs, and message boards for discussions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many gameplay videos posted online feature attempts at breaking [[speedrun]] or [[Score_(game)#High_score|high score]] records.

=== Fighting game community ===
The competitive [[Fighting game community]] traces its legacy from old-school arcades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|title=Why the fighting game community is color blind|first=Mitch|last=Bowman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[fighting game]]s have continued to receive arcade releases after the end of the arcade era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2010/10/brief-history-of-2d-fighting-games.html|title=A Brief History of 2D Fighting Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Face-to-face competition of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' has been featured in the [[Evolution Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shoryuken.com/2015/06/05/evo-2015-super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-side-tournament-announced-registration-now-live/|title=Evo 2015 Super Street Fighter II Turbo Side Tournaments Unveiled, Registration Now Live|first=Ian|last=Walker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===
There are several events that retrogamers can take part in. Exhibits typically include vendors, retrogames available to play, tournaments, costumes, and live music, such as the Vancouver Retro Gaming Expo, run by Phase 3 events. This event has been occurring annually since March 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vancouver Retro Gaming Expo|url = http://www.vancouvergamingexpo.com/|website = www.vancouvergamingexpo.com|access-date = 2016-02-22|last = VGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retrogaming in museums ===
Retrogaming is recognized by [[museum]]s worldwide.  For example, the ''RetroGames'' arcade museum of [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]] was founded in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[https://retrogames.info/ RetroGames e.V.] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/29231 |title=Erster eingetragener Verein für Computer- und Konsolenspiele-Oldies eröffnet |publisher=[[Heise.de]] |first=Peter |last=Schmitz |date=2002-07-19 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin]] was founded in 1997.  Some classical art museums bear a video gaming retrospective, as with 2012's [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] exhibition titled ''[[The Art of Video Games]]''&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/story/2012-03-12/video-games-smithsonian/53502696/1? |title=Are video games art? Draw your own conclusions |first=Mike |last=Snider |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]] |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-06-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] "Applied Design" exhibition in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2012-11-29 |url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters |title=Video Games: 14 in the Collection, for Starters |first=Paola |last=Antonelli |work= Inside / Out. A MoMA/MoMA PS1 Blog |publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2015, The [[National Museum of Play]] adds games annually to the [[World Video Game Hall of Fame]].

== Legal issues surrounding retrogaming ==
Though many [[abandonware]] titles are available for free download on third-party websites, the duration of copyright on creative works in most countries is far longer than the era of home computing.

Emulators are typically created by third parties, and the software they run is often taken directly from the original games and put online for free download.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While it is completely legal for anyone to create an emulator for any hardware, unauthorized distribution of the code for a retro game is an infringement of the game's copyright.&lt;ref name=NGenEmu&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Emulations |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=42-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies have made public statements regarding the issues, such as Nintendo, stating that "the introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date in the intellectual property rights of video game developers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = {{!}} Nintendo – Corporate Information {{!}} Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.)|url = https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#helping|website = www.nintendo.com|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, video game developers and publishers typically turn a blind eye to emulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One reason for this is that at any given time, most of the games illegally distributed for emulation are not presently being sold by the company which owns the game, and so the damages the company would collect in the event of a successful lawsuit would most likely be negligible.&lt;ref name=NGenEmu/&gt;

The '''separation of mechanism and policy'''&lt;ref&gt;Butler W. Lampson and Howard E. Sturgis. ''[http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/15-ReflectionsOnOS/Acrobat.pdf Reflections on an Operating System Design]'' [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360051.360074] Communications of the ACM  19(5):251-265 (May 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[software design|design]] principle in [[computer science]].  It states that mechanisms (those parts of a system implementation that control the [[authorization]] of operations and the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]]) should not dictate (or overly restrict) the policies according to which decisions are made about which operations to authorize, and which resources to allocate.

This is most commonly discussed in the context of security mechanisms (authentication and authorization), but is actually applicable to a much wider range of resource allocation
problems (e.g. [[Scheduling (computing)|CPU scheduling]], [[memory allocation]], [[quality of service]]), and the general 
question of good object abstraction.

[[Per Brinch Hansen]] introduced the concept of separation of policy and mechanism in operating systems in the [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Per Brinch Hansen • IEEE Computer Society|url = http://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-per-hansen|website = www.computer.org|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artsy and Livny, in a 1987 paper, discussed an approach for an operating system design having an "extreme separation of mechanism and policy".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. S., &amp; Drexler, K. E. (1988). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033556/http://www.agorics.com/Library/agoricpapers/aos/aos.4.html "Markets and computation: Agoric open systems"]. In Huberman, B. A. (Ed.). (1988), pp. 133–176. ''The Ecology of Computation''. North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artsy, Yeshayahu ''et al.'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 article, Chervenak et al. described the principles of ''mechanism neutrality'' and ''policy neutrality''.&lt;ref&gt;Chervenak 2000 p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale and implications==

The separation of mechanism and policy is the fundamental approach of a [[microkernel]] that distinguishes it from a [[Monolithic kernel|monolithic]] one. In a microkernel the majority of operating system services are provided by user-level server processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphael Finkel]], [[Michael L. Scott]], Artsy Y. and Chang, H. ''[www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/1989_IEEETSE_Charlotte.pdf Experience with Charlotte: simplicity and function in a distributed operating system]. IEEE Trans. Software Engng 15:676-685; 1989. Extended abstract presented at the IEEE Workshop on Design Principles for Experimental Distributed Systems, Purdue University; 1986. &lt;/ref&gt; It is important for an [[operating system]] to have the flexibility of providing adequate mechanisms to support the broadest possible spectrum of real-world security policies.&lt;ref&gt;R. Spencer, S. Smalley, P. Loscocco, M. Hibler, D. Andersen, and J. Lepreau ''[http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/papers/flask-usenixsec99-abs.html The Flask Security Architecture: System Support for Diverse Security Policies]'' In Proceedings of the Eighth USENIX Security Symposium, pages 123–139, Aug. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is almost impossible to envision all of the different ways in which a system might be used by different types of users over the life of the product.  This means that any hard-coded policies are likely to be inadequate or inappropriate for some (or perhaps even most) potential users.
Decoupling the mechanism implementations from the policy specifications makes it possible for different applications to use the same mechanism implementations with different policies.  This means that those mechanisms are likely to better meet the needs of a wider range of users, for a longer period of time.

If it is possible to enable new policies without changing the implementing mechanisms, the costs and risks of such policy changes can be greatly reduced. In the first instance, this could be accomplished merely by segregating mechanisms and their policies into distinct modules: by replacing the module which dictates a policy (e.g. CPU scheduling policy) without changing the module which executes this policy (e.g. the scheduling mechanism), we can change the behaviour of the system.  Further, in cases where a wide or variable range of policies are anticipated depending on applications' needs, it makes sense to create some non-code means for specifying policies, i.e. policies are not hardcoded into executable code but can be specified as an independent description.  For instance, file protection policies (e.g.  [[Filesystem permissions|Unix's ''user/group/other read/write/execute'']]) might be parametrized. Alternatively an implementing mechanism could be designed to include an interpreter for a new policy specification language. In both cases, the systems are usually accompanied by a {{clarify-span|deferred binding|date=August 2013}} mechanism (e.g. [[configuration file]]s, or [[Application programming interface|API]]s) that permits policy specifications to be incorporated to the system or replaced by another after it has been delivered to the customer.

An everyday example of mechanism/policy separation is the use of [[Keycard lock|card keys]] to gain access to locked doors. The mechanisms (magnetic card readers, remote controlled locks, connections to a security server) do not impose any limitations on entrance policy (which people should be allowed to enter which doors, at which times). These decisions are made by a centralized security server, which (in turn) probably makes its decisions by consulting a database of room access rules. Specific authorization decisions can be changed by updating a room access database. If the rule schema of that database proved too limiting, the entire security server could be replaced while leaving the fundamental mechanisms (readers, locks, and connections) unchanged.

Contrast this with issuing physical keys:  if you want to change who can open a door, you have to issue new keys and change the lock.  This intertwines the unlocking mechanisms with the access policies.  For a hotel, this is significantly less effective than using key cards.

'''''The Spiritual Heritage of India''''' is a book written by [[Swami Prabhavananda]] (1893–1976), founder and head of the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]] from 1930 until his death. Originally published in 1962 by Doubleday, the book has been republished with the same title in several later editions, including hardcover, paperback, and sound recording. It has been reviewed in magazines&lt;ref name=ray63/&gt; and professional journals.&lt;ref name=gerber64&gt;William Gerber (1964).

==Topics covered==
Following an 8 page introduction, ''The Spiritual Heritage of India'' is divided into five major sections or "books":

:I. The [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]]. This contains chapters on  general aspects of the Vedas; On the [[Vedas|Samhitas]], [[Brahmanas]], and [[Aranyakas]]; and a lengthy chapter on the [[Upanishads]].

:II. The Auxiliary Scriptures. Chapters on the conceptual status of the auxiliary scriptures, including summaries of [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and [[Yoga Vasistha]]; on the [[Bhagavad Gita]]; and on the [[Smritis]], [[Puranas]], and [[Tantras]].

:III. [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. A chapter on each of these traditions.

:IV. The Six Systems of Thought. Chapters include general remarks on the six orthodox ([[astika]]) schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]; [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]]; [[Samkhya]]; [[Patanjali|Yoga system of Patanjali]]; [[Purva Mimamsa]]; and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (also known as the [[Vedanta Sutras]])

:V. Vedanta and Its Great Exponents. Chapters are included on [[Gaudapada]]; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]; [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]]; [[Yamuna]]; [[Ramanuja]]; [[Nimbarka]]; [[Madhvacharya|Madhwa]]; [[Vallabha]]; [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Sri Caitanya]]; and [[Sri Ramakrishna]].

The book concludes with a bibliography and index. In the foreword, Smith wrote that one of the book's
&lt;blockquote&gt;
many virtues is the way it integrates the variety in the Indian heritage which, left to itself, can be bewildering. Even Buddhism and Jainism, technically considered by Hindus to be unorthodox, are here shown to be authentic expressions of the basic Indian vision. Or the Six Systems of Indian Philosophy; often regarded as competitors, they are here shown to complement one another.... Indian thought as it emerges in the reading of this book is... pre-disciplinary in the rich and holistic way that Biblical, Chinese and early Greek thought are. (p. 9)&lt;ref name=smith78/&gt;

===Reviews===
A reviewer in the magazine ''[[Books Abroad]]'' (later renamed as ''[[World Literature Today]]'') stated that "The Spiritual Heritage of India offers a clear Indian view of a subject that currently suffers from too much Western commentary," and that "Prabhavananda treats India's spiritual heritage in terms of 'immediate perception,' as opposed to abstract speculation.... his own translations, though limited in this volume, embody unusual poetic power" (p.&amp;nbsp;101).&lt;ref name=ray63&gt;Robert J. Ray (1963). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40117563 [Untitled - review of Prabhavananda's The Spiritual Heritage of India&amp;#93;]. ''[[Books Abroad]] [continued by [[World Literature Today]]]'', v37 n1, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Christian Century]]'' wrote that "As India seeks to define herself as a secular state it becomes ever more important for us to be informed about the kinds of theisms and nontheisms that go into her religious philosophy. &lt;nowiki&gt;[Prabhavananda's book]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a comprehensive survey; little previous familiarity is necessary on the reader's part" (p.&amp;nbsp;619&lt;ref

A reviewer in the academic journal ''Philosophy'' stated that "Swami Prabhavananda has written a charming and authoritative book on the spiritual heritage of India, by which he means that heritage in consonance with the Vedic tradition and its culmination in Vedanta" (p.&amp;nbsp;376).&lt;ref name=riepe63&gt;Dale Riepe (1963).

The reviewer stated that "throughout the book breathes an air of relaxed simplicity and conviction.... I was particularly refreshed by the absence of attacks on science, materialism, naturalism, and other such means to spiritual fulfilment" (pp.&amp;nbsp;376–377).&lt;ref name=riepe63/&gt; A reviewer in the ''[[Hibbert Journal]]'' stated that "True to the spirit of Ramakrishna to whose Order of Monks he belongs, he is extremely catholic in his spiritual outlook, which makes his book imbued with wide sympathies and understanding. The non-specialist reader will find it a good and reliable introduction to the spiritual heritage of India. But it will be useful also to the more serious student of Indian philosophy and religion, since it covers almost the whole field of spiritual thought and practice in that ancient land"

===Other===
''The Spiritual Heritage of India'' was discussed in [[Antony Copley]]'s (2006) book about [[Prabhavananda]]'s disciple [[Christopher Isherwood]], a well-known literary figure.&lt;ref name=copley2006&gt;Antony R. H. Copley (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qo_a1mNUmbgC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=prabhavananda+manchester&amp;lr=&amp;cd=28#v=onepage&amp;q=spiritual%20heritage&amp;f=false A spiritual Bloomsbury: Hinduism and homosexuality in the lives and writings of Edward Carpenter, E.M. Forster, and Christopher Isherwood]''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books. {{ISBN|978-0-7391-1464-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copley noted that Prabhavananda wrote two overviews of Indian philosophy, ''Vedic Religion and Philosophy'' (1937) and ''The Spiritual Heritage of India'' (1962). According to Copley, in the later book, "more space is given to the heterodox while trying to incorporate them within the orthodox. He saw the teachings of the [[Tantras]] as compatible with those of the [[Upanishads]]. Here the role of the [[eternal feminine]] is introduced; the power of [[shakti]], of God the mother, inseparable from the Absolute.... He also sets out more fully an account of the psychology of yoga. Intriguingly, he tries to demonstrate that [[Freud]]'s two basic instincts, [[Eros]] and [[Thanatos]], translated here as the will to live and the will to death - and quite clearly in America with its cult of psychoanalysis Prabhavananda could not continue to ignore [[Freud]] - can be incorporated into yoga psychology" (pp.&amp;nbsp;238–239).&lt;ref name=copley2006/&gt;

'''Steven Allan Spielberg''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBEh}} {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]]}} (born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the [[New Hollywood]] era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.&lt;ref&gt;''The cinema of Steven Spielberg: Empire of light''. Nigel Morris. Wallflower Press. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After gaining traction in Hollywood with directing television and several minor theatrical releases, Spielberg became a household name as the director of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), which was critically and commercially successful, and is considered the first summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Bill|title='Jaws': Revisiting Hollywood's First Summer Blockbuster|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jaws-steven-spielberg-box-office-309339|accessdate=July 10, 2016|date=April 7, 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction and adventure films, with ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977), the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), and the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' series seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood [[Escapism|escapist]] filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steven Spielberg to Harvard grads: Be the movie heroes of real life|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/steven-spielberg-to-harvard-grads-be-the-movie-heroes-of-real-life/articleshow/52463599.cms|work=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg transitioned into addressing [[Humanism|humanistic]] issues in his later work via the films ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985), ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'' (1987), ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993), ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' (1997) and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998). He has largely adhered to this practice during the 21st century, with ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' (2005), ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' (2012), ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'' (2015), and ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]'' (2017).

Spielberg co-founded [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Studios]], where he has also served as a producer for several successful films, including the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Men in Black (film series)|Men in Black]]'', and ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' series. Spielberg later transitioned into producing several games within the video-game industry.

Spielberg is one of the American film industry's most critically successful filmmakers, with praise for his directing talent and versatility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Matt Zoller Seitz|Seitz, Matt Zoller]]|author2=Arikan, Ali|author3=Bramble, Serena|title=MAGIC AND LIGHT: THE FILMS OF STEVEN SPIELBERG: Chapter 1: Introduction|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/12/magic-and-light-the-films-of-steven-spielberg-chapter-1-introduction-132598/|website=[[IndieWire]]|date=December 15, 2011|quote=The fact that Spielberg is perfectly attuned to the commercial aspects of cinema does not preclude the idea that he is a master artist, who’s worthy of appreciation and study....

As a child, Spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an Orthodox Jew with the perception of him by other children he played with.

In 1958, he became a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and fulfilled a requirement for the [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|photography merit badge]] by making a nine-minute 8&amp;nbsp;mm film entitled ''The Last Gunfight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Steven Spielberg Sighted in Arizona|url = http://doney.net/aroundaz/celebrity/spielberg_stephen.htm| accessdate =November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Spielberg recalled to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera.

At age 13, while living in Phoenix, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled ''Escape to Nowhere''… using a cast composed of other high school friends. That motivated him to make 15 more amateur 8&amp;nbsp;mm films.&lt;ref name=Fischer /&gt;{{rp|548}} In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called ''[[Firelight (1964 film)|Firelight]]'', which would later inspire ''Close Encounters''. The film was made for $500, most of which came from his father, and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which earned back its cost.&lt;ref&gt;From Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton interviewing Steven Spielberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|Arcadia High School]] in Phoenix for three years, his family next moved to [[Saratoga, California]], where he later graduated from [[Saratoga High School (California)|Saratoga High School]] in 1965.

His long-term goal was to become a film director. His three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. In Los Angeles, he applied to the [[University of Southern California]]'s film school, but was turned down because of his "C" grade average.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;Fischer, Dennis. ''Science Fiction Film Directors, 1895–1998'', McFarland &amp; Co.

==Career==
===1970s===
His first professional TV job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of ''[[Night Gallery (film)|Night Gallery]]'', written by [[Rod Serling]] and starring [[Joan Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064725/|title= Night Gallery|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate = July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford, however, was "speechless, and then horrified" at the thought of a twenty-one-year-old newcomer directing her, one of Hollywood's leading stars. "Why was this happening to me?" she asked the producer.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;Chandler, Charlotte. ''Not the Girl Next Door: Joan Crawford, a Personal Biography'', Hal Leonard Corp. (2008) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Her attitude changed after they began working on her scenes:

{{quote|When I began to work with Steven, I understood everything. It was immediately obvious to me, and probably everyone else, that here was a young genius. I thought maybe more experience was important, but then I thought of all of those experienced directors who didn't have Steven's intuitive inspiration and who just kept repeating the same old routine performances. ''That'' was called "experience." I knew then that Steven Spielberg had a brilliant future ahead of him. Hollywood doesn't always recognize talent, but Steven's was not going to be overlooked. I told him so in a note I wrote him. I wrote to Rod Serling, too. I was so grateful that he had approved Steven as the director. I told him he had been totally right.&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;}}

She and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called "[[L.A. 2017]]". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).

Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that "a major new director is on the horizon."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.

Studio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&amp;nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].

Rejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=145|isbn=978-0-00-638444-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&amp;nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php "1941, Box Office Information."] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.

===1980s===
Next, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. It was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and it won 4 out of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/et-spielberg-fantasy|title=ET: The Extra-Terrestrial: No 7 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time|last=Wise|first=Damon|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 18, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|The Twilight Zone]]'' (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1556111/story.jhtml|title= Rewind: Major-Studio flicks that belong in the Grind House|first = Karl|last = Heitmueller|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate =January 2, 2009|publisher = MTV|quote = Ultimate A-lister Steven Spielberg co-produced this big-budget adaptation of Rod Serling's classic '60s TV show....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = This way to the children's crusade|first = Richard|last = Corliss|date = January 7, 1985|accessdate =January 2, 2009|quote = he wrote the story and served as an executive producer of The Goonies....|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959559,00.html|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg appeared in a cameo on [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music video for the movie's theme song, "[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|LxLhytQ67fs|Cyndi Lauper – The Goonies 'R' Good Enough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Steven Spielberg and [[Chandran Rutnam]] on a location in Sri Lanka during the filming of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.]]
His next directorial feature was the ''Raiders'' prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress [[Kate Capshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|title=Steven Spielberg Biography|publisher=Biography.com|date=December 18, 1947|accessdate=January 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201106/https://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Spielberg released ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],'' an adaptation of [[Alice Walker]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|novel of the same name]], about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.

In 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer [[Andrew Sarris]] called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Andrew Sarris' Top 10 lists 1958–2005| url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| accessdate =October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg was also a co-producer of the 1987 film ''[[Batteries Not Included|*batteries not included]]''.

After two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.

===1990s===
[[File:Spielberg1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]
In 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&amp;nbsp;million budget).

In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&amp;nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.

Spielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts. (At the time, Spielberg held the script for a remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schindler's List'' earned Spielberg his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (it also won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.

In 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|publisher = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&amp;cs=1&amp;query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate =February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&amp;nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).
[[File:Steven Spielberg - GianAngelo Pistoia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg in 1993]]

His next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion. Despite decent reviews from critics, it did not do well at the box office. Spielberg released ''Amistad'' under DreamWorks Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;(formed with former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animation exec [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and media mogul [[David Geffen]], providing the other letters in the company name)&lt;/ref&gt; which has produced all of his films from ''Amistad'' onwards with the exception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masters|first1=Kim|title=Steven Spielberg on DreamWorks' Past, Amblin's Present and His Own Future|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/steven-spielberg-dreamworks-past-amblins-902544|accessdate=July 11, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1998 theatrical release was the World War II film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Capt. Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5–6, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&amp;nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].

===2000s===
In 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&amp;nbsp;million.

Spielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K. Dick]] about a Washington D.C. police captain in the year 2054 who has been foreseen to murder a man he has not yet met. The film received strong reviews with the review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 92% approval rating, reporting that 206 out of the 225 reviews they tallied were positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/minority_report/|title=Minority Report|last=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned over $358&amp;nbsp;million worldwide. [[Roger Ebert]], who named it the best film of 2002, praised its breathtaking vision of the future as well as for the way Spielberg blended [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] with live-action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020621/REVIEWS/206210304/1023|title=Minority Report|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=June 21, 2002|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=April 10, 2018|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg's 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' is about the daring adventures of a youthful con artist (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). It earned [[Christopher Walken]] an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film is known for [[John Williams]]'s score and its unique [[title sequence]]. It was a hit both commercially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=catchmeifyoucan.htm| title=Box office collection of Catch Me If You Can| accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and critically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catch_me_if_you_can/|title=Reviews of Catch Me If You Can|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg collaborated again with Tom Hanks along with [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] in 2004's ''[[The Terminal]]'', a warm-hearted comedy about a man of Eastern European descent who is stranded in an airport. It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.

Also in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.

Spielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Yossi Melman and Steven Hartov|date=January 17, 2006|title=Munich: Fact and Fantasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1687815,00.html|publisher=The Guardian Unlimited|volume=|pages=|accessdate=April 10, 2018|via=|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Munich'' received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg.

===Upcoming projects===
During an interview with ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses the film projects he would work on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Sometimes], a story speaks to me, even if it doesn't speak to any of my collaborators or any of my partners, who look at me and scratch their heads and say, 'Gee, are you sure you wanna get into that trench for a year and a half?' I love people challenging me that way because it's a real test about my own convictions and [whether] I can be the standing man of my own life and take a stand on a subject that may not be popular, but that I would be proud to add to the body of my work. That's pretty much the litmus test that gets me to say, 'Yeah, I'll direct that one.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Ray|title=The Tech talks to Steven Spielberg|url=https://thetech.com/2015/10/22/spielberginterview-v135-n28|website=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]|publisher=The Tech|accessdate=March 10, 2018|date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Themes ==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2011}}
Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. &lt;!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an "ordinary character"--&gt;In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 978-0-571-19177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,&lt;ref&gt;Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster&lt;/ref&gt; these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.

The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.

Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Though some critics accuse his films of being a little overly sentimental, Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. He is still a highly praised director as well as being credited as one of the most influential directors of all time. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].&lt;ref name="culture show"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===
Spielberg first met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], "I met a real heartbreaker last night."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his "bachelor funky" house.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: "I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend," she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|295}}

As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985, they married, already having had a son, Max Samuel. After three and a half years of marriage, however, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other as to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|publisher=BBC News|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. They married on October 12, 1991. Capshaw is a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Karen W.|last=Arenson|title=From 'Schindler's List,' a Jewish Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/24/us/from-schindler-s-list-a-jewish-mission.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 1995|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capshaw"&gt;{{cite book|last =Pogrebin| first =Abigail| title =Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish| publisher =Bantam Dell Pub Group|date=October 2005| isbn =978-0-7679-1612-7| title-link =Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They currently move among their four homes in [[Pacific Palisades, California]]; Quelle Farm, [[Georgica Pond]] in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2002/09/19/0919feat_7.html "Billionaires on vacation: No. 80: Steven Spielberg"] by Christina Valhouli, ''Forbes'' magazine, September 19, 2002.

=== Religion ===
Spielberg grew up in a Jewish household, including having a [[bar mitzvah]] ceremony in Phoenix when he turned 13. He grew away from Judaism after his family moved to various cities during his high school years, where they became the only Jews in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|29}} Before those years, his family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends and nearby relatives.

He remembers his grandparents telling him about their life in Russia, where they were subjected to religious persecution, causing them to eventually flee to the United States. He was made aware of [[the Holocaust]] by his parents, who he says "talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind."&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|30}} His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|21}}

Spielberg "rediscovered the honor of being a Jew," he says, before he made ''Schindler's List'', when he married Kate Capshaw.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin&gt;Pogrebin, Abigail.

*Film critic [[Pauline Kael]], who had championed Spielberg's films in the 1970s, expressed disappointment in his later development, stating that "he's become, I think, a very bad director.... And I'm a little ashamed for him, because I loved his early work.... [H]e turned to virtuous movies. And he's become so uninteresting now.... I think that he had it in him to become more of a fluid, far-out director. But, instead, he's become a melodramatist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afterglow: A Last Conversation with Pauline Kael]]'' by [[Francis Davis]], [[Da Capo Press]], 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Imre Kertész]], Hungarian Jewish author, [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] survivor, and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], criticized Spielberg's depiction of the Holocaust in ''Schindler's List'' as [[kitsch]], saying "I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/holocaust/reflections.htm|title=Holocaust Reflections|publisher=English.illinois.edu|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran documentary filmmaker and professor [[Claude Lanzmann]] also labeled ''Schindler's List'' "pernicious in its impact and influence" and "very sentimental".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', December 6, 2010 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/movies/07shoah.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all Maker of 'Shoah' Stresses Its Lasting Value]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stephen Rowley wrote an extensive essay about Spielberg and his career in ''[[Senses of Cinema]]''. In it, he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying "there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films" and that "Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious", concluding that he has only received "limited, begrudging recognition" from critics.&lt;ref name="Rowley" /&gt;
*[[Shia LaBeouf]], who worked with Spielberg on a number of films including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and various [[DreamWorks]] productions (such as the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] in 2016. He stated, "I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, that's where it is – I'm not talking about fame, and I'm not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you're not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You're meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He's less a director than he is a fucking company." He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, "Spielberg's sets are very different – everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you're doing for a living." He concluded his point by stating: "I don't like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film]." Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying "There's no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn't have the immediate response [of the internet]. If you were Mark Hamill [in ''Star Wars''], you could lie to yourself. You could find the pockets of joy, and turn a blind eye to the shit over there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Setoodeh|first1=Ramin|title=How Shia LaBeouf Stopped Drinking and Found the Career He Wanted|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/shia-labeouf-drinking-steven-spielberg-american-honey-1201851776/|website=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=December 27, 2016|date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada,''' commonly known as the "Union of Russian Workers" (Союз Русских Рабочих, ''Soiuz Russkikh Rabochikh)'' was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] political association of Russian emigrants in the United States. The group was established shortly after the failure of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and was essentially annihilated in America by the [[First Red Scare|1919 Red Scare]] in which it was targeted by the [[Bureau of Investigation]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. Thousands of the group's adherents were arrested and hundreds deported in 1919 and 1920; still more voluntarily returned to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. During its brief existence the organization, which was only loosely affiliated with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], published numerous books and pamphlets in the [[Russian (language)|Russian language]] by anarchist writers, operated reading rooms and conducted courses to teach newly arrived Russians the English language, and fulfilled a social function for emigrants half a world from home.

==Organizational history==
===Formation and development===

The Union of Russian Workers (URW) was established in [[New York City]] in 1908 by refugees from the defeated Russian Revolution of 1905.&lt;ref name="KZ"&gt;KZ, [http://www.organizepittsburgh.org/UORW "A Slice of Pittsburgh Anarchist History: The Union of Russian Workers,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707003922/http://www.organizepittsburgh.org/UORW |date=July 7, 2010 }} ''Steel City Revolt!'' Spring 2009. Pittsburgh Organizing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; While some have estimated that by the end of the 1910s the Union of Russian Workers achieved a membership of about 10,000,&lt;ref name="Buhle"&gt;Maria Woroby, "Russian Americans," in [[Mari Jo Buhle]], [[Paul Buhle]], and [[Dan Georgakas]] (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of the American Left.'' First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 661-663.&lt;/ref&gt; a more sanguine estimate is that the group's membership topped out at about half that number.&lt;ref name="KZ" /&gt;

[[File:Union-of-russian-workers-ny.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Union of Russian Workers fulfilled not only a political but also a social function for its members. New York URW branch, circa 1917.]]
The URW's declaration of principles called for the unification of Russian workers in the United States and Canada so that they might do battle against capitalism and the forces of authority. The group further declared itself in favor of supporting the struggles of non-Russian workers in America and the struggle for liberation from [[Tsarism]] in Russia as well.&lt;ref name="KZ" /&gt; Although in its initial phase the organization promoted the philosophy of [[communist anarchism]], over time the [[ideology]] of the group evolved until in 1912 it declared itself for [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="KZ" /&gt;

In large measure through the efforts of [[Bill Shatoff]], a Russian-born anarcho-syndicalist who worked for a time on the staff of the URW's newspaper, ''Golos Truda'' (The Voice of Labor), the URW developed close ties with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Salerno, ''Red November Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World.'' Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1989; pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to publishing books and pamphlets on anarchist and syndicalist themes, the Union of Russian workers additionally provided and educational and social function, maintaining reading libraries, conducting classes to teach the English language to newcomers from Russia, and providing a setting for socialization of Russian speaking emigrants with their fellows.

===Destruction===
Political turmoil swept Europe in the years after [[World War I]]. The Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia showed every sign of beating the odds and retaining power. Additional communist uprisings dotted the map, including serious efforts in [[Finnish Revolution|Finland]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], and [[German Revolution|Germany]]. In America, the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party|Left Wing]] of the [[Socialist Party of America]] began to organize itself, proclaiming the need for [[revolutionary socialism]] in the United States. Politicians, press, and citizens on the street alike began to feel concerned about the potential for armed insurrection in America itself.

The Union of Russian Workers, small and isolated though it may have been, was seen by some as a source of the revolutionary contagion. On March 12, 1919, police raided headquarters of the organization, located on the [[Lower East Side]] and arrested 162 people.&lt;ref name=Rethinking16&gt;Todd J. Pfannestiel, ''Rethinking the Red Scare: The Lusk Committee and New York's Crusade against Radicalism, 1919-1923.'' New York: Routledge, 2003; pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time of the raid Detective Sergeant James Gegan of the New York City police department's "Bomb Squad" labeled the group "a front for alien subversive activity," results of the operation were ultimately rather less definitive, as only four of those arrested were ultimately charged with "criminal anarchy."&lt;ref name=Rethinking16 /&gt;

Fear still lingered. On June 8, 1919, the influential ''New York Times'' shrieked in an article spanning four columns that "500 Russian Reds" of the Union of Russian Workers were "agents spreading Bolshevism in the United States." Citing the constitution of the URW at length, the article breathlessly declared

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An organization directly connected with Russia is at work in the United States with an underground propaganda for overthrow of the Government by force. *  *  * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"Traces of the activity of the organization have been found from New York to San Francisco.... The agitation has been chiefly among the Slav races, but Scandinavians and the representatives of other European races in this country have been subjects of the underground campaign. The main instrument of the propaganda is literature which calls for the overturn of government by violence, asserting that there is no moral wrong in accomplishing revolution by bloodshed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The literature is distributed at meetings and handed individually at other places to those whom it is thought are ready to give hearing to the measures advocated.... From the traces of their activity it is estimated that there are not less than 500 propagandists of the Russian Workers' Union in this country."&lt;ref name="Agents"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/06/08/97094684.pdf "Russian Reds are Busy Here,"] ''New York Times,'' June 8, 1919. Retrieved March 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With public opinion thus prepared, Federal authorities headed by [[U.S. Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] in an operation conducted by his "special assistant," [[J. Edgar Hoover]], launched a coordinated campaign in over 30 cities across America on the night of November 7/8, 1919 — the second anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. At 8:45 in the evening of November 7, 1919, dozens of plainclothes and uniformed members of the [[New York Police Department]] together with Federal law enforcement authorities swept down on the "People's House" located at 133 East 15th Street, headquarters of the Union of Russian Workers, in what one reporter characterized as "one of the most brutal raids ever witnessed in the city."&lt;ref name="Raid"&gt;[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/lfed/russian/1919/1108-nycall-peopleshouse.pdf "IWW and Russian People's House Raided,"] ''New York Call,'' v. 12, no. 313 (November 8, 1919), pp. 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; A report in the [[socialist]] ''[[New York Call]]'' melodramatically recounted the violence of the scene:

[[File:Bianki-peter-1919.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Peter Bianki, top leader of the Union of Russian Workers, was deported with [[Emma Goldman]] on the ''U.S.A.T. Buford'' in 1920.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A witness of the event said that he saw one of the Russians trying to rush out of the building, his face and clothing covered with blood. Agonized cries were heard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"One who was close to the scene while the raiders were covering themselves with the blood of men and women against whom no crime had been charged heard heavy thuds as of clubs descending on human flesh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"All who attempted to escape were driven back into the building, and none but officers were permitted to enter. Two ''Call'' reporters who attempted to gather the facts of the assault were threatened with arrest if they did not leave at once. One policeman on the stoop of the building shouted to the crowd that had collected outside: 'If there’s a soldier among you, get after them!' *  *  * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"They were beaten, not only with clubs, but with [[Baton (law enforcement)#Blackjack|blackjacks]]. After the police and other guardians of law had their fill of clubbing and blackjacking, they crowded the Russians together in the back of the hall and cross-examined them. Then they bandaged the heads of those who had suffered more than others, but even the bandages were heavily bloodstained. Meanwhile, patrol wagons which had been stationed in the neighborhood came clanging up and were filled as fast as they appeared with the Russians who had been beaten up. Most of them had their heads bandaged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"They were thrown down steps of the stoop without ceremony. One of them moaned loudly and the crowd outside mimicked him. The crowd was not permitted to approach too closely and a ''Call'' reporter was unable to see what marks had been made by the clubs of the police on the faces of the assaulted men and women."&lt;ref name="Raid" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After taking nearly 100 of those present to police headquarters for questioning, 50 men and 2 women were held for possible deportation as "undesirable aliens."&lt;ref name="Raid" /&gt;

[[File:USAT Buford.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ''United States Transport Buford,'' which deported 249 non-citizen immigrant political prisoners in December 1919.]]
According to the report of the head of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], [[Anthony Caminetti]], a total of 351 aliens "of anarchist and kindred classes" were deported from the United States from July 1, 1918 to June 30, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Selection reprinted in Corvallis, OR by 1000 Flowers Publishing, 2006. See page 2, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these political deportations, the vast majority were made at one time aboard the ''[[The Buford|USAT Buford]],'' which departed from New York harbor on December 21, 1919, carrying 249 involuntary passengers. Chief among these were members of the Union of Russian Workers arrested in the series of raids conducted in the fall of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Also heavily represented were members of the Industrial Workers of the World.

===Newspapers===

The URW issued a newspaper called ''[[Golos Truda]]'' [Voice of Labor] in New York City beginning in 1911. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the editors returned home together to begin publishing the paper there. A new official Union of Russian Workers newspaper was launched in New York on February 26, 1919, ''Khleb i volia'' [Bread and Freedom], edited by G.V. Karpuk.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 121. Specialists should be advised that ''Khleb i Volia'' was actually preceded in 1918 by a publication unlisted in Hoerder called ''Nabat,'' [The Alarm], a publication probably no longer be extant but which is mentioned in the Bureau of Investigation NARA M-1085 microfilm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to documents seized by the [[Lusk Committee]], the paid circulation of the latter publication was 4,547 in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Legislative Committee Investigating Seditious Activities, New York Legislature, [https://archive.org/details/revolutionaryrad01newyuoft ''Revolutionary Radicalism: Its History, Purpose and Tactics: With an Exposition and Discussion of the Steps Being Taken and Required to Curb It.''] [Hereafter: ''Lusk Committee Report''] In four volumes.

'''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 1815''' was unanimously adopted on 2 June 2008.

== Resolution ==
The Security Council today extended the mandate of the [[International Independent Investigation Commission]], which is investigating the 2005 murder of Lebanon’s former Prime Minister, [[Rafiq Hariri]], and other attacks, until 31 December 2008.

Unanimously adopting resolution 1815 (2008), the Council left open the possibility of terminating the mandate earlier, if the Commission reported that it had completed implementation of that mandate.

The International Independent Investigation Commission was established on 7 April 2005 by resolution 1595 (see Press Release SC/8353), with the Lebanese Government’s approval, in order to investigate in all its aspects the terrorist attack that killed Mr. Hariri and others and caused the injury of numerous people, including helping to identify its perpetrators, sponsors, organizers and accomplices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9317.doc.htm|title=Security Council extends mandate of commission investigating murder of lebanon’s Former prime minister, Rafiq Hariri, until 31 December 2008|date=June 2, 2008|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The street runs approximately north-south between [[New Cavendish Street]] at the northern end, crossing [[Wigmore Street]] near [[Wigmore Hall]] just to the east, becoming [[Vere Street, Westminster|Vere Street]] continuing southwards. The nearest tube station is [[Bond Street tube station|Bond Street]] to the south. The part south of Wigmore Street is part of the B406.

[[The London Welbeck Hospital]], is located at 27 Welbeck Street, and the Welbeck Street Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System was located on this street as well; the offices of the British Institute of Radiology were formerly located there. The Welbeck Clinic is located at No. 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewelbeckclinic.co.uk/about-us.php About Us], [http://www.thewelbeckclinic.co.uk/ The Welbeck Clinic], 20 Welbeck Street, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Chapel]] in Welbeck Street that dates back as far as the early 19th century when the building formed part of the [[Russia]]n [[embassy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsophia.org.uk/stsophia.htm History of St Sophia's Cathedral] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195123/http://www.stsophia.org.uk/stsophia.htm |date=5 July 2008 }}, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel was rebuilt in 1864 and features a particularly fine [[iconostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Iconostasis |volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel is located behind No. 30, on the east side of the street near the northern end, and can be seen from Marylebone Mews (it is visible on [[Edward Stanford]]'s 1862 map of London).&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Stanford]], [http://www.mappalondon.com/london/north-west/regents-park-map.htm Regent's Park], [http://www.mappalondon.com/ Map of London], 1862–1871.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous people ==
[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], who lived at 48 Welbeck Street from 1799.]]
The notorious 18th-century highwayman [[James MacLaine]] was once a grocer on Welbeck Street.

In 1799, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] established himself as a [[physician]] in this street at No 48, now recorded by a [[blue plaque]]. The street was favoured by doctors at the time and remains a leading medical location. It is close to [[Harley Street]], now more famed for its concentration of private medical practitioners.

General [[John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater]] (b. 14 Apr 1753, d. 21 Oct 1823) married Charlotte Catherine Anne Haynes, daughter of Samuel Haynes and Elizabeth, on 14 January 1783 at 58 Welbeck Street.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.

'''''Wittgenstein''''' is a 1993 film by the English director [[Derek Jarman]]. It is loosely based on the life story as well as the philosophical thinking of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The adult Wittgenstein is played by [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]]. Tilda Swinton portrayed the Wittgenstein’s rather camp aristocratic mistress.&lt;ref name="Tindle"/&gt;

The original screenplay was by the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]]. Jarman heavily rewrote the script during pre-production and shooting, radically altering the style and structure, although retaining much of Eagleton's dialogue. The story is not played out in a traditional setting, but rather against a black backdrop within which the actors and key props are placed, as if in a theatre setting.

The film was originally part of a series of 12 films on the life and ideas of the philosopher, produced by Tariq Ali on behalf of [[Channel Four]]. Only four scripts got commissioned, ''Socrates'' by [[Howard Brenton]], ''Spinoza'' by Tariq Ali, ''Locke'' by [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and ''Wittenstein'' by Terry Eagleton. Spinoza was filmed and directed by [[Christopher Spencer (director)|Chris Spencer]] as ''Spinoza : The Apostle of Reason''. Also ''Citizen Locke'' was filmed and directed by [[Agnieszka Piotrowska]]. They were transmitted in 1994 as 52 min long [[television films]].&lt;ref name=Wymer&gt;Rowland Wymer {{google books|BQi9C_bChgYC|Derek Jarman|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
