'''Adam Lilling''' (born 1970) is an entrepreneur and venture capitalist.  The founder of Pentagon CDs and Tapes, an internet music retailer which launched in 1995, Lilling is recognized for his early role in the development of the online music business and [[e-commerce]] practices.&lt;ref name=CRN&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Rob |title=The Young &amp; Restless: Adam Lilling, Pazanga |url=http://newsle.com/article/0/3802002/ |work=November 30, 2000 |publisher=CRN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194950/http://newsle.com/article/0/3802002/ |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the co-founder of [[LaunchpadLA]], a mentorship program which later became a [[Startup company|startup]] [[Business incubator|accelerator]],&lt;ref name=Techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Suster |first=Mark |title=Launchpad LA Receives VC Funding: $50,000 Per Startup |url=http://newsle.com/article/0/5505808/ |work=November 8, 2007 |publisher=Techcrunch |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184157/http://newsle.com/article/0/5505808/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the founder and managing partner of [[Plus Capital]], a venture capital firm.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Lori|title=The Power Of Social Capital|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorikozlowski/2013/05/15/the-power-of-social-capital/|work=May 13, 2013|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes Changing LA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pozin|first=Ilya|title=12 Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing LA Forever|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2012/07/09/12-entrepreneurs-that-are-changing-la-forever/|work=July 9, 2012|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Lilling was born in Brooklyn and raised in Muttontown, New York.  He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] from the School of Business Administration.  A lifelong musician, Lilling planned to pursue a career in music composition for film and television; after moving to Los Angeles in 1992, he enrolled in  a graduate school program at the [[USC Thornton School of Music|Thornton School of Music]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  The one-year program, run by [[Buddy Baker (composer)|Buddy Baker]], was taught by prominent composers such as [[Jerry Goldsmith]]; Lilling's class of 19 students included [[Marco Beltrami]] and [[Christophe Beck]].  At the conclusion of the program, rather than work as a composer, Lilling opted to work in the music business.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/music/programs/smptv/|work=2103|publisher=USC Thornton School of Music|accessdate=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901170017/http://www.usc.edu/schools/music/programs/smptv/|archive-date=2013-09-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

In college, Lilling founded Soundtrax, a short-lived company which focused on selling film soundtracks at theaters. Soundtrax was dissolved when Lilling, then 23,  was hired by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] as the director of marketing for Vending Intelligence, one of Copeland's many companies.  Regarded as groundbreaking, Vending Intelligence developed and sold [[Compact disc|CD]] [[vending machine]]s  which allowed customers to select and hear a 30-second sample of every CD included in the machine's inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tamaki|first=Julie|title=Vending Machines Dispense CDs for $13.99 in the Slot|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-25/local/me-50197_1_cd-vending-machines|work=April 25, 1994|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vending Intelligence was not successful, and in 1994, Lilling was reassigned to Copeland's label, [[I.R.S. Records]], as the West Coast head of regional marketing and sales.&lt;ref name=VentureBeat&gt;{{cite web|title=VB Profiles: Adam Lilling |url=http://venturebeatprofiles.com/person/adam-lilling/ |work=2013 |publisher=Venture Beat |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193532/http://venturebeatprofiles.com/person/adam-lilling/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, while still at I.R.S., Lilling started Pentagon, an online [[Compact cassette|cassette]] and [[Compact disc|CD retailer]], who, among other innovations, distributed the first album offered online prior to its [[Brick and mortar|brick-and-mortar]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haring|first=Bruce|title=Internet gets first crack at new album|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/doc/408663509.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Dec+29%2C+1995&amp;author=Haring%2C+Bruce&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Internet+gets+first+crack+at+new+album|work=December 29, 1995|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covington|first=Richard|title=MEDIA MARKETS : Will Internet Replace Record Shops?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/06/business/worldbusiness/06iht-juke.t.html|work=March 6, 1996|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentagon was among the earliest internet retailers to offer personalized recommendations, gift packaging, and the ability to pre-order albums for day-of-release shipment; Pentagon also initiated the now-standard practices involving [[inventory]], [[Web content|content]], and advertising.  Major [[Record label|labels]] paid for "Featured Artist" placement; chat boards and community areas encouraged dialogue among consumers, and Pentagon's inventory of 150,000 CDs and tapes included independent artists. "Here were bands who were selling tapes out of their trunks after shows, and now they've got international distribution," Lilling said in a 1995 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]].'' "And people who love music can sample and buy music from bands that haven't been signed yet."&lt;ref name=Gillen&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillen|first=Marilyn|title=Retailer Explores Unique Online Features|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rA4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=adam+lilling+billboard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FvEYUv-AA8WgiQLTmoCgBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=adam%20lilling%20billboard&amp;f=false|work=October 28, 1995|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perceived at the time as a competitor to [[CD Now]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], Pentagon adhered to a strategy of limited expenses and sustainable growth, and became profitable early in the company's evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Left Coast Confidential:  Pentagon Singing A Happy Tune|year=1997|publisher=The Street|location=New York|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Lilling sold the company to the [[Virgin Group|Virgin Entertainment Group]], who adopted Pentagon's [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] e-commerce technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John|title=Pazanga, Inc.|year=2000|publisher=Smart Partner|location=New York|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and, in 2000, formed a new venture, Pazanga, which became a premiere worldwide entertainment e-commerce services provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Portnoy|first=Sandy|title=Pazanga On a Tear|url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18811771/pazanga-on-a-tear.htm|work=October 18, 2000|publisher=CRN|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cirillo|first=Rich|title=Pazanga: From CD E-Tailor to E-commerce Enabler|url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18809415/pazanga-from-cd-e-tailor-to-e-commerce-enabler.htm|work=August 4, 2000|publisher=CRN|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, following the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]] crash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Bryan|title=Tech Boom 2.0: Lessons Learned From the Dot-Com Crash|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/08/tech-boom-2-0-lessons-learned-from-the-dot-com-crash/|work=August 13, 2013|publisher=Wired|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pazanga's value dropped dramatically.

In 2004, Lilling co-founded BiggerBoat with Barbara DeLury, who had been Pazanga's [[Chief technology officer|CTO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuo|first=Benjamin|title=Interview with Adam Lilling and Barbara De Lury|url=http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_adam_lilling_and_barbara_de_lury__biggerboat/s-0003271.html|work=February 17, 2006|publisher=Social Tech|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first entertainment-specific search engine, BiggerBoat built an advertising platform based on monitoring the media consumption of over 27 million consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BiggerBoat Solutions|url=http://biggerboat.com/sol.htm|work=2013|publisher=BiggeBoat|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 BiggerBoat received [[investment]] funding; in 2009, Lilling and De Lury bought the company back in order to reestablish ownership of the [[intellectual property]].  Edified by the experience, Lilling shifted his focus to venture capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision in Action Conference|url=http://confdemo.entrepreneurassociation.net/index.php/eaceditions/eac2012main/eac2012speaker|work=May 11, 2012|publisher=UCLA Anderson School of Business|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, at the invitation of [[Mark Suster]] of [[Upfront Ventures]], Lilling co-founded Launchpad LA, an organization designed to guide young Los Angeles-based entrepreneurs through [[mentorship]]. By 2011, 19 of the 23 companies incubated via Launchpad LA had received funding and/or been acquired,&lt;ref name=Suster&gt;{{cite web|last=Suster |first=Mark |title=Launchpad LA Receives VC Funding: $50,000 Per Startup |url=http://newsle.com/article/0/5111596/ |work=November 8, 2011 |publisher=Techcrunch |accessdate=25 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190125/http://newsle.com/article/0/5111596/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, Lilling was included on the ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' list of the "12 entrepreneurs who are changing LA forever."&lt;ref name="Forbes Changing LA" /&gt;  Additionally, Lilling invested in BigFrame, MoviePass, advised the boards of AgentAce, The Cradle, MediaNet, Triptrotting, [[ShareThis]], and [[MediaNet]], and was appointed to the Board of Directors for Chromatik, HelloMusic, and  [[Movieclips|MovieClips]] (now ZEFR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carney|first=Michael|title=Plus Capital launches a new fund to prove that "influence" tops "celebrity"|url=http://pandodaily.com/2013/03/08/plus-capital-launches-new-fund-to-prove-that-influence-tops-celebrity/|work=March 8, 2013|publisher=Pando Daily|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Featured in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety's]]'' 2013 list of Venture Capitol Kingmakers and described as a "serial entrepreneur," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Lori|title=Venture Capital Kingmakers|url=https://variety.com/gallery/photos-venture-capital-kingmakers/#!1/adam-lilling-plus-capital/|work=August 7, 2013|publisher=Variety|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilling launched Plus Capital, a venture capital fund designed to connect early stage companies with influencers and investors, in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dotan|first=Tom|title=Sowing Startups|url=http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2013/apr/15/sowing-startups/|work=April 15, 2013|publisher=Los Angeles Business Journal|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Sōma}}
{{nihongo|'''Aizō Sōma'''|相馬愛蔵|Sōma Aizō|extra=November 8, 1870 – February 14, 1954}} was an entrepreneur, philanthropist, patron of artists and patron of [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian politics]] during the pre-war [[Empire of Japan]]. He is known as the founder of Nakamura-ya, a noted bakery in Tokyo.

==Biography==
Sōma was born in a wealthy farming family in what is now [[Azumino, Nagano]]. He came to Tokyo at the age of 17 in order to enter [[Waseda University]] in 1886, entering the Tokyo Professional College which had just been founded. His professors included [[Tsubouchi Shōyō]] and [[Tameyuki Amano]]. Later, he studied with Sokichi Tsuda, a Japanese historian who became a professor at Waseda University. During this time, he was also converted to Christianity by [[Uchimura Kanzō]], and became friends with [[Taguchi Ukichi]].&lt;ref name = Okuda&gt;{{cite book | last = Okuda | first = Akiko | year = 1998 | title = Women and Religion in Japan | publisher =Routledge | location =  | isbn = 3447040149}} page 115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in 1890, and travelled to [[Hokkaido]], where he studied [[sericulture]] at the [[Sapporo Agricultural College]], and returned to Nagano to conduct experiments in the improvement of [[silkworm]]s. He also founded a [[temperance movement]] in Azumino, which drew the wrath of locals for its aggressive approach again drinking and brothels.&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;  He also met with foreign missionaries, and established a local orphanage.

In 1898, married [[Kokkō Sōma|Kokkō]], the daughter of an ex-samurai from [[Sendai]], which he had visited in order to raise funds for the orphanage, but she had frequent problems with her health and with adjusting to rural life, and the couple relocated to Tokyo in 1901. In Tokyo, Sōma purchased the Nakamura-ya bakery near the main gate to [[Tokyo Imperial University]].&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;   He is credited with inventing the ''kurimu-pan'', a bun with custard inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Usui | first = Kazuo | year = 2014 | title = Marketing and Consumption in Japan | publisher =Routledge | location =  | isbn = 9780415323130}} page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, he moved the shop to [[Shinjuku]]. He often hired foreigners or consulted with foreign residents in Japan for ideas on new products or new condiments to use in his bakery items. He also established a school to teach commercial morality and to improve on the service standards of his employees. The shop flourished, and he added a café and restaurant as well.

Sōma became a patron of the arts and literature by organizing a [[Salon (gathering)|literary salon]], and by providing financial support to struggling artists and writers. Members of the salon included [[Naoe Kinoshita]], a socialist activist from Sōma’s home town, [[Vasili Eroshenko]], a blind Russian poet, as well as actress [[Sumako Matsui]], painter [[Tsune Nakamura]], and sculptor [[Rokuzan Ogiwara]].&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;  
 
Sōma also provided support to the pan-Asian movement, and his salon provided a convenient and confidential meeting place for politicians, including [[Toyama Mitsuru]], [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] and others. Sōma provided shelter for [[Rash Behari Bose]], the fugitive head of the [[Indian independence movement]]. Bose was the mastermind behind a number of bomb plots against the [[Viceroy of India]] and attempts to organize an uprising against the [[British Raj]]. Bose married Sōma’s daughter Toshiko in 1918.

Sōma died in 1954.

'''Andrés Framini''' (August 2, 1914&amp;nbsp;–May 9, 2001) was an Argentine labor leader and politician.

==Life and times==

===Early career===
Andrés Framini was born in the working-class [[La Plata]] suburb of [[Berisso]], in 1914. He entered the labor force as a [[peon]] in one of [[Buenos Aires]]' many [[textile industry|textile manufacturers]], eventually working for the important Piccaluga facility in the southside [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]] section of the city. Poor pay and working conditions provided Labor Minister and then Vice President [[Juan Perón]] a powerful political opportunity, which he seized by aggressively lobbying employers for a redress of these grievances, which had hitherto been quite difficult for most working-class Argentines to do.&lt;ref name=mercosul&gt;[http://www.sindicatomercosul.com.br/noticia02.asp?noticia=1367''Sindicato Mercosul: Falleció Framini, el gobernador que no llegó a serlo'' {{es icon}}]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vice President's receptiveness to reform and his assurances of change earned Framini's support. Following President [[Edelmiro Farrell]]'s October 13, 1945, arrest of the increasingly popular Perón, Framini participated actively in the October 17 mobilizations that freed the populist leader and forced the regime to call [[Argentine general election, 1946|elections]] for early in 1946; Perón was elected handily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capacitacionpj.com.ar/Textos/Capitulo_4.htm Luis Galcerán: El tercer peronismo {{es icon}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119050017/http://www.capacitacionpj.com.ar/Textos/Capitulo_4.htm |date=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by these developments, the [[w:es:Asociación Obrera Textil|Textile Workers' Association]] (AOT) was formed ten days later as an affiliate of the umbrella [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]], and Framini was elected factory [[shop steward]]. Following a series of failed strikes in 1953 against President Perón's [[austerity]] plan, Framini displaced the AOT's more militant, left-wing leadership, becoming the powerful union's Secretary General. In that capacity, he was among those present at the June 16, 1955, rally at the [[Plaza de Mayo]] in support of the president following his excommunication by [[Pope Pius XII]], a day earlier. As Perón spoke, [[Argentine Air Force]] [[Gloster Meteor]] jets flew overhead, dropping their ordnance and killing over 350 before flying to safety in neighboring [[Uruguay]]; Perón was ultimately [[Revolución Libertadora|overthrown on September 19]].&lt;ref name=page&gt;Page, Joseph. ''Perón: A Biography''. Random House, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=homenaje&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127014409/http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/sesionesxml/item.asp?per=119&amp;r=11&amp;n=7 Camara de Diputados: Homenaje {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance and the CGT's reorganization===
The moderately anti-[[Peronist]] new president, Gen. [[Eduardo Lonardi]], held talks with the CGT that sought to allow the continued existence of the 2.5 million-member labor union (the largest in Latin America, at the time), while coercing the CGT to abandon [[Peronism]].&lt;ref name=page/&gt; The CGT's directors resigned on October 5, leaving the leadership to Framini and to Light and Power Union leader Luis Natalini.&lt;ref name=mercosul/&gt;
[[File:Lonardi-Cerrutti Costa-Natalini-Framini.jpg|thumb|left|240px|October 1955: President [[Eduardo Lonardi]] chairs talks with CGT leaders Luis Natalini and Andrés Framini (''right'').]]

The two CGT leaders arrived at an agreement with Labor Minister Luis Cerruti Costa (himself an erstwhile Peronist) within a day of taking over. They greed to union elections within 120 days and the formal abandonment of peronism, in return for assurances against government (or military) intervention. Cerruti Costa's insistence on continuing to replace CGT leaders led to Framini's October 26 ultimatum against him, with the threat of a [[general strike]]. This was averted at the last minute; but on November 13, General Lonardi was replaced with the more anti-Peronist Gen. [[Pedro Aramburu]].&lt;ref name=mercosul/&gt;

Framini responded by calling a three-day general strike for November 15; Aramburu had over 9,000 CGT figures (including Framini and Natalini) jailed, however, thus foiling the strike. The failed strike was followed by a prison sentence for Framini, at which he was stripped of official CGT leadership. He then formed an "Authentic CGT" and was among the civilian organizers of a failed, June 9, 1956, coup led by Gen, [[Juan José Valle]] against Aramburu - a fiasco which resulted in Valle's execution, as well as of 26 others'. Framini himself escaped this fate by going into hiding.&lt;ref name=mercosul/&gt;

The AOT received a military-appointed leader, though in 1957 the regime allowed new labor union elections resulting in the victory of Framini's deputy at the textile union, Juan Carlos Loholaberry. The regime's appointees at the CGT sabotaged an August 1957 congress by walking out (depriving the congress of [[quorum]]), and Framini responded by calling two general strikes, in September and October.&lt;ref name=page/&gt;

Framini geared for the [[Argentine general election, 1958|February 1958 elections]] by echoing the exiled Juan Perón's endorsement of the [[UCRI]] candidate, [[Arturo Frondizi]]. The military, however, forced Frondizi to appoint an ultra-conservative military contractor, [[Álvaro Alsogaray]], as Economy Minister at the end of 1958, throwing Framini and labor, in general, against the new administration. The president retaliated by having Framini arrested numerous times in 1959 - a year marked by recession and labor conflicts. The labor leader's case was brought before the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), which prevailed on President Frondizi to allow Framini [[due process]]. He was returned as head of the AOT, later that year.&lt;ref name=homenaje/&gt;

===Candidate for governor===
The textile workers' leader helped organize the Commission of 20, in October 1960, with the goal of persuading Frondizi to rid the CGT of its puppet leadership. A successful, November 7, 1960, general strike resulted in the president's agreeing to talks, and on March 3, 1961, the CGT was entrusted to the Commission of 20 (ending nearly 6 years of government receivership). These accomplishments encouraged Peronists to field candidates for [[Argentine Congress|Congress]] and the governorships, ahead of the [[Argentine legislative election, 1962|March 1962 mid-term elections]].&lt;ref name=mercosul/&gt;  
[[File:Andrés Framini-1955-IIA-CEAL-10-259(1976).jpg|thumb|Framini votes in the 1962 gubernatorial elections.]]
Peronism and its political vehicle, the [[Justicialist Party]], had been banned from political life since 1955; but Framini and other Peronists ran on proxy political parties organized after Perón's overthrow, notably [[Juan Atilio Bramuglia]]'s [[Unión Popular|Popular Union]]. The Popular Union nominated Framini for governor of the [[Province of Buenos Aires]] (home to 38% of Argentines) and for vice-governor: Perón, himself. The leader believed this symbolic spot on the ticket (which, unable to return, he could never fill) would prove a powerful endorsement to Framini; but the move backfired. Frondizi's government declared Perón's candidacy null and void, and even [[Antonio Caggiano|Cardinal Caggiano]] (a supporter of Perón's until his overthrow) spoke out against the move.&lt;ref name=page/&gt;

Receiving the endorsement of [[Socialist Party of Argentina|Socialist Party]] leaders [[Alfredo Palacios]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]], and joined on the ticket by Marcos Anglada, Framini's unofficial slogan was unequivocal, however: ''"Framini-Anglada, Perón to the Rosada!"'' The clear reference to the [[Casa Rosada]] (the president's executive office building) put anti-peronists and the military on high alert when, in fact, Perón's proxies won 10 of 14 governorships at stake - including Framini's victory in the all-important Province of Buenos Aires. President Frondizi was forced to annul Framini's March 18 victory, and despite quickly obeying military demands, on March 28 the president was overthrown.&lt;ref name=page/&gt;

===Framini versus Vandor===
Framini led a gathering on the steps of the Provincial Legislature in [[La Plata]] to demand he be sworn in as governor; the demonstration was violently repressed, however. These bitter experience helped divide the CGT once again, moreover, and two camps eventually developed in the trade union. The leader of the [[w:es:Unión Obrera Metalúrgica|Steel and Metalworks Union]] (UOM), [[Augusto Vandor]], favored distancing the CGT from Perón; while Framini did not. A plenary held near [[La Falda]] in June 1962 resulting in a marked leftward shift in the CGT's platform, a position encouraged by the re-appointment of the anti-labor [[Alvaro Alsogaray]] and a new, deep recession.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2001/05/11/p-01301.htm ''Clarín'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leaders' differences were superficial, initially, and the two formed part of the Peronist Tactical Command, the movement's secret political [[think tank]]. Perón's frustrated December 1964 return to Argentina only exacerbated tensions between the two factions and, in February 1966, the CGT was divided. Framini counted on strong supporters, such as CGT Secretary General [[José Alonso (trade unionist)|José Alonso]], [[Rail transport in Argentina|rail workers']] leader Lorenzo Pepe, and the sanitation workers' leader Amado Olmos. As head of the UOM (the CGT's largest union), however, Vandor was able to eject Alonso as CGT head. Vandor's faction of the CGT benefited as well from the [[Revolución Argentina|June 28, 1966, coup d'état]] against President [[Arturo Illia]] (overthrown for allowing Peronists to take their seats in Congress following a [[Argentine legislative election, 1965|1965 election]] victory). Illia's replacement, Gen. [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], appointed a Labor Minister, Rubens San Sebastián, whose self-professed strategy vis-à-vis the CGT was that of "divide and conquer;" San Sebastián's support for Vandor eventually helped lead the AOT to replace Framini for his deputy, Juan Carlos Laholaberry, in 1968.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

===Twilight===
Framini's own exit from the AOT was far from ceremonious: as the rank-and-file voted, they learned that he had been apparently kidnapped. The prominent Buenos Aires daily, [[Crónica, Buenos Aires|''Crónica'']], exposed the kidnapping as a hoax, however, and Framini kept a low profile for some time. The incident inspired Víctor Proncet's script for director Raymundo Gleyzer's 1973 drama ''Los traidores'' (''The Traitors'') – a banned film which, to date, has not been shown publicly.

Following the Peronists' return to power in 1973, Framini was unable to return to political prominence. The early morning hours of March 24, 1976, found him and Mrs. Framini away from home – a coincidence that saved their lives when the newly installed [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] raided their home with the intention of eliminating the retired labor leader.&lt;ref name=homenaje/&gt; The Framinis were forced to sell the home and relocate to a tiny apartment, where they remained due to economic duress following the end of the dictatorship in 1983.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

Framini received numerous recognitions in later years. His 1962 electoral victory was honored with the bestowment of the title of "Former Governor-elect of the Province of Buenos Aires" by Governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]] and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] recognized him for his historical role as a Notable Argentine, in 1997. Framini opposed President [[Carlos Menem]]'s abandonment of his [[populism|populist]] Peronist platform (on which he was elected in 1989) and offered his support to a small left-wing party in 2000.&lt;ref name=homenaje/&gt; He attended a May 9, 2001, tribute to the populist former first lady, [[Eva Perón]], at the [[Argentine Workers' Center]] headquarters. There, [[Leonardo Favio]]'s ''[[w:es:Perón, sinfonía del sentimiento|Perón: A Symphony of Feelings]]'' (1999) was shown as part of the tribute, and when the projection came to an end, Andrés Framini was found dead in his seat; he was 86.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;
He was buried in [[La Chacarita Cemetery]]

'''Barry Allen Sadler''' (November 1, 1940{{spaced ndash}}November 5, 1989) was an American soldier, singer/songwriter, and author. Sadler served as a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] medic, achieving the rank of [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]]. He served in the Vietnam War from late December 1964 to late May 1965. Most of his work has a military theme, and he is best known for his patriotic "[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]," a #1 hit in 1966.

==Early life==
Sadler was born in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]], the second son of John Sadler and Bebe Littlefield of [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. According to Sadler's autobiography, ''I'm A Lucky One'', his father developed a successful [[plumbing]] and electrical business in Carlsbad and owned several farms in the area. He describes his mother as managing restaurants and bars, and at times, games in casinos.

The family relocated often. His parents divorced when Sadler was five, and his father died not long after at age 36 from a rare form of nervous system cancer. His mother moved her family around as she worked at temporary jobs in Arizona, [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]].

==Career==

===Enlistment===
Sadler dropped out of high school in the tenth grade in [[Leadville, Colorado]]. In 1958, at 17, he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. He finished his GED certificate while in the Air Force. He trained as a [[radar]] technician in 1958 and was stationed in [[Japan]]. After his discharge in 1961, Sadler enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], and volunteered for Airborne and Special Forces, opting to be a medic.

When he completed Airborne training, he underwent the lengthy training as a combat medic at [[Fort Sam Houston, Texas]], Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In May 1965, while he was on a combat patrol southeast of [[Pleiku]] in the Central Highlands, he was severely wounded in the knee by a feces-covered [[punji stick]]. Sadler dressed the wound with a cotton swab and an adhesive bandage, then completed the patrol; however, he subsequently developed a serious infection in his leg, and was evacuated to Clark Air Force Base Hospital in The Philippines. Doctors were forced to surgically enlarge the wound to drain it and to administer large doses of penicillin. Sadler returned to Fort Bragg where he made a complete recovery.

===The Ballad of the Green Berets===
[[File:RobertSadler.jpg|thumb|right|Sadler during 1969, performing the "Ballad of the Green Berets" with his guitar]]
Sadler recorded his famous song, "The [[Ballad of the Green Berets]]", a patriotic tune about the Special Forces, in December 1965. The writer [[Robin Moore]], author of the novel ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]],'' which became a 1968 movie, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]],'' featuring [[John Wayne]], helped Sadler with lyrics and with getting a recording contract with RCA Victor Records. "The Ballad of the Green Berets" arranged as a choral version by [[Ken Darby]] was the title song of the movie. Moore also wrote an introduction to Sadler's [[autobiography]], ''I'm A Lucky One,'' which he dictated to Tom Mahoney and was published by Macmillan Company in 1967. "The Ballad of the Green Berets" was released by [[RCA Victor]] Records in January 1966, and became a fast-selling single, holding No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks from March 5 to April 2, 1966. The record sold more than nine million copies.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

The song was a great success in many U.S. cities; it scored five weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Good Guys music survey at [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]], the top popular music radio station in New York during 1966. He sang it for his television début on January 30 on The Ed Sullivan Show. Sadler had recorded an album of similarly themed songs which he titled ''Ballads of the Green Berets''. It sold a million copies during the first five weeks of its release.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/&gt; Sadler had a minor success, the similarly patriotic-themed "The 'A' Team", later the same year when that single scored #28.

===Awards and decorations===
According to the ribbons and badges worn by Sadler in a televised performance of "The Ballad of the Green Berets," he received the following awards for his military service: [[Purple Heart Medal]], [[Army Good Conduct Medal]], [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]], [[Air Force Longevity Service Award]], [[Combat Infantryman Badge]], [[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]], and the [[South Vietnamese]] [[Parachutist Badge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0w6Bqma4qM&amp;feature=related |title=Ssgt Barry Sadler - The Ballad Of The Green Berets (1966 clip) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ribbons shown in Sadler's television performance mentioned above did not represent all of Sadler's awards. Sadler was also entitled to the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the [[Vietnam Campaign Medal]]. He had the option of replacing the [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]] with the [[Vietnam Service Medal]].

==Later years==
===Literary works===
Sadler was unable to score any close to a major success with his other songs, though "The A-Team" was a Top 30 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart single during 1966. He was honorably discharged from the Army in May 1967, and moved with his family to Tucson, Arizona. After minor acting parts in four episodes of two TV western series, "Death Valley Days and "The High Chaparral", and in the 1968 caper film ''[[Dayton's Devils]]'' starring [[Rory Calhoun]], he moved to Nashville and begin writing pulp fiction novels. His popular Casca series is about the title character, [[Casca Rufio Longinius]] (a combination of [[Longinus]] and the [[Wandering Jew]]), supposedly the Roman soldier who thrust his lance into [[Christ]]'s side during the [[crucifixion]]. Casca is cursed to remain a soldier until the [[Second Coming]]. The novels feature Casca's life from biblical times to the 20th century. Sadler himself wrote the first twenty-two books. After his death, the series was continued with books by other authors.

===Lee Emerson Bellamy===
On December 1, 1978, at about 11&amp;nbsp;p.m., Sadler killed a country music songwriter named [[Lee Emerson Bellamy]] with one gunshot to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19781203&amp;id=e3QjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2Z4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,377107 |title=Singer Fatally Shoots Songwriter |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |publisher= |date=3 December 1978 |pages=20A |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting was the culmination of a month-long dispute the men had concerning Darlene Sharpe, who was Bellamy's former girlfriend, and Sadler's lover at the time. Bellamy made many harassing telephone calls to Sadler and Sharpe, had one violent confrontation in a Nashville bar's parking lot, and threatened both their lives.

On the night in question, Bellamy made several harassing telephone calls, including one to the Natchez Trace Restaurant where Sadler and Sharpe were having dinner and drinks with two friends. That resulted in Sadler asking a bartender to telephone the police, who never responded. Bellamy later went to Sharpe's apartment complex and knocked on the door. Sadler exited through a side door. On seeing Sadler, Bellamy fled to his van. It was at that time, Sadler testified, that he saw a flash of metal. Believing it to be a gun, he fired one shot. The bullet struck Bellamy right between the eyes, and he died several hours later in a Nashville hospital. It turned out that Bellamy was unarmed. According to court records, Sadler had then placed a handgun in Bellamy's van, presumably to strengthen his claim of self-defense. After a plea bargain, on June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Lee Emerson Bellamy, and sentenced to from 4 to 5 years in prison. His legal team worked to lower the sentence, which a judge reduced to just 30 days in the county workhouse. He served 28 days. Sadler was sued for wrongful death by Bellamy's stepson, and was ordered to pay compensation of about $10,000.

===Death===
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}
Sadler moved to [[Guatemala City]] in 1984. He continued to write and publish his ''Casca'' books, produced a never-released self-defense video, and provided free medical treatment in rural villages. On September 7, 1988, Sadler was shot in the head while sitting in a cab in Guatemala City. Witnesses said he accidentally shot himself, but his friends and family believed he was shot by a robber or an assassin. He was flown to the United States by friends in a private jet paid for by ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' magazine publisher Bob Brown. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

He was operated on at the Nashville [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) Hospital, and remained in a coma for about six weeks. After emerging from the coma, Sadler was a quadriplegic and had suffered significant brain damage. He was finally released in January 1989, but he was reported missing by his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-11/news/mn-367_1_barry-sadler Nation : Singer Barry Sadler Vanishes] Retrieved 11-30-2012&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he was found, in time to be present at a competency hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-01-13/news/26121890_1_lockerbie-camera-operator-royal-protocol |title=Barry Sadler Found |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=1989-01-13 |accessdate=2013-06-03 |quote=Lawyers for two friends of Barry Sadler said the man who wrote and sang the 1966 hit "Ballad of the Green Berets" would be present today at a Cleveland hearing to discuss his mental competency. Sadler, 48, was reported missing by his family, who want him declared imcompetent, after checking himself out of a Cleveland hospital Sunday. He had been undergoing treatment for brain damage suffered in a September shooting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being moved to the Cleveland [[VA Hospital]] for specialized treatment, he was removed from the hospital by two former Green Berets and his mother, Blanche Sadler. After a contentious court battle waged by his wife and children, a court in Tennessee ruled that Sadler be put under the care of an independent guardian. Sadler was moved to the VA Hospital in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], in February 1989, but he never recovered from his injury. He died there of cardiac arrest on November 5, 1989, four days after his 49th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-06/news/mn-708_1_barry-sadler Barry Sadler, 'Green Berets' Balladeer, Dies], latimes.com; retrieved November 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_739199/a-green-beret-has-met-his-fate-sgt-sadler-died-mys.html|title=Archives|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2013-06-03}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadler was survived by his wife, Lavona, a daughter, Brooke, and two sons, Thor and Baron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/06/obituaries/barry-sadler-49-balladeer-dies.html|title=Barry Sadler, 49, Balladeer, Dies|publisher=NYTimes.com|date=1989-11-06|accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Douglas Newman''' (born '''Jason Douglas Newman''', July 30, 1977), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Brother Ali''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]], community activist, and member of the [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] hip hop collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymesayers.com/brotherali |title=Brother Ali |publisher=Rhymesayers Entertainment |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has released six albums, four EPs, a number of singles and collaborations. 

==Beginnings==
Ali was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], with [[albinism]], a disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. He moved with his family to Michigan for a few years and then settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1992. He attended [[Robbinsdale Cooper High School]] in [[New Hope, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="NPR100509" /&gt; He began rapping at age eight. Ali stated that he was influenced by hip hop culture at a very early age. In an interview with ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck]]'' magazine, he stated "Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always been into hip hop. I started beatboxing when I was about seven years old. Eventually, that led to me falling in love with the words." &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/music-2/brother-ali-hip-hop-portal-finding-faith-identity/ "In hip-hop Brother Ali found faith and identity"] ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck]]'' Adam Woodward Retrieved on 22 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;


==Appearances==

===Television===
On August 13, 2007, Brother Ali appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson|The Late Late Show]]'' and performed his single "[[Uncle Sam Goddamn]]" from ''The Undisputed Truth''. On October 19, 2007, Ali appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and performed "Take Me Home" from ''The Undisputed Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/late-night-with-conan-obrien/josh-hartnett-jack-mcbrayer-brother-ali/episode/1149331/summary.html |title=Late Night with Conan O'Brien |publisher=Tv.com|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2009 Ali appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' and was featured with late night band [[The Roots]].

===Podcasts===
On July 24, 2013, Brother Ali appeared on the [[Maximum Fun]] podcast ''[[Judge John Hodgman]]'' as an "Expert Witness".&lt;ref name="Judge John Hodgman Episode 120: Halal In The Family"&gt;{{cite web|author=MaxFun Intern|url=http://www.maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/halal-family|title=Judge John Hodgman Episode 120: Halal In The Family|publisher=[[Maximum Fun]]|date=24 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Ali also appeared in [[Sacha Jenkins]]' 2018 documentary ''Word is Bond''. 

==Personal life==
Ali has a son, Faheem, from his first marriage, and a daughter from his second marriage in 2006. His music frequently addresses his role as a father, parent, and husband. The song "Real as Can Be" off his 2009 [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Truth Is Here]]'' refers to the incoming daughter and in the song "Fresh Air" from his 2009 album ''Us'', he goes on to say "Just got married last year/ treated so good that it ain't even fair/ already got a boy now the baby girl's here/ Bought us a house like the [[Berenstain Bears]]."

Ali often makes fun of the media's constant urge to mention his albinism condition in the first lines of their reviews or newspaper articles. He is also [[legally blind]] which is caused by his albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Neda Ulaby |last=Ulaby |first=Neda |title=Brother Ali: An Honest Act Of Worship |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |newspaper=NPR |date=October 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65o1XAhIK?url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |archivedate=February 29, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article titled "The Art of Mourning in America", Brother Ali said his favorite food is [[sweet potato pie]]. The interview was conducted during the month of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]] and Ali performed a freestyle: "life long Starvation every month is Ramadan, walk in the crib and I'm surprised that the power's on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muhammad Ali|first1=Queen|title=The Art of Mourning in America|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Nation19 Magazine|pages=44–46|edition=#3|url=http://issuu.com/radiobums/docs/nation19_mag_3/44|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Ali converted to [[Islam]] at age 15 and followed Imam [[Warith Deen Mohammed]]. During this time, Ali was selected to join a group of students on a [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] study tour, in which they explored ways that a more liberal Islamic society could peacefully coexist with different religions.&lt;ref name="NPR100509"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113504052 |title=Brother Ali: An Honest Act Of Worship |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali credits his conversion to Islam to fellow hip hop musician [[KRS-One]], whom he met during a lecture at age 13 at a local Minnesotan university. When asked about his faith, Ali stated, "KRS-One was actually the one who told me I should read [[Malcolm X]]. He assigned the autobiography of Malcolm X to me; I read it, and that’s what led to me becoming a Muslim."&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/music-2/brother-ali-hip-hop-portal-finding-faith-identity/ "In hip-hop Brother Ali found faith and identity"] ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck Magazine]]'' Adam Woodward Retrieved on 22 January 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Many of Brother Ali's themes of [[social justice]] are incorporated into his lyricism, though he also takes part in activism outside of the music. He primarily focuses on themes of racial inequality, slavery, and critiquing the United States government, though overarching themes of hope, acceptance, and rising from sorrow are also often present. Much attention was garnered through Ali's album, ''[[The Undisputed Truth (Brother Ali album)|The Undisputed Truth]]'', as it heavily criticized much about the United States' political system. After the music video for "[[Uncle Sam Goddamn]]" was released in 2007, it quickly gained much attention, and shortly after, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] froze a money transfer to his record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/rapper-brother-ali-privilege-hope-stories|title=Rapper Brother Ali on Privilege, Hope, and Other People’s Stories|last=Tepper|first=Fabien|website=YES! Magazine|language=en|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ali was arrested along with thirty-seven others while occupying the home of a Minneapolis resident to fight the house's foreclosure. The goal of the protesters was to block the eviction of the family through their assembly and occupancy, but they were unsuccessful. Ali ended up using his celebrity as a platform to discuss these events, and bring them to the attention of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/06/22/local-rapper-brother-ali-arrested-at-occupy-protest |title=Local Rapper Brother Ali Arrested At Occupy Protest « CBS Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota.cbslocal.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali deals heavily with the notion of privilege, and focuses on bringing to mind issues that are all too often ignored within society. He stated in an interview with ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|Yes!]]'' magazine that "The best definition of privilege I’ve heard is anything you don't have to wrestle with, that you don't have to think about". Ali feels a certain obligation to act politically, as he is unwilling to sit aside after experiencing all he has. He states, "I feel like that's my job, and I feel like within the last few years I fully woke up to that, found the courage to understand that, and stepped out like that".

'''Charles Meade''' (December 24, 1916 – April 10, 2010) was the founder of a Christian church first called End Time Ministries, later [[Meade Ministries]], based just south of [[Lake City, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Barnard"&gt;Barnard, Jackelyn (May 12, 2005) [http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/news-article.aspx?storyid=37164 "Former Endtimer Speaks Out"] ''First Coast News'' (Jacksonville, Florida)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meade was born to a farming family in [[Oil Springs, Kentucky|Oil Springs]], [[Kentucky]] (west of [[Paintsville, Kentucky|Paintsville]]), the ninth child of his mother.&lt;ref name="Lewan-0"&gt;Lewan, Todd (2005) "Meade, the self-styled prophet: a man cloaked in lore and mystery" Associated Press, reproduced from the ''Daytona Beach News-Journal'' of 17 April 2005 at [http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview_new.asp?Subject=Meade%2C+the+self%2Dstyled+prophet%3A+a+man+cloaked+in+lore+and+mystery+ this website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609111932/http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview_new.asp?Subject=Meade%2C+the+self-styled+prophet%3A+a+man+cloaked+in+lore+and+mystery+ |date=June 9, 2012 }} by The International Cultic Studies Association; requires Microsoft's Internet Explorer&lt;/ref&gt; According to church literature he was the twelfth of fifteen children.

As a young man, Meade reportedly served in the [[United States]] armed forces on the front lines in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Lewan-0"/&gt; According to church literature he was seriously injured more than once, but there is no indication of this in his service record. He claims this is due to his biblical skills in the heart of danger.&lt;ref name="Lewan-0"/&gt;
During the early 1970s Meade began to carry the gospel of Jesus Christ to various groups of young people in their late teens and early twenties. They met in living rooms, garages and various cult meeting places throughout the United States.

He founded Meade Ministries (now [[Mountaintop Ministries Worldwide]]) in 1984, he relocated his ministry from South Dakota and Indiana to [[Lake City, Florida]]. According to the church, God told Charles Meade that Lake City, Florida, would be the only place that believers could survive [[Armageddon]]. In a 1998 ''New York Times'' article about doomsday groups, writers Alex Heard and Peter Klebnikov explained Meade's beliefs about the apocalypse: {{quote|text=The world will soon be engulfed in a sticky white substance, Meade has said, leaving his church standing as a beacon of light. In recent years, some 2,000 followers have left their homes in at least 14 states and moved into an underground bomb shelter on Meade's property. There they lived by surviving on the word and eating their daily bread. The Meade-ites have prospered in local businesses, and the church has built a stunning $10 million worship center shaped like an overturned Noah's ark -- a design that is meant to attract new members.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klebnikov|first1=Alex Heard and Peter|title=Apocalypse Now. No, Really. Now!|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/27/magazine/apocalypse-now-no-really-now.html?pagewanted=4|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Company|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005174455/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/27/magazine/apocalypse-now-no-really-now.html?pagewanted=4|archivedate=October 5, 2013|deadurl=no|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meade was married twice, first to Marie Meade who died of breast cancer on October 24, 1985, and then in November, 1985 to Marlene Helen Malthesen.

'''Grover Cleveland "Cleve" Backster, Jr.''' (February 27, 1924 – June 24, 2013) was an interrogation specialist for the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]], best known for his experiments with plants using a [[polygraph]] instrument in the 1960s which led to his theory of "[[Plant perception (paranormal)|primary perception]]" where he claimed that plants "feel pain" and have [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP), which was widely reported in the media but was rejected by the scientific community.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Lafayette Township, New Jersey]] on February 27, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Public Records Index'' Vol 2 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matté, James Allen.

Publications, 1996. {{ISBN|9780965579407}}. "Cleve Backster, born Grover Cleveland Backster, Jr., on 27 February 1924 at Lafayette, New Jersey, received an appointment on 12 April 1948 as Plans Officer at the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) whose near total operation was headquartered at 2430 E. Street, N. W. in Washington D. C...."&lt;/ref&gt; Backster began his career as an [[Interrogation]] Specialist with the CIA, and went on to become Chairman of the Research and Instrument Committee of the Academy for Scientific Interrogation. He is the former director of the Backster School of Lie Detection in [[San Diego, California]] and was a polygraph instructor before his experiments on plants.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=2013-08-06|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3|pages=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matté1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Allan Matté|title=Forensic Psychophysiology Using the Polygraph: Scientific Truth Verification, Lie Detection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yThE6vChBAC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=2012-09-01|year=1996|publisher=J.A.M.

Backster founded the CIA's polygraph unit shortly after World War II.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Backster School of Lie Detection is located in San Diego, California. The school was founded in New York City in 1960, shortly after Backster left his position with the Central Intelligence Agency.

==Primary perception==

===Findings===
Backster's study of plants began in the 1960s, and he reported observing that a polygraph instrument attached to a plant leaf registered a change in [[electrical resistance]] when the plant was harmed or even threatened with harm. His work was inspired by the research of physicist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], who claimed to have discovered that playing certain kinds of music in the area where plants grew caused them to grow faster.&lt;ref name=eop&gt;William F. Williams, ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]'', 2000 publ. Fitzory Dearborn Publishers, {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose used a [[crescograph]] to measure plant response to various [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and demonstrated feeling in plants. From the analysis of the variation of the cell [[membrane potential]] of plants under different circumstances, he hypothesized that plants can "feel pain, understand affection etc" and wrote two books about it in 1902 and 1926.

In February 1966, Backster attached polygraph [[electrode]]s to a [[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena cane plant]], to measure at first the time taken for water to reach the leaves. The electrodes are used to measure [[galvanic skin response]] and the plant showed readings which resembled that of a human. This made Backster try different scenarios, and the readings went off the chart when he pictured burning the leaf, because according to him, the plant registered a stress response to his thoughts of harming it.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; He conducted another similar experiment where he observed a plant's response to the death of a [[brine shrimp]] in another room; his results convinced him that plants demonstrated [[telepathy|telepathic]] awareness. He argued that plants perceived human intentions, and as he began to investigate further, he also reported finding that other human thoughts and emotions caused reactions in plants, which could be recorded by a polygraph instrument. He termed the plants' sensitivity to thoughts "Primary Perception", and published his findings from the experiments in the ''International Journal of Parapsychology'' in 1968.&lt;ref name="jornal"&gt;[http://www.parapsychology.org/dynamic/070100.html International Journal of Parapsychology]: "Evidence of a Primary Perception in Plant Life," vol. 10, no. 4, Winter 1968, pp. 329-348&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet scientists invited Backster to the first Psychotronic Association conference in Prague in 1973 and his paper was entitled "Evidence of Primary Perception at a Cellular Level in Plant and Animal Life".&lt;ref name="D'Arc2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan D'Arc|title=Phenomenal World: Remote Viewing, Astral Travel, Apparitions, Extraterrestrials, Lucid Dreams and Other Forms of Intelligent Contact in the Magical Kingdom of Mind-at-Large|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgTG1dxoQ8kC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=2013-08-07|date=1 November 2000|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1-58509-128-7|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1973, he further experimented on [[yoghurt]] bacteria, eggs and [[human sperm]] and he claimed his results showed "primary perception" could be measured in all living things.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary perception|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jun/10/research.highereducation4|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-08-05|author=Mark Pilkington|date=June 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions by the scientific community===

Controlled experiments that have attempted to replicate Backster's findings have failed,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Horowitz, Donald Lewis and Edgar Gasteiger. (1975). ''Plant Primary Perception: Electrophysiological Unresponsiveness to Brine Shrimp Killing''. Science, 189. pp. 478-480.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kmetz, John. (1975). ''An Examination of Primary Perception in Plants''. Parapsychology Review, 6. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwebs, Ursula. (1973). ''Do Plants Have Feelings?''. Harpers. pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory was not accepted since it did not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="St.Pete times"/&gt; At the 141st annual meeting of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the panel of biologists found the claim unsupportable. The results seemed to be spontaneous; repeatability is still a problem, for him and the people who tried to perform his experiment. His lack of control experiments were criticized and explanations, such as that the polygraphs were responding to [[static electricity]] build-up and [[humidity]] changes, were put forward. The reliability of the polygraph test itself has been questioned.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Plants have cellulose cell walls but do not possess sensory organs, which rules out the possibility of plants having ESP.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"/&gt;

Biologist [[Arthur Galston]] told ''St. Petersburg Times'', "We know plants don't have nervous systems. But they do have little electrical currents flowing through them and are subject to outside manipulation." He further said that plants can show altered electrical responses to light, chemical agents and disease but he "draws the line" to the claim of them "responding to human thoughts and events, including life elimination."&lt;ref name="St.Pete times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galston, Arthur. ''The Limits of Plant Power''. Natural History, 84. pp. 22-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists at the [[Cornell University]] and the Science Unlimited Research Foundation, San Antonio, Texas, could not find results that supported Backster's findings in the experiment, where the death of brine shrimp caused electrical voltage changes in the leaves of a plant in another room. Backster explained that they did not follow the exact laboratory techniques which he had used to perform the original experiments and he has not attempted to repeat them himself.&lt;ref name="St.Pete times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists find talking to plants of no real value|publisher=[[St.Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=2013-08-05|date=January 31, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture and influence==
Backster's work became popular and drew public attention,&lt;ref name="Sawyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Sawyer|title=The Dangerous Man: Conversations with Free-Thinkers and Truth-Seekers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMicb0W1PoYC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=2013-08-06|date=February 2010|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-84694-345-4|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his findings were similar to the beliefs of [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]] and [[New Age]] followers. Some [[parapsychologist]]s criticized his work, suggesting the results were due to "his own telekinetic abilities".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; His theory is in books like [[Peter Tompkins]] and [[Christopher Bird]]'s ''[[The Secret Life of Plants]]'' and Robert Stone's ''The Secret Life of Your Cells''.&lt;ref name="Sawyer2010"/&gt; He was a guest on June 27, 2007 on the evening radio show, "Coast To Coast AM", during which he discussed with host [[George Noory]] and with callers to the program his experiments with primary perception and findings of an interconnection between all [[living cells]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He had been a guest several times before on [[Art Bell]]'s Coast to Coast, as well as on [[Jeff Rense]]'s radio shows, and has presented papers at many international conferences and meetings as well as those in the [[United States of America|US]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Marcel Vogel]] claimed to be able to duplicate this effect "using plants as transducers for bio-energetic fields from the human mind". Backster's work caught the attention of the [[Church of Scientology]] founder, [[Ron Hubbard]]. Hubbard officially used the polygraph as an "[[E-meter]]" and he too, published plant communication experiments on tomato plants.&lt;ref name="D'Arc2000"/&gt;

Backster's "Primary Perception" theory was a subject of the [[Discovery Channel]] television show ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/mythbusters/deadly-straw/episode/822485/recap.html |title=MythBusters - Season 4, Episode 18: Deadly Straw - TV.com |publisher=tv.com |accessdate=2016-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116210058/http://www.tv.com/mythbusters/deadly-straw/episode/822485/recap.html |archivedate=2009-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After all human and environmental stimuli that could alter the results were removed, they reproduced Backster's experiments with the dracaena plant, yoghurt, saliva and eggs. After getting negative results, they performed a final experiment using an [[EEG]] instrument, which is more sensitive than a polygraph, connected it to a plant to check whether it would "see" eggs being catapulted randomly into boiling water. The instrument registered no change in the plant and the myth was considered as busted in that episode.&lt;ref name="Discovery channel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythbusters database|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/plants-have-feelings.htm|publisher=Discovery channel|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Routh Goshen''', born '''Arthur James Caley'''  (1824 – February 12, 1889) was most commonly known as '''Colonel Routh Goshen''' or the '''Arabian Giant''' or the '''Palestine Giant'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=[[William L. Slout]] |title=Col. Routh Goshen |encyclopedia=Olympians of the Sawdust Circle |year= |publisher= |page= |quote=Col. Routh Goshen (May 5, 1837 [sic] - February 12, 1889) Sideshow giant, known as 'The Palestine Giant.'  | url=http://www.circushistory.org/Olympians/OlympiansG.htm |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was billed as the tallest man in the world at 7&amp;nbsp;ft, 11&amp;nbsp;inches (2.41 m) and 620 pounds (280&amp;nbsp;kg) but was most likely no more than 7&amp;nbsp;ft, 5&amp;nbsp;inches (2.26 m) and 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg). His true origins were kept secret from the public during his performance years in the United States and were obscured by the many apocryphal biographies that were created to publicize him. His actual origins came out slowly after his death. His birth name was Arthur James Caley and he was born on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1824. His fictional biographies said he was born in [[Jerusalem]] on May 5, 1837. After his retirement in the 1880s, he settled in [[Middlebush, New Jersey]] and gained the nickname the '''Middlebush Giant'''.

==Life as Arthur Caley==
Routh Goshen was born Arthur James Caley in 1824 near [[Sulby, Isle of Man]], to Arthur Caley and Anne Kewley. He was baptized on November 16, 1824, in [[Lezayre]] parish. He was one of twelve children the couple had. His sister Margaret Caley, moved to New York. In his teens, he began to grow very tall and continued to grow into his 20s. In May 1851, Caley visited friends at Liverpool and news articles were published about his size. At that time, Caley was described as being 7&amp;nbsp;ft, 6&amp;nbsp;inches (2.28 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Manxman|newspaper= [[New-York Daily Tribune]]|location= New York City, New York|date= 22 May 1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Caley exhibited himself in Manchester, then in London and eventually in Paris, France. In February 1853, Caley's mother received a letter saying her son had died on February 1 in Paris, shortly after a life insurance policy had been taken out for him by his manager Etienne Lefevre. It is not known what happened for the next several years of Caley's life. He eventually moved to the United States and adopted the name Colonel Routh Goshen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Quirk|first= John|date= 2011 |title= The Manx Giant: The Amazing Story of Arthur Caley|url= |location= Isle of Man|publisher= Manx Heritage Foundation and MP Publishing Limited|page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life as Colonel Routh Goshen==
By at least 1859, Colonel Routh Goshen had already become known as the "Arabian Giant." By November 1863 he was being billed along side [[Anna Swan]], [[General Tom Thumb]], and [[Commodore Nutt]] at [[Barnum's American Museum]]. He was described as being twenty-seven years old at the time and having been born in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Barnum's American Museum|url= |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|location= New York, New York |date= 26 November 1863|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported to have settled for a time around 1869 on a farm in [[Algonquin, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Late News Items|url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83032041/1869-03-25/ed-1/seq-2/|newspaper= The Cambria Freeman|location= Ebensburg, PA|date= 25 March 1869|access-date= 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 a semi-fictitious biography of his life was published entitled "The History of Palestine and the Present Condition of Old Jerusalem and the Life of Col. Routh Goshan". Another fictional biography described his history as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This worthy descendant of the [[Brobdingnag|Brohdignagian]] race first saw the light of day forty three years ago in the city of [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He is of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] descent. At present he stands seven feet eleven inches in his stocking feet, weighs 635 pounds, measures ninety one inches around the chest and ninety five inches round the waist. His arms are the thickness of saplings and his fist possesses the ponderosity of the hammer of [[Thor]]. The Colonel served in several eventful campaigns. He was in the Turkish army at Jerusalem, and fought through the [[Crimean war]], the war of Italian independence and the campaign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximillian]] in Mexico. ...&lt;ref name=BE01081879&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[Media:Colonel Ruth Goshen in the Brooklyn Eagle of Brooklyn, New York on January 8, 1879.jpg|Melancholy.]] |quote= |publisher=[[Brooklyn Eagle]] |date=January 8, 1879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ruth Goshen |work= |publisher=[[Brooklyn Eagle]] |date=January 9, 1879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married at least three times and divorced twice at the time of his death. In March 1859 in Massachusetts he married Clestina N. Townes of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Giant Married|url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024738/1859-03-17/ed-1/seq-1/|newspaper= The Daily Dispatch|location= Richmond, VA|date= 17 March 1859|access-date= 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1869 he married Augusta White a German snake charmer that he met while traveling for his show. They settled near [[Clyde, New Jersey]]. At one point fellow circus performer, John Sweet and his wife the bareback rider Mrs. Elizabeth Sebastian lived with the Goshen family. Mrs. Sebastian left John Sweet, and while Goshen was away on tour, Augusta left Goshen. John Sweet and Augusta took $600 worth of silver, $70,000 worth of bonds, a goat, a horse and a wagon from Goshen's farm and eloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Giant on His Muscle|url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1882-08-17/ed-1/seq-3/ |newspaper= Evening Star|location= Washington, DC|date= 17 August 1882|access-date= 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goshen filed for divorce around January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Col.

She was from [[Elgin, Illinois]]. She had met Goshen years earlier through her cousin who was fat lady who once toured with Goshen. After their marriage, they settled down in Middlebush, NJ. In August 1882, while working at Atlantic City, Goshen encountered John Sweet again. Goshen threatened to kill Sweet with a pistol he brandished, and then beat Sweet with a cane. At the time of the assault Sweet owned a farm in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] that Goshen had lost due to a mortgage, which Sweet had paid off. A warrant was issued for Goshen's arrest and he was ordered to appear before a court in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Giant on His Muscle|url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1882-08-17/ed-1/seq-3/ |newspaper= Evening Star|location= Washington, DC|date= 17 August 1882|access-date= 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1884, Goshen applied for divorce from Welch, claiming that she was unfaithful. She claimed that he had been unfaithful with three different women. During the divorce, it came out that he was really not an Arabian, but from Lancaster, England. He was also claiming to be sixty-five years old at that time. They were divorced in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Giant in Jealous Doubt|url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1884-07-24/ed-1/seq-3/|newspaper= The Sun|location= New York, NY|date= 24 July 1884|access-date= 6 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routh also had two adopted daughters. Lillie, who married Martin Robert, a clog dancer, and Frances Goshen Sylvester (1868-1949). She may have traveled with him in Europe and she was said to have danced for [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name=will&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Contesting Colonel Goshen's Will |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1889/03/11/109793667.pdf |quote=It is reported that before his death Col.

==Death and burial==
He died at his farm on Amwell Road in [[Middlebush, New Jersey]] on February 12, 1889. He had been living in Franklin Township for about 15 years. By the time of his death, he had accumulated a valuable estate. In his will he left everything to his adopted daughter Francis then the wife of Henry Sylvester. If she were to die without any heirs, Goshen wanted his estate to go to his sister, Margaret Caley Gelling of Rochester, New York. His will was contested by his ex-wife Mary Welch who was living with family in [[Elgin, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=will/&gt;

His funeral was described in the following manner:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The farm house of the dead giant was thronged with villagers long before the hour fixed for the funeral. The remains had been placed in a coffin eight feet long and three feet wide. It was covered with cloth and had been specially made for the deceased. After the funeral services were over the coffin was borne on the shoulder of eight sturdy farmers to a wagon which was standing in the road about {{convert|100|yd}} from the house. Undertaker Van Duyn said he could not find a hearse large enough to hold the giant's coffin. The [[pallbearer|pall bearers]] had a hard struggle in carrying the remains down the incline leading from the house to the road and when they deposited the coffin in the wagon, beads of perspiration stood out on their foreheads. A large crowd followed the remains to the [[Cedar Grove Cemetery, Franklin|Middlebush cemetery]], where the interment took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[:File:Death notice for Routh Goshen (Fort Covington Sun, Fort Covington, New York, Thursday, March 07, 1889; page 1).jpg|Death and funeral of giant Goshen]] |work= |publisher=Fort Covington Sun |date=March 7, 1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was originally buried without a tombstone for fear his body would be dug up and put on display. The cemetery is the [[Cedar Grove Cemetery, Franklin|Cedar Grove Cemetery]] in [[Middlebush, New Jersey]]. His tombstone reads "Col. Routh Goshen, Middlebush Giant, 1837-1889".&lt;ref&gt;[[William B. Brahms]], Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ: A History, FTPL; {{ISBN|0-9668586-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Goshen's Manx origins==

The connection between Arthur Caley and his alias Colonel Goshen was not well known by the public for years after Caley's death in 1889. In the last months of his life, it was reported that Goshen told that his real name was the similar-sounding Arthur Crowley, that he had been born on the Isle of Man about seventy years before, and that the stories previously told about his life were lies.&lt;ref name=will/&gt; An article about Caley and Goshen entitled "The Mystery of Arthur Caley, the Manx Giant" was published in 1962 in the ''Journal of Manx Museum''. In 1965 ''The New York Times'' ran an article about the life of Arthur Caley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bardens |first= Dennis|date= 18 July 1965|title= Little People are Important on Isle of Man |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= New York City, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1980, a letter was sent to the [[Middlebush Reformed Church]] stating that his real name was "Arthur James Caley", and claiming he was born in the village of Sulby on the Isle of Man in 1827. This would have him 62 years old when he died.&lt;ref&gt;[[William B. Brahms]], Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ: A History, FTPL; {{ISBN|0-9668586-0-3}}. p.541 Brahms reprints part of the letter from Mrs. V. E. Teare of Sulby Village dated May 16, 1980. The original letter and a response letter from historian Elsie B. Stryker are in the collection of the Franklin Township Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the book ''The Manx Giant: The Amazing Story of Arthur Caley'' was published that further documented Caley's life before and after becoming Colonel Goshen.

Smith, Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation at the FAA, presents SpaceShipOne pilot [[Michael Melvill]] the department's first commercial astronaut wings]]A '''commercial astronaut''' is a person trained to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a privately funded [[spacecraft]]. This is distinct from an otherwise non-government astronaut, for example [[Charles D. Walker|Charlie Walker]], who flies while representing a non-government corporation but with funding and/or training coming from government sources.

==Criteria==
The definition of “[[astronaut]]” and the criteria for determining who has achieved [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as any flight over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} of altitude. In the [[United States]], professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} are eligible to be awarded [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]]. Until 2003, [[astronaut|professional space travelers]] were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, whether by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the first sub-orbital flight of the privately funded [[Scaled Composites Tier One]] in 2004, the commercial astronaut category was created.

==FAA Commercial Astronaut rating==
[[File:US - FAA Astronaut Wings.png|right|thumb|FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings]]With the advent of private commercial space flight ventures in the U.S., the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] has been faced with the task of developing a certification process for the pilots of commercial spacecraft. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 established the FAA's [[Office of Commercial Space Transportation]] and required companies to obtain a [[launch license]] for vehicles, but at the time manned commercial flight - and the licensing of crewmembers - was not considered. The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act has led to the issuance of draft guidelines by the FAA in February 2005 for the administration of vehicle and crew certifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/airports/regional_guidance/northwest_mountain/airports_news_events/annual_conference/2005/media/commercial_space_nield.ppt ''Commercial Space Flight - New Legislation and the Industry and Developments which Impact Commercial Airports'', FAA NW Mountain Region 2005-04-05, accessed 2007-02-20]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/programs/international_affairs/media/Industry_Standards_paper_IAC_Sept_2013_FAAfinal.pdf|title=IAC-13-E6.4.5 – INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the FAA has not issued formal regulatory guidance for the issuance of a Commercial Astronaut Certificate, but as an interim measure, has established the practice of awarding "Commercial Astronaut Wings" to commercial pilots who have demonstrated the requisite proficiency. The content of 14 CFR Part 460 implies that an instrument rating and second-class medical certificate issued within the 12 months prior to the proposed qualifying flight will be included as a minimum standard.

==List of Commercial Astronauts==
Two FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings have been awarded to [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] pilots [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/current_licenses/ ''Active Commercial Space Licenses'', FAA, accessed 2007-02-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Berman''' (1903–1957), nicknamed "Davie the Jew", was a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] [[organized crime]] figure in [[Iowa]], [[New York City]], [[Minneapolis]], and [[Las Vegas]]. He was one of the pioneers of gambling in Las Vegas, where he was a partner with flamboyant [[mobster]] [[Bugsy Siegel]] at the [[Flamingo Hotel]].  Berman died a non-violent death in 1957 during surgery.

==Early life==
Berman was born into a [[Ukrainian Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCJfAIOC2csC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=John P.|last=Marschall|title=Jews in Nevada: A History|pages=173|publisher=University of Nevada Press|date=February 1, 2008|ISBN=9780874177374}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Odessa, [[Ukraine]], at that time in the Russian Empire. His father was a former [[Yeshiva|rabbinical student]] who played the violin. When he was a young child, his father departed for America and settled in [[Ashley, North Dakota]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.bismarcktribune.com/mobile/news/columnists/article_65709558-143c-11e0-9859-001cc4c002e0.html "Las Vegas mob boss had ties to N.D."], ''Bismarck Tribune'', January 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; on land provided by [[Baron]] [[Maurice de Hirsch]]'s [[Jewish Colonization Association]]. Berman then sent for his wife and children. Davie's mother was reportedly horrified after getting off the train and realizing that they had exchanged the warmth of Odessa for the icy cold of the [[Great Plains]].

==Gangster==
After failing on the land, the Bermans moved to [[Sioux City, Iowa]], where David got his start as a mobster. At the age of 13, he ran a crew of teenaged thugs committing petty shakedowns and eventually a string of illegal distilleries. He then went on to run his own bank-robbing crew. After developing close ties to the [[Genovese crime family]], he moved to [[Minneapolis]], where he operated a major [[bookmaking]] operation in rivalry with local mob bosses [[Kid Cann]] and [[Tommy Banks (gangster)|Tommy Banks]]. One of Berman's closest enforcers during those years was Israel "Ice Pick Willie" Alderman, a homicidal Jewish gangster from North Minneapolis. His brother, "Chickie" Berman, also worked for him.

Due to his close relationship with Minneapolis mayor [[Marvin L. Kline]], Berman briefly eclipsed his rivals as boss of the Minneapolis gambling rackets.

According to his daughter, [[Susan Berman|Susan]], Berman also used his crew to intimidate and terrorize members of the pro-Nazi [[Silver Shirts]], driving them out of Minneapolis.

==World War II==
Persecution of his fellow Jews enraged Berman so much that he enlisted in the [[Canadian Army]]. He had previously been turned away by the U.S. military as a convicted felon. In addition, [[Pearl Harbor]] had not yet brought the U.S. into [[World War II]]. He saw combat in the [[European Theater]] with the 18th Armoured Car Regiment (12th Manitoba Dragoons), a reconnaissance outfit, along with Minnesota friend Nathan Gittlewich. Berman was well-liked, and fellow troopers did not know of his criminal background.

==Las Vegas==
After his return to Minneapolis, Davie's gambling operations were shattered during the first term of racket busting Mayor [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Berman moved his crew to Las Vegas and operated there in concert with Genovese Family associate [[Moe Sedway]],

Almost immediately after the 1947 assassination of [[Bugsy Siegel]], Sedway and Berman walked into the lobby of the ''[[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]]'' and announced that they were in charge. Berman died on the operating table during surgery to remove polyps from his colon on [[Father's Day]], 1957.

==Family==
While he lived in Minneapolis, Berman met and married Gladys Ewald, a [[German-American]] dancer who later converted to [[Judaism]]. The couple's only child, daughter [[Susan Berman]], wrote a memoir about growing up as Las Vegas mob royalty titled ''[[Easy Street (book)|Easy Street]]'' (1981). In her memoir, Susan indicated she knew little of her father's past until an acquaintance brought to her attention the mentions of her father in the book [[The Green Felt Jungle]]. Gladys Berman died shortly after Davie Berman at age 39 of an overdose of [[barbiturates]], although it is unclear whether it was suicide.  His daughter Susan Berman was murdered in her Southern California home — suspected murderer is Robert Durst.

'''Elena Ferrante''' ({{IPA-it|ˌɛːlena ferˈrante}}) is a [[pseudonym]]ous Italian [[novelist]], who has said that she was born in 1943 in [[Naples]]. Ferrante's books, originally published in Italian, have been translated into many languages. Her four-book series of ''[[Neapolitan Novels]]'' are among her best known works.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called Ferrante one of the 100 most influential people in 2016.

==Writing==
Ferrante is the name used by the author of half a dozen novels, the best known of which is the four-volume work known as the ''[[Neapolitan Novels]]''.&lt;ref name="Donadio"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rahel|title=Who Is Elena Ferrante?

The series consists of ''My Brilliant Friend'' (2012), ''The Story of a New Name'' (2013), ''Those Who Leave And Those Who Stay'' (2014), and ''The Story of the Lost Child'' (2015), which was nominated for the [[Strega Prize]], an Italian literary award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/elena-ferrante-mystery-creator-of-her-neapolitan-novels/story-fnb64oi6-1227269529686 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170126032629/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/elena-ferrante-mystery-creator-of-her-neapolitan-novels/news-story/e6f2f4d6b1e0fa1756fd5b4a4976b536 |archivedate=2017-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37539258 Elena Ferrante: Journalist defends unmasking 'anonymous' author]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrante holds that "books, once they are written, have no need of their authors."&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/21/women-on-the-verge | title=Women on the Verge: The Fiction of Elena Ferrante | author=Wood, James | publisher=Newyorker.com | accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has repeatedly argued that anonymity is a precondition for her work&lt;ref name="argument" /&gt; and that keeping her true name out of the spotlight is key to her writing process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/03/496406869/for-literary-world-unmasking-elena-ferrantes-not-a-scoop-its-a-disgrace For Literary World, Unmasking Elena Ferrante's Not A Scoop.

I felt as though I had released the words from myself.&lt;ref name="AoF228" /&gt;}}

The first appearance of her work in English was the publication of a short story entitled "Delia's Elevator," translated by Adria Frizzi in the anthology ''After the War'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=King, Martha|title=After the War: A Collection of Short Fiction by Postwar Italian Women|location=New York|publisher=Italica Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-934977-55-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPNm1NxhvxkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It narrates the movements of the title character on the day of her mother's burial, particularly her return to her safe retreat in the old elevator in the apartment building where she grew up.

==Anonymity==
Despite being recognized as a novelist on an international scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-ideal-marriage-according-to-novels |title=The Ideal Marriage, According to Novels |first=Adelle |last=Waldman |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=15 January 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrante has kept her identity secret since the publication of her first novel in 1992.&lt;ref name="AoF228"&gt;{{cite news |last1 =Ferri |first1=Sandro |last2=Ferri |first2=Sandra |title=Interview: Elena Ferrante, Art of Fiction No. 228 |url =http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6370/art-of-fiction-no-228-elena-ferrante |accessdate=13 June 2015| issue=212 |publisher=[[The Paris Review]] |date=Spring 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation as to her true identity has been rife, and several theories have been put forth, based on information Ferrante has given in interviews as well as analysis drawn from the content of her novels.

In 2003, Ferrante published ''La Frantumaglia'' (The Act of Falling Apart), a volume of her correspondence with editors, which shed some light on her identity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/culture/books/351280/elena-ferrante-unveiled-as-jewish-german-translator/ |title=Elena Ferrante 'Unveiled' as Jewish German Translator |author=Forward Staff |work=[[The Forward]] |date=3 October 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was translated into English only in 2016. Nonetheless, in a 2013 article for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] summarized what is generally accepted about Ferrante, based in part upon these collected letters:

{{quote|text=...a number of her letters have been collected and published. From them, we learn that she grew up in [[Naples]], and has lived for periods outside Italy. She has a classics degree; she has referred to being a mother. One could also infer from her fiction and from her interviews that she is not now married...In addition to writing, “I study, I translate, I teach.”&lt;ref name="wood" /&gt;}}

In March 2016, Marco Santagata, an Italian novelist and [[philology|philologist]], a scholar of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]], and a professor at the [[University of Pisa]],&lt;ref&gt;http://unimap.unipi.it/cercapersone/dettaglio.php?ri=5768&amp;template=dettaglio.tpl&lt;/ref&gt; published a paper detailing his theory of Ferrante's identity. Santagata's paper drew on philological analysis of Ferrante's writing, close study of the details about the cityscape of [[Pisa]] described in the novel, and the fact that the author reveals an expert knowledge of modern [[Italian politics]]. Based on this information, he concluded that the author had lived in Pisa but left by 1966, and therefore identified the probable author as Neapolitan professor Marcella Marmo, who studied in Pisa from 1964 to 1966. Both Marmo and the publisher deny Santagata's identification.&lt;ref name="Donadio" /&gt;

In October 2016, investigative reporter [[Claudio Gatti]] published an article jointly in ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'' and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', that relied on financial records related to real estate transactions and [[royalties]] payments to draw the conclusion that {{ill|Anita Raja|de}}, a [[Rome]]-based [[translator]], is the real author behind the Ferrante pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/10/02/elena-ferrante-an-answer/ |title=Elena Ferrante: An Answer? |first=Claudio |last=Gatti |publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] |date=10 October 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatti's article was criticized by many in the literary world as a violation of privacy,&lt;ref name="argument"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/137377/nyrbs-argument-doxing-elena-ferrante-not-good |title=The NYRB’s argument for doxing Elena Ferrante is not very good |work=[[The New Republic]] |first=Alex |last=Shepherd |date=2 October 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="backlash"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/style/backlash-reporter-outs-id-anonymous-writer-behind-elena-111500055.html |title=Backlash for Reporter Who 'Outs' ID of Anonymous Writer Behind Elena Ferrante |work=[[Sky News]]  |publisher=Yahoo!

In September 2017, a team of scholars, computer scientists, philologists and linguists at the [[University of Padua]] analyzed 150 novels written in Italian by 40 different authors, including seven books by Elena Ferrante. Based on analysis using several authorship attribution models, they concluded that Anita Raja's husband, author and journalist [[Domenico Starnone]], is the probable author of the Ferrante novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320131096_Elena_Ferrante_Unmasked |title=Elena Ferrante Unmasked |first=Jacques |last=Savoy |work=[[Université de Neuchâtel]] |publisher=[[ResearchGate]] |date=September 2017 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrante has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that she is actually a man, telling ''Vanity Fair'' in 2015 that questions about her gender are rooted in a presumed “weakness” of female writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/elena-ferrante-interview-the-story-of-the-lost-child |title=The Mysterious, Anonymous Author Elena Ferrante on the Conclusion of Her Neapolitan Novels |last=Schappell |first=Elissa |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=27 August 2015 |access-date=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
Two of Ferrante's novels have been turned into films. ''Troubling Love'' (''L'amore molesto'') became the feature film ''[[Nasty Love]]'' directed by [[Mario Martone]], while ''The Days of Abandonment'' (''I giorni dell'abbandono'') became [[I giorni dell'abbandono|a film of the same title]] directed by [[Roberto Faenza]]. In her nonfiction book ''Fragments'' (''La frantumaglia'' 2003), Ferrante speaks of her experiences as a writer.

In 2016, it was reported that a 32-part television series, ''The Neapolitan Novels'', was in the works and will be co-produced by the Italian producer Wildside for Fandango Productions, with screenwriting led by the writer Francesco Piccolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moylan |first1=Brian |title=Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels set for TV adaptation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/feb/09/neopolitan-novels-elena-ferrante-tv-adaptation |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 February 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, the first two episodes of the renamed ''[[My Brilliant Friend (miniseries)|My Brilliant Friend]]'', an Italian-language [[miniseries]] co-produced by American premium cable network [[HBO]] and Italian networks [[RAI]] and [[TIMvision]],&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://medium.com/hbo-cinemax-pr/my-brilliant-friend-debuts-sunday-nov-18-on-hbo-d335239ce9d7 |title=My Brilliant Friend Debuts Sunday, Nov. 18 on HBO |publisher=[[HBO]] |date=13 September 2018 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were aired at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Miniseries&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/reviews/my-brilliant-friend-hbo-1202921018/ |title=TV Review: ‘My Brilliant Friend’ on HBO |first=Daniel |last=D'Addario |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2 September 2018 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO started airing the complete eight episode miniseries, focusing on the first book in the ''The Neapolitan Novels'', in November 2018.&lt;ref name="announce"/&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Epiphanes''' is the legendary author of ''On Righteousness'',&lt;ref&gt;Ephiphanes (The Gnostic Society Library); Mead 1880:232-235.&lt;/ref&gt; a notable [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] literary work that promotes communist principles, that was published and discussed by [[Clement of Alexandria]], in ''[[Stromata|Stromaties, III]]''. Epiphanes was also attributed with founding [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monadic Gnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Wace 1880:147&lt;/ref&gt; G.R.S. Mead however thinks that Epiphanes was a legend and may not have been an actual person, that the real author of ''On Righteousness'' may be the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian]], [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]].

According to Clement,  Epiphanes was born on [[Cephalonia]] in the late 1st Century or early 2nd Century to [[Carpocrates]] (his father), and Alexandria of Cephalonia (his mother). Epiphanes died at the age of 17. Clement wrote that Epiphanes was "worshipped as a god with the most elaborate and lascivious rites by the Cephalonians, in the great temple of [[Sami, Cephalonia|Samē]], on the day of the new moon."&lt;ref name="Mead"&gt;Mead 1880:232-235&lt;/ref&gt; Mead discusses that the idea of temple worship is probably a misunderstanding, that Clement may have mistaken the worship of the moon god ''[[Epiphanes (deity)|Epiphanes]]'' with a person of the same name. The Epiphany was a sun-moon festival at the Samē temple. The new moon's life of 17 days (in the lunar cycle) may have been misunderstood as Epiphanes' 17 years of life.&lt;ref&gt;Wace 1880:148.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Vanderbilt Professor Kathy L. Gaca (The Making of Fornication:Eros, Ethics, and Political Reform in Greek Philosophy and Early Christianity, University of California Press, 2003) promotes a view of Epiphanes as one of the voices in early Christianity who held a positive and liberationist view of sexual pleasure, and who was among those like him who were ultimately silenced by the victorious sex-negative leadership represented by Clement of Alexandria, Tatian, Ambrose, Jerome and Augustine.
 
Another legend that Epiphanes led Monadic Gnosis, may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word ''eiphanes'' which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means ''distinguished'', as in a ''distinguished teacher.''&lt;ref name="Mead" /&gt;

==''On Righteousness''==

A notable belief attributed to Epiphanes and described in ''On Righteousness'' was the idea of communal living or [[communism]], including shared property and spouses.&lt;ref name="Mead" /&gt; The text begins: "The righteousness of God is a kind of sharing along with equality." The idea of communal living may have come from [[Plato]]'s ideas in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]].'' Clement took this very seriously as a sign of [[libertine]] promiscuity, but the real followers were likely to be more philosophical and merely observant of the [[Early Christian]] practice of [[Agape]], communal feasts and property.

'''George Bailey Brayton''' was an American [[mechanical engineering|mechanical engineer]] and inventor. He was noted for introducing the constant pressure engine that is the basis for the [[gas turbine]], and which is now referred to as the [[Brayton cycle]].

==Brayton's Ready Motor==

In 1872 George Brayton patented a constant pressure internal combustion [[engine]], initially using vaporized gas but later using liquid fuels such as [[kerosene]] and [[oil]], known as ''Brayton's Ready Motor'',&lt;ref&gt;Borth, Christy. ''Masters of Mass Production,'' p. 152, Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Patent Search"&gt;{{cite web

The significant difference from other piston driven internal combustion engines is that the two cylinders are arranged so that the fuel/air mixture burns progressively at constant pressure as it is transferred from the compressor cylinder and reservoir to the working/expansion cylinder. In the original version a gas/air mixture was created by a [[vapor carburetor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Frank A. Taylor|year=1939|title=Catalog of the Mechanical Collections Of The Division Of Engineering
|work=United States National Museum Bulletin 173|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst1731939unit/bulletinunitedst1731939unit_djvu.txt|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; then compressed and stored in a reservoir where it was ignited and then introduced into an expansion cylinder. A metal gauze/mesh was used to prevent the combustion running back to the reservoir. However at times the mesh failed, leading to flash-back or explosion. In 1874 Brayton filed a patent for a liquid fuel injection system. In this version, fuel was introduced as the air passed into the expansion cylinder, thus eliminating the explosion problem.&lt;ref name="Google Patent Search"/&gt; Ignition remained a pilot flame. The principle was referred to as constant pressure combustion, and had been attempted without success by [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Sir William Siemens]] c1861 using a 4-cylinder engine with a separate combustion chamber. Brayton not only achieved success in making the constant pressure cycle work, but he also made and marketed a commercial product.

Brayton cycle engines were some of the first engines to be used for motive power.
In 1881 [[John Philip Holland]] used a Brayton engine to power the world's first successful self-propelled submarine, the Fienian Ram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.zoominternet.net/~pcgray/FenianRam/fenianarticle.htm Fienian Ram]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the Selden auto of 1878 used a Brayton cycle engine. This design never actually ran. When the Brayton engine was applied to an omnibus in 1878 as part of a project between Brayton and the engineers George and James Fawcett the latter described the attempt as a 'complete failure'.&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to George Fritz: ''I am very sorry to say that the car did not run, the engine not being able to move it. You ask me to explain what I mean by failure. I mean that Mr. B's plan to run the car with that 'hobby' of his, 'fluid circulation,' was a total failure, notwithstanding his contradiction; we, at his advice abandoned it and applied chains, but the engine would not move the car with them, would not even slip the wheels on wet ground, but would come to a standstill, so we concluded to give it up. I would like you to get me some information in regard to the experiment he made in Prov. some years ago, how much the engine did, how he succeeded in keeping it cool, and what grade he went up, and, in fact, everything connected with it, if it would not be too much trouble for you. I, goose that I was, put every faith in what the B's and their friends said and did not even enquire from outside parties. I remain, Your friend Jim.''&lt;br /&gt;
J. Harold Byers: ''The Selden Case.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Selden auto.jpg|thumb|Selden Auto showing Brayton cycle engine]]

The engine's cycle of operations including sectional drawings and indicator diagrams for both gas and petroleum fueled versions. Details of the way the liquid fuel was introduced are described over 11 pages of [[Dugald Clerk]]'s book ''Gas and Oil Engines''.&lt;ref name="Oil&amp;Gas"&gt;Dugald Clerk, ''Gas and Oil Engines'', Longman Green &amp; Co, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The petroleum engine in these tests was made by the "New York and New Jersey Ready Motor Company". This is followed by a similar analysis of Simon's engine which was an adaptation of the Brayton engine made by Louis Simon &amp; Sons, in Nottingham, UK and marketed as ''The Eclipse Silent Gas Engine''. The Simon engine had an added complexity in that it injected some of the water/steam heated by the engine/exhaust into the engine. The indicator diagrams for this engine are also reported by [[Dugald Clerk]] and show that the addition of the water has little merit in terms of power production, the cooling of the gases and expansion of the steam compensating for each other.

Because the Brayton engine had a slow progressive burn of the fuel/air mixture it was possible to maintain a pilot flame, and so the engine, once lit, needed no form of ignition system.&lt;ref&gt;

The early Brayton gas engine had the engine speed governed by varying the point of cut-off for the admission of the combusted gases into the power cylinder, and the admissions of gas and air to the pump was similarly regulated to maintain the reservoir pressure. The liquid fueled engine reported by Clerk only regulated the cut-off to the power cylinder, and used a pressure relief valve to limit the reservoir air pressure. The reservoir on the Brayton engine allowed it to be readily started if it remained pressurized, though Clerk states that "leakage and loss were so frequent that the apparatus was of little use."&lt;ref name="Oil&amp;Gas"/&gt;

Brayton's engine was displayed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, and the Simon variant was displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exhibition]], and for a few years was well regarded, but within a short time the [[Otto engine]] became more popular. However, it was considered the first safe and practical oil engine and also served as inspiration to [[George B. Selden]]. As a production engine the design evolved over time, and according to Henry de Graffigny in ''Gas and Petroleum Engines'', it was available in both vertical and horizontal forms.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Graffigny (translated from the French), ''Gas and Petroleum Engines'', Whittaker, London, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

A Brayton Engine is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in the American History museum, and a later Brayton engine which powered one of [[John Philip Holland]]'s early submarines is preserved in the [[Paterson Museum]] in the [[Old Great Falls Historic District]] of [[Paterson, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Brayton's contributions to the Diesel engine==

[[File:Brayton air blast injection system 1890.jpg|thumb|Brayton air blast injection system 1890]]
[[File:Brayton direct injecton 1887.jpg|thumb|Brayton direct injecton 1887]]
In 1890 Brayton patented a 4 stroke engine with an air blast fuel injection system. Diesel's first engines used an air blast atomization system that was very similar to Brayton's . Unlike Diesel's engine Brayton's engine was fairly low compression. The ignition source was a constantly glowing mesh of platinum.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Cassier's Magazine Jun 1893, pgs. 155-157[http://vintagemachinery.org/mfgindex/imagedetail.aspx?id=6367]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; "Engineering" July 15 1892 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bppDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=1892+Warwick++Brayton+engine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3J-tyOHOAhUBHGMKHUXfD7MQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1892%20Warwick%20%20Brayton%20engine&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Diesel engines used a system of high pressure fuel injection nearly identical to Brayton's 1887 engine where the fuel was admitted into the combustion area as it passed through a spring loaded relief nozzle, This caused the fuel to become much more combustable. Here is the discovery in Brayton's own words " “I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber.” Another part reads “I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion.” US Patent #432114

==Life==

===Early life===
{{main|Villiers family}}
George was the son of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]],{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}} [[royal favourite|favourite]] of [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and his wife [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine Manners]]. He was only seven months old when his father was assassinated at [[Portsmouth]] by the renegade officer [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]].{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=68}} Subsequently he was brought up in the royal household of Charles I, together with his younger brother Francis and the King's own children, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[James II of England|James II]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=68}} He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he obtained the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] in 1642.{{sfn|ACAD|VLRS641G}} For a time he was taught geometry by [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{snf|Hobbes|Malcolm|1994|p=778}} During this time he was also acquainted with [[George Aglionby]], whose influence he later accredited with persuading him to follow the English King in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1871|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement in the English Civil War ===

In the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he fought for [[Charles I of England|the King]], and took part in [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s attack on Lichfield Close in April 1643.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

Under the care of the [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], George and his brother travelled abroad and lived in [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]. When the [[Second English Civil War]] broke out they joined Royalists under the command of [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland]] in [[Surrey]], in July 1648.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

Holland scraped together a small force of 600 men and appointed Buckingham as his General of the Horse.{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=69 ff.}} This force was scattered after a minor engagement near [[Kingston upon Thames]] in which Buckingham's brother Francis was killed.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}} Buckingham himself escaped after an heroic stand against six Roundhead opponents, his back against an oak tree, which became the stuff of [[Cavalier]] legend.{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=69 ff.}} After another doomed [[battle of St Neots|combat at St Neots]] the Duke succeeded in escaping to the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

=== Exile with Charles II ===

Because of his participation in the rebellion, his lands, which had been restored to him in 1647 on account of his youth, were confiscated and given to his future father-in-law, Thomas, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]], who refused to compound. On 19 September 1649, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] conferred on him the [[Order of the Garter]] (KG)  and admitted him to his [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 6 April 1650.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

In opposition to Hyde, Buckingham supported the alliance with the Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, accompanied Charles to [[Scotland]] in June, and allied himself with the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Marquess of Argyll]], dissuading Charles from joining the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] plot of October 1650, and being suspected of betraying the plan to the covenanting leaders.  That May, he had been appointed general of the eastern association in England, and was sent to raise forces abroad; the following year, he was chosen to lead the projected movement in [[Lancashire]] and to command the Scottish royalists. He fought alongside Charles at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, but escaped alone to [[Rotterdam]] in October.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|pp=724–725}}

His subsequent negotiations with [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s government, and his readiness to sacrifice the interests of the church, separated him from the rest of Charles's advisers and diminished his influence.  His estrangement from the royal family was completed by his audacious courtship of the king's widowed sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess of Orange]], and by a money dispute with Charles.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

=== Return and imprisonment ===

In 1657 he returned to England, and on 15 September married [[Mary Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Mary]], daughter of [[Anne Fairfax|Anne]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron]],{{sfn|Eales|2004}} who had fallen in love with him although the [[banns]] of her intended marriage with [[Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield]] were being called in church.{{snf|Yardley|2009}} Buckingham was soon suspected of organizing a Presbyterian plot against the government. An order was issued for his arrest{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}} on 9 October, despite Fairfax's interest with Cromwell. He was placed under house arrest at [[York House, Strand|York House]] in April 1658, escaped, and was rearrested on 18 August.  He was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] until his [[Anne Fairfax|mother]] and father-in-law negotiated his release on 23 February 1659. He was freed after promising not to assist the enemies of the government, and on Fairfax's security of £20,000.{{sfn|Eales|2004}} He joined Fairfax in his march against [[John Lambert (general)|General John Lambert]] in January 1660, and afterwards claimed to have gained Fairfax to the cause of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

=== After the Restoration===

The returning King Charles at first received Buckingham (who met him at his landing at [[Dover]]) coldly, but Buckingham was soon back in favour.  He was appointed a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]], carried the [[Sovereign's Orb]] at the coronation on 23 April 1661, and was made [[Lord Lieutenant]] of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 21 September. The same year, he accompanied Princess [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta]] to Paris to marry the [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orleans]], but made such shameless advances to her that he was recalled. On 28 April 1662 he was admitted to the [[Privy Council]]. His confiscated estates, amounting to £26,000 a year, were restored to him, and he was said to be the king's richest subject. He helped suppress the projected insurrection in [[Yorkshire]] in 1663, went to sea in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1665, and took measures to resist the Dutch or French invasion in June 1666.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

He was, however, debarred from high office by the influence of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]], the Chancellor.  Buckingham now plotted to effect the Chancellor's ruin. He organized parties in both Houses of Parliament to support the [[Importation Act 1667]] prohibiting the import of Irish cattle, partly to oppose Clarendon and partly to thwart [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|the Duke of Ormonde]]. Having asserted during the debates that "whoever was against the bill had either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding", he was challenged by [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Lord Ossory]]. Buckingham avoided the encounter, and Ossory was sent to the Tower. A short time afterwards, during a conference between the two Houses on 19 December, he came to blows with the [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester|Marquess of Dorchester]]: Buckingham pulled off the marquess's [[periwig]], and Dorchester also "had much of the duke's hair in his hand."  According to Clarendon, no misdemeanour so flagrant had ever before offended the dignity of the [[House of Lords]]. The offending peers were both sent to the Tower, but were released after apologising; and Buckingham vented his spite by raising a claim to the title of [[Baron Ros]], held by [[John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland|Dorchester's son-in-law]]. His opposition to the government had lost him the king's favour, and he was now accused of treasonable intrigues, and of having cast the king's horoscope. His arrest was ordered on 25 February 1667, and he was dismissed from all his offices. He avoided capture till 27 June, when he gave himself up and was imprisoned in the Tower.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
He was released by 17 July, was restored to favour and to his appointments on 15 September, and took an active part in the prosecution of Clarendon. When Clarendon fell, he became the chief minister, even though he held no high office except that of [[Master of the Horse]], bought from [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|the Duke of Albemarle]] in 1668. In 1671 he was elected chancellor of Cambridge, and in 1672 high steward of the [[University of Oxford]]. He favoured religious toleration, and earned the praise of [[Richard Baxter]]; he supported a scheme of comprehension in 1668, and advised the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]] in 1672. He upheld the original jurisdiction of the Lords in [[Skinner's Case]]. With these exceptions Buckingham's tenure of office was chiefly marked by scandals and intrigues. His illicit connection with [[Anna Maria Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|the Countess of Shrewsbury]] led to a [[duel]] with [[Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury|her husband the Earl]] at [[Barn Elms]] on 16 January 1668, in which the Earl was fatally wounded. The tale that the countess witnessed the encounter disguised as a page appears to have no foundation; but Buckingham provoked an outrage when he installed the "widow of his own creation" in his own and his wife's house.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

Buckingham was thought to be behind the idea of obtaining the divorce of the childless queen, [[Catherine of Braganza]] (though this never happened). He intrigued against [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], against Sir [[William Coventry]]—one of the ablest statesmen of the time, whose fall he procured by provoking Coventry to send him a challenge—and against the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]], who was dismissed in 1669. He was even suspected of having instigated [[Thomas Blood]]'s attempt to kidnap and murder Ormonde, and was charged with the crime in the king's presence by Ormonde's son, [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Lord Ossory]], who threatened to shoot him dead in the event of his father's meeting with a violent end. [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Arlington]], next to Buckingham himself the most powerful member of the [[Cabal Ministry|"Cabal"]] and a favourite of the king, was less easy to overcome; and he derived considerable influence from the control of foreign affairs entrusted to him. Buckingham always been an adherent of the French alliance, while Arlington concluded through Sir [[William Temple (British politician)|William Temple]] the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]]. On the complete ''volte-face'' and surrender made by Charles to France in 1670, Arlington, a [[Roman Catholic]], was entrusted with the first [[Secret treaty of Dover|Treaty of Dover]] of 20 May—which besides providing for the united attack on Holland, included Charles's undertaking to proclaim himself a Catholic and to reintroduce the Roman Catholic faith into England,—while Buckingham was sent to France to carry on the sham negotiations which led to the public treaties of 31 December 1670 and 2 February 1672. He was much pleased with his reception by [[Louis XIV]], declared that he had "more honours done him than ever were given to any subject", and, was presented with a pension of 10,000 [[French livre|livres]] a year for Lady Shrewsbury.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

In June 1672, during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], he accompanied Arlington to [[Nieuwerbrug]] to impose terms on the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]], and when these were refused with Arlington arranged a new treaty, the [[Accord of Heeswijk]] with Louis. After all this activity he suffered a keen disappointment in being passed over for the command of the newly formed [[Blackheath Army]] in favour of [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|the Duke of Schomberg]]. Buckingham was given command of a regiment, but resented serving under Schomberg. He now knew of the secret treaty of Dover, and towards the end of 1673 his jealousy of Arlington became open hostility. He threatened to impeach him, and endeavoured with the help of Louis to stir up a faction against him in parliament.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

===Downfall ===

This, however, was unsuccessful, and in January 1674 both houses of Parliament attacked Buckingham.  In the [[House of Lords|Lords]], the trustees of the young [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]] complained that Buckingham publicly continued his affair with the Countess, and that a son of theirs had been buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] with the title of [[Earl of Coventry]]; Buckingham and the countess were required to apologize and give security for £10,000 not to cohabit together again. In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] he was attacked as the promoter of the French alliance, of "popery" and arbitrary government. He defended himself chiefly by endeavouring to blame Arlington; but the house approved a petition to the king to remove Buckingham from his councils, presence and from employment forever. Charles, who had been waiting for a favourable opportunity, and who was enraged at Buckingham's disclosures, quickly consented.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

Buckingham retired, reformed his ways, attended church with his wife, began to pay his debts, became a "patriot", and was claimed by the country or opposition party as one of their leaders. In the spring of 1675 he was conspicuous for his opposition to the [[Test Acts|Test Oath]] and for his abuse of the bishops, and on 16 November he introduced a bill for the relief of the [[nonconformist]]s. On 15 February 1677 he was one of the four lords who tried to embarrass the government by raising the question whether the parliament, not having assembled according to the act of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] once in the year, had not been dissolved by the recent prorogation. The motion was rejected and the four lords were ordered to apologize. When they refused, they were sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]], Buckingham in particular exasperating the House by ridiculing its censure. He was released in July, and immediately entered into intrigues with [[Paul Barillon]], the French ambassador, with the object of hindering the grant of supplies to the king; and in 1678 he visited Paris to get the assistance of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] for the opposition's cause.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|pp=725–726}}

He took an active part in prosecuting those implicated in the "[[Popish Plot]]", and accused the lord chief justice (Sir [[William Scroggs]]) in his own court while on circuit of favouring the [[Roman Catholic]]s.  Because of this, a writ was issued for his arrest, but it was never served. He promoted the return of [[British Whig Party|Whig]] candidates to Parliament, constituted himself the champion of the dissenters, and was admitted a [[Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]]. He, however, separated himself from the Whigs on the exclusion question, probably on account of his dislike of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], was absent from the great debate in the Lords on 15 November 1680, and was restored to the king's favour in 1684.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

===Retirement===
[[File:Augustus Leopold Egg - The Death of Buckingham - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Death of Buckingham'' by Victorian artist [[Augustus Egg]]. The scene of his death derives from the exaggerated account in Alexander Pope's ''Epistle to Bathurst'':
&lt;poem&gt;In the worst inn’s worst room, with mat half-hung,	
The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung,	
On once a flock-bed, but repaired with straw,	
With tape-tied curtains never meant to draw,	
The George and Garter dangling from that bed
Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red.
&lt;/poem&gt;]]
He took no part in public life after [[James II of England|James II]]'s accession, but returned to his manor of [[Helmsley]] in [[Yorkshire]], probably because of poor health and exhausted finances. In 1685 he published a pamphlet, entitled ''A short Discourse on the Reasonableness of Man's having a Religion'' in which after discussing the main subject he returned to his favourite topic, religious toleration. The tract provoked some rejoinders and was defended, amongst others, by [[William Penn]], and by the author himself in ''The Duke of Buckingham's Letter to the unknown author of a short answer to the Duke of Buckingham's Paper'' (1685). In hopes of converting him to Roman Catholicism, James sent him a priest, but Buckingham ridiculed his arguments. He died on 16 April 1687, from a chill caught while hunting, in the house of a tenant in [[Kirkbymoorside]] in Yorkshire (it is known as Buckingham House and it is located in the town centre), expressing great repentance and feeling himself "despised by my country and I fear forsaken by my God".{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

The miserable picture of his end drawn by [[Alexander Pope]] is greatly exaggerated. Buckingham was buried on 7 June 1687 in [[Henry VII Lady Chapel|Henry VII's chapel]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], with greater splendour than the late king. With his death, the family founded by the extraordinary rise to power and influence of the first duke ended. As he left no legitimate children, the title became extinct, and his great estate was completely dissipated; of the enormous mansion{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}} he constructed at [[Cliveden]] in Buckinghamshire only the arcaded terrace remains.{{sfn|Oxford Archaeology|2002|pp=1–2 (PDF 4–5)}}

== Character ==
Buckingham was one of the archetypal Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], part of the "Merry Gang" of courtiers whose other members included [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], [[Charles Sedley|Sir Charles Sedley]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]], and the playwrights [[William Wycherley]] and [[George Etherege]].{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=19–20}} Following the tone set by the monarch himself, these men distinguished themselves in drinking, sex and witty conversation. Buckingham is often judged ostentatious, licentious, and unscrupulous, the "[[Alcibiades]] of the seventeenth century."  But even his critics agree that he was good-humoured, good-natured, generous, an unsurpassed mimic, and the leader of fashion.  His good looks and amusing wit made him irresistible to his contemporaries, in spite of his moral faults and even crimes.  A contemporary observer at the Court of Charles II found him: "Courteous, affable, generous, magnanimous...he is adored by the people....On the other hand he is an atheist, blasphemer, violent, cruel and infamous for his licentiousness, in which he is so wrapped up that there is no sex, nor age, nor condition of persons who are spared from it".{{sfn|Middleton|1980|pp=47–48}} His portrait has been drawn by Burnet, Count Hamilton in the ''Memoires de Grammont'', [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]] in the ''Epistle to Lord Bathurst'', and Sir [[Walter Scott]] in ''Peveril of the Peak''. [[John Reresby]] calls him "the first gentleman of person and wit I think I ever saw", and [[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet]] bears the same testimony. Dean Lockier, after alluding to his unrivalled skill in riding, dancing and fencing, adds, "When he came into the presence-chamber it was impossible for you not to follow him with your eye as he went along, he moved so gracefully". Racing and hunting were his favourite sports, and his name long survived in the hunting songs of Yorkshire.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

The Duke was the patron of [[Abraham Cowley]], [[Thomas Sprat]], [[Matthew Clifford]] and [[William Wycherley]]. He dabbled in [[chemistry]], and according to [[Thomas Burnet]], "he thought he was very near the finding of the [[philosopher's stone]]." He set up the [[Vauxhall glassworks]] at [[Lambeth]], the productions of which were praised by [[John Evelyn]]; and he spent much money, according to his biographer Brian Fairfax, in building ''[[Substructiones Insanae|substructiones insanae]].'' [[John Dryden]] described him under the character of Zimri in celebrated lines in the poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' (to which Buckingham replied in ''Poetical Reflections on a late Poem ... by a Person of Honour'', 1682):{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

{{quote|
A man so various that he seemed to be/Not one, but all mankind's epitome;/Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,/Was everything by starts and nothing long;/But, in the course of one revolving moon/Was chymist, fiddler, statesman and buffoon../..Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late,/He had his jest, but they had his estate.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}
}}

Buckingham, however, cannot with any truth be called "mankind's epitome". On the contrary, the distinguishing features of his life are incompleteness, aimlessness, imperfection, insignificance, neglected talent and wasted opportunity. "He saw and approved the best", says Brian Fairfax, "but did too often ''deteriora sequi'' (Latin &gt; "follow the worst")". He is more severely but more justly judged by himself. In light-hearted moments he wrote "Methinks, I see the wanton houres flee, And as they passe, turne back and laugh at me", but his last recorded words, "O! what a prodigal have I been of that most valuable of all possessions—Time!" express with exact truth the fundamental flaw of his character and career, of which he had at last become conscious.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

==Works==

Buckingham wrote [[occasional verse]]s, pamphlets, lampoons, satires and plays showing undoubted (but undeveloped) poetic gifts, a collection of which, containing however many pieces not from his pen, was first published by [[Tom Brown (satirist)|Tom Brown]] in 1704; while a few extracts from a [[commonplace book]] of Buckingham of some interest are given in an article in the ''Quarterly Review'' of January 1898. He was the author of ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'', an amusing and clever satire on the heroic drama and especially on Dryden's ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (first performed on 7 December 1671, at the Theatre Royal, and first published in 1672), a deservedly popular play which was imitated by [[Henry Fielding]] in ''Tom Thumb the Great'', and by [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]] in ''The Critic''.  It is believed that [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] had a hand in it. Dryden had his revenge in his picture of Buckingham as ''Zimri'' in ''Absalom and Achitophel''.  Buckingham also published two adapted plays: a version of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] ''[[The Chances]]'' (1682) and ''The Restoration or Right will take place'', from [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]'' (publ. 1714); and also ''The [[Battle of Sedgmoor]]'' and ''The Militant Couple'' (publ. 1704). The latest edition of his works is that by T. Evans (2 vols. 8vo, 1775). Another work is named by Wood, ''A Demonstration of the Deity'', of which there is now no trace.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=126}}

Like [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|his father]], the younger Duke makes an appearance in [[Alexandre Dumas pere|Alexandre Dumas père]]'s "Musketeer" novels. ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' sees him escorting [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s sister, [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], to [[France]] to be married to [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]]. He is soon smitten with the young lady, which Philippe perceives quickly, and appeals to his mother, [[Anne of Austria]]. Anne, whose love for Villiers Senior was chronicled in ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', convinces him that, due to his feelings, it would be best for French-English relations if he returned home. While in France, however, he earns the enmity of Comte de Wardes, whose father was the lover of [[Milady de Winter]], who was responsible for the old Villiers' death. De Wardes escorts him to a boat destined for England, but before departing, the two men duel and de Wardes is injured.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=for the whole paragraph}}

== Legacy==
The [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[film director|director]] [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]] portrayed the 2nd Duke of Buckingham in the 1957 episode "The Trial of Colonel Blood" of [[NBC]]'s [[anthology series]], ''[[The Joseph Cotten Show]]''.

In the 2003 [[British television]] mini-series ''[[Charles II: The Power and The Passion]]'', Villiers is portrayed by the British actor [[Rupert Graves]].

In the 2004 motion picture ''[[Stage Beauty]]'', [[Ben Chaplin]] plays him.

== Personal life and death ==

Gilbert Kahele was born in a grass shack by the sea on May 15, 1942 at Kalihi, just south of the Hawaiian fishing village of Miloliʻi in South Kona.

Born to Peter and Rebecca Kahele, both of Hawaiian descent, Gilbert was the third-born behind brothers Ronald and Peter and would be the older brother to Leighton, Mona, and Corrine.

Kehele attended Hilo High School, played on the Vikings football team and graduated in 1960.

Kahele served in the United States Marine Corps. for four years in the engineering troop responsible for refrigeration.

After the military Kahele graduated with an Associate degree in Science in 1967 from Laney College

Kahele moved back to Hawaiʻi where he began a civil service career that would last 33 years. He got a job with the Federal Government at Naval Station Wahiawa as a refrigeration mechanic. He married United Airlines stewardess Linda Haggberg in October of 1971, and the couple lived in Wahiawa. In 1976, the couple moved to Hilo. They had two children, Kai and Noelani. For the next 25 years Gil drove from Hilo up the Saddle Road to his job at the Pohakuloa Training Area, where he would eventually retire in 2000 as the Director of Public Works.

During the 1980s, Kahele spent a lot of time in Miloliʻi and made a name for himself as a successful community organizer in South Kona.

Governor Neil Abercrombie selected Gil Kahele to represent Senate District Two on Hawaiʻi Island after Senator Russell Kokubun resigned his seat to take a position in Governor Abercrombieʻs cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://senatorkahele.com/about-senator-kahele/ |title= From Miloliʻi to the Hawaiʻi State Senate - Senator Gil Kahele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahele died early January 26, 2016, after a short illness which caused him to miss the 2016 Hawaii State Legislature’s opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hawaii247.com/2016/01/26/sen-kahele-dies-1942-2016/ |title= Senator Kahele dies (1942-2016) |publisher=[[Hawaii 24/7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gracie family''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɡɾejsi|lang}}) is a prominent [[martial arts]] family from [[Brazil]] known for their development of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] (BJJ). They have been successful in combat sport competitions including [[mixed martial arts]], [[vale tudo]], and [[submission wrestling]] events. As a family, they uphold the [[Gracie challenge]], which promotes their style of modern jiu-jitsu. Members are [[Affinity (law)|affinally]] and [[Consanguinity|consanguineously]] related to the [[Machado family]].

==Origins==
One part of the Gracie family line in Brazil descended from George Gracie, a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] from the [[Carronbridge|Carronhill estate]] in [[Dumfriesshire]] who emigrated in 1826 when he was 25 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faixapreta.com/Materia.aspx?C=1400 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516230406/http://www.faixapreta.com/Materia.aspx?C=1400 |date=May 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faixapretamag.wordpress.com/|title=Faixapreta|work=Faixapreta.com|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gracie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/cgfh/earlygracies.html|title=Early Gracies|work=Optusnet.com.au|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2012|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

==Jiu-Jitsu==
Gastão Gracie from [[Rio de Janeiro]], the grandson of George Gracie through his son Pedro married Cesarina Pessoa Vasconcellos, the daughter of a wealthy [[Ceará]] family, in 1901 and decided to settle in [[Belém do Pará]].&lt;ref name="cairus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/members/congress-papers/lasa2009/files/CairusJose.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Gracie Clan and the Making of Brazilian Jiu‐jitsu: National Identity, Performance and Culture, 1801‐1993 (Draft)]|author=José Cairus|publisher=Lasa.international.pitt.edu|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=November 2012|reason=Unrevised drafts of publications are categorically unreliable.}} Gastão Gracie became a business partner of the American Circus in Belém.

Conde thus accepted to teach Gastão's son Carlos. In 1921, however, following financial hardship and his own father Pedro's demise, Gastão Gracie returned to Rio de Janeiro with his family.&lt;ref name="cairus"/&gt;

Maeda's teachings were then passed on through local Rio coaches to Carlos and brothers Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., and George and [[Hélio Gracie|Hélio]]. There's a version saying that Helio was too young and sick at that time to learn the art and due to his medical imposition was prohibited to physically partake in training, but it is now known that he became a [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]] for the local rowing team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracieacademy.com/generations_helio.asp|title=Helio Gracie|work=Gracieacademy.com|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a competitive swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/the_grumpy_grappler/2014/06/deconstructing-the-gracie-mythology-part-2.html|title=Deconstructing the Gracie Mythology (Part 2) - The Jiu Jitsu Journey|work=Typepad.com|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hélio successfully learned the art of Jiu Jitsu.

'''Griffith Davies''' (1868-1962) was a Welsh poet from the [[Llanuwchllyn]] area [[Merionethshire]]. He was raised by his mother, his father having died before he was born, and was educated at the local school, and for a time at Owen Owen's (1850 - 1920) school in Oswestry. For most of his life he lived as a farmer, farming Bryncaled farm in [[Merionethshire]]. He also served as a deacon of Yr Hen Gapel (Congregational church), [[Llanuwchllyn]], and was for a time Vice-President of the Merioneth Historical Society.

His writings include a number of contributions to the local press, and articles written for 'Y Tyst', 'Dysgedydd', and 'Geninen'. In 1910 he published a booklet containing his [[awdl]] (long poem) to Michael D. Jones. ''Awen Gwyndaf Llanuwchllyn'', a volume of his works, was published posthumously in 1966, edited by James Nicholas. He died in 1962, and was buried in the new cemetery at [[Llanuwchllyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Griffith|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-DAVI-GRI-1868.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Strange''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. The character is one of [[Batman]]'s first recurring villains and is also one of the first Batman villains to discover the hero's [[secret identity]].

==Publication history==
Hugo Strange first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #36 (February 1940)&lt;ref name=dc136&gt;''Detective Comics'' #36&lt;/ref&gt; and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-''Crisis''===
====Earth-One====
Hugo Strange first appears as a scientist who uses a stolen "concentrated lightning" machine to generate a dense fog every night, allowing his gang to rob banks unseen, though he knows Batman poses a threat to him. Batman, who already knows of Strange's experiments, begins investigating him after one of his henchmen kills a man. When his henchmen are apprehended, Strange vows to set a trap for Batman as the next target on the list. When Batman arrives, over a dozen of Strange's men are waiting for him, and one of them knocks him out with a [[Baton (law enforcement)|blackjack]]. He wakes up in Strange's lair, where Strange hangs him from his wrists and lashes him with a whip. Batman breaks the ropes, gasses the room, and tackles Strange, who is jailed but plans to escape.&lt;ref name=dc136 /&gt; In ''Batman'' (vol. 1) #1 he escapes from [[Arkham Asylum|the "city asylum"]] with a gang of criminals, then breaks out "five insane patients" and uses them as test subjects, turning them into hulking 15&amp;nbsp;ft. [[monster]]s by administering a powerful artificial [[growth hormone]] that acts on the [[pituitary gland]]. They wear bulletproof clothing, and he releases them to wreak havoc in [[Gotham City]] while his men commit robberies. Strange administers the serum to Batman after the giants capture him, saying it will work in 18 hours. Batman tricks two of the monsters into killing each other, and then saves himself by creating a drug that prevents any abnormal secretions from the pituitary gland. He is then able to kill all the other monsters, and sends Strange to his apparent demise, although he suspects that the mad scientist has survived.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 1) #1&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Detective Comics'' #46, Strange starts spreading a fear-inducing powder around the city until a punch from Batman sends him falling to his apparent death.&lt;ref name=dc146&gt;''Detective Comics'' #46&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned in the 1970s during the "Strange Apparitions" [[story arc]]. Having survived his earlier "death", Strange is running a private hospital for Gotham's wealthiest citizens—where he holds them for ransom and changes them into monsters. When Bruce Wayne checks into the hospital to recover discreetly from [[radiation]] burns he sustained while fighting [[Doctor Phosphorus]], Strange finds out that Wayne is Batman and proceeds to wreak havoc on his personal life. Strange then attempts to auction the identity of Batman to Gotham City Council Boss [[Rupert Thorne]], [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], and [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. Thorne has Strange kidnapped and beaten to reveal Batman's identity, but Strange apparently dies before he can tell them. Strange's ghost comes back to haunt Thorne, driving the council boss insane. Thorne confesses his long career of corruption and is sent to [[Arkham Asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #469-476&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed in ''Batman'' (vol. 1) #356 (February 1983) Strange had indeed survived the beating from Thorne's men, by using [[yoga]] to slow his heartbeat to an undetectable level. Strange artificially created the "ghost" that haunted Thorne which drove him to confess to the authorities. Subsequently, Strange attempts to weaken Bruce Wayne through the use of drugs and robots, with the ultimate goal of usurping the mantle of Batman. The plan fails, and Strange apparently dies once more when he blows up a replica of [[Wayne Manor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 1) #356&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Strange returns in ''Batman Annual'' #10 (1986), in another attempt to destroy Batman and Bruce Wayne, attempting to financially bankrupt Wayne by using various tricks to force Wayne Enterprise shareholders to sell their stocks to him, allowing him to bankrupt Wayne, but he is defeated and sent to prison. Batman casts further doubt on Strange's deductions of his identity by claiming that he hypnotized Strange just before Commissioner Gordon showed up to make the arrest, leaving Strange doubting his own mind as he wonders if Batman is attempting a complex double-bluff.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Annual'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earth-Two====
The [[Earth-Two]] version of Strange has a similar history and also survives the fall he experienced.&lt;ref name=dc146 /&gt; He is left [[paralysis|paralyzed]] but, after years of physical therapy, he regains enough movement to write out the surgical techniques needed to repair the damage to his body—and bribes a surgeon to perform the operation. The surgeon lacks Strange's skill, and the operation leaves Strange physically deformed (the surgeon dies for his failure). Strange uses one of his devices to capture [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]]'s Cosmic Rod, to use its power to attack everyone and everything Batman holds dear. He generates a storm in Gotham to obtain the device, which creates a [[Portal (fiction)|dimensional doorway]] to [[Earth-One]], bringing that [[fictional universe|universe]]'s Batman over to Earth-Two and allows him and that world's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] to join with the original [[Batwoman]] in defeating Strange. Strange realizes that he is, in fact, angry at his own wasted life and deformed body. Strange then uses the Cosmic Rod to commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Brave and the Bold'' #182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-''Crisis''===
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']] continuity, Strange was reintroduced in the "[[Batman: Prey|Prey]]" storyline as a [[psychiatrist]] enlisted to help a police taskforce capture Batman. While brilliant at his work, Strange is depicted as being equally unbalanced: he is so obsessed with Batman, he takes to dressing up like Batman in private, convinced that he understands the darkness that drives Batman when he really constantly underestimates Batman's strength.

According to [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], Strange was "abandoned as a child, grew up in state homes. A bright kid, but he apparently had a hell of a temper. Nobody knows ''how'' he put himself through college and medical school." He was raised in an orphanage on the lower East Side of Gotham, not far from the infamous "Crime Alley", in the heart of a part of Gotham known as "Hell's Crucible". Strange became a Professor of Psychiatry at Gotham State University, but had his tenure suspended due to his increasingly bizarre [[genetic engineering]] theories. At some point, he is approached by an Indian man named Sanjay, who seeks Strange's aid in curing his sick brother. Strange agrees to help, and Sanjay works loyally by his side from that point onward. Borrowing money from gangster [[Sal Maroni]], who is in the employ of Gotham's criminal kingpin [[Carmine Falcone]], Strange sets up a lab. He then bribes a corrupt orderly to give him incurably insane inmates from [[Arkham Asylum]]—who have been institutionalized so long that they will not be missed.

Strange's experiments have literally monstrous results, with his test subjects turning into gigantic, mindless "[[Batman and the Monster Men|Monster Men]]", possessing superhuman strength and cannibalistic instincts. Strange uses these Monster Men to raise the money he needs to pay back his Mafia connections. Batman becomes involved after discovering some of the gruesome remains of the Monster's Men's cannibalistic rampages. When Strange sets his creations free at an illegal poker game, helping himself to the victims' money after the slaughter, his Mafia connections begin to grow suspicious. Batman tracks Strange down, but is captured by Sanjay and thrown to the Monster Men as an intended meal. Batman not only holds off the creatures, but uses them in part of an inventive escape. Strange is enthralled by Batman, believing that he has found a genetically perfect man. He creates one final Monster Man using a drop of Batman's blood, and while his creation still has many of the flaws of its "brothers", it lacks most of the grotesque disfigurements that had plagued Strange's earlier work. Strange is forced to destroy his lab in order to evade capture. Soon after, he turns the Monster Men loose, including Sanjay's brother (who had been mutated in a failed attempt to cure him), at Falcone's estate, where Strange's Mafia connections are staying. Strange wants a fresh start, and realizes that the Mafia is still a link to his experiments. In the battle that follows, all of the Monster Men are killed, along with Sanjay (who was attempting to avenge his brother). Strange escapes amid the chaos, and succeeds in eradicating all links between himself and his experiments. Confident that he can not be linked to them, he begins to appear on TV as a psychological expert on the Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and the Monster Men'' #1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the events of [[Doug Moench]] and [[Paul Gulacy]]'s "Prey" storyline take place at this point. Partly due to Hugo Strange's appearance on TV as a psychological expert, Captain Gordon is ordered to assemble a task force to capture Batman (with Strange working as a consultant to it, to deduce Batman's secret identity). As the task force's investigation progresses, Strange grows increasingly maniacal in his obsession with Batman, going so far as expressing a desire to become Batman and dressing up in a replica Batsuit. To that end, Strange attempts to kill the Caped Crusader and permanently replace/impersonate him.  However, Strange repeatedly underestimates the level of physical conditioning needed to be Batman (e.g., incorrectly theorizing that Batman was driven into activity by a personal tragedy suffered within just the past five years—while Gordon already knows that a lifetime of training would really be required). Strange also diagnoses Batman with various [[personality disorder]]s, such as explaining Batman's use of a costume as symptomatic of [[multiple personality disorder]], whereas Gordon more accurately explains the Batsuit's intended purpose as 'scaring the pants off criminals'. Strange eventually concludes that Bruce Wayne is most likely Batman, brainwashes the task force's commander into becoming a lethal vigilante (as part of a plot to turn public sentiment against Batman) and kidnaps the Mayor's daughter dressed as the Dark Knight. Despite Strange's attempt to psychologically 'break' Batman by creating recordings and mannequins of Thomas and Martha Wayne, blaming Bruce for their deaths, which he sets up in Wayne Manor, Bruce is able to collect himself and focus in the Batcave. The following day, he confronts Strange and tricks Strange into doubting his own hypothesis about Batman's secret identity, claiming that his parents live in [[Paraguay]] and he has no idea what Strange is talking about when he discusses mannequins. Strange is ultimately exposed, but he is shot twice by the task force when he attempts to escape dressed in his replica Batsuit, and falls into a river. Hugo Strange is presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Doug Moench]]'s "Terror" storyline, Strange mysteriously comes back. He decides to work with another of Batman's enemies, [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]], and use him as a tool to help him capture Batman, while simultaneously having fallen into a further delusional state as he engages in a 'relationship' with a female mannequin in Batman's cowl, reflecting his warped dual admiration and loathing of Batman. Scarecrow turns on Strange when Strange's therapy proves effective enough to turn Scarecrow against his 'benefactor', tricking Strange into falling into the cellar of his mansion base where the twisted psychiatrist is impaled on a weather vane Crane had left in the cellar earlier. The Scarecrow then uses Strange's mansion as a trap for Batman, but his attempt to use Strange's plan fails when he only learns of Strange's plan to use Crime Alley as the scene of a trap while ignorant of the reasons ''why'' that alley is so significant to Batman, with his 'trap' merely consisting of luring Batman into the alley and decapitating a former classmate of Crane's in front of Batman. With Catwoman's help, Batman locates Scarecrow's hideout and catches Scarecrow in the cellar with Strange's body before the house is destroyed in a fire, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vane-he claimed that he lured rats to himself by using his sweat so that he could eat them-or if Scarecrow and Batman were hallucinating from exposure to Crane's new fear-gas, although Batman concludes that the subsequent explosion of the house has definitely killed Strange.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #137–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Both "Prey" and "Terror" are set during Batman's early years. In the modern timeline, Strange returns in a four-part storyline called "Transference". Initially appearing in his own Batsuit, he captures Catwoman with the aid of his henchwoman Dora-a former patient whose identity issues have been 'focused' by Strange so that she will act as Catwoman, albeit wielding a gun-and attempts to interrogate her about Batman's current status, Strange dismissing the existence of Batman's new allies by proclaiming them to be 'parasites' as he cannot accept that Batman would share his 'power'. He is then shown posing as a psychiatrist doing standard stress evaluations at [[Wayne Enterprises]]&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;. While Bruce Wayne is on the couch, Strange drugs him with a powerful [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]] in order to coax Wayne into admitting that he is Batman. Wayne is able to escape using a cleaning fluid from the office storage cupboard to start a fire, dresses as Batman to fake the Dark Knight's death when the Batmobile explodes just as he lands in it,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; and triggers a post-[[hypnotic]] suggestion in himself, forcing him to completely repress the Batman aspect of his mind until [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] can thwart Strange. Faced with Nightwing and Robin each denying that Wayne is Batman and Wayne's own obvious lack of combat reflexes, Strange becomes concerned that his theory that Bruce Wayne is Batman has been disproved and that he may have actually killed Batman. Faced with this conflicting situation, Strange has a mental breakdown and is taken to [[Arkham Asylum]]&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;.

Following that, Strange reappears as the head of a gang of supervillains attempting to take control of Gotham's East Side, then controlled by [[Catwoman]]. Catwoman joins Strange's gang, then allows its members to "find out" that she intends to betray them, faking her death when they attempt to eliminate her. Although she defeats and imprisons most of the gang, and even convinces Strange to leave the East Side alone, Strange still mocks her by pointing out that he had faked his own death far more often than she had.&lt;ref&gt;''Catwoman'' #46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catwoman'' #48&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Batman'' #665, Batman tells Tim Drake that a huge man dressed like a combination of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and Batman had beaten him up and he suspects the impostor had used "Hugo Strange's monster serum and daily Venom shots" to gain his size and strength.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 1) #665&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story arc ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Strange is associating with other supervillains such as the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Doctor Death (comics)|Doctor Death]] and [[Two-Face]]. Strange and the others are rounded up by the [[Suicide Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Underground'' #1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange takes part in the limited series ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He is amongst the supervillains imprisoned on another planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation Run'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange appears in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', which is set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. Issues #35 and 36 of the comic book provide him with a tragic backstory: he witnessed the murder of his son David by mob boss [[Rupert Thorne]] and was so overcome with grief that he sought to literally erase the memory with his mind control technology. The plan backfired, however; following the experiment, he could remember ''nothing but'' his son's death. After Batman stops him from killing Thorne, Strange is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum.

===''The New 52''===
''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) introduces the reader to his son Eli Strange for the first time.&lt;ref name="dc5"&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #5 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Eli is first seen playing a game of poker with the [[Russian Mob]], betting a valuable bracelet, winning big and cleaning house. Before he can walk away with his winnings, the mobster forces him to play another hand, in which he discovers Eli's sleeve is loaded with cards. Before he can give the order to have him killed, the mobster's thugs realize their bracelet (Eli's was a fake replica) had been stolen, [[Catwoman]] pounces from the ceiling and takes out the entire group of criminals. She thanks Eli for being her distraction (the two having been working together the entire time) and tells him to run home to his father, which he is last seen doing.&lt;ref name="dc5" /&gt;

Later, Hugo Strange uses Eli to oversee an operation to dose Gotham with fear gas. Scarecrow led Batman to believe that a small boy in a picture would be harmed unless he put a stop to it. Arriving at the scene, Batman realizes that the small boy was actually Eli. He manages to avert the disaster and Eli is arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #10 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Hugo Strange is among the supervillains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''DC Rebirth''===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Hugo Strange appears in ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' during the ''Night of the Monster Men'' crossover event.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/batman-rebirth-monster-men/&lt;/ref&gt; Although apparently ignorant of Batman's identity, he is now determined to prove his superiority by attacking Gotham with a group of 'Monster Men' created from corpses of former patients as representations of what Strange perceives as Batman's greatest flaws: his ego, grief, manipulative nature, childhood, and basic fear, ultimately provoking Batman into a confrontation at Strange's office penthouse headquarters. Strange wears what he terms a 'suicide suit'-a near-replica of the Batsuit without the cape and cowl that is rigged to detonate if its wearer is subjected to any physical attack-on the assumption that Batman will have no choice but surrender the cowl to him as the 'true' Batman. Nightwing is able to defeat the final monster-an amalgamation of the previous ones-by literally leaping inside it to inject it with a pre-prepared antidote, while Batman outwitted Strange by having [[Clayface]] cover the penthouse in a airtight seal prior to the confrontation. It results with a delirious Strange losing consciousness while Batman is still standing, Nightwing musing that Strange failed to realize that Batman's flaws were actually his motivation in protecting Gotham.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===''Batman '66''===
In the ''[[Batman '66]]'' universe, Hugo Strange is initially a psychiatrist at the Arkham Institute, until being revealed as a villain in ''Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E.''. &lt;ref&gt;''Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''DC Bombshells''===
In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' universe, Hugo Strange is a eugenicist attempting to improve the gene pool. He weeds out what he considers unclean. &lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics Bombshells'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Killer Frost]]'s plan to create a race of superhumans, Hugo Strange allied himself with Penguin and Harvey Dent. With Harvey Dent at the head of Gotham City, Hugo Strange would have had access to all Gothamites' genes and control the generations to come. When the Batgirls attempted to stop Penguin and his allies, Hugo Strange used his modified gun to force the Batgirls to fight each other. However, Harvey Dent eventually betrayed Penguin and him in favour of the Batgirls. Hugo Strange fled in response, promising to find other scientists sharing his dream.
Hugo Strange found new allies within the [[Soviets]]. They fund his researches and he created several clones using Supergirl's DNA, among which [[Power Girl]], who became the [[U.S.S.R.]]'s secret weapon, and [[Superman]], that he considered a failure. &lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics Bombshells'' #28&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, Hugo Strange captured Supergirl and [[Steve Trevor]]. With Supergirl as a guinea pig, Hugo Strange intended to create a perfect army to purge the world. During the tests, Supergirl was able to turn Power Girl against Hugo Strange, and [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]] and [[Lois Lane]], who had found the laboratory thanks to Killer Frost, blew up the laboratory's security system. Hugo Strange attempted to stop Reaper, Lois Lane, Steve Trevor, Power Girl and Supergirl using his remaining clones. However, they were able to leave the place without a fight, taking Superman with them. &lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics Bombshells'' #29&lt;/ref&gt;

After tranquilizing the test subject, Hugo Strange gave them the research on the weaponized blood and a sample that he secretly kept from the Court of Owls in exchange that they do not arrest him and cause the Court of Owls to go ahead with their plans early.

{{main|DC Animated Universe}}
* Hugo Strange appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:
** Hugo Strange is introduced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Ray Buktenica]]. This version is a psychiatrist that runs a rest hospital that he uses to blackmail [[Gotham City]]'s elite with secrets via a machine that reads minds. In the episode "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne", Bruce Wayne goes to the hospital and undergoes the "treatment" which allows Strange to discover Bruce's double life as Batman. He then [[auction]]s off this information to a trio of Gotham's top crime bosses: the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Two-Face]] and the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. After the villains simply pool their money and pay Strange rather than competing, [[Batman]] manages to switch the video with the Dark Knight's identity with a manufactured one which shows Strange boasting about his plan to scam the villains by giving them a fake identity for Batman. In an attempt to save himself, Strange blurts out that Batman is Wayne and the disbelieving trio then tries to kill him by throwing him out of an airplane. However, Batman saves him at the last minute and had [[Dick Grayson]] (disguised as Bruce Wayne) show up at the crime scene to discredit Strange's claims of knowing Batman's secret identity as Strange is then taken into police custody.
** Hugo Strange is seen in a non-voiced [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode "The Doomsday Sanction", he is now a member of [[Project Cadmus]] seated at a table within Cadmus' headquarters with no lines. It is possible that Strange is the one who provides [[Amanda Waller]] with [[Batman]]'s real identity. Producer/writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] confirmed that the character's appearance was intended to set up for the episode "Question Authority" during a [[torture]] scene to pull information from the [[Question (comics)|Question]]'s mind. But due to the production of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', [[Warner Brothers]] withheld most Batman characters and Strange is replaced in Cadmus by [[Doctor Moon]].
* Hugo Strange appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Frank Gorshin]] and later by [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]]. In this series, he is the chief psychologist at Arkham Asylum. Strange appears briefly in the episode "Meltdown" and as a primary character in the episode "Strange Minds". Strange is portrayed as being far more fascinated with the deranged criminals at Arkham Asylum and how their minds work than actually finding a cure for their madness, on more than one occasion provoking them to cause more mayhem. In this interpretation, he is a master [[chemistry|chemist]], programmer and skilled at [[robotics]]. In the episode "Fistful of Felt", Strange cures the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]] of his [[multiple personality disorder]] only to turn him again into a criminal. Despite his insistence that it was simply a test to see if he is truly cured, Batman warns Strange that he will be watching him. In the episode "Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind", he does in fact design a robotic villain called D.A.V.E. to hunt down Batman. He pulls a gun out at Batman, thus sealing his reputation as a villain. He is currently incarcerated in Arkham, having been ironically dubbed insane by his former colleagues. In the episode "Strange New World", Strange (from his cell in Arkham) infects Batman and Robin with a toxin claiming it to be an [[antidote]]. Under the drug's influence, the Dynamic Duo hallucinate that they are being pursued by [[zombie]]s. Hugo claims that he has distributed a chemical throughout town, making everyone into zombies that obey his every command. This is later revealed to be a lie, concocted in order to trick Batman into spreading the real chemical. Robin is cured about halfway through the episode. Batman realizes the truth at the last moment and allows [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] to cure him. Even later in the same season, Strange appears as one of the many supervillains held hostage by the vigilante Rumor. As Rumor moves to the machine he would use to execute all criminals at once, Strange asks him about his motivation. Rumor replies that he wants to kill them all in retaliation for an attack by the Joker that crippled his boss. Strange laughs and tells him that the scheme is in fact motivated by his guilt over his failure to protect his boss rather than any sense of altruism or desire to protect Gotham from the captured villains. Strange later appears in the series finale "Lost Heroes", working with The Joining, helping them to capture the [[Justice League]] and extract their powers in return for ultimate knowledge of the universe. When Strange's work was complete, The Joining kept their promise but the massive amount of information (delivered directly into his brain) overloaded his cerebral cortex, leaving him catatonic.
* Hugo Strange appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "In Alfred Pennyworth's The Knights of Tomorrow!", Strange appears with his Monster Men and are defeated by Batman and Catwoman.
* Hugo Strange appears in the series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' voiced by [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Introduced in the episode "Terrors", Hugo is the psychiatrist of [[Belle Reve]] working under warden Amanda Waller. During [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Sr.]]'s breakout attempt, Strange and Waller are trapped in a cell by the escaped inmates. After the breakout is thwarted by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Miss Martian]] then all of the prisoners (sans Riddler) are rounded up and returned to their cells, Hugo ends up becoming the new warden of the prison. In the episode's closing moments, it is revealed that he had been working with Icicle Sr. the entire time as part of a plot to take control of the prison on behalf of the Light ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors).&lt;ref&gt;''Young Justice'', "Terrors"&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Humanity", Strange was seen viewing a surveillance of the team interrogating [[Professor Ivo]] on where [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]]'s hideout is. Hugo even allows Ivo to send a transmission to Morrow (impersonated by [[Red Volcano]] at the time) warning him that Young Justice is heading his way. In the episode "Coldhearted", Batman and Flash visit Strange at Belle Reve where they state that they suspected that [[Captain Cold]], Icicle Sr., [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]], [[Killer Frost]] and [[Mr. Freeze]] were behind the flying ice fortresses that buried the USA in winter. Hugo shows Batman and Flash some security footage stating that the five ice villains have never left their cells. As of the episode "Usual Suspects", his role in helping prisoners escape is known by the JLA and he is not seen again, meaning he is either on the run or has been captured in the five-year break between seasons one and two.
* Hugo Strange appears in a short animated film created by [[Bruce Timm]] in honor of Batman's 75th anniversary titled ''[[Batman: Strange Days]]'', voiced by [[Brian George]]. Strange has one of his Monster Men kidnap a woman to use her blood for an experiment, but Batman fires tear gas on them. Strange takes the woman hostage, but Strange falls off a cliff when he backs away from Batman unto unstable ground. The woman asks if it is over to which Batman replies "For now", casting ambiguity on Strange's fate.

===Film===
* Hugo Strange appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. He is one of several villains allied with the Joker.
* Hugo Strange appears in ''[[Batman vs. Two-Face]]'' which is the second animated film based on the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' TV series]]. Strange (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) did not previously appear in any of the episodes of the original 1966 show, making this his debut in that universe. 
* Hugo Strange (voiced by [[William Salyers]]) appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham by Gaslight (film)|Batman: Gotham by Gaslight]]'' as the director of Arkham Asylum. Strange shows a deep fascination with the concepts of masks and alternate identities, which draws him to both Batman and [[Jack the Ripper]]. He approaches Bruce Wayne at Sister Leslie’s funeral and offers his insight on the Ripper’s identity, hinting at the possibility that he has also deduced Bruce’s identity as Batman. Later in his office at Arkham, Strange is approached by who he thinks is Batman, but is instead Jack the Ripper. The Ripper then kills Strange by throwing him into a pit full of deranged Arkham patients, allowing them to rip him to pieces.

* Hugo Strange appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. According to [[Rocksteady Studios]], this is the first time Batman has faced him in this continuity.&lt;ref&gt;http://au.ign.com/articles/2011/02/14/batman-arkham-city-gotham-on-lockdown&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Hugo Strange, who has a shady past involving controversial experiments with [[Behavior modification|behavior control]], brainwashed Warden Quincy Sharp into becoming his puppet during his time at the Asylum. After the events of ''Arkham Asylum'', Strange has Sharp run for mayor to obtain almost unlimited influence over the city. Soon, Sharp was elected, and Strange ordered him to propose a project called "Arkham City", a city sized detention facility where criminals were allowed to run rampant. Once the project is authorized, Strange is appointed warden of the facility. It is revealed that he also brainwashed and manipulated ex-military contractors, known as TYGER Guards, into serving him by using technology created by the Mad Hatter. He continues his unethical research, disposing of anybody who attempts to uncover the truth by committing them to Arkham City. The game opens with Strange capturing Bruce Wayne (whom he knows is Batman's alter ego), and throwing him into Arkham City to die. During a conversation between the two, Strange claims that an operation code-named "Protocol 10" will mark Batman's failure and make him famous. Near the end of the game, "Protocol 10" is revealed to be the wholesale extermination of Arkham's criminal populace after their professional interest to Strange has expired. He accomplishes this by letting inmates "steal" Tyger weapons and convincing city hall that the inmates have taken control of Arkham City and that "Protocol 10" was the only way to stop them. When his private security force massacres hundreds of inmates with a barrage of air to surface missile strikes, Batman steals the codes for Strange's security from an attack chopper and breaches Wonder Tower, Strange's headquarters. Breaking through many TYGER Guards, Batman eventually reaches Strange and forcibly deactivates the operation. As Batman confronts him, Strange is stabbed in the back, both literally and figuratively, by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who is revealed to be the benefactor and true mastermind of Strange's operation. While Batman argues with Ra's al Ghul over his plan, Strange's last act before succumbing to his wounds is activating '''Protocol 11''', a self-destruct sequence for his command tower. Batman pushes Ra's al Ghul out the window leaving Strange inside as the tower explodes. Inmates can later be heard talking about Strange's sinister plan and how they are glad he is dead, one inmate even noting that Strange is "spread" all over Arkham City.

'''Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Federal Republic|GCFR]]}}  (born 17 August 1941), is a retired [[Nigerian Army]] [[Four star rank|General]] who was [[List of Presidents of Nigeria|President]] of [[Nigeria]] from 27 August 1985 to 26 August 1993. He previously served as the chief of army staff from January 1984 to August 1985. Babangida was a key player in most of the [[military coups in Nigeria]] (July 1966, February 1976, December 1983, August 1985, December 1985 and April 1990).

==Early life==
Ibrahim Babangida was born on 17 August 1941, in [[Minna]], [[Niger State]], to his father Muhammad Babangida and mother Aisha Babangida.&lt;ref name="Babangida Encyclopedia"/&gt;  

From 1950 to 1956, Ibrahim Babanginda attended primary school. From 1957 to 1962 Babangida was educated at the Government college, Bida, Niger state, Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Agbese-1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agbese|first1=Dan|title=Ibrahim Babangida: The Military, Power and Politics|publisher=Adonis &amp; Abbey Publishers|date= 2012|isbn=9781906704964|pages=19–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Babangida joined the [[Nigerian Army]] on 10 December 1962, when he attended the [[Nigerian Military Training College]] (NMTC) in Kaduna. Babangida received his commission as a [[Second Lieutenant|2nd Lieutenant]] as a regular combatant officer in the [[Nigeria Regiment|Royal Nigerian Army]] (a month before it became the [[Nigerian Army]]) with the personal army number N/438 from the [[Indian Military Academy]] on 26 September 1963.&lt;ref name=Agbese&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agbese|first1=|title=Ibrahim Babangida|publisher=|date= 2012|isbn=|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babangida and General [[Mohammed Magoro]] were among the first batch of Nigerian graduates from the NMTC who attended the Indian Military Academy from April to September 1963. Others in subsequent batches from Babangida's NMTC class include [[Garba Duba]] and Ibrahim Sauda.&lt;ref name=Agbese /&gt; Babangida furthered his armoury training from January 1966 until April 1966 by enrolling in Course 38 of the Young Officers' Course (ARMED) in the United Kingdom where he received a four-month course in Saladin and gunnery.&lt;ref name=Agbese-2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agbese|first1=|title=Ibrahim Babangida|publisher=|date=2012|isbn=|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 1972 to June 1973, he took the Advanced Armoured Officers' course at Armored school. He attended the Senior officers' course, [[Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji]], from January 1977 until July 1977 and the Senior International Defence Management Course, Naval Postgraduate school, U.S., in 1980.

He was heavily involved in quelling the Nigerian coup of 1976, when he was to ‘liberate’ a radio station from one of the coup plotters, Col [[Buka Suka Dimka]] (a close friend of his), to prevent him making further announcements over the air waves. Although he did prevent further broadcasts, Col Dimka managed to escape.

He attained the following ranks: [[Second Lieutenant]] (1963), [[Lieutenant]] (1966), [[Captain (land)|Captain]] (1968), [[Major]] (1970), [[Lieutenant Colonel]] (1970), [[Colonel]] (1973), [[Brigadier]] (1979), [[Major General]] (1983), and [[General officer|General]] (1987). Babangida also served as a member of the [[Supreme Military Council (Nigeria)|Supreme Military Council]] from 1 August 1975 to October 1979.

==Participation in the Nigerian counter-coup of July 1966==
Babangida, then a lieutenant with the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron in Kaduna, was one of the many officers of northern Nigerian origin who staged what became known as the [[Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966]]&lt;ref name=Siollun&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siollun|first1=Max|title=Oil, Politics and Violence: Nigeria's Military Coup Culture (1966 - 1976)|publisher=Algora|isbn=9780875867090|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the death of Nigeria's first military Head of State, General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] (who had taken power in [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|another coup earlier that year]]), and his replacement with General [[Yakubu Gowon]].

==1985 Coup, overthrow of Buhari's regime==
Babangida was the Chief of Army Staff and a member of the [[Supreme_Military_Council_of_Nigeria_(1983–1985)|Supreme Military Council]] (SMC) under the administration of Major General [[Muhammadu Buhari]]. Babangida would later overthrow Buhari's regime on 27 August 1985 in a military coup that relied on mid-level officers that Babangida had strategically positioned over the years.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency (1985-93)==
[[File:Nigerian-Presidential-Seal1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seal of the President of Nigeria|Seal of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria]] ]]

===Oil Revenue===
With the oil revenue, Babangida created the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. He created eleven state governments and several local government councils. He had the Toja Bridge in Kebbi constructed. He also created the Jibia Water Treatment Plant and the [[Challawa Gorge Dam|Challawa Cenga Dam]] in Kano. In 1992, constituted the Oil Mineral Producing Area Development Commission. Babangida also increased the share of oil royalties and rents to state of origin from 1.5 to 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPREMNET/Resources/489960-1338997241035/Growth_Commission_Vol3_Leadership_Growth_Ch6_Leadership_Policy_Making_Economic_Growth_African_Countries_Case_Nigeria.pdf |title=Leadership, Policy Making,   and Economic Growth in African Countries: The Case of Nigeria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OIC membership===
In January 1986, Nigeria joined the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) as its 46th member. The OIC was established in 1969. The chief of staff supreme headquarters, Commodore [[Ebitu Ukiwe|Ebitu Okoh Ukiwe]], was removed and replaced from his post as chief of staff supreme headquarters by Babangida, because Ukiwe was opposed to the registration of Nigeria, a secular country, in the OIC.&lt;ref name=AllAfrica&gt;

''Vanguard'', 
14 December 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The creation of eleven states ===
On 23 September 1987, Babangida created two states: Akwa Ibom and Katsina. On 27 August 1991, Babangida created nine more states: Abia, Enugu, Delta, Jigawa, Kebbi, Osun, Kogi, Taraba and Yobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oldnaija.com/2015/07/26/how-nigeria-got-to-36-statestimeline-of-state-creation-in-nigeria/ |title=How Nigeria got to 36 States (Timeline of State creation in Nigeria) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing the total number of [[States of Nigeria|states in Nigeria]] to thirty in 1991.

===Economic policies===
Babangida issued a referendum to garner support for austerity measures suggested by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]], and subsequently launched his "[[Structural Adjustment Program]]" (SAP) in 1986. The policies involved in the SAP were: 
*[[deregulation]] of the agricultural sector to include abolition of marketing boards and elimination of [[price controls]]
*[[privatisation]] of [[state-owned enterprise|public enterprises]]
*[[devaluation]] of the [[Nigerian naira]] to improve the competitiveness of the [[export]] sector
*relaxation of restraints on foreign investment put in place by the [[Yakubu Gowon|Gowon]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo|Obasanjo]] governments during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=prebendalism /&gt;

Between 1986 and 1988, these policies were executed as intended by the IMF, and the [[Economy of Nigeria|Nigerian economy]] actually did grow as had been hoped, with the export sector performing especially well. But falling [[real wages]] in the public sector and among the urban classes, along with a drastic reduction in [[expenditure]] on public services, set off waves of rioting and other manifestations of discontent that made sustained commitment to the SAP difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=prebendalism /&gt;

Babangida subsequently returned to an [[inflationary]] [[economic policy]] and partially reversed the deregulatory initiatives he had set in motion during the heyday of the SAP following mounting political pressure, and economic growth slowed correspondingly, as [[capital flight]] resumed apace under the influence of negative [[real interest rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990 Major Orkar failed coup===
On 22 April 1990, Babangida's government was almost toppled by a failed coup led by Major [[Gideon Orkar]]. Babangida was at the [[Dodan Barracks]], the military headquarters and presidential residence, when they were attacked and occupied by the rebel troops, but managed to escape by a back route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawodu.com/omoigui8.htm |title=The Orkar Coup of April 22, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orkar and 41 of his conspirators were countered, captured by government troops. They were convicted of treason.&lt;ref name=Omoigui&gt;{{cite web|last1=Omoigui|first1=Nowa|title=The Orkar Failed Coup of April 22, 1990  Part 2|url=http://www.waado.org/nigerdelta/nigeria_facts/MilitaryRule/Omoigui/OrkarCoup1990-PartTwo.html|website=Urhobo Historical Society|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 1990, they were executed by firing squad.

===Relocation of the federal government to Abuja in 1991===
On 12 December 1991, President Babangida relocated the seat of the federal government from Lagos to Abuja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.ncl.ac.uk/forum/v6i1/ikoku.pdf |title=The City as Public Space: Abuja - the Capital City of Nigeria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation of 1993 general election===
In 1989, Babangida legalized the formation of political parties, and after a [[census]] was carried out in November 1991, the [ National Electoral Commission]] (NEC) announced on 24 January 1992 that both legislative elections to a bicameral National Assembly and a presidential election would be held later that year. A process of voting was adopted, referred to as Option A4. This process advocated that any candidate needed to pass through adoption from the local level to any height of governance.

Babangida had formed two political parties, namely the SDP (Social Democratic Party) and NRC (National Republican Convention) for the elections. He urged all Nigerians to join either of the parties, which the late Chief [[Bola Ige]] famously referred to as "two leper hands." The two-party state had been a recommendation of the 17-member Political Bureau.

The legislative elections went ahead as planned, with the [[Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) winning majorities in both houses of the [[National Assembly of Nigeria|National Assembly]], but on 7 August 1992, the INEC annulled the first round of presidential primaries, alleging widespread irregularities. On 4 January 1993, Babangida announced a National Defense and Security Council (NDSC), of which he was president, while in April 1993, the SDP nominated [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola]] (MKO) as its presidential candidate, with the [[National Republican Convention]] (NRC) choosing [[Bashir Tofa]] to run for the same position. On 12 June 1993, a presidential election was finally held, but no results were ever announced, because Babangida annulled the elections. It was however unofficially announced in some states that Abiola had won 19 of the 30 [[States of Nigeria|states]]. That Abiola had unofficially won the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  Campbell| first=Ian|title="Nigeria's Failed Transition: The 1993 Presidential Election"|publisher=Journal of Contemporary African Studies |year=1994|pages=179-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights ===
The killing by a letter bomb of [[Dele Giwa]], a magazine editor critical of Babangida's administration, at his Lagos home in 1986 was allegedly attributed to Babangida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Human Rights Investigation Violation Investigation Commission of Nigeria (HRVIC)|title=HRVIC Report Volume Four - Case-by-Case Records of Public Hearings|url=http://www.nigerianmuse.com/nigeriawatch/oputa/OputaVolumeFour.pdf|website=NigerianMuse|accessdate=1 April 2015|pages=103–106|format=PDF|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a controversial incident to this day. In 1999, President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] established the Human Rights Violation Investigation Commission headed by Justice Chukwudifu Oputa to investigate [[human rights abuses]] during Nigeria's decades of military rule. However, Babangida repeatedly defied summons to appear before the panel to answer allegations of humans rights abuses and questioned both the legality of the commission and its power to summon him. He was however represented by counsels, Mustapha Bashir Wali and Yahya Mahmoud. His right not to testify was upheld in 2001 by Nigeria's court of appeal which ruled that the panel did not have the power to summon former rulers of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1632714.stm|title=Generals evade Nigeria rights panel|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oputa Panel Report would conclude that: "On General Ibrahim Babangida, we are of the view that there is evidence to suggest that he and the two security chiefs, Brigadier General [[Halilu Akilu]] and Col. A. K. Togun are accountable for the untimely death of Dele Giwa by letter bomb. We recommend that this case be re-opened for further investigation in the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawodu.com/oputa1.pdf|title=Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations|publisher=Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission (Nigeria)|date=May 2002|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential aspirations and campaigns==

===2007 campaign===
In an interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on 15 August 2006, Babangida announced that he would run for president in Nigeria's 2007 national elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/86219712-2caf-11db-9845-0000779e2340.html|title=Former military ruler of Nigeria seeks presidency|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=15 August 2006|last=Mahtani|first=Dino}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1163401560343R131 "Nigeria's 'evil genius' enters election race"], ''IOL''.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was doing so "under the banner of the Nigerian people" and accused the country's political elite of fuelling Nigeria's current ethnic and religious violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4797395.stm|title=Babangida to contest Nigeria poll|date=15 August 2006|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2006, General Babangida picked up a nomination form from the Peoples Democratic Party Headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. This effectively put to rest any speculation about his ambitions to run for the Presidency. His form was personally issued to him by the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]] chairman, [[Ahmadu Ali]]. This action immediately drew extreme reactions of support or opposition from the western population of the country. In early December, just before the PDP presidential primary, however, it was widely reported in Nigerian newspapers that IBB had withdrawn his candidacy to be the PDP's nominee to run for president. In a letter excerpted in the media, IBB is quoted as citing the "moral dilemma" of running against [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], the younger brother of the late [[Shehu Yar'Adua]] (himself a former nominee to run for the Presidency during IBB's military regime), as well as against General [[Aliyu Mohammed Gusau]], given IBB's close relationship with the latter two. It is widely believed that his chances of winning were slim.&lt;ref&gt;Ologbondiyan, Kola, Sufuyan Ojeifo and Oke Epia, "IBB: I Withdraw for Gusau, Yar`Adua"], ''This Day'', 12 December 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6169715.stm "Blow to Babangida's Nigeria bid"], BBC News (11 December 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 campaign===
On 15 September 2010, Babangida officially declared his intention to run for the presidency in the general election at the Eagles Square in Abuja, Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beegeagle.wordpress.com/2010/09/15/2011-polls-nigerias-former-military-rulergeneral-babangida-declares-his-interest/|title=IBB Formally Declares to Contest for President }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Babangida later withdrew his nomination for the presidency, due to lack of support from party members. President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] was chosen by the PDP party to run for the 2011 general election.

==Personal life==
Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida was married to Maryam (née King) Babangida (deceased) (First Lady of Nigeria 1985–93). They had four children together: Muhammadu, Aminu, Aishatu, and Halimatu.&lt;ref name="Babangida Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibrahim Babangida 1941–  Nigerian president and military officer|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2870600010.html|publisher=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryam Babangida died from complications of ovarian cancer on 27 December 2009.

'''Jan Fredrik Wiborg''' (9 October 1944 &amp;ndash; 21 June 1994) was a Norwegian civil engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/saker/dokumenter/2000-2001/dok18-01.pdf |title=Rapport til Stortinget / Hvem var Jan Fredrik Wiborg? |publisher=The [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102230742/http://www.stortinget.no/saker/dokumenter/2000-2001/dok18-01.pdf |archivedate= 2 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, he criticised plans for building [[Oslo]]'s new airport at [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Gardermoen]]. The [[Parliament of Norway]] had originally decided to build the new airport at [[Hurumlandet]], but weather surveys claimed this location would only be operable 80% of the time. Wiborg claimed the information was falsified&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/overbevist-om-at-varsleren-jan-wiborg-ble-drept/a/23280178/ Overbevist om at varsleren Jan Wiborg ble drept] [Convinced that the whistleblower Jan Wiborg was killed]&lt;/ref&gt; and that parliament were deliberately misled by government officials.

Wiborg died on 21 June 1994 after falling from a hotel window in Copenhagen, and crucial documents about the case disappeared. Circumstances about his death was never fully cleared. Journalists from the newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' were awarded the prestigious [[SKUP prize]] in 1999 for their investigation of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ij.no/skup/skupprisen/skup99utt.htm#wiborg_vaerrapporten |title=SKUP Prize 1999 |author=The [[Norwegian Institute of Journalism]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=25 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324045258/http://www.ij.no/skup/skupprisen/skup99utt.htm#wiborg_vaerrapporten |archivedate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skup.no/Metoderapporter/1999/1999Gardermoen.htm |title=Wiborg and the Gardermoen weather report |author=Pål Enghaug |language=Norwegian |accessdate=25 February 2007 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806082916/http://www.skup.no/Metoderapporter/1999/1999Gardermoen.htm |archivedate=6 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the parliamentary [[Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs]] held a public hearing about the alleged foul play during the airport planning process. An official report was released in 2001.&lt;ref name=whistle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whistleblowers.dk/live/uk_gardermoen.php |title=The political plotting of an airport |author=whistleblowers.dk |accessdate=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg13587.html |title=Norwegian airport probe says court of impeachment must be considered |author=[[California Aviation Alliance]] |accessdate=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Jacques Dessalines''' ([[Haitian Creole]]: Jan-Jak Desalin; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ʒak dɛsalin}}; 20 September 1758 – 17 October 1806) was a leader of the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the first ruler of an independent [[Haiti]] under the 1805 constitution. Initially regarded as governor-general, Dessalines was later named Emperor '''Jacques I of Haiti''' (1804–1806) by the Generals of the Haitian Revolution Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/01/30/97/00002/GPCH_1804_11_22.pdf

Dessalines served as an officer in the [[French army]], when the colony was fending off Spanish and British incursions. Later he rose to become a commander in the revolt against France. As [[Toussaint Louverture]]'s principal lieutenant, he led many successful engagements, including the [[Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot]].

After the betrayal and capture of Toussaint Louverture in 1802, Dessalines became the leader of the revolution. He defeated a French army at the [[Battle of Vertières]] in 1803. Declaring Haiti an independent nation in 1804, Dessalines was chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of governor-general. He ordered the [[1804 Haiti massacre]] of French settlers in Haiti, resulting in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people, but declared that all other whites such as the [[Polish Haitians]] could remain in the new country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Philippe R. Girard (2011). ''The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence 1801–1804''. [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]: [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8173-1732-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1804, he  was proclaimed emperor by the Generals of the Haitian Revolution Army and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Fsmitha.com|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h34-np2.html|title=Slave Revolt in St. Domingue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Jean-Jacques Duclos was born into slavery on Cormier, a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] near [[Grande-Riviere-du-Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educando.edu.do/articulos/estudiante/jean-jacques-dessalines/ "Jean Jacques Dessalines"], Educando, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His father had adopted the surname from his owner Henri Duclose. The identity of Jean-Jacques' parents, as well as his region of ancestral origin in Africa, are not known, but most slaves trafficked to Haiti came from west and central West Africa.

Dessalines had two brothers, Louis and Joseph Duclos, who also later took the name Dessalines. The first was the father of [[Maréchal de Camp]] Monsieur Raymond Dessalines, created 1st [[Baron]] de Louis Dessalines on 8 April 1811, [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Henri Christophe|King Henry I]], [[privy council]]or, [[secretary-general]] of the [[Ministry of War]] between 1811 and 1820 and member of the Royal Chamber of Public Instruction between 1818 and 1820, who received the degree of [[Knight]] of the Order of St. Henry on 1 May 1811. He was killed by the revolutionaries at [[Cap-Henri]] on 10 October 1820. The second was the father of Maréchal de Camp Monsieur Dessalines, created 1st Baron de Joseph Dessalines in 1816, [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] to Prince Jacques-Victor Henry, the Prince Royal of Haiti, and [[major]] of the Grenadiers de la Garde, who received the degree of Knight of the Order of St. Henry on 28 October 1815.

Working in the [[sugarcane]] fields as a laborer, Dessalines rose to the rank of ''commandeur'', or foreman. He worked on Duclos's plantation until he was about 30 years old. The slave Jean-Jacques was bought by a free black man named Dessalines, who assigned his own surname to him. From then on he was called Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Dessalines kept this name in freedom.  He worked for that master for about three years, until the slave uprising of 1791, which spread across the Plaine du Nord.

Dessalines became increasingly embittered toward both the whites and ''[[gens de couleur]] libres'' (the mixed-race residents of Saint-Domingue) during the years of fighting the revolution against residents and foreign troops: French, British and Spanish. After the defeat of French royalists during the Haitian Revolution, he ordered the killing of all royalists to ensure that Saint-Domingue would be a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Revolution ==

In 1791, Jean-Jacques Dessalines joined the slave rebellion of the northern plains led by [[Jean François Papillon]] and [[Georges Biassou]]. This rebellion was the first action of what would become the Haitian Revolution. Dessalines became a lieutenant in Papillon's army and followed him to Santo Domingo, where he enlisted to serve Spain's military forces against the French colony of Saint-Domingue.

It was then that Dessalines met the rising military commander Toussaint Bréda (later known as [[Toussaint Louverture]]), a mature man also born into slavery, who was fighting with Spanish forces on Hispaniola. These men wanted above all to defeat slavery. In 1794, after the French declared an end to slavery, Toussaint Louverture switched allegiances to the French. He fought for the French Republic against both the Spanish and British. Dessalines followed, becoming a chief lieutenant to Toussaint Louverture and rising to the rank of brigadier general by 1799.

Dessalines commanded many successful engagements, including the captures of [[Jacmel]], [[Petit-Goâve]], [[Miragoâne]] and [[Anse-à-Veau]]. In 1801, Dessalines quickly ended an insurrection in the north led by Louverture's own nephew, General Moyse. Dessalines gained a reputation for his "take no prisoners" policy, and for burning homes and entire villages to the ground.

The rebellious slaves were able to restore most of Saint-Domingue to France, with Louverture in control and finally appointed by the French as governor general of the colony. Louverture wanted Saint-Domingue to have more autonomy. He directed the creation of a new constitution to establish that, as well as rules for how the colony would operate under freedom. He also named himself governor-for-life, while still swearing his loyalty to France.

The French government had been through changes and was led by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]], whose wife, [[Josephine de Beauharnais]] was part of a slave-owning family. Many white and mulatto planters had been lobbying the government to reimpose slavery in Saint-Domingue. The French responded by dispatching an expeditionary force to restore French rule to the island, an army and ships led by General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]]. Louverture and Dessalines fought against the invading French forces, with Dessalines defeating them at the battle for which he is most famous, [[Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot|Crête-à-Pierrot]].

During the 11 March 1802 battle, Dessalines and his 1,300 men defended a small fort against 18,000 attackers. To motivate his troops at the start of the battle, he waved a lit torch near an open powder keg and declared that he would blow the fort up should the French break through.&lt;ref name=LAS&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]|title=Jean Jacques Dessalines|author=Simmonds, Yussuf J.|date=February 11, 2010|url=https://lasentinel.net/jean-jacques-dessalines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking army, but after a 20-day siege they were forced to abandon the fort due to a shortage of food and munitions. Nonetheless, the rebels were able to force their way through the enemy lines and into the Cahos Mountains, with their army still largely intact.&lt;ref name=LAS/&gt;

The French soldiers under Leclerc were accompanied by [[mulatto]] troops led by gens de couleur [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[André Rigaud]] from Saint-Domingue. Pétion and Rigaud, both sons of wealthy with white fathers, had opposed Louverture's leadership. They had tried to establish separate independence in the South of Saint-Domingue, an area where wealthy ''[[gens de couleur]]'' were concentrated in plantations. Toussaint Louverture's forces had defeated them three years earlier.

After the [[Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot]], Dessalines defected from his long-time ally Louverture and briefly sided with Leclerc, Pétion, and Rigaud. Dessalines was at least partially responsible for Louverture's arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture's own son Isaac.  On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines "learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately
wrote Leclerc to denounce Louverture’s conduct as “extraordinary.”". For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Girard|first1=Philippe R.|title=Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2012|volume=69|issue=3|page=559|url=http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Girard2012|publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|quote=a list of “extraordinary expenses incurred by general Brunet in regards to [the arrest of] Toussaint” started with “gifts in wine and liquor, gifts to Dessalines and his spouse, money to his officers: 4000 francs.”|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0549|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125421/http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became clear that the French intended to re-establish slavery on Saint-Domingue, as they had on Guadeloupe, Dessalines and Pétion switched sides again in October 1802, to oppose the French. By November 1802, Dessalines had become the leader of the alliance [light skinned free coloreds] with the blessing of the most prominent of free coloreds, mulatto general Alexandre Pétion.&lt;ref&gt;Trouillot, Michel-Rolph. Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History. Boston, Mass: Beacon Press, 1995. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; Leclerc died of yellow fever, which also took many French troops.

The brutal tactics of Leclerc's successor, [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], helped to unify rebel forces against the French. Dessalines, the leader of the Revolution after Toussaint's capture on 7 June 1802, commanded the rebel forces against a French army weakened by a [[yellow fever]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Trouillot, Michel-Rolph. Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History. Boston, Mass: Beacon Press, 1995. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; His forces achieved a series of victories against the French, culminating in the last major battle of the revolution, the [[Battle of Vertières]]. On 18 November 1803, black and mulatto forces under Dessalines and Pétion attacked the fort of Vertières, held by Rochambeau, near [[Cap-Français]] in the north. Rochambeau and his troops surrendered the next day. On 4 December 1803, the French colonial army of Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered its last remaining territory to Dessalines' forces. This officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history which successfully resulted in establishing an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/httoc.html#ht0013 |title=Chapter 6 – Haiti: Historical Setting |publisher=Library of Congress |work=Country Studies |accessdate=18 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dessalines then promulgated the Declaration of Independence in 1804, and declared himself emperor.&lt;ref&gt;William Alexander MacCorkle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ntoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Haiti&amp;as_brr=4&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Monroe doctrine in its relation to the republic of Haiti], Neale Publishing Company, 1915, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emperor ==
On 1 January 1804, from the city of [[Gonaïves]], Dessalines officially declared the former colony's independence and renamed it "''Ayiti''" after the indigenous [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name. He had served as Governor-General of Saint-Domingue since 30 November 1803. After the declaration of independence, Dessalines named himself Governor-General-for-life of Haiti and served in that role until 22 September 1804, when he was proclaimed later [[Emperor of Haiti]] by the Generals of the Haitian Revolution Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/01/30/97/00002/GPCH_1804_11_22.pdf

 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was crowned Emperor Jacques I in a [[coronation]] ceremony on 6 October in the city of [[Le Cap]]. On 20 May 1805, his government released the Imperial Constitution, naming Jean-Jacques Dessalines emperor for life with the right to name his successor.

Dessalines tried hard to keep the [[sugar]] industry and [[plantation]]s running and producing without slavery. Born into slavery and having worked under white masters for 30 years, as well as having seen many atrocities by all peoples, Dessalines did not trust the white French people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/earlyhaiti/dessalines.htm "A Brief History of Dessalines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228150910/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/earlyhaiti/dessalines.htm |date=28 December 2005 }}, from 1825 ''Missionary Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; Between February and April 1804, he had the white Haitian minority killed by ordering the [[1804 Haiti Massacre]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Dessalines declared Haiti an all-black nation and forbade whites from owning property or land there.

The French meanwhile had fled to the Spanish side of the island and had holed themselves up in Santo Domingo.  Dessalines and Christophe went after them at the head of 20,000 men.  The Spanish side was a colony of fewer than 175,000 souls. The French force numbered perhaps 500 and the local colonial militia had no more than 1000 men.  The armed Haitian juggernaut advanced sweeping everything in its path. In the town of Moca, one of the places that fell to Christophe, 40 children were beheaded; altogether more than 600–6000 perished or were taken away in captivity as spoils of war, according to the eyewitness Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo.

Dessalines enforced a harsh regimen of plantation labor, described by the historian [[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] as ''caporalisme agraire'' (agrarian militarism). As had Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines demanded that all blacks work either as soldiers to defend the nation or as laborers on the plantations to raise crops and help sustain the nation. His forces were strict in enforcing this, to the extent that some blacks felt as if they were again enslaved.

Dessalines believed in the tight regulation of foreign trade, which was essential for Haiti's sugar and [[coffee]] based export economy. Like Toussaint L'Ouverture, Dessalines encouraged merchants from Britain and the United States over those from France. For his administration, Dessalines needed literate and educated officials and managers. He placed in these positions well-educated Haitians, who were disproportionately from the mulatto elite, as ''gens de couleur'' were most likely to have been educated.

===Mass killings===

Jean-Jacques Dessalines is known for the ordering of the execution of all French people on the island. This systematic [[genocide]] is known as the [[1804 Haiti massacre]]. The massacre, which took place in the entire territory of Haiti, was carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804, and resulted in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people of all ages and genders.{{sfn|Girard|2011|pp=319–322}}

== Death ==

Disaffected members of Dessalines' administration, including [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[Henri Christophe]], began a conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor. Dessalines was assassinated north of the capital city, [[Port-au-Prince]], at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge), on 17 October 1806, on his way to fight the rebels. The exact circumstances of his death are uncertain. Some historians claim that he was actually killed at Pétion's house at Rue l'Enterrement, after a meeting to negotiate the power and the future of the young nation. Some reports say that he was arrested and was dealt a deadly blow to the head.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Corbet, "A Brief History of Dessalines". From ''American Missionary Register'' (October 1825, Vol. VI, No. 10, pp. 292–297).&lt;/ref&gt; Another report says he was ambushed and killed at first fire.&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Wells Brown, "The Rising Son". "Chapter XVI of ''The Rising Son the Antecedents and Advancement of the Colored Race 1874'' (1874).&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another account recalls a brutal attack on him by his men. It says he was shot at twice and hit once. Then, his head was split open by a sabre's blow and he was finally stabbed three times with a dagger, with the crowd shouting "the tyrant is killed".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madiou, “Histoire of Haiti”, Henri Dechamps, t.3,( Port-au-Prince, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The mob desecrated and disfigured his remains, which were abandoned on Government Square.&lt;ref&gt;David Patrick Geggus, ''The World Of the Haitian Revolution'', Indiana University Press, 2009, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lot of resistance to providing him with a proper burial; but, Défilée ([[Dédée Bazile]]), a black woman from a humble background, took the mutilated body of the Emperor and buried it. A monument at the northern entrance of the Haitian capital marks the place where the Emperor was killed.

== Legacy ==
In 1804, the city of Marchand was renamed to [[Dessalines]] in his honor.

Shortly after his death, many men on the island changed their last names from their slave names to "Jean-Jacques" in honor of Dessalines. Some historians believe these men were soldiers of Dessalines.

For the remainder of the 19th century, Dessalines was generally reviled by generations of Haitians for his autocratic ways. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, Dessalines began to be reassessed as an icon of Haitian nationalism. The [[national anthem]] of Haiti, "[[La Dessalinienne]]", written in 1903, is named in his honor.

The Haitian humanitarian organization Fondasyon Félicité (FF), established in 1999 by [[Bayyinah Bello]], is named after Dessalines' spouse [[Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité]].

Dessalines was a great-grandfather of [[Cincinnatus Leconte]], who served as President of Haiti from 1911 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Carmeleau, ''Jean Price-Mars and Haiti'' (Three Continents Press, 1981), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dantès Bellegarde]], ''Histoire de du peuple haïtien, 1492–1952'' (Held, 1953), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1836">'''John Davies''' (11 July 1772 &amp;ndash; 19 August 1855) was a Welsh missionary and school teacher. His family were from the [[Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa]] area of [[Montgomeryshire]]. Having received some education in one of "Madam" [[Bridget Bevan]]'s schools, he decided to set up his own school at [[Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant]]. Whilst attending a local [[Methodism|Methodist]] church he heard of missionary positions in [[Tahiti]], and volunteered to join the work. He and his wife left for the island in May 1800, and remained there for the next 55 years. Davies became superintendent of a school at [[Papara]], established by the [[London Missionary Society]]. He also encouraged the setting up of mission schools in [[Fiji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doug Munro|author2=Andrew Thornley|title=The Covenant Makers: Islander Missionaries in the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoeqNDIEC7YC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1996|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=978-982-02-0126-2|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His published written works include a dictionary and grammar of the [[Tahitian language]], a translation of substantial portions of the New Testament and Psalms, Brown's Catechism, the Westminster Catechism, the Pilgrim's Progress, and a number of smaller works. He also wrote a ''History of the Tahitian Mission, 1799-1830'' (Cambridge, 1962).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27068">{{Anglo-Saxon Kings}}
The [[Mercia|Kingdom of Mercia]] was a state in the [[English Midlands]] from the 6th century to the 10th century. For some two hundred years from the mid-7th century onwards it was the dominant member of the [[Heptarchy]] and consequently the most powerful of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms. During this period its rulers became the first [[English people|English]] monarchs to assume such wide-ranging titles as ''King of Britain'' and ''King of the English''.

Spellings varied widely in this period, even within a single document, and a number of variants exist for the names given below. For example, the sound ''th'' was usually represented with the [[Old English]] letters [[Eth|ð]] or [[Thorn (letter)|þ]].

For the Continental predecessors of the Mercians in [[Angeln]], see [[List of kings of the Angles]]. For their successors see [[List of English monarchs]].

==Kings of the Mercians==
{{further|Iclingas}}
The traditional rulers of Mercia were known as the Iclingas, descendants of the kings of the [[Angles]]. When the Iclingas became extinct in the male line, a number of other families, labelled B, C and W by historians, competed for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Zaluckyj, Sarah &amp; Feryok, Marge. ''Mercia: The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Central England'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-873827-62-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legend|#ffc|Iclingas}}
{{legend|#def|B-dynasty (so-called &amp;ndash; a conjectural grouping based on names alone)}}
{{legend|wheat|C-dynasty (traditionally a branch of the Iclingas, probably instead descended from the [[Wessex|West Saxon]] king [[Cenwalh of Wessex|Cenwalh]] and his Iclinga wife)}}

All the following are [[king]]s, unless specified. Those in ''italics'' are probably legendary, are of dubious authenticity, or may not have reigned.

'''Ludvík Vaculík''' {{IPA-cs|ˈludviːk ˈvatsuˌliːk|}} (23 July 1926 – 6 June 2015) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[writer]] and [[journalist]]. He was born in [[Brumov-Bylnice|Brumov]],  [[Moravian Wallachia]]. A prominent [[samizdat]] writer, he was best known as the author of the "[[The Two Thousand Words|Two Thousand Words]]" [[manifesto]] of June 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/06/world/europe/ap-eu-czech-obit-vaculik.html|title=Czech Writer, Anti-Communist Dissident Ludvik Vaculik Dies|publisher=The New York Times.com|accessdate=June 7, 2015|date=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-1968==
President of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] leader [[Antonín Novotný]] and his fellow conservatives had begun taking a more repressive approach toward intellectuals and writers after the [[Six-Day War]]&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Crampton, ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century – and After'', 2nd ed. (New York: Routledge, 1997), 323.&lt;/ref&gt; of June 1967. The following month, Vaculík, then still a member of the Communist Party, attended the Fourth Congress of the Union of Writers. Others in attendance included communists [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Klíma]], and [[Milan Kundera]], as well as non-Party member [[Václav Havel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans Renner, ''A History of Czechoslovakia since 1945'', trans. Evelien Hurst-Buist (New York: Routledge, 1989), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaculík made an inflammatory speech in which he rejected the leading role of the party as unnecessary and criticized it for its restrictive cultural policies and failure to address social issues.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Eastern Europe, 323"&gt;Crampton, ''Eastern Europe'', 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Havel recalled the mixed response of the fellow writers to Vaculík's remarks: on the one hand, they were "delighted that someone had spoken the truth… but [their] delight was tempered by doubts about whether direct confrontation on the political level would lead anywhere, and by fears that it could stimulate a counterattack by the power center."&lt;ref&gt;Václav Havel, ''Disturbing the Peace: A Conversation with Karel Hvížďala'', trans. Paul Wilson (New York:Knopf, 1990), 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Novotný and his supporters did indeed try to bring the writers' union under their control after the congress, but failed.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Eastern Europe, 323"/&gt; Vaculík's and other writers' speeches at the conference, with their anti-Novotný sentiments, increased the gap between the conservative Novotný supporters and more moderate members of the party leadership,&lt;ref&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; a division that would contribute to Novotný's eventual fall.

==The Prague Spring and the "Two Thousand Words"==
Vaculík was among the most progressive members of the Communist Party and thereby more radical than [[Alexander Dubček]], who had become Party leader in January 1968. Hence, Vaculík and others generally felt that the reforms of the [[Action Programme (1968)|April Action Programme]] were the minimum necessary and that they should be quickly and firmly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of influencing voters in upcoming party congress elections, Vaculík released the manifesto "Two Thousand Words to Workers, Farmers, Scientists, Artists, and Everyone" in several major [[Prague]] newspapers, complete with signatures of other public figures. The date was 27 June 1968, the day after preliminary censorship was abolished by the national assembly.

In the "Two Thousand Words," Vaculík asked that the public "demand the resignation of people who have misused their power" by criticism, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and [[Strike action|strikes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludvík Vaculík, "Two Thousand Words to Workers, Farmers, Scientists, Artists, and Everyone," in ''From Stalinism to Pluralism: A Documentary History of Eastern Europe since 1945'', ed. Gale Stokes (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also expressed concern over the "recent apprehension" regarding the reforms due to "the possibility that foreign forces"—those of the [[Warsaw Treaty Organization]]—"may intervene in Czechoslovakia's internal development."&lt;ref name="Vaculík, Two Thousand Words, 130"&gt;Vaculík, "Two Thousand Words," 130.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to happen, Vaculík argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…the only thing we can do is to hold our own and not indulge in any provocation. We can assure our government—with weapons if need be—as long as it does what we give it a mandate to do.&lt;ref name="Vaculík, Two Thousand Words, 130"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Impact of the "Two Thousand Words"===
Despite the overall moderate tone and [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] orthodoxy,&lt;ref name="Crampton, Eastern Europe, 334"&gt;Crampton, ''Eastern Europe'', 334.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Two Thousand Words" called for action on the part of the public in case of military intervention and therefore denied the leading role of the party, as Vaculík's 1967 speech had. It was popular throughout Czechoslovakia with both intellectuals and workers, and its popularity only increased after the party officially condemned it.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Eastern Europe, 334"/&gt;  It also significantly increased the concerns of the Soviet Union. Following the "Two Thousand Words," [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s party leadership, seeing a situation similar to that in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungary]] developing,&lt;ref&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term "counterrevolution" to describe the [[Prague Spring]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Levy, ''So Many Heroes'', (Sagaponack, NY: Second Chance Press, 1980), 166.&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[counterrevolution]] was taking place (and the Soviet Union was increasingly disposed to categorising the events in Czechoslovakia as such, as other radicals continued to act and Dubček failed to gain their confidence), [[socialism]] as the Soviet Union saw it was threatened and invasion by Warsaw Treaty Organisation troops, as occurred 20–21 August 1968, was deemed justified. This policy of the acceptability of using force wherever socialism was thought to be threatened would become known as the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], and Vaculík's "Two Thousand Words" was an integral step toward this early application of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Vaculík as a dissident==
After [[Gustáv Husák]] came to power in 1969 and censorship increased, Vaculík (now no longer a party member) was part of the circle of [[dissident]] writers in Czechoslovakia. In 1973, he started ''Edice Petlice'' (''Edition Padlock''), a samizdat series that he ran until 1979. Others followed with their own series, despite harassment from the party's secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Hájek, "Traditions of Czech Literature: Curses and Blessings," in ''Czechoslovakia 1918–88: Seventy Years of Independence'', ed. [[H. Gordon Skilling]] (Oxford: Macmillan, 1991), 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Some samizdat authors, including Vaculík, were also published in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Hájek, "Traditions of Czech Literature," 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the samizdat authors eventually developed and signed the foundation document of [[Charter 77]];&lt;ref&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaculík attended the second of the planning meetings in December 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Havel, ''Disturbing the Peace'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 1977, Vaculík, along with Havel and [[Pavel Landovský]], an actor, attempted to take a copy of the charter to the post office to mail to the Czechoslovak government. Their car was pulled over by the Party secret police, and all three were taken in for interrogation. Other signatories were subsequently subjected to interrogations and searches of their homes, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1978, however, Vaculík published the article "Remarks on Courage", a piece that helped set the tone for criticism of charterists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Renner, ''History of Czechoslovakia'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the original signatories, most were from the intelligentsia in Prague and [[Brno]],&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, ''Eastern Europe'', 348.&lt;/ref&gt; and Vaculík and others warned against them becoming so isolated that average citizens could no longer relate to Charter 77. His criticism worked against a [[Mythology#Myths as depictions of historical events|mythologisation]] of the Charter and ensured a continued discussion of its position and role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==After communism==
Vaculík continued to write; the official ban on his works was lifted in late 1989.  He had a weekly column in ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' that featured [[feuilleton]]s addressing various Czech political and cultural issues, just as much of his underground work during Communism had.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Mastalir, ''Ludvík Vaculík: a Czechoslovak man of letters'', [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/81466 Radio.cz]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Vaculík died of natural causes at the age of 88 on 6 June 2015 in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-64124370-zemrel-spisovatel-a-fejetonista-ludvik-vaculik-bylo-mu-89-let|title=Zemřel spisovatel a fejetonista Ludvík Vaculík.

'''Martin Luther''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of St. Augustine|O.S.A.]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|θ|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/martin%20luther "Luther"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{IPA-de|ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ|lang}}; 10 November 1483&lt;ref&gt;Luther himself, however, believed that he had been born in 1484. {{cite book|last1=Hendrix|first1=Scott H.|title=Martin Luther: Visionary Reformer|date=2015|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHKhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=12 November 2017|isbn=978-0300166699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 18 February 1546) was a German professor of [[Theology#Christian theology|theology]], composer, priest, monk,&lt;ref&gt;Luther consistently referred to himself as a former monk. For example: "Thus formerly, when I was a monk, I used to hope that I would be able to pacify my conscience with the fastings, the praying, and the vigils with which I used to afflict my body in a way to excite pity. But the more I sweat, the less quiet and peace I felt; for the true light had been removed from my eyes." Martin Luther, Lectures on Genesis: Chapters 45–50, ed. Jaroslav Jan Pelikan, Hilton C. Oswald, and Helmut T. Lehmann, vol. 8 ''Luther’s Works''. (Saint Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1999), 5:326.&lt;/ref&gt; and a seminal figure in the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He strongly disputed the Catholic view on [[indulgence]]s. Luther proposed an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of [[Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;X]] in 1520 and the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles&amp;nbsp;V]] at the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 resulted in his [[excommunication]] by the [[Pope]] and condemnation as an [[outlaw]] by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

Luther taught that [[salvation]] and, consequently, [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] are not earned by good deeds but are received only as the free gift of God's [[Divine grace#Grace in the Protestant Reformation|grace]] through the believer's [[Faith in Christianity#Lutheranism|faith]] in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as redeemer from sin. [[Theology of Martin Luther|His theology]] challenged the authority and office of the [[Pope]] by teaching that the [[Bible]] is the [[sola scriptura|only source]] of [[Divinity|divinely]] revealed knowledge from God&lt;ref&gt;Ewald M. Plass, ''What Luther Says'', 3 vols., (St. Louis: CPH, 1959), 88, no. 269; M. Reu, ''Luther and the Scriptures'', (Columbus, Ohio: Wartburg Press, 1944), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed [[sacerdotalism]] by considering [[Universal priesthood|all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''Concerning the Ministry'' (1523), tr. Conrad Bergendoff, in Bergendoff, Conrad (ed.) ''Luther's Works''. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1958, 40:18 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who identify with these, and all of Luther's wider teachings, are called [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], though Luther insisted on ''Christian'' or ''Evangelical'' ([[German language|German]]: ''evangelisch'') as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.

[[Luther Bible|His translation of the Bible]] into the German [[vernacular]] (instead of [[Latin]]) made it more accessible to the laity, an event that had a tremendous impact on both the church and German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the [[German language#Modern German|German language]], added several principles to the art of translation,&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey William. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''. Grand Rapids, MI: Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999–2003, 1:244.&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the writing of an English translation, the [[Tyndale Bible]].&lt;ref name="Tyndale"&gt;''Tyndale's New Testament'', trans. from the Greek by William Tyndale in 1534 in a modern-spelling edition and with an introduction by David Daniell. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University]] Press, 1989, ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[hymn]]s influenced the development of singing in Protestant churches.&lt;ref name=Bainton269&gt;[[Roland Bainton|Bainton, Roland]]. ''Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther''. New York: Penguin, 1995, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to [[Katharina von Bora]], a former nun, set a model for the practice of [[clerical marriage]], allowing Protestant [[clergy]] to marry.&lt;ref name=Bainton223&gt;Bainton, Roland. ''Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther''. New York: Penguin, 1995, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two of his later works, Luther expressed antagonistic views towards [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, Scott H. [http://www.luthersem.edu/word&amp;world/Archives/3-4_Luther/3-4_Hendrix.pdf "The Controversial Luther"], ''Word &amp; World'' 3/4 (1983), Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN. Also see Hillerbrand, Hans.

Cambridge University Press, 2003. In 1523, Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the [[Old Testament]] could be shown to speak of [[Jesus Christ]]. However, as the Reformation grew, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity, and in the years his health deteriorated he grew more acerbic toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the [[Anabaptists]], [[Zwingli]], and the [[pope]].&lt;/ref&gt; His rhetoric was not directed at Jews alone, but also towards [[Roman Catholics]] (whom Protestants labeled "[[Papists]]"), [[Anabaptists]], and [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian Christians]].&lt;!--See section 'Anti-Judaism and antisemitism' below--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip: ''History of the Christian Church, Vol. VIII: Modern Christianity: The Swiss Reformation'', William B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, 1910, page 706.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther died in 1546, with his decree of excommunication by [[Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;X]] still effective. On his deathbed, Luther was asked: "Are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?" He answered "Yes", before taking his final breath.&lt;ref name=Reeves60&gt;Reeves, Michael. "The Unquenchable Flame". Nottingham: IVP, 2009, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustinerkloster Erfurt 19-05-2011 DSCF6253.jpg|thumb|left|Former monks' dormitory, [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St Augustine's Monastery]], Erfurt]]
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder (or Ludher, later Luther)&lt;ref name=Marty1&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Margarethe (née Lindemann) on 10 November 1483 in [[Eisleben]], [[County of Mansfeld]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther was [[Baptism|baptized]] the next morning on the feast day of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]. His family moved to [[Mansfeld]] in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters&lt;ref name=Brecht3&gt;[[Martin Brecht|Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council; in 1492 he was elected as a town councilor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-Luther | title=Martin Luther &amp;#124; Biography, Reformation, Works, &amp; Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marty1/&gt; The religious scholar [[Martin E. Marty|Martin Marty]] describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of "trading-class stock and middling means" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant.&lt;ref name=Marty1/&gt;

He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob.&lt;ref name=Marty3&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then [[Magdeburg]] in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a [[laity|lay group]] called the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], and [[Eisenach]] in 1498.&lt;ref name=RuppEB&gt;[[Gordon Rupp|Rupp, Ernst Gordon]]. "Martin Luther," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', accessed 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools focused on the so-called "[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to [[purgatory]] and [[hell]].&lt;ref name=Marty2&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1501, at the age of 17, he entered the [[University of Erfurt]], which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse.&lt;ref name=Marty4&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as "a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises."&lt;ref name=Marty4/&gt; He received his master's degree in 1505.&lt;ref name=Marty5&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - Martin Luther, Bust in Three-Quarter View - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Luther as a friar, with tonsure]]

In accordance with his father's wishes, he enrolled in law but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Marty5/&gt; Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in [[Aristotle]], [[William of Ockham]], and [[Gabriel Biel]].&lt;ref name=Marty5/&gt; He was deeply influenced by two tutors, [[Bartholomaeus Arnoldi]] von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers&lt;ref name=Marty5/&gt; and to test everything himself by experience.&lt;ref name=Marty6&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of [[reason]] but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason.&lt;ref name=Marty6/&gt; For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine [[revelation]], he believed, and [[Scripture]] therefore became increasingly important to him.&lt;ref name=Marty6/&gt;

On 2 July 1505, while returning to university on horseback after a trip home, a lightning bolt struck near Luther during a thunderstorm. Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, he cried out, "Help! [[Saint Anna]], I will become a monk!"&lt;ref name=Brecht48&gt;Brecht, Martin. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Google Books Archive of  Martin Luther: His road to Reformation, 1483–1521 (By Martin Brecht)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hH6nI6Q6qBIC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Martin%20Luther%3A%20His%20road%20to%20Reformation%2C%201483-1521%20%20By%20Martin%20Brecht%20Help%20me%20saint%20Anne%20I%20will%20become%20a%20monk&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=Help%20me%20st.%20Anne%20I%20will%20become%20a%20monk&amp;f=false|website=Martin Luther: His road to Reformation, 1483–1521 (By Martin Brecht)|accessdate=14 May 2015|isbn=978-1451414141|last1=Brecht|first1=Martin|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left university, sold his books, and entered [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] in [[Erfurt]] on 17 July 1505.&lt;ref&gt;Schwiebert, E.G. ''Luther and His Times''. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1950, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister. "This day you see me, and then, not ever again," he said.&lt;ref name=Marty6/&gt; His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther's education.&lt;ref name=Marty7&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early and academic life===
[[File:Portrait of Martin Luther as an Augustinian Monk.jpg|thumb|upright|A posthumous portrait of Luther as an [[Order of St. Augustine|Augustinian]] friar]]

Luther dedicated himself to the [[Order of St. Augustine|Augustinian]] order, devoting himself to [[fasting]], long hours in [[prayer]], [[pilgrimage]], and frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]].&lt;ref name=Bainton40&gt;Bainton, Roland. ''Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther''. New York: Penguin, 1995, 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair. He said, "I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter, and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul."&lt;ref name=Kittelson79&gt;Kittelson, James. ''Luther The Reformer''. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Publishing House, 1986, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann von Staupitz]], his superior, pointed Luther's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ. He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart.{{sfn|Froom|1948|p=249}}

On 3 April 1507, Jerome Schultz (lat. Hieronymus Scultetus), the [[Bishop of Brandenburg]], ordained Luther in [[Erfurt Cathedral]]. In 1508, von Staupitz, first dean of the newly founded [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Wittenberg]], sent for Luther, to teach [[theology]].{{sfn|Froom|1948|p=249}}&lt;ref name=Bainton44&gt;Bainton, Roland. ''Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther''.

The [[Latin]] inscription above informs the reader that the original door was destroyed by a fire, and that in 1857, King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] ordered a replacement be made.]]

In 1516, [[Johann Tetzel]], a [[Dominican friar]] and papal commissioner for [[indulgences]], was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money in order to rebuild [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Johann Tetzel]]," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by [[Albrecht von Brandenburg|Albrecht von Brandenburg, Archbishop of Mainz]], who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from [[Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;X]] to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices.

On 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albrecht von Brandenburg, protesting the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his "Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences", which came to be known as the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly "searching, rather than doctrinaire."&lt;ref name=HillerbrandIndulgences&gt;Hillerbrand, Hans J. "Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: "Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest [[Crassus]], build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?"&lt;ref name=HillerbrandIndulgences/&gt;

Luther objected to a saying attributed to [[Johann Tetzel]] that "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs."&lt;ref&gt;Thesis 55 of Tetzel's ''One Hundred and Six Theses''. These "Anti-theses" were a reply to Luther's ''Ninety-five Theses'' and were drawn up by Tetzel's friend and former Professor, [[Konrad Wimpina]]. Theses 55 &amp; 56 (responding to Luther's 27th Theses) read: "For a soul to fly out, is for it to obtain the vision of God, which can be ''hindered by no interruption'', therefore he errs who says that the soul ''cannot fly out'' before the coin can jingle in the bottom of the chest." In, ''The reformation in Germany'', [[Henry Clay Vedder]], 1914, Macmillan Company, p. 405.

Christians, he said, must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances.

According to one account, Luther nailed his ''Ninety-five Theses'' to the door of [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]] in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. Scholars Walter Krämer, Götz Trenkler, Gerhard Ritter, and Gerhard Prause contend that the story of the posting on the door, even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history, has little foundation in truth.&lt;ref name="Krämer"&gt;Krämer, Walter and Trenkler, Götz.

The Latin ''Theses'' were printed in several locations in Germany in 1517. In January 1518 friends of Luther translated the ''Ninety-five Theses'' from Latin into German.&lt;ref name=Brecht204&gt;Brecht, Martin. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months, they had spread throughout Europe.

Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519.&lt;!--contradicts "throughout Europe" in previous line--&gt; Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak. He published a short commentary on [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] and his ''Work on the Psalms''. This early part of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz, Lewis W. ''The Renaissance and Reformation Movements'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1987, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his best-known works were published in 1520: ''[[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]]'', ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church]]'', and ''[[On the Freedom of a Christian]]''.

===Justification by faith alone===
{{Main|Sola fide}}
[[File:Luther at Erfurt - Justification by Faith.jpg|thumb|upright|"Luther at Erfurt", which depicts Martin Luther discovering the doctrine of ''sola fide''. Painting by [[Joseph Noel Paton]], 1861.]]

From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, and on the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as [[penance]] and [[righteousness]] by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The most important for Luther was the doctrine of [[justification (theology)|justification]]—God's act of declaring a sinner righteous—by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's [[Divine grace|grace]], attainable only through faith in Jesus as the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name=Wriedt&gt;Wriedt, Markus. "Luther's Theology," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Luther''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 88–94.&lt;/ref&gt; "This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification", he wrote, "is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness."&lt;ref&gt;Bouman, Herbert J.A. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090403013639/http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/dorman-luther.shtml "The Doctrine of Justification in the Lutheran Confessions"], ''Concordia Theological Monthly'', 26 November 1955, No. 11:801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]]'', which was written in response to ''On Free Will'' by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1524). Luther based his position on [[predestination]] on St. Paul's epistle to the {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:8–10|NKJV}}. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in ''cooperation'' with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually ''is'' the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith.&lt;ref&gt;Dorman, Ted M., "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403013639/http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/dorman-luther.shtml Justification as Healing: The Little-Known Luther"], ''Quodlibet Journal'': Volume 2 Number 3, Summer 2000. Retrieved 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law," he wrote. "Faith is that which brings the [[Holy Spirit]] through the merits of Christ."&lt;ref name=faith&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ProjectWittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/luther-faith.txt|title=Luther's Definition of Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was "as though I had been born again." His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about "the righteousness of God"—a discovery that "the just person" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=155|title=Justification by Faith: The Lutheran-Catholic Convergence|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615015903/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=155|archivedate=15 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his concept of "justification" in the [[Smalcald Articles]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first and chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our justification (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us&amp;nbsp;... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13:31).&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. "The Smalcald Articles," in ''Concordia: The Lutheran Confessions''. Saint Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 2005, 289, Part two, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luther's rediscovery of "Christ and His salvation" was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation. His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it.{{sfn|Froom|1948|p=243}}

===Breach with the papacy===
[[File:Bulla-contra-errores.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Leo X]]'s ''Bull against the errors of Martin Luther'', 1521, commonly known as ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'']]

[[Albert of Brandenburg|Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg]] did not reply to Luther's letter containing the ''Ninety-five Theses''. He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Mullett, ''Martin Luther'', London: Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0415261685}}, 78; Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0300103131}}, 192–93.&lt;/ref&gt; He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric. As Luther later noted, "the pope had a finger in the pie as well, because one half was to go to the building of St Peter's Church in Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 68–69; Oberman, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marius, ''Luther'', London: Quartet, 1975, {{ISBN|0704331926}}, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and he responded slowly, "with great care as is proper."&lt;ref&gt;Papal Bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', 15 June 1520.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther, which served only to harden the reformer's anti-papal theology. First, the Dominican theologian [[Sylvester Mazzolini]] drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome. The [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Elector Frederick]] persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] was held.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There, over a three-day period in October 1518, Luther defended himself under questioning by [[papal legate]] [[Thomas Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]]. The Pope's right to issue indulgences was at the centre of the dispute between the two men.&lt;ref name=Reformation500&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformation500.csl.edu/timeline/luther-meets-with-cajetan-at-augsburg/|title=Luther meets with Cajetan at Augsburg|publisher=Reformation 500 – Concordia Seminary, St. Louis|accessdate=28  March 2016|date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ex-Classics&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.exclassics.com/foxe/foxe147.htm    |title=The Acts and Monuments of the Church – Martin Luther |publisher=exclassics.com|accessdate=28  March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than writing his theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the Carmelite monk [[Christoph Langenmantel]], Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luther-vor-Cajetan.jpg|thumb|The meeting of Martin Luther (right) and [[Cardinal Cajetan]] (left, holding the book)]]

In January 1519, at [[Altenburg]] in Saxony, the papal ''nuncio'' [[Karl von Miltitz]] adopted a more conciliatory approach. Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 92–95; Roland H. Bainton, ''Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther'', New York: Mentor, 1955, {{OCLC|220064892}}, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Johann Eck]], however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in a public forum. In June and July 1519, he staged a [[Leipzig Debate|disputation]] with Luther's colleague [[Andreas Karlstadt]] at [[Leipzig]] and invited Luther to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, 87–89; Bainton, Mentor edition, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor [[Ecumenical council|church councils]] were infallible.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, 93; Bainton, Mentor edition, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Eck branded Luther a new [[Jan Hus]], referring to the Czech reformer and heretic [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] in 1415. From that moment, he devoted himself to Luther's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''Reformation Europe: 1517–1559'', London: Collins, 1963, {{OCLC|222872115}}, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excommunication===
On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the [[papal bull]] (edict) ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' that he risked [[excommunication]] unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the ''Ninety-five Theses'', within 60 days. That autumn, [[Johann Eck]] proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns. [[Karl von Miltitz]], a papal [[nuncio]], attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of ''On the Freedom of a Christian'' in October, publicly set fire to the bull and [[decretal]]s at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520,&lt;ref name="Hillerbrand463"&gt;Brecht, Martin. (tr. Wolfgang Katenz) "Luther, Martin," in Hillerbrand, Hans J. (ed.) ''Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, 2:463.&lt;/ref&gt; an act he defended in ''Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned'' and ''Assertions Concerning All Articles''. As a consequence, Luther was excommunicated by Pope {{nowrap|Leo X}} on 3 January 1521, in the bull ''[[Decet Romanum Pontificem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Babylon to Eternity: The Exile Remembered and Constructed in Text and Tradition|first=Bob|last=Becking|first2=Alex|last2=Cannegieter|first3=Wilfred|last3=van er Poll|publisher=Routledge|p=91|year=2016|isbn=978-1134903863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet of Worms==
{{Main|Diet of Worms}}
[[File:Luther at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''Luther Before the Diet of Worms'' by [[Anton von Werner]] (1843–1915)]]
The enforcement of the ban on the ''Ninety-five Theses'' fell to the secular authorities. On 18 April 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the [[Diet of Worms]]. This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], a town on the [[Rhine]]. It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles&amp;nbsp;V]] presiding. Prince [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III, Elector of Saxony]], obtained a [[safe conduct]] for Luther to and from the meeting.

[[Johann Eck]], speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]], presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his, and whether he stood by their contents. Luther confirmed he was their author, but requested time to think about the answer to the second question. He prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 1:460.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of this speech, Luther raised his arm "in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout." Michael Mullett considers this speech as a "world classic of epoch-making oratory."&lt;ref name=mullettp25&gt;Mullett (1986), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin-Luther-Denkmal, Worms.JPG|thumb|[[Luther Monument (Worms)|Luther Monument in Worms]]. His statue is surrounded by the figures of his lay protectors and earlier Church reformers including John Wycliffe, Jan Hus and Girolamo Savonarola.]]

Eck informed Luther that he was acting like a heretic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"'Martin,' said he, 'there is no one of the heresies which have torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various interpretation of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with Biblical texts that [[Pelagius]] and [[Arius]] maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which you admit, in this verse of the New Testament—''Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son''; and he said, in the same way that you say, that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the [[Council of Constance]] condemned this proposition of [[John Huss]]—''The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect'', they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/luther/lutherbyluther.html#secondnarrative|title=Life of Luther (Luther by Martin Luther)|author=Martin Luther|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luther refused to recant his writings. He is sometimes also quoted as saying: "Here I stand. I can do no other". Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable, since they were inserted before "May God help me" only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 153, 170; Marius, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Mullett suggests that given his nature, "we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words."&lt;ref name=mullettp25/&gt;

Over the next five days, private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate. The Emperor presented the final draft of the [[Edict of Worms]] on 25 May 1521, declaring Luther an [[outlaw]], banning his literature, and requiring his arrest: "We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic."&lt;ref&gt;Bratcher, Dennis. "[http://www.crivoice.org/creededictworms.html The Diet of Worms (1521)]," in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resources for Growing Christians''. Retrieved 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter. It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.

==At Wartburg Castle==
[[File:Wartburg Eisenach DSCN3512.jpg|thumb|[[Wartburg|Wartburg Castle]], [[Eisenach]]]]
[[File:WartburgLutherstube1900.jpg|thumb|The [[Wartburg]] room where Luther translated the [[New Testament]] into German. An original first edition is kept in the case on the desk.]]

Luther's disappearance during his return to Wittenberg was planned. {{nowrap|Frederick III}} had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen impersonating highway robbers. They escorted Luther to the security of the [[Wartburg Castle]] at Eisenach.&lt;ref&gt;''Reformation Europe: 1517–1559,'' London: Fontana, 1963, 53; [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490–1700,'' London: Allen Lane, 2003, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as "my [[Patmos]]",&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. "Letter 82," in ''Luther's Works''. Jaroslav Jan Pelikan, Hilton C. Oswald and Helmut T. Lehmann (eds), Vol. 48: Letters I, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1999, c1963, 48:246; Mullett, 133. [[John of Patmos|John]], author of [[Revelation]], had been exiled on the island of Patmos.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther translated the [[New Testament]] from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings. These included a renewed attack on [[Albert of Mainz|Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz]], whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates,&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Refutation of the Argument of Latomus," in which he expounded the principle of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] to [[Jacobus Latomus]], an orthodox theologian from [[Leuven|Louvain]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 132, 134; Wilson, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this work, one of his most emphatic statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:7–9; Marius, 161–62; Marty, 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt; All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and [[Divine grace|God's grace]] (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides."&lt;ref name="sinsbestrong"&gt;Martin Luther, [http://www.ProjectWittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/letsinsbe.txt "Let Your Sins Be Strong," a Letter From Luther to Melanchthon], August 1521, Project Wittenberg, retrieved 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1521, Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practice. In ''On the Abrogation of the Private Mass'', he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:27–29; Mullett, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; His essay ''On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It'' rejected compulsory [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and encouraged private confession and [[absolution]], since "every Christian is a confessor."&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Luther wrote ''The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows''. He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, 163–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Bildnis Luthers als Junker Jörg (Leipzig).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Luther disguised as "[[Junker]] Jörg", 1521]]

In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy, in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation, placing them on prophetic faith. His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12, 23–25. The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy. So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7, coming up among the divisions of Rome, explicitly applied.{{sfn|Froom|1948|p=261}}

Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed. [[Andreas Karlstadt]], supported by the ex-Augustinian [[Gabriel Zwilling]], embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote ''A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion''.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called [[Zwickau prophets]], arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man,{{clarify|date=May 2018}} [[Believer's baptism|adult baptism]], and Christ's imminent return.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 192–202; Brecht, 2:34–38.&lt;/ref&gt; When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act.&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, Mentor edition, 164–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Wittenberg and Peasants' War==

[[File:Wittenberg Lutherhaus.JPG|thumb|[[Lutherhaus]], Luther's residence in [[Wittenberg]]]]

Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522. He wrote to the Elector: "During my absence, Satan has entered my sheepfold, and committed ravages which I cannot repair by writing, but only by my personal presence and living word."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 7 March 1522. Schaff, Philip, [http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm ''History of the Christian Church, Vol VII, Ch IV'']; Brecht, 2:57.&lt;/ref&gt; For eight days in [[Lent]], beginning on ''Invocavit'' Sunday, 9 March, Luther preached eight sermons, which became known as the "Invocavit Sermons". In these sermons, he hammered home the primacy of core [[Christian values]] such as love, patience, charity, and freedom, and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:60; Bainton, Mentor edition, 165; Marius, 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you know what the Devil thinks when he sees men use violence to propagate the gospel? He sits with folded arms behind the fire of hell, and says with malignant looks and frightful grin: "Ah, how wise these madmen are to play my game! Let them go on; I shall reap the benefit. I delight in it." But when he sees the Word running and contending alone on the battle-field, then he shudders and shakes for fear.&lt;ref name="Schaff IV"&gt;Schaff, Philip, [http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm ''History of the Christian Church, Vol VII, Ch IV''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The effect of Luther's intervention was immediate. After the sixth sermon, the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector: "Oh, what joy has Dr. Martin's return spread among us! His words, through divine mercy, are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth."&lt;ref name="Schaff IV" /&gt;

Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices. By working alongside the authorities to restore public order, he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; After banishing the Zwickau prophets, he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 141–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Titelblatt 12 Artikel.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Twelve Articles]]'', 1525]]
Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield. Preachers such as Zwickau prophet [[Nicholas Storch]] and [[Thomas Müntzer]] found support amongst poorer townspeople and peasants between 1521 and 1525. There had been [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|revolts]] by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hughes, ''Early Modern Germany: 1477–1806'', London: Macmillan, 1992, {{ISBN|0333537742}}, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with "liberal" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Dickens, ''The German Nation and Martin Luther'', London: Edward Arnold, 1974, {{ISBN|0713157003}}, 132–33. Dickens cites as an example of Luther's "liberal" phraseology: "Therefore I declare that neither pope nor bishop nor any other person has the right to impose a syllable of law upon a Christian man without his own consent".&lt;/ref&gt; Revolts broke out in [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], and [[Thuringia]] in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia, and Hipler and Lotzer in the south-west, the revolts turned into war.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther sympathised with some of the peasants' grievances, as he showed in his response to the [[Twelve Articles]] in May 1525, but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; During a tour of Thuringia, he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries. In ''[[Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants]]'', written on his return to Wittenberg, he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth, condemned the violence as the devil's work, and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Therefore let everyone who can, smite, slay, and stab, secretly or openly, remembering that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel ... For baptism does not make men free in body and property, but in soul; and the gospel does not make goods common, except in the case of those who, of their own [[free will]], do what the apostles and disciples did in Acts 4 [:32–37]. They did not demand, as do our insane peasants in their raging, that the goods of others—of Pilate and Herod—should be common, but only their own goods. Our peasants, however, want to make the goods of other men common, and keep their own for themselves. Fine Christians they are! I think there is not a devil left in hell; they have all gone into the peasants. Their raving has gone beyond all measure.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav J. Pelikan, Hilton C. Oswald, ''Luther's Works'', 55 vols. (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Pub. House and Fortress Press, 1955–1986), 46: 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds. First, in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government, they were ignoring Christ's counsel to "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's"; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1–7|NKJV}} that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted. This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the [[divine right of kings]], or, in the German case, the divine right of the princes. Second, the violent actions of rebelling, robbing, and plundering placed the peasants "outside the law of God and Empire", so they deserved "death in body and soul, if only as highwaymen and murderers." Lastly, Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves "Christian brethren" and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without Luther's backing for the uprising, many rebels laid down their weapons; others felt betrayed. Their defeat by the [[Swabian League]] at the [[Battle of Frankenhausen]] on 15 May 1525, followed by Müntzer's execution, brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, radicalism found a refuge in the [[Anabaptist]] movement and other religious movements, while Luther's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pettegree, ''Europe in the Sixteenth Century'', Oxford: Blackwell, {{ISBN|063120704X}}, 102–03.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526 Luther wrote: “I, Martin Luther, have during the rebellion slain all the peasants, for it was I who ordered them to be struck dead.”&lt;ref&gt;Erlangen Edition of ''Luther’s Works'', Vol. 59, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Luther married [[Katharina von Bora]], one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen [[Cistercian convent]] in April 1523, when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; "Suddenly, and while I was occupied with far different thoughts," he wrote to Wenceslaus Link, "the Lord has plunged me into marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip, [http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm ''History of the Christian Church, Vol VII, Ch V''], rpt.

[[File:Portrait of Martin Luther at his Desk.jpg|left|thumb|335x335px|Martin Luther at his desk with family portraits (17th century)]]
On 13 June 1525, the couple was engaged with [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], [[Justus Jonas]], Johannes Apel, [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and his wife as witnesses.&lt;ref name=Scheible147&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheible|first=Heinz|title=Melanchthon.

Some priests and former members of [[Catholic religious order|religious orders]] had already married, including [[Andreas Karlstadt]] and [[Justus Jonas]], but Luther's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lohse, Bernhard, ''Martin Luther: An Introduction to his Life and Work,'', translated by Robert C.

Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc7.ii.v.ii.html "Luther's Marriage. 1525."], ''History of the Christian Church, Volume VII, Modern Christianity, The German Reformation''. § 77, rpt. Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Retrieved 17 May 2009; Mullett, 180–81.&lt;/ref&gt;
Before marrying, Luther had been living on the plainest food, and, as he admitted himself, his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Marty, 109; Bainton, Mentor edition, 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery, "[[Augusteum and Lutherhaus|The Black Cloister]]," a wedding present from the new elector [[John, Elector of Saxony|John the Steadfast]] (1525–32). They embarked on what appears to have been a happy and successful marriage, though money was often short.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2: 202; Mullett, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Katharina bore six children: Hans&amp;nbsp;– June 1526; [[Elisabeth Luther|Elizabeth]]&amp;nbsp;– 10 December 1527, who died within a few months; [[Magdalena Luther|Magdalene]]&amp;nbsp;– 1529, who died in Luther's arms in 1542; Martin&amp;nbsp;– 1531; [[Paul Luther|Paul]]&amp;nbsp;– January 1533; and Margaret&amp;nbsp;– 1534; and she helped the couple earn a living by farming and taking in boarders.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman, 278–80; Wilson, 237; Marty, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther confided to [[Michael Stiefel]] on 11 August 1526: "My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of [[Croesus]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, Mentor edition, 228; Schaff, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc7.ii.v.ii.html "Luther's Marriage. 1525."]; Brecht, 2: 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organising the church==
[[File:Kirchenordnung Mecklenburg 1650.jpg|thumb|Church orders, Mecklenburg 1650]]
By 1526, Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church. His Biblical ideal of congregations choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bainton: "Luther's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality. If he were forced to choose, he would take his stand with the masses, and this was the direction in which he moved."&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, Mentor edition, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1525 to 1529, he established a supervisory church body, laid down a new form of [[Service of worship|worship service]], and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two [[catechisms]]. Luther's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross, the negation of every affirmation: as long as the cross is at the center, the system building tendency of reason is held in check, and system building does not degenerate into System.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9042013025|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid confusing or upsetting the people, Luther avoided extreme change. He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another. He concentrated on the church in the [[Electorate of Saxony]], acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model. He worked closely with the new elector, [[John, Elector of Saxony|John the Steadfast]], to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:260–63, 67; Mullett, 184–86.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership "was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign".&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:267; Bainton, Mentor edition, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elector authorised a [[Canonical Visitation|visitation]] of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:267; MacCulloch, 165. On one occasion, Luther referred to the elector as an "emergency bishop" (''Notbischof'').&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the ''Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony'' (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 186–87; Brecht, 2:264–65, 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eisleben]] reformer [[Johannes Agricola]] challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:264–65.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Instruction'' is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:268.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luckau Nikolaikirche Abendmahlsbild.jpg|thumb|left|Lutheran church liturgy and sacraments]]
In response to demands for a German [[liturgy]], Luther wrote a ''[[Deutsche Messe|German Mass]]'', which he published in early 1526.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:251–54; Bainton, Mentor edition, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the "simple people", a "public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:255.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted "everything that smacks of sacrifice", and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 183; Eric W. Gritsch, ''A History of Lutheranism'', Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0800634721}}, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He retained the [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevation of the host]] and [[chalice]], while trappings such as the Mass [[vestments]], altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:256; Mullett, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reformers, including followers of [[Huldrych Zwingli]], considered Luther's service too papistic, and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:256; Bainton, Mentor edition, 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:256; Bainton, Mentor edition, 269–70.&lt;/ref&gt; To reach the simple people and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the [[catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:256–57.&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], which began in 1527.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:263.&lt;/ref&gt; They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory. "Merciful God, what misery I have seen," Luther wrote, "the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 186. Quoted from Luther's preface to the ''Small Catechism'', 1529; MacCulloch, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catechisms===
[[File:MartinLutherWindow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A stained glass portrayal of Luther]]

Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations. In 1529, he wrote the [[Luther's Large Catechism|''Large Catechism'']], a manual for pastors and teachers, as well as a synopsis, the [[Luther's Small Catechism|''Small Catechism'']], to be memorised by the people themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Marty, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Baptism#Protestant Reformation|baptism]], and the [[Lutheranism#Lord's Supper|Lord's Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:273; Bainton, Mentor edition, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be [[Rote learning|learned by rote]], "the way monkeys do it", but understood.&lt;ref&gt;Marty, 123; Wilson, 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The catechism is one of Luther's most personal works. "Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes," he wrote, "I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would rather see them all devoured. For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine, except perhaps the ''[[On the Bondage of the Will|Bondage of the Will]]'' and the Catechism."&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''Luther's Works''. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971, 50:172–73; Bainton, Mentor edition, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Small Catechism'' has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:277, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in use today, along with Luther's hymns and his translation of the Bible.

Luther's ''Small Catechism'' proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the ''Large Catechism'' was effective for pastors.&lt;ref&gt;See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] language. He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life.&lt;ref name="James Arne Nestingen 1996"&gt;Charles P. Arand, "Luther on the Creed." ''Lutheran Quarterly'' 2006 20(1): 1–25. {{ISSN|0024-7499}}; James Arne Nestingen, "Luther's Catechisms" ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation.'' Ed. Hans J. Hillerbrand. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the [[Ten Commandments]]) and the [[Lord's Prayer]], which are also part of the Lutheran catechetical teaching.&lt;ref name="James Arne Nestingen 1996"/&gt;

==Translation of the Bible==
{{Main|Luther Bible}}
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|right|Luther's 1534 Bible]]

Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522, and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534, when the whole Bible was published. He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 145; Lohse, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Others had previously translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two of the earlier translations were the Mentelin Bible (1456)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18191/ |title=Mentelin Bible |website=World Digital Library |access-date=June 2, 2018|year=1466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Koberger Bible (1484).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18183/ |title=Koberger Bible |website=World Digital Library |access-date=June 2, 2018|date=1483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were as many as fourteen in High German, four in Low German, four in Netherlands language, and various in other languages before the Bible of Luther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Hebrew Scriptures |title=The Contested History of a Book: The German Bible of the Later Middle Ages and Reformation in Legend, Ideology, and Scholarship |last=Gow |first=Andrew C. |volume=9 |year=2009 |issn=1203-1542 |doi=10.5508/jhs.2009.v9.a13 |url=http://jhsonline.org/Articles/article_115.pdf |access-date=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When he was criticised for inserting the word "alone" after "faith" in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3:28,&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 148; Wilson, 185; Bainton, Mentor edition, 261. Luther inserted the word "alone" (''allein'') after the word "faith" in his translation of [[Epistle to the Romans|St Paul's Epistle to the Romans]], 3:28. The clause is rendered in the [[Authorised King James Version|English Authorised Version]] as "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law".&lt;/ref&gt; he replied in part: "[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ... But when works are so completely cut away—and that must mean that faith alone justifies—whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say, 'Faith alone justifies us, and not works'."&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, Carter.

Luther's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery, intelligible to both northern and southern Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 183; Brecht, 2:48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; He intended his vigorous, direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans, "for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance."&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 149; Wilson, 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications, Luther's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation. As such, it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther, and with woodcuts by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]] that contained anti-papal imagery, it played a major role in the spread of Luther's doctrine throughout Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lohse, 112–17; Wilson, 183; Bainton, Mentor edition, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, such as [[William Tyndale]]'s English Bible (1525 forward), a precursor of the [[Authorised King James Version|King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Weissbort and Astradur Eysteinsson (eds.), ''Translation – Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0198712006}}, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther was a prolific [[hymnodist]], authoring hymns such as "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"), based on [[Psalm 46]], and "[[Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her]]" ("From Heaven Above to Earth I Come"), based on Luke 2:11–12.&lt;ref&gt;For a short collection see [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn online hymns]&lt;/ref&gt; Luther connected high art and folk music, also all classes, clergy and laity, men, women and children. His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship, school, home, and the public arena.&lt;ref name="Christopher Boyd Brown 2005"&gt;Christopher Boyd Brown, ''Singing the Gospel: Lutheran Hymns and the Success of the Reformation''. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the [[waldzither]] that became a [[List of national instruments (music)|national instrument]] of Germany in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=23 March 2014|title=Waldzither – Bibliography of the 19th century|publisher=Studia Instrumentorum|url=http://www.studia-instrumentorum.de/MUSEUM/zistern.htm|quote=Es ist eine unbedingte Notwendigkeit, dass der Deutsche zu seinen Liedern auch ein echt deutsches Begleitinstrument besitzt. Wie der Spanier seine Gitarre (fälschlich Laute genannt), der Italiener seine Mandoline, der Engländer das Banjo, der Russe die Balalaika usw. sein Nationalinstrument nennt, so sollte der Deutsche seine Laute, die Waldzither, welche schon von Dr. Martin Luther auf der Wartburg im Thüringer Walde (daher der Name Waldzither) gepflegt wurde, zu seinem Nationalinstrument machen. Liederheft von C.H. Böhm (Hamburg, March 1919)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of [[Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes]], the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn "[[Ein neues Lied wir heben an]]" ("A new song we raise"), which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger's translation by the title and first line "Flung to the Heedless Winds" and sung to the tune [[Ibstone]] composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/f/l/u/flungtot.htm |journal=Hymntime |title=Flung to the heedless winds |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014171540/http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/f/l/u/flungtot.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's 1524 creedal hymn "{{lang|de|[[Wir glauben all an einen Gott]]|italic=unset}}" ("We All Believe in One True God") is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed in the ''[[Small Catechism]]''. Luther's hymn, adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn, gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525. Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included "Wir glauben all" among the catechetical hymns, although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] rather than catechetical, and 20th-century Lutherans rarely used the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.&lt;ref name="Christopher Boyd Brown 2005" /&gt;

Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the [[Lord's Prayer]], "[[Vater unser im Himmelreich]]", corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the ''Small Catechism'', with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions. The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune. Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer have adopted Luther's tune, although modern texts are considerably shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Robin A. Leaver, "Luther's Catechism Hymns." ''Lutheran Quarterly'' 1998 12(1): 79–88, 89–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther wrote "[[Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir]]" ("From depths of woe I cry to You") in 1523 as a hymnic version of [[Psalm 130]] and sent it as a sample to encourage his colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship. In a collaboration with [[Paul Speratus]], this and seven other hymns were published in the ''Achtliederbuch'', the [[first Lutheran hymnal]]. In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of "grace alone" more fully. Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine, this expanded version of "Aus tiefer Not" was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own. Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of [[Psalm 51]], Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism, concerning confession.&lt;ref&gt;Robin A. Leaver, "Luther's Catechism Hymns: 5. Baptism." ''Lutheran Quarterly'' 1998 12(2): 160–69, 170–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther wrote "[[Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein]]" ("Oh God, look down from heaven"). "[[Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland]]" (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', became the main hymn (Hauptlied) for [[Advent]]. He transformed ''A solus ortus cardine'' to "{{lang|de|[[Christum wir sollen loben schon]]|italic=unset}}" ("We should now praise Christ") and ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]'' to "{{lang|de|[[Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist]]|italic=unset}}" ("Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God").&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Markschies, Michael Trowitzsch: ''Luther zwischen den Zeiten&amp;nbsp;– Eine Jenaer Ringvorlesung''; Mohr Siebeck, 1999; pp. 215–19 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote two hymns on the [[Ten Commandments]], "{{lang|de|[[Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot]]|italic=unset}}" and "Mensch, willst du leben seliglich". His "[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") became the main hymn for Christmas. He wrote for [[Pentecost]] "[[Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist]]", and adopted for Easter "{{lang|de|[[Christ ist erstanden]]|italic=unset}}" (Christ is risen), based on [[Victimae paschali laudes]]. "{{lang|de|[[Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin]]|italic=unset}}", a paraphrase of [[Nunc dimittis]], was intended for [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Purification]], but became also a funeral hymn. He paraphrased the [[Te Deum]] as "[[Herr Gott, dich loben wir]]" with a simplified form of the melody. It became known as the German Te Deum.

Luther's 1541 hymn "{{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam]]|italic=unset}}" ("To Jordan came the Christ our Lord") reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the ''Small Catechism''. Luther adopted a preexisting [[Johann Walter]] tune associated with a hymnic setting of [[Psalm 67]]'s prayer for grace; Wolf Heintz's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541. Preachers and composers of the 18th century, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work, although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran [[pietism]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Boyd Brown 2005" /&gt;

Luther's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation. He supplied four of eight songs of the [[First Lutheran hymnal]] ''Achtliederbuch'', 18 of 26 songs of the ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion]]'', and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by [[Johann Walter]], ''[[Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn]]'', all published in 1524.

Luther's hymns inspired composers to write music. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] included several verses as [[chorale]]s in his [[Bach cantata|cantatas]] and based [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantatas]] entirely on them, namely [[BWV 4|''Christ lag in Todes Banden'', BWV 4]], as early as possibly 1707, in his second annual cycle (1724 to 1725) [[BWV 2|''Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein'', BWV 2]], [[BWV 7|''Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam'', BWV 7]], [[BWV 62|''Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland'', BWV 62]], [[BWV 91|''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'', BWV 91]], and [[BWV 38|''Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir'', BWV 38]], later [[BWV 80|''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'', BWV 80]], and in 1735 [[BWV 14|''Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit'', BWV 14]].

==On the soul after death==
[[File:Epi Michael-Meienburg-1555.jpg|thumb|Luther on the left with [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] being raised by Jesus from the dead, painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1558]]

In contrast to the views of [[John Calvin]]&lt;ref&gt;''Psychopannychia'' (the night banquet of the soul), manuscript Orléans 1534, Latin Strasbourg 1542, 2nd.ed. 1545, French, Geneva 1558, English 1581.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philipp Melanchthon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Anima'' 1562&lt;/ref&gt; throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death.&lt;ref&gt;D. Franz Pieper ''Christliche Dogmatik'', 3 vols., (Saint Louis: CPH, 1920), 3:575: "Hieraus geht sicher so viel hervor, daß die abgeschiedenen Seelen der Gläubigen in einem Zustande des seligen Genießens Gottes sich befinden .... Ein Seelenschlaf, der ein Genießen Gottes einschließt (so Luther), ist nicht als irrige Lehre zu bezeichnen"; English translation: Francis Pieper, ''Christian Dogmatics'', 3 vols., (Saint Louis: CPH, 1953), 3:512: "These texts surely make it evident that the departed souls of the believers are in a state of blessed enjoyment of God .... A sleep of the soul which includes enjoyment of God (says Luther) cannot be called a false doctrine."&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages, such as the parable of the [[rich man and Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sermons of Martin Luther: the House Postils'', Eugene F.A. Klug, ed. and trans., 3 vols., (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1996), 2:240.&lt;/ref&gt; This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: "It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace."&lt;ref&gt;Weimarer Ausgabe 43, 360, 21–23 (to Genesis 25:7–10): also Exegetica opera latina Vol 5–6 1833 p. 120 and the English translation: ''Luther's Works'', American Edition, 55 vols. (St. Louis: CPH), 4:313; "Sufficit igitur nobis haec cognitio, non egredi animas ex corporibus in periculum cruciatum et paenarum inferni, sed esse eis paratum cubiculum, in quo dormiant in pace."&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the existence of [[Purgatory]], which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.12 |title=Smalcald Articles, Part II, Article II, paragraph 12|publisher=Bookofconcord.org|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond death. In his [[Smalcald Articles]], he described the saints as currently residing "in their graves and in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.28|title=Smalcald Articles, Part II, Article II, paragraph 28|publisher=Bookofconcord.org|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran theologian [[Franz Pieper]] observed that Luther's teaching about the state of the Christian's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as [[Johann Gerhard]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard ''Loci Theologici, Locus de Morte'', § 293 ff. Pieper writes: "Luther speaks more guardedly of the state of the soul between death and resurrection than do Gerhard and the later theologians, who transfer some things to the state between death and resurrection which can be said with certainty only of the state after the resurrection" (''Christian Dogmatics'', 3:512, footnote 21).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] (1755) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]] on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Article in the ''Berlinischer Zeitung'' 1755 in Complete Works ed. Karl Friedrich Theodor Lachmann&amp;nbsp;– 1838 p. 59 "Was die Gegner auf alle diese Stellen antworten werden, ist leicht zu errathen. Sie werden sagen, daß Luther mit dem Worte Schlaf gar die Begriffe nicht verbinde, welche Herr R. damit verbindet. Wenn Luther sage, daß die Seele IS nach dem Tode schlafe, so denke er nichts mehr dabey, als was alle Leute denken, wenn sie den Tod des Schlafes Bruder nennen. Tode ruhe, leugneten auch die nicht, welche ihr Wachen behaupteten :c. Ueberhaupt ist mit Luthers Ansehen bey der ganzen Streitigkeit nichts zu gewinnen."&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's ''Commentary on Genesis'' contains a passage which concludes that "the soul does not sleep (''anima non sic dormit''), but wakes (''sed vigilat'') and experiences visions".&lt;ref&gt;Exegetica opera Latina, Volumes 5–6 Martin Luther, ed. Christopf Stephan Elsperger (Gottlieb) p. 120 "Differunt tamen somnus sive quies hujus vitae et futurae. Homo enim in hac vita defatigatus diurno labore, sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum tanquam in pace, ut ibi dormiat, et ea nocte fruitur quiete, neque quicquam scit de ullo malo sive incendii, sive caedis. Anima autem non sic dormit, sed vigilat, et patitur visiones loquelas Angelorum et Dei. Ideo somnus in futura vita profundior est quam in hac vita et tamen anima coram Deo vivit. Hac similitudine, quam habeo a somno viventia." (Commentary on Genesis&amp;nbsp;– ''Enarrationes in Genesin'', XXV, 1535–1545)"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Blackburne (archdeacon)|Francis Blackburne]] in 1765 argued that [[John Jortin]] misread this and other passages from Luther,&lt;ref&gt;Blackburne ''A short historical view of the controversy concerning an intermediate state'' (1765) p121&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Gottfried Fritschel]] pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man "in this life" (''homo enim in hac vita'') tired from his daily labour (''defatigus diurno labore'') who at night enters his bedchamber (''sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum'') and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Fritschel]]. ''Zeitschrift für die gesammte lutherische Theologie und Kirche'' p. 657 "Denn dass Luther mit den Worten "anima non sic dormit, sed vigilat et patitur visiones, loquelas Angelorum et Dei" nicht dasjenige leugnen will, was er an allen andern Stellen seiner Schriften vortragt"&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Eyster Jacobs' English translation from 1898 reads:
:"Nevertheless, the sleep of this life and that of the future life differ; for '''in this life''', man, fatigued by his daily labour, at nightfall goes to his couch, as in peace, to sleep there, and enjoys rest; nor does he know anything of evil, whether of fire or of murder."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Eyster Jacobs ''Martin Luther the Hero of the Reformation 1483 to 1546'' (1898). Emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacramentarian controversy and the Marburg Colloquy==
{{See also|The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics}}
[[File:Statue of Martin Luther, St. Mary's Church, Mitte, Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Martin Luther outside [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin]]]]

In October 1529, [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the [[Marburg Colloquy]], to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 194–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen, the exception being the nature of the [[Eucharist]]—the [[sacrament]] of the Lord's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:325–34; Mullett, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theologians, including [[Zwingli]], [[Melanchthon]], [[Martin Bucer]], and [[Johannes Oecolampadius]], differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the [[Last Supper]]: "This is my body which is for you" and "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" ([[1 Corinthians 11]]:23–26).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther insisted on the [[Real Presence]] of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the [[sacramental union]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Weimar Ausgabe]]'' 26, 442; ''Luther's Works'' 37, 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwingli, for example, denied Jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time. Luther stressed the [[omnipresence]] of Jesus' human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marty, 140–41; Lohse, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; According to transcripts, the debate sometimes became confrontational. Citing Jesus' words "The flesh profiteth nothing" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 6.63), Zwingli said, "This passage breaks your neck". "Don't be too proud," Luther retorted, "German necks don't break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Oberman, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; On his table Luther wrote the words "''Hoc est corpus meum''" ("This is my body") in chalk, to continually indicate his firm stance.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht 2:329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist, the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the [[Augsburg Confession]], and for the formation of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as [[John of Saxony]], Philip of Hesse, and [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. The Swiss cities, however, did not sign these agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.  He wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke, VIII''&lt;/ref&gt; and "[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...]  For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Table Talk''.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason "strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it",&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, "On Justification CCXCIV", ''Table Talk''&lt;/ref&gt; bringing claims he was a [[fideist]] into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]] in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to.

[[File:OsmanenDeutscheKavallerie-1-.jpg|thumb|The battle between the Turks and the Christians, in the 16th century]]

At the time of the Marburg Colloquy, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was [[Siege of Vienna|besieging Vienna]] with a vast [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] army.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett, 198; Marius, 220. The siege was lifted on 14 October 1529, which Luther saw as a divine miracle.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 ''Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses'', provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a [[scourge]] sent by God to punish Christians, as agents of the Biblical [[apocalypse]] that would destroy the [[antichrist]], whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cunningham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLxDnAMaUgQC&amp;pg=PA141 ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Religion, War, Famine and Death in Reformation Europe''], Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0521467012}}, 141; Mullett, 239–40; Marty, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He consistently rejected the idea of a [[Religious war|Holy War]], "as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name".&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[On War against the Turk]]'', 1529, quoted in William P. Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=87hQ2AjcttEC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Ten Commandments: The Reciprocity of Faithfulness''], Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0664223230}}, 258; Lohse, 61; Marty, 166.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in keeping with his [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]], Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Marty, 166; Marius, 219; Brecht, 2:365, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, he argued in ''Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace'' that national defence is reason for a just war.&lt;ref&gt;Mullett, 238–39; Lohse, 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1529, in ''[[On War against the Turk]]'', he was actively urging Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&amp;nbsp;V]] and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:364.&lt;/ref&gt;
He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 257; Brecht, 2:364–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of the [[Siege of Vienna]], Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to "give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies".&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 2:365; Mullett, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1542, Luther read a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 3:354.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam, which he called "Mohammedanism" or "the Turk".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uJzjatjTL4C&amp;pg=PA109 ''The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe''], Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0521459087}}, 109; Mullett, 241; Marty, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil, he was indifferent to its practice: "Let the Turk believe and live as he will, just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live."&lt;ref&gt;From ''On war against the Turk'', 1529, quoted in Roland E. Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BjC7K1j_AT8C&amp;pg=PA208 ''Muslims and the Gospel''], Minneapolis: Kirk House Publishers, 2006, {{ISBN|1932688072}}, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an, wanting it exposed to scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 3:355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antinomian controversy==
[[File:LutherPulpit.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pulpit of St. Andreas Church, Eisleben, where Agricola and Luther preached]]
Early in 1537, [[Johannes Agricola]] (1494–1566)—serving at the time as pastor in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben—preached a sermon in which he claimed that God's [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]], not God's moral law (the [[Ten Commandments]]), revealed God's wrath to Christians. Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] theses circulating in Wittenberg. These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal: Martin Luther's Complete Antinomian Theses and Disputations,'' ed. and tr. H. Sonntag, Minneapolis: Lutheran Press, 2008, 23–27. {{ISBN|978-0974852966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for [[disputation]]s between 1538 and 1540.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ibid., 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 [[open letter]] to C. Güttel ''Against the Antinomians'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Luther's Works'' 47:107–19. There he writes: "Dear God, should it be unbearable that the holy church confesses itself a sinner, believes in the forgiveness of sins, and asks for remission of sin in the Lord's Prayer? How can one know what sin is without the law and conscience? And how will we learn what Christ is, what he did for us, if we do not know what the law is that he fulfilled for us and what sin is, for which he made satisfaction?" (112–13).&lt;/ref&gt; and his book ''On the Councils and the Church'' from the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Luther's Works'' 41, 113–14, 143–44, 146–47. There he said about the antinomians: "They may be fine Easter preachers, but they are very poor Pentecost preachers, for they do not preach ''de sanctificatione et vivificatione Spiritus Sancti'', "about the sanctification by the Holy Spirit," but solely about the redemption of Jesus Christ" (114). "Having rejected and being unable to understand the Ten Commandments, ... they see and yet they let the people go on in their public sins, without any renewal or reformation of their lives" (147).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Luther reviews and reaffirms, on the one hand, what has been called the "second use of the law," that is, the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal,'' 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians—thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church—does not eliminate the accusing law.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 76, 105–07.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that the law—in any form—should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 140, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments—when considered not as God's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will, that is, of the natural law—also positively teach how the Christian ought to live.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 75, 104–05, 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; This has traditionally been called the "third use of the law."&lt;ref&gt;The "first use of the law," accordingly, would be the law used as an external means of order and coercion in the political realm by means of bodily rewards and punishments.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther, also Christ's life, when understood as an example, is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments, which a Christian should follow in his or her [[vocation]]s on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ten Commandments, and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of [[Lutheranism#Baptism|baptism]], are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future [[angel]]-like life in heaven in the midst of this life.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 35: "The law, therefore, cannot be eliminated, but remains, prior to Christ as not fulfilled, after Christ as to be fulfilled, although this does not happen perfectly in this life even by the justified. ... This will happen perfectly first in the coming life." Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal,'', 43–44, 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's teaching of the Ten Commandments, therefore, has clear [[Eschatology|eschatological]] overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.

==Bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse==
From December 1539, Luther became implicated in the [[bigamy]] of [[Philip&amp;nbsp;I, Landgrave of Hesse]], who wanted to marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting. Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the [[landgrave]] that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Martin, ''Martin Luther'', tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3: 206.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, [[Margarethe von der Saale]], with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to "tell a good, strong lie" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Martin, ''Martin Luther'', tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3:212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Luther's biographer [[Martin Brecht]], "giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable".&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Martin, ''Martin Luther'', tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3:214.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Martin, ''Martin Luther'', tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3:205–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|upright|thumb|The original title page of ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'', written by Martin Luther in 1543]]

Luther wrote negatively about the Jews throughout his career.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Michael, Robert. ''Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, 109; Mullett, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived in a locality which had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Mark. ''Luther's Last Battles''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1983, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Brecht|Brecht]], 3:341–43; Mullett, 241; Marty, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in ''That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew'' and also aimed to convert them to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 3:334; Marty, 169; Marius, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Graham. "Martin Luther and German anti-Semitism," ''History Review'' (2002) No. 42:1–2; Mullett, 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise ''Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen'' (''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]''), and ''Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi'' (''[[On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ]]''), both published in 1543, three years before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 3:341–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil's people", and referred to them with violent language.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, ''On the Jews and their Lies'', quoted in Michael, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luther, ''Vom Schem Hamphoras'', quoted in Michael, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein [[Moses]] commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "''scharfe Barmherzigkeit''" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames."&lt;ref name=gritsch8687&gt;Gritsch, Eric W. (2012). ''Martin Luther's Anti-Semitism: Against His Better Judgment''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]. {{ISBN|978-0802866769}}. pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Luther advocated setting [[synagogue]]s on fire, destroying Jewish [[Siddur|prayerbooks]], forbidding [[rabbi]]s from preaching, seizing Jews' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Luther, ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', ''Luthers Werke''. 47:268–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Robert Michael (historian)|Robert Michael]]'s view, Luther's words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', quoted in Robert Michael, "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews," ''Encounter'' 46 (Autumn 1985) No. 4:343–44.&lt;/ref&gt; "God's anger with them is so intense," Luther concluded, "that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them!"&lt;ref name=gritsch8687/&gt;

Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Silesia.&lt;ref name="Michael:Josel/Strasbourg"&gt;Michael, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josel of Rosheim]], the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537, later blamed their plight on "that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell!—who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Michael, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther's anti-Jewish works: they refused initially, but did so when a Lutheran pastor in [[Hochfelden, Bas-Rhin|Hochfelden]] used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews.&lt;ref name="Michael:Josel/Strasbourg" /&gt; Luther's influence persisted after his death. Throughout the 1580s, riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther was the most widely read author of his generation, and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Gritsch, 113–14; Michael, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing opinion among historians,&lt;ref name=Wallman1&gt;"The assertion that Luther's expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment have been of major and persistent influence in the centuries after the Reformation, and that there exists a continuity between Protestant [[anti-Judaism]] and modern racially oriented anti-Semitism, is at present wide-spread in the literature; since the Second World War it has understandably become the prevailing opinion." Johannes Wallmann, "The Reception of Luther's Writings on the Jews from the Reformation to the End of the 19th century", ''Lutheran Quarterly'', n.s. 1 (Spring 1987) 1:72–97.&lt;/ref&gt; his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Berger, Ronald.

''The 12-Year Reich: A Social History of Nazi German 1933–1945'' (NP:Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971), 465.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who "wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther." According to Michael, just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the [[Third Reich]] contained references to and quotations from Luther. [[Heinrich Himmler]] (albeit never a Lutheran, having been brought up Catholic) wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Himmler wrote: "what Luther said and wrote about the Jews. No judgment could be sharper."&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of ''On the Jews and their Lies'' to [[Julius Streicher]], editor of the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', on his birthday in 1937; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc H.

On 17 December 1941, seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the [[yellow badge]], "since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory." According to [[Daniel Goldhagen]], Bishop [[Martin Sasse]], a leading Protestant churchman, published a compendium of Luther's writings shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], for which [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], Professor of the History of the Church in the [[University of Oxford]] argued that Luther's writing was a "blueprint."&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490–1700''. New York: Penguin Books Ltd, 2004, pp. 666–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day, writing in the introduction, "On 10 November 1938, on Luther's birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany." The German people, he urged, ought to heed these words "of the greatest antisemite of his time, the warner of his people against the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Nellessen, "Die schweigende Kirche: Katholiken und Judenverfolgung," in Buttner (ed), ''Die Deutschen und die Jugendverfolg im Dritten Reich'', p. 265, cited in Daniel Goldhagen, ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' (Vintage, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer."|author=[[Martin Brecht]]&lt;ref&gt;Brecht 3:351.&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%|align=left}}
At the heart of scholars' debate about Luther's influence is whether it is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis. Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. [[Johannes Wallmann (theologian)|Johannes Wallmann]] argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Wallmann, 72–97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uwe Siemon-Netto]] agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uwe Siemon-Netto|Siemon-Netto]], ''The Fabricated Luther'', 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SiemonNetto2"&gt;[[Uwe Siemon-Netto|Siemon-Netto]], "Luther and the Jews," &lt;cite&gt;Lutheran Witness&lt;/cite&gt; 123 (2004) No. 4:19, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans J. Hillerbrand]] agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in [[History of Germany|German history]].&lt;ref name=HillerbrandEB&gt;Hillerbrand, Hans J. "Martin Luther," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007. Hillerbrand writes: "His strident pronouncements against the Jews, especially toward the end of his life, have raised the question of whether Luther significantly encouraged the development of German anti-Semitism. Although many scholars have taken this view, this perspective puts far too much emphasis on Luther and not enough on the larger peculiarities of German history."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Bainton]], noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote "One could wish that Luther had died before ever [''On the Jews and Their Lies''] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial."&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, Roland: ''Here I Stand'', (Nashville: Abingdon Press, New American Library, 1983), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For similar views, see:

However, Christopher J. Probst, in his book ''Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany'' (2012), shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Probst, [http://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/academic-publications/full-list-of-academic-publications/demonizing-the-jews-luther-and-the-protestant-church-in-nazi-germany ''Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany''], Indiana University Press in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0253001009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as Mark U. Edwards in his book ''Luther's Last Battles: Politics and Polemics 1531–46'' (1983), suggest that since Luther's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated, it is possible they were at least partly the product of a state of mind. Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used "vulgarity and violence" for effect, both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against "Turks" (Muslims) and Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theologian.org.uk/churchhistory/lutherandthejews.html#_ftnref67|title=Martin Luther and "The Jews" A Reappraisal|author=Dr. Christopher Probst|publisher=The Theologian|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, Lutheran denominations have repudiated Martin Luther's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;''Synod deplores and disassociates itself from Luther's negative statements about the Jewish people and the use of these statements to incite anti-Lutheran sentiment'', from a summary of [http://www.ctsfw.edu/bsmith-cts/etext/lcms/Synod/resolutions.pdf Official Missouri Synod Doctrinal Statements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225041133/http://www.ctsfw.edu/bsmith-cts/etext/lcms/Synod/resolutions.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lull, Timothy ''Martin Luther's Basic Theological Writings, Second Edition'' (2005), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Strommen et al.'s 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that, compared to the other minority groups under consideration, Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews.&lt;ref&gt;See Merton P. Strommen et al., A Study of Generations (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing, 1972), p. 206. P. 208 also states "The clergy [ALC, LCA, or LCMS] are less likely to indicate anti-Semitic or racially prejudiced attitudes [compared to the laity]."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Professor Richard (Dick) Geary, former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham, England, and the author of ''Hitler and Nazism'' (Routledge 1993), published an article in the magazine ''[[History Today]]'' examining electoral trends in Weimar Germany between 1928 and 1933. Geary noted, based on his research, that the Nazi Party received disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Richard (Dick) Geary, "Who voted for the Nazis?

==Final years, illness and death==
[[File:DHM - Luther auf Totenbett.jpg|thumb|Luther on his deathbed, painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

Luther had been suffering from ill health for years, including [[Ménière's disease]], [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[fainting]], [[tinnitus]], and a [[cataract]] in one eye.&lt;ref name="pmid9019884"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iversen OH |title=Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death |language=Norwegian |journal=[[Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen.]] |volume=116 |issue=30 |pages=3643–46 |year=1996 |pmid=9019884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal that ensued from the [[bigamy]] of [[Philip&amp;nbsp;I, Landgrave of Hesse]] incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from [[kidney stone|kidney and bladder stones]], [[arthritis]], and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, he began to feel the effects of [[angina pectoris|angina]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments. His wife Katharina was overheard saying, "Dear husband, you are too rude," and he responded, "They are teaching me to be rude."&lt;ref&gt;Spitz, 354.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Market Church]] in Halle, staying with his friend [[Justus Jonas]] during [[Christmas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-halle.de/bildung-im-voruebergehen/luther/ Die Beziehungen des Reformators Martin Luther zu Halle] buergerstiftung-halle.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last sermon was delivered at [[Eisleben]], his place of birth, on 15 February 1546, three days before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. Sermon No. 8, "Predigt über Mat. 11:25, Eisleben gehalten," 15 February 1546, ''Luthers Werke'', Weimar 1914, 51:196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; It was "entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews, whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory," according to [[Léon Poliakov]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, Léon]]. ''From the Time of Christ to the Court Jews'', Vanguard Press, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a "fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst, unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, James. ''Luther and the Reformation''. Vol. IV, (New York): Russell &amp; Russell, 1962, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther said, "we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert," but also that they are "our public enemies&amp;nbsp;... and if they could kill us all, they would gladly do so. And so often they do."&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''Admonition against the Jews'', added to his final sermon, cited in [[Oberman, Heiko]]. ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New York: Image Books, 1989, p. 294. A complete translation of Luther's ''Admonition'' can be found in Wikisource. [[s:Warning Against the Jews (1546)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's final journey, to Mansfeld, was taken because of his concern for his siblings' families continuing in their father Hans Luther's copper mining trade. Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control. The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts: Albrecht, Philip, John George, and Gerhard. Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement, and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion.

The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546. After 8&amp;nbsp;a.m., he experienced chest pains. When he went to his bed, he prayed, "Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God" (Ps. 31:5), the common prayer of the dying. At 1&amp;nbsp;a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels. He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed. His companions, Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius, shouted loudly, "Reverend father, are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?" A distinct "Yes" was Luther's reply.

An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech, and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 18 February 1546, aged 62, in Eisleben, the city of his birth. He was buried in the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]] in [[Wittenberg]], beneath the pulpit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3:369–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was held by his friends [[Johannes Bugenhagen]] and [[Philipp Melanchthon]].&lt;ref name=MacKim19&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=The Cambridge companion to Martin Luther|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|series=Cambridge companions to religion|isbn=978-0521016735|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, troops of Luther's adversary [[Charles&amp;nbsp;V, Holy Roman Emperor]] entered the town, but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave.&lt;ref name=MacKim19/&gt;

A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement. The statement was in Latin, apart from "We are beggars," which was in German. The statement reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;# No one can understand [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Bucolics]]'' unless he has been a shepherd for five years. No one can understand Virgil's ''[[Georgics]]'', unless he has been a farmer for five years.
# No one can understand [[Cicero's Letters|Cicero's ''Letters'']] (or so I teach), unless he has busied himself in the affairs of some prominent state for twenty years.
# Know that no one can have indulged in the Holy Writers sufficiently, unless he has governed churches for a hundred years with the prophets, such as [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]], [[John the Baptist]], Christ and the apostles.

Do not assail this divine [[Aeneid]]; nay, rather prostrate revere the ground that it treads.

We are beggars: this is true.&lt;ref&gt;Kellermann, James A.

Luther made effective use of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s printing press to spread his views.  He switched from Latin to German in his writing to appeal to a broader audience.  Between 1500 and 1530, Luther's works represented one fifth of all materials printed in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "The Monk Who Shook the World", Richard J. Evans,
 March 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1530s and 1540s, printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism. In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints, Luther was presented as a stout man with a "double chin, strong mouth, piercing deep-set eyes, fleshy face, and squat neck." He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism. His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders. Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by [[Hans Brosamer]] (1530) and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (1546).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roper|first=Lyndal|title=Martin Luther's Body: The 'Stout Doctor' and His Biographers|journal=American Historical Review|date=April 2010|volume=115|issue=2|pages=351–62|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.2.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints]]. In the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England's Calendar of Saints]] he is commemorated on 31 October.

Martin Luther is honored in various ways by Christian traditions coming out directly from the Protestant Reformation, i.e. Lutheranism, the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]], and [[Anglicanism]]. Branches of Protestantism that emerged afterwards vary in their remembrance and veneration of Luther, ranging from a complete lack of a single mention of him to a commemoration almost comparable to the way Lutherans commemorate and remember his persona. There is no known condemnation of Luther by Protestants themselves.

Various sites both inside and outside Germany (supposedly) visited by Martin Luther throughout his lifetime commemorate it with local memorials. [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has two towns lawfully named after Luther, [[Lutherstadt Eisleben]] and [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg]]. [[Mansfeld]] is sometimes called Mansfeld-Lutherstadt, although the state government has not decided to put the ''[[Lutherstadt]]''-prefix in its official name.

[[Reformation Day]] commemorates the publication of the ''Ninety-five Theses'' in 1517 by Martin Luther; it has been historically important in the following European entities. It is a [[civic holiday]] in the [[states of Germany|German states]] of [[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Hamburg]]. Two further states ([[Lower Saxony]] and [[Bremen]]) are pending a vote on introducing it. [[Slovenia]] celebrates it due to the profound contribution of the Reformation to its culture. [[Austria]] allows Protestant children not to go to school that day, and Protestant workers have a right to leave work in order to participate in a church service. [[Switzerland]] celebrates the holiday on the first Sunday after 31 October. It is also celebrated elsewhere around the world.

{{Nihongo|'''Mihael Keehl'''|ミハエル・ケール|Mihaeru Kēru|lead=yes}}, universally referred to by the [[mononym]] {{Nihongo|'''Mello'''|メロ|Mero}}, is a fictional character in the [[manga]] series ''[[Death Note]]'', created by [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and [[Takeshi Obata]]. Mello is introduced alongside [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] as a potential substitute for [[L (Death Note)|L]]. Both Mello and Near were raised at Wammy's House, an orphanage established by [[List of Death Note characters#Watari|Watari]], L's assistant. However, Mello refuses to work with Near to capture a murderer dubbed "[[Light Yagami|Kira]]". Over the course of ''Death Note'', he joins the mafia, obtains a [[Death Note#The notebooks|Death Note]], causes the death of some people, and dies before he can expose Kira's identity. Mello has also appeared in other media from the series, including [[video games]], and [[light novels]].

The character of Mello was created, along with Near, to break the endless cycle of confrontations between the detective L and Light Yagami, the man behind the persona Kira. Both Mello and Near were designed after L, and were initially envisioned as twins and sons of L. Ultimately, this idea was dropped, with their designs switched compared to the original concept. He is voiced in the Japanese [[anime]] series by [[Nozomu Sasaki]] and in the English adaptation by [[David Hurwitz (actor)|David Hurwitz]]. Merchandise has been created for the character, including plush dolls and action figures. Mello has received mixed commentary by manga and anime publications.

==Appearances==

===In ''Death Note''===
Mello, whose real name is Mihael Keehl, grew up in Wammy's House, an orphanage for [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] children, and is one of two potential successors to L—the best detective in the world. When L dies, it is proposed to him to work with [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], the other potential successor, to find L's murderer, a criminal dubbed "[[Light Yagami|Kira]]". Mello rejects the proposal, citing their bad relationship and different personalities. Then, he leaves the orphanage and joins the [[Mafia]].&lt;ref name=c61/&gt; Aware of a Death Note—a book that allows anyone to murder individuals just by knowing their faces and names—in Japanese police's possession, Mello abducts its director; Kira, however, kills the director.&lt;ref name=c60/&gt; Afterwards, Mello proceeds to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]], the daughter of the police's vice-director, [[Soichiro Yagami]];&lt;ref name=c61/&gt; Mello succeeds in obtaining the Death Note this time.&lt;ref name=c64/&gt;

Light Yagami, the true identity of Kira, discovers the location of Mello's hideout.&lt;ref name=c68/&gt; An indirect result of this is that Mello meets the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Sidoh]], the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent.&lt;ref name=c69/&gt; However, Light launches a [[SWAT]] team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.&lt;ref name=c74/&gt;

Mello invades [[List of Death Note characters#SPK (Special Provision for Kira)|SPK]]—an organization that aims to catch Kira—to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules,&lt;ref name=c77/&gt; which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light.&lt;ref name=c78/&gt; Mello then enlists the help of his friend [[List of Death Note characters#Matt|Matt]] to spy on [[Misa Amane]], suspecting she is helping Kira.&lt;ref name=c83/&gt; After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap [[Kiyomi Takada]], Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity.&lt;ref name=c98/&gt; Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do in such a situation.&lt;ref name=c99/&gt; Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; [[Teru Mikami]] uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.&lt;ref name=c104/&gt;

=== In the live-action drama ===
In [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|the live-action television drama]], Mello is portrayed by [[Mio Yūki]]. A major change is made to this character; Mello is the other half of Near. He lives inside of Near's body. A puppet of Mello is seen in Near's hand. After knowing that L is killed, Mello possesses Near and teams up with Himura. Mello takes Himura's help to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]] in order to obtain the Death Note. Light Yagami makes Himura to blow up Mello's hideout with the help of Death Note. Mello survives the bombing and, over the phone, vows to expose Light as Kira. Light plans another ambush with the task force and Japanese police in order to defeat Mello. Later, Light meets with Misa and Mikami and orders them to kill the task force and Mello respectively. During the ambush, Light confronts Mello in a warehouse, who reverts to his Near personality. Near reveals that he pretended to be taken over by Mello as part of a plan to expose Mikami as the current Kira.

===In other media===
Aside from the initial manga, Mello appears in other media based on ''Death Note''. He serves as the narrator of [[Nisio Isin]]'s [[light novel]] ''[[Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases]]''.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt; He is featured in two video games; in ''Death Note: L o Tsugu Mono'',&lt;ref name=game1/&gt; he can serve as Kira or Kira's accomplice,&lt;ref name=game2/&gt; and in the ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''-based [[fighting game]] ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', he is a support character.&lt;ref name=jus/&gt; Mello also appears in the animated special ''Death Note: Relight 2: L's Successors'', which retells the second half of the anime. In it, his story is almost the same, the only exception is that Mello's involvement with the mafia is removed.&lt;ref name=relight/&gt;

==Creation and conception==
[[Tsugumi Ohba]], ''Death Note''{{'}}s writer, introduced [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and Mello together because he felt L individually could not defeat Kira and that introducing only one new character would produce a "repeat" of the struggle between Light and L. Ohba asked [[Takeshi Obata]], artist of the series, to make both characters look "a little 'L-ish.'" Ohba "wavered" in their ages and considered making the characters the sons of L.&lt;ref name=HowtoThink64/&gt; As Ohba wanted to "include a little L" in Near and Mello, Obata tried to keep "the weirdness and the panda eyes". Since L is an important character, Obata felt that he had made Near and Mello look too much like L. When he first heard about Near and Mello, Obata assumed that they would join as a team and work together, so he envisioned the two as twins, describing the creation of the character designs as "a major struggle". At first, he tried to depict Mello as having "more energy than Near".&lt;ref name=drawingdesign134/&gt; However, the designs for the characters became switched at a later phase; the final Mello had Near's design and vice versa. When Obata created the designs, his editor wrote the wrong names to accompany them; when Obata received approval for the designs, it was too late to point out that the labels were incorrect. Initially, for him, Mello was "more calm and feminine", but later he felt that "it's better" that the switch occurred.&lt;ref name=drawingdesign135/&gt;

Ohba did not initially develop Mello and Near's personalities as he wanted to "reveal" them through their actions.&lt;ref name=HowtoThink64/&gt; He added the chocolate trait because he believed that chocolate "represented all sweets" and that the trait would fit with the story arc in the United States.&lt;ref name=HowtoThink66/&gt; Obata designed Mello's clothing based on clothes he enjoys drawing, which includes "shiny" leather.&lt;ref name=drawingdesign134/&gt; At first, Mello's hair was cut straight across; Obata preferred Mello's hair becoming messy, which occurred later in the story. Obata became grateful when Ohba added the scar since he felt that he could draw Mello "looking cooler".&lt;ref name=drawingdesign134/&gt; Ohba added Mello's scar to the thumbnails as the trait would give him "more depth";&lt;ref name=HowtoThink69/&gt; he further added Mello looks "more intense" and "more human" with the scar.&lt;ref name=HTR179/&gt; After drawing Mello's updated appearance with the scar, Obata "finally [felt that he could draw Mello] really well". Obata said that the fact that Ohba and Obata did not regularly meet in person was for the best, because if Obata had told Ohba about his satisfaction with Mello's new appearance, Ohba might not have killed Mello.&lt;ref name=HTR179/&gt; However, Obata felt sad when Mello died in the story shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=drawingdesign134/&gt;

Ohba considered having Mello be the character who ultimately defeats Light. According to Ohba, after the disappearance of Sidoh, the writer "struggled" with Mello's role. Ohba's idea of Mello ultimately defeating Light and Near, being "the best", was strong in his mind, but once Mello had "learned too much about the Death Note", he had to kill him to "sustain the intensity of the story". As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a "large role" at the conclusion of ''Death Note'' and instead had Mello negatively affect Light "indirectly". Ohba gave Mello a "very plain" death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished "dramatically" it would reveal the truth behind his death.&lt;ref name=HowtoThink68/&gt;

==Reception==
Merchandise based on his character has been released, including action figures and plush dolls.&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=merc2/&gt;&lt;ref name=merc3/&gt; Moreover, several publications for manga and anime have commented on Mello's character. Referring to Mello and Near's introduction, Julie Rosato of Mania.com said the "focus on both makes for a clash of attitudes and rough transitions".&lt;ref name=rosato/&gt; However, as they were introduced in the anime, [[IGN]]'s Tom S. Pepirium criticized how it is not explained "what Mello is doing and how it differs from Near's story".&lt;ref name=pepirium/&gt; Writing for Active Anime, Holly Ellingwood stated they "truly represent – Light's newest and greatest enemies",&lt;ref name=aa/&gt; while Briana Lawrence from [[Anime News Network]] said both could be "much better characters" if they were treated as individuals instead of "different halves of L".&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |title=Death Note GN 12 |date=August 5, 2007 |author=Lawrence, Briana |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpQyOi5j?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |archivedate=July  5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erin Finnegan from Pop Culture Shock praised ''[[Death Note: The Last Name]]'' for the absence of Mello and Near.&lt;ref name=finnegan/&gt;

Anime News Network's Casey Brienza stressed Mello's presence as a narrator in the light novel "makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self-conscious in others".&lt;ref name=bb/&gt; A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, "a man of action", "spiced things up a bit" as he brought "actually" action to the series.&lt;ref name=sparrow1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sparrow2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sparrow3/&gt; Manga News said Mello is "an interesting character" as he is "unpredictable" and also praised the action scenes he brings.&lt;ref name=mn9/&gt;&lt;ref name=mn12/&gt; As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is "one of the few to bring some new blood to the series".&lt;ref name=mn11/&gt; After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote "Mello deserved more."&lt;ref name=pepirium2/&gt; On the other hand, Mello is "an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com.&lt;ref name=beveridge/&gt; ''AnimeLand'' and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.&lt;ref name=aland/&gt;&lt;ref name=mn10/&gt;

== Activism ==

An intersex and trans activist for over 30 years, Jiménez started her activism in feminist and LGBT movements in Latin America,&lt;ref name="astraea" /&gt; and speaks at a range of national and international human rights institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/news/voices-lgbti-defenders |title=Voices of LGBTI Defenders |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 26, 2015 |website= |publisher=[[International Service for Human Rights]] |access-date=2015-07-03 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas'', Rosa-Linda Fregoso and Cynthia Bejarando Jímenez remarks,

'''O'Shea''' is a [[country music]] duo formed by husband and wife team Mark O'Shea (born 16 February 1977) and Jay O'Shea (previously Kylie Smith, born 17 January 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/country-music-star-jay-oshea-discovers-her-birth-father-is-midnight-oils-rob-hirst/news-story/d8d4e37e1c17f0d4ecf771dd3308c6a4|title=Rocker's secret love child revealed|website=''news.com.au''|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since relocating to [[Nashville]] in 2007, the duo has seen success as artists and songwriters, and also as finalists in the [[Country Music Television]] series ''[[Can You Duet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/series/can_you_duet/episodes.jhtml|title=CMT : Can You Duet : Episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early careers==
Individually Mark and Jay have both seen success as independent artists as their career has taken them across the globe. Originally from [[Dalby, Queensland]] Mark had begun his musical career at an early age by winning the Gympie Music Muster talent competition in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/120094495/|title=The Sydney Morning Herald from Sydney, New South Wales on September 5, 1993 &amp;middot; Page 147|website=''newspapers.com''|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/119768495/|title=The Sydney Morning Herald from Sydney, New South Wales on June 26, 1994 &amp;middot; Page 169|website=''newspapers.com''|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a record deal he signed at age 17. His debut album earned Mark two Golden Guitar awards from the CMAA for Best New Talent of the Year (1996) for the track "The Swimming Song"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/53-1996 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409214914/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/53-1996 |archivedate=9 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Best Video (1997) for "The Dreamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/54-1997 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409214921/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/54-1997 |archivedate=9 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Mark left his solo career to form rock/pop group [[Zinc (band)|Zinc]] that signed with Los Angeles-based label, Trauma. The band's first single released in Australia, "The Morning After" (co-written with Mark Hudson), reached No.&amp;nbsp;22 on the [[ARIA Charts]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jennie (30 September 2004), "Zinc invades the airwaves – Band bids to break into pop music mainstream", ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Mark toured as a guitarist for artist [[Ronn Moss]] and also had his own song "When We Kissed" recorded and released on Moss' ''Uncovered'' album in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronnmoss-uncovered.com/3/miscellaneous2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715201807/http://www.ronnmoss-uncovered.com/3/miscellaneous2.htm |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her musical endeavours, Jay also toured the UK and Europe with the Australian Dance-Drill team at age 15.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.addt.com.au/highligh.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iacmusic.com/artist.aspx?id=24124|title=Jay at IACmusic.com, presented by Independent Artists Company – Unsigned – Band Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Jay signed her first publishing deal with Warner Chappell London. While working in London, Jay co-wrote "Rutinas" with Wendy Page and Jim Marr. It became the hit single on [[Chenoa]]'s album ''[[Nada Es Igual (Chenoa album)|Nada Es Igual]]'' and reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 on the Spanish chart in 2005.

==Forming O'Shea==

{{for|the journal ''Nuncius''|Nuncius (journal)}}
An '''apostolic nuncio''' (also known as a '''papal nuncio''' or simply as a '''nuncio''') is an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] [[diplomat]], serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the [[Holy See]] to a [[Sovereign state|state]] or to an international organization. A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See, and is the head of the [[diplomatic mission]], called an [[Apostolic Nunciature]], which is the equivalent of an [[embassy]]. The Holy See is legally distinct from the [[Vatican City]] or the [[Catholic Church]]. A nuncio is usually an [[archbishop#Titular archiepiscopal sees|archbishop]].

An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of [[ambassador]] extraordinary and [[plenipotentiary]], although in [[Catholic countries]] the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps|deanship of that country's diplomatic corps]] to the nuncio regardless of seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities | title=[[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], Article 16 |publisher=United Nations |date=1961-04-18 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The representative of the Holy See in some situations is called a Delegate or, in the case of the United Nations, Permanent Observer. In the Holy See hierarchy, these usually rank equally to a nuncio, but they do not have formal diplomatic status, though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges.

In addition, the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation, supervising the diocesan episcopate (usually a national [[conference of bishops]] which has its own chairman, usually the highest-ranking bishop or archbishop, especially if his seat carries the title of [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] or he has individually been created a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]) and has an important role in the selection of bishops.

== Terminology and history ==
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
The name nuncio is derived from the ancient [[Latin]] word, ''nuntius'', meaning "envoy" or "messenger".

Formerly, the title '''(Apostolic) Internuncio''' denoted a papal diplomatic representative of the second class, corresponding to [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] as a title for diplomatic representatives of states (cf. Article 14, par. 2 of the Vienna Convention). Before 1829, Internuncio was the title applied instead to the ''ad interim'' head of a mission when one Nuncio had left office and his replacement had not yet assumed it.

A [[legate a latere]] is a temporary papal representative or a representative for a special purpose.

Historically, the most important type of [[apocrisiary]] (a title also applying to representatives exchanged by a high prelate with a Patriarch) was the equivalent of a nuncio, sent by the Pope to the [[Byzantine Empire]]; during the fifth and sixth centuries, when much of [[Italy]] remained under Byzantine control, several [[Pope]]s were former apocrisiaries.

'''Pro-nuncio''' was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and ''de jure'' deanship of the Diplomatic Corps. In those countries, the papal representative's precedence within the corps is exactly on a par with that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps.

In countries with whom the Holy See does not have diplomatic ties, an '''Apostolic Delegate''' may be sent to act as a liaison with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in that country, though not accredited to its government. Apostolic delegates have the same ecclesiastical rank as nuncios, but have no formal diplomatic status, though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges. For example, an apostolic delegate served as the Holy See's ''de facto'' diplomatic representative to the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], until both major Anglo-Saxon states with a predominantly Protestant tradition established full-fledged relations with the Holy See in the late twentieth century, allowing for the appointment of a Papal Nuncio (see the list of [[British Ambassadors to the Holy See]]). Archbishop [[Pio Laghi]], for example, was first apostolic delegate, then pro-nuncio, to the United States during the [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]] presidencies.

Apostolic delegates are also sent to regions such as the [[West Indies]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|islands of the Pacific]]. These delegates are also appointed nuncio to at least some of the many states covered by their delegation, but the area entrusted to them also contains one or more territories that either are not independent states or are states that do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See.

Article 16 of the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] provides:
# Heads of mission shall take precedence in their respective classes in the order of the date and time of taking up their functions in accordance with Article 13.
# Alterations in the credentials of a head of mission not involving any change of class shall not affect his precedence.
# This article is without prejudice to any practice accepted by the receiving State regarding the precedence of the representative of the Holy See.

In accordance with this article, many states (even not predominantly Catholic ones such as Germany and Switzerland and including the great majority in central and western Europe and in the Americas) give precedence to the Nuncio over other diplomatic representatives, according him the position of [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]] reserved in other countries for the longest-serving resident ambassador.

== Multilateral ==
A [[Holy See Representative]] is accredited to an international organisation (mostly UN-related or regional) where other states dispatch a [[Permanent Representative]], usually at ambassadorial level ([[Titular Archbishop]], equivalent a papal Nuncio).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16816">'''Ralph Fasanella''' (September 2, 1914 – December 16, 1997) was a self-taught painter whose large, detailed works depicted urban working life and critiqued post-[[World War II]] [[United States|America]].
==Early life==
Ralph Fasanella was born to Joseph and Ginevra (Spagnoletti), Italian immigrants, in the [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] on [[Labor Day]] in 1914. He was the third of six children. His father delivered ice to local homes. His mother worked in a neighborhood dress shop drilling holes into buttons, and spent her spare time as an anti-[[fascism|fascist]] activist.

Fasanella spent much of his youth delivering ice with his father from a horse-driven wagon. This experience deeply impressed him.  He saw his father as representative of all working men, beaten down day after day and struggling for survival. "Fasanella later said that the compositional density of his pictures was influenced by the experience of helping his father deliver ice, which involved removing all the food from customers' refrigerators and arranging it in neatly ordered stacks."&lt;ref name="Smith, 1997"&gt;Smith, ''New York Times,'' December 18, 1997, p. B14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasanella's mother was a literate, sensitive, progressive woman. She instilled in Fasanella a strong sense of social justice and political awareness. Fasanella began accompanying his mother when she worked on anti-fascist and [[trade union]] causes. Fasanella also helped his mother publish and distribute a small [[Italian language|Italian]]-language, anti-fascist newspaper to help support the family.

Joseph Fasanella abandoned his family and returned to [[Italy]] in the 1920s. This increased the influence Fasanella's mother had over young Ralph, but it also led to some behavioral problems.

Fasanella served two stints in reform schools run by the Catholic Church for truancy and running away from home. He later said he was sexually abused ("used as a girl") by the priests.&lt;ref name="Saltz, 2002"&gt;Saltz, ''Village Voice,'' June 10th, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences instilled a deep dislike for authority and reinforced Fasanella's hatred for anything which broke people's spirits. Fasanella later depicted his experience in reform school in a painting titled ''Lineup at the Protectory 2'' (1961). The melancholy image features rows of boys standing at attention, watched over by scowling, ominous-looking priests. Fasanella quit school after the sixth grade.

During the [[Great Depression]], Fasanella worked as a textile worker in garment factories and as a truck driver. He became a member of [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]] (UE) Local 1227 while working as a machinist in [[Brooklyn]]. He became strongly aware of the growing economic and social injustice in the U.S., as well as the plight and powerlessness of the working class.

In late 1930s, Ralph Fasanella volunteered to fight in the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]], an American paramilitary force fighting to support the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the successful fascist rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]].

==Union organizing career==
After the Spanish Civil War, Fasanella returned to the United States, where he began organizing labor unions.

Fasanella joined the UE staff in 1940. He organized a [[Western Electric]] manufacturing plant in [[Manhattan]], a Sperry Gyroscope factory, and a number of other electrical equipment and machine plants in and around New York City. One of his later paintings shows a union organizing committee meeting being held in a UE hall.

It was during a UE organizing drive in 1940 that Fasanella first began to draw.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dantealighieri.net/cambridge/AmIta_art.html |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510090356/http://www.dantealighieri.net/cambridge/AmIta_art.html |archivedate=May 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasanella married Matilda Weiss in 1943. The short-lived marriage ended in 1944.

==Painting career==
In the mid-1940s, Fasanella began to suffer from intense finger pain caused by [[arthritis]].  A union co-worker suggested that he take up painting as a way to exercise his fingers and ease the pain.

In 1945, Fasanella persuaded the UE to organize painting classes for its members at a local college.  He was one of the first members to sign up for classes.

Fasanella became consumed by art, and left labor union organizing to paint full-time. To pay the bills, he bought a service station and worked there.

Fasanella's painting focused on city life, men and women at work, union meetings, strikes, sit-ins and baseball games. He quickly developed a style which spoke to workers and the poor through the use of familiar details.  Fasanella improvised a quasi-surrealist style, depicting interiors and exteriors or past and future simultaneously. He painted canvases as big as 10 feet across because he envisioned his paintings hanging in large union meeting halls.

" 'I always felt embarrassed by the whole thing,' he said, 'but I had to do it.' "&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Saltz, ''Village Voice,'' June 10th, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasanella's art was highly improvisational.  He never planned out works, and rarely revised them.  He said of his 1948 painting ''May Day'', it "just came out of my belly. I never planned it. I don't know how I did it."&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

His first solo show was at the ACA Galleries in New York City in 1948. One of his first sales was to choreographer [[Jerome Robbins]].

In 1950, Fasanella married Eva Lazorek, a school teacher. They had a son, Marc, and a daughter, Gina.

Fasanella's opinionated, leftist-oriented artwork caused him to be blacklisted among art dealers and galleries during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]. His wife supported him by teaching school.

Fasanella's work, however, remained largely unknown for nearly 30 years. While he was acknowledged within labor and leftist circles, his art remained more of a popular curiosity.

===Late public acclaim===
A self-proclaimed folk-art dealer "discovered" Fasanella in 1972.

On October 30, 1972, Fasanella appeared on the cover of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine. The cover depicted him wearing a work shirt and standing in his tiny studio. Accompanying the photo was the headline: "This man pumps gas in the Bronx for a living. He may also be the best primitive painter since [[Grandma Moses]]."&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/uen_0198_fasanella.html "Artist, Former UE Organizer, Ralph Fasanella Dies"], ''UE News'', January 1998. The source does not describe the ''New York'' magazine in as much detail as here (2015-09-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York'' magazine cover catapulted Fasanella to national fame.

Fasanella was happy with his fame, but dismissed descriptions of his work as [[primitivism|primitive]]. Fasanella said it was not possible to be primitive in a [[post-industrial society]]. Critic John Berger agreed, pointing out Fasanella's left-liberal critique of urban living, "the violence of the daily necessity of the streets .. the way that the density of the working population makes itself felt."&lt;ref name="Smith, 1997"/&gt;

In 1972 he appeared in a major interview, with anchor Patrick Watson, on WNET Channel XIII's groundbreaking newshour ''The Fifty-First State.'' This led to the publishers Alfred Knopf and Company, under chief editor Robert Gottlieb, to commission Watson to write the book ''Fasanella's City,'' which was richly produced, with superb four-colour reproductions of the artist's work.

Now Fasanella's art began to sell. He appeared on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' and ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' with [[Charles Kuralt]], and his work appeared in several documentary films (including one about baseball).  A large number of exhibits traveled the U.S. His work brought new respect for folk, urban and working-class art, and encouraged the emerging field of labor culture studies.

Fasanella spent three years in Massachusetts in the mid-1970s. He lived in an $18-a-week room at the [[YMCA]] while completing 18 canvases. He produced several very large paintings of New England mill towns, three of which depicted the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912. He also produced a painting of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], and violent, blood-red image of the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]].

In 1986, [[Ron Carver (organizer)|Ron Carver]], a union organizer, founded a non-profit organization called Public Domain to raise money and acquire Fasanella works so that they could be displayed in public rather than private collections.  Carver was inspired by Fasanella himself, who declared, "I didn't paint my paintings to hang in some rich guy's living room."&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

===Notable public displays===
Fasanella's 5-foot by 10-foot painting, ''Lawrence 1912: The Great Strike'' (also titled ''Bread and Roses - Lawrence, 1912'') was purchased by donations from 15 labor unions and the [[AFL-CIO]]. It was loaned to the [[United States Congress]], where it hung for years in the [[Rayburn Office Building]] in the hearing room of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Subcommittee on Labor and Education]]. Following the 1994 elections, a staffer for the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority in Congress had the painting removed from the hearing room and returned to the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper reports at the time said the Republican staffer who ordered the removal of the painting had "little grasp of history and even less of art." Saltz, ''Village Voice,'' June 10th, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The work now hangs at the [[Labor Museum and Learning Center]] in [[Flint, Michigan]].

In 1995, Fasanella's 1950 painting, ''Subway Riders'', was installed in the [[Fifth Avenue / 53rd Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Fifth Avenue / 53rd Street]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] station.

Fasanella's ''Family Supper'' is currently on permanent display in the Great Hall at [[Ellis Island]].

===Reputation and death===
By the end of his life, many of the causes Fasanella fought for no longer enjoyed public favor or had been lost. Fasanella himself lamented the decline in the relevance of his work. "It's over. What I wanted to do was to paint great big canvases about the spirit we used to have in the movement and then go around the country showing them in union halls. When I started these paintings I had no idea that when they were all finished there wouldn't be any union halls in which to show them."&lt;ref name="Saltz, 2002"/&gt;

It quickly became apparent that much of the public fascination for Fasanella's work had relied on the political and socio-economic messages they contained rather than their artistic appeal. As those messages fell from favor, Fasanella was abandoned by many of his strongest supporters. As he told one reporter: "The other day, I called an old lefty pal at [[1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East|1199]] (the drug and hospital workers' union) and offered them my stuff. 'Forget it Ralph,' he said to me. 'We don't want your stuff.'"&lt;ref name="Saltz, 2002"/&gt;

At his death, however, he had regained a small measure of popularity. In a press release regarding his death, John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, declared Fasanella to be "a true artist of the people in the tradition of Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie."&lt;ref name="Saltz"&gt;{{cite web | last=Saltz | first=Jerry | title=Working-Class Hero | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0224,saltz,35544,13.html | work=The Village Voice | location=New York | publisher=Village Voice, LLC | date=June 11, 2002 | accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrospective at the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in 2014 presented critics and the public with an opportunity to reassess Fasanella's art and its place in postwar American culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkartmuseum.org/fasanella "Ralph Fasanella: Lest We Forget"], 
2014 exhibition, [[American Folk Art Museum]]. Retrieved 2015-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical assessment==
Critics praise Fasanella for utilizing bold images and strong colors:
:His paintings—bold, colorful, loaded with detail yet unified in composition—speak powerfully of a distinct working-class identity and culture, and of the [[dignity of labor]]. They capture the past and express hope for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fenimoreartmuseum.org/exhibitions/fasanella.htm |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708184330/http://www.fenimoreartmuseum.org/exhibitions/fasanella.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasanella is also cited for being able to create deeply detailed works with highly individualized parts, yet unifying these scenes into a coherent single image.  "Typically, his paintings have hundreds, if not thousands, of individually painted people and buildings. But Fasanella's people are never individuals. They're always seen en masse."&lt;ref name="Saltz, 2002"/&gt;

Some critics have argued that Fasanella's world is one of simplistic nostalgia for a past that never really existed. But his supporters point to the "anger, anxiety and agitation" which can be found not only in some of the subjects he depicts (strikes, sit-ins) but in the subtle details of his canvases (such as the angry marchers in his ''May Day''). "He has done what he set out to do, paint the heroism of the working class in the organizing struggles of the thirties and the forties and the continuing struggles, the joys and sorrows and the hopes that make up the lives of workers and their families."&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===

A [[mameluke]] of [[Hammuda ibn Ali]], of high rank in the palace at [[Le Bardo]], he passed into the service of the prince [[Hussein II Bey|Hussein]] as Keeper of the Seals and secretary when he became crown prince again in 1815. He accompanied him several times in the military column charged with collecting tribute from the Tunisian tribes and became his son-in-law.

=== Grand Vizier ===
When Hussein acceded to the throne in 1824, it was entirely natural that al-Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a became his [[Head of Government of Tunisia|Grand Vizier]] and councillor (in 1829).&lt;ref name="chakir"/&gt; However he had to deal with the powerful commander in chief of the army and son-in-law- of [[Mahmud ibn Muhammad|Mahmud Bey]], general [[Slimane Kahia]]. Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a was an important supporter of the policy of autonomy from the [[Ottoman Empire]] which Hussein II attempted to institute. Likewise, during the [[French conquest of Algeria]], he strongly encouraged the Bey not to break relations with [[France]], but to attempt to profit from Paris and the French consul at Tunis, whose influence on the Bey grew ever greater. He restored, for a time, the finances of the state - at the price of violent exactions and extortions from the producers and exporters of [[olive oil]]. He allied with the [[Makhzen]] family of Ben Ayed in an export enterprise which became the source of his fortune. As a result, the [[Djellouli family]], previously empowered by an alliance with [[Yusuf Sahib al-Tabi]] found themselves in difficulty as a result of the economic crisis of 1830, fell deep in debt and were completely [[bankrupt]] ten years later; the son of [[Mahmoud Djellouli]] sought refuge in [[Malta]] for several years and while he regained his family's administrative roles he did not return to the commercial ventures which were the source of their fortune.

In 1830, Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a persuaded the Bey to respond to the Ottoman Sultan's calls for reform and to institute the first regiments of a regular army, drawn entirely from the best young men in the Turkish militia of Tunis and trained by European instructors. In January 1831, the first regiment was created, composed of several battalions of infantry, a battalion of artillery with 150 men, and a battalion of engineers with 120 men. The soldiers were dressed and armed in the European fashion and formed the original core of the modern Tunisian army, continuing in the reign of [[Ahmed I Bey]].

After the death of Hussein II in 1835, Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a began to cultivate a strong influence on his successor and younger brother [[Mustafa ibn Mahmud|Mustafa Bey]] who retained him as Grand vizier, but removed him from his position as Keeper of the Seals. Shakir Sahib at-Taba'a pushed the Bey to carry out many bold but very unpopular reforms, such as general [[conscription]] from the population of large towns.

Protests eventually dissuaded the Bey from continuing these reformes, but Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a's role as minister did not end, sue to his great power and influence at court. Moreover, Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a maintained a policy of rapprochment with the Ottoman government in order to counter the growing power of European merchants who were under the protection of the French and English consuls. His reforming spirit and authoritarianism had a powerful influence on the Bey's son, the future [[Ahmed I Bey]]. Once in power he revived the reforms of Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a, especially in the realm of military affairs.

During the olive oil crisis during the winter of 1833/1834, he repressed a revolt at [[Kairouan]] in violation of the holy city's traditional [[right of asylum]] and imposed a fine of more than 500,000 [[Tunisian rial|rial]]. Another agricultural crisis of less moment arose at [[Bizerte]] in 1837, he once more repressed the revolt of a population squeezed by the weight of taxes.

=== Assassination ===

Mustafa Bey, whose suspiscions were encouraged by his entourage and especially by the French consul, decided to execute him. Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a was strangled in the corridor of Le Bardo palace on 11 September 1837, as he went to meet the Bey.&lt;ref name="dhiaf"/&gt; A telling sign is that he was assassinated during a visit to Le Bardo by the French consul and the admiral [[Julien Pierre Anne Lalande|Lalande]] on a special mission to Tunis. Shakir Sahib al-Taba'a was immediately replaced by [[Mustafa Sahib at-Taba'a]], the oldest minister, although it was [[Mustapha Khaznadar]] who became the dominant personage at court.

== Legacy ==

Sahib at-Taba'a possessed large agricultural estates throughout the country, notably in the [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], where he supported its economy and helped to bring an end to the economic troubles in the olive oil industry.&lt;ref name="chakir"/&gt; He owned 2112 olive treesat [[M'saken]], where he built a [[seraglio]], known as the "Seraglio of General Makroun". In addition to his ministerial duties he was [[qaid]] of Sahel (uniting the qaidats of [[Sousse]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]] from 1836 to 1837.

'''Shanna the She-Devil''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Jungle girl|jungle adventurer]] superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Carole Seuling]] and [[penciller]] [[George Tuska]], she made her [[first appearance]] in ''Shanna the She-Devil'' #1 (Dec. 1972).

==Publication history==
''Shanna the She-Devil'' was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'' and ''[[Tigra|Claws of the Cat]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]]
{{blockquote|...had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for ways to expand our franchise. My idea ... was to try to get women to write them. ... I thought of my friend [[Carole Seuling]], who had done a bit of writing for her ex-husband Phil in conjunction with [[Comic Art Convention|his comic cons]]. I approached her to do the ''Shanna'' book because I knew she liked jungle comics and adventure comics.   ... I put [[Ross Andru]] on as the ''Shanna'' artist [beginning with issue #2], with [[Vince Colletta|Vinnie Colletta]] inking to make Ross' Shanna look attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Thomas interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #70 (July 1970): pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seuling in 2010 recalled,"My instructions were to make [Shanna] someone who would fit in with the times and also was prone to a little more violence than [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]] or the other [[Jungle girl|jungle queens]] of the past."&lt;ref name=bip4&gt;{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|title= Shanna: And a Jungle Queen is Born|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 43|page= 4|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With veteran [[penciler]] [[George Tuska]], she created the lead character and her two leopard companions, as well as [[game warden]] and potential romantic interest Patrick McShane, loosely based on after actor [[Patrick McGoohan]]'s game-warden character in the film ''[[Nor the Moon by Night]]''.&lt;ref name=bip5&gt;Seuling in Buttery, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Steve Gerber]], in his first assignment for Marvel Comics,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gerber in letters page, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #115 (Nov. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; supplied additional dialogue for that first issue, as well as the next. Seuling explained,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Steve Gerber did not collaborate with me on the scripts or the origin story, but he added some additional dialogue since Stan [Lee] and Roy [Thomas] thought the stories were a bit light on the talking.&lt;ref name=bip5 /&gt;

However, ... Steve Gerber was not one of the creators. He provided additional dialogue for the first two [issues] and then took over when I left [after four issues]. ... Gerber himself, before he died a few years ago, denied that he had any part in Shanna's origin.&lt;ref name=bip6&gt;Seuling in Buttery, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This initial series ran five issues (Dec. 1972 - Aug. 1973), with [[Jim Steranko]] drawing the covers of #1-2, [[John Buscema]] and [[Joe Sinnott]] of issue #3, and [[John Romita Sr.]] of the final two issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/2061/ ''Shanna the She-Devil'' (Marvel, 1972 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The character went on to a series of guest appearances, first in the jungle lord comic ''[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]'' #1 (Jan. 1974); then in a storyline running through the [[superhero]] comics ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #109-111 (May–July 1974) and ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #3 (May 1974), which supplied additional details about Shanna's past and family, and notes McShane's murder by the [[supervillainess]] [[Nekra]] in the interim; in ''Daredevil'' #117 (Jan. 1975); and in a Ka-Zar story in the black-and-white, mature-audience comics magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #8 (Jan. 1975).&lt;ref name=buttery-bip6&gt;Buttery, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanna then starred in two solo stories in ''Savage Tales'' #9-10 (March &amp; May 1975) by writer Carla Conway (assisted by then-husband [[Gerry Conway]] on the former), with pencil art by, respectively, [[Tony DeZuniga]] and Ross Andru.&lt;ref name=shannagcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/character/name/shanna%20the%20she-devil/sort/chrono/ Shanna the She-Devil] (character) at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; In the first of these two stories, Shanna's leopards Ina and Biri are killed. Gerry Conway recalled in 2010 that this "was part of the strategy to make her a stronger, fiercer character in the ''Savage Tales'' mode. It also raised the stakes for her personally, and by eliminating these 'rivals' for her affections opened her up to a relationship with Ka-Zar",&lt;ref name=buttery-bip6 /&gt; whom she would eventually marry, in ''Ka-Zar the Savage #29 (Dec. 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Buttery, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Shanna starred in a backup story in ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'' #9 (June 1978), by writer Gerber and artist DeZuniga.&lt;ref name=shannagcd /&gt; She then starred in several eight-page solo stories in the omnibus title ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', beginning with a tale by writer-artist [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] in issue #13 (Late Feb. 1989), followed by the 10-part "The Bush of Ghosts", by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and penciler [[Paul Gulacy]] in issues #68-77 (Jan.-Late May 1991).&lt;ref name=shannagcd /&gt;

Dovetailing with the end of that run came four full-length stories begun in 1978, completing plot threads from Shanna's solo story in ''The Rampaging Hulk'' #9. Written by Gerber and penciled by [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Bret Blevins]] (two stories, the first credited as "A. Novice") and DeZuniga, these non-chronological, essentially flashback stories ran in ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #56-59 (April-Oct. 1991).&lt;ref name=shannagcd /&gt; The title's editor, [[Al Milgrom]], unearthed the unpublished stories because
{{blockquote|I would scour the office looking for gems [that] I could publish in ''Fanfare'' and I found the first part of Steve's Shanna story completely penciled by Carmine Infantino. There were also complete scripts for the second and third installments. So I called Steve up and said, ... 'I want to know going in that I can get you to finish the storyline.' Steve replied that he'd be happy to do so. ... [Regarding the art,] Carmine's a great designer but he doesn't draw the most sensuous women. ... I had been doing some work with Bret Blevins, who did great-looking girls, so I asked him if he'd be interested in inking an Infantino story. ... I think I told Bret that if he inked the first issue, he could pencil the following chapters. Bret was keen to ink his own pencils[, which] slowed him down. ... Steve turned in the fourth chapter — 13 years after he'd started the story. Bret couldn't handle the deadline for the final chapter, so I asked Tony DeZuniga."&lt;ref&gt;Buttery, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marvel has also published [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] versions of Shanna, unrelated except for the name.

Shanna was featured in the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' book titled ''[[Savage Wolverine]]''. The new series, written and drawn by [[Frank Cho]], debuted in January 2013. The title is a team-up story with Shanna and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as they try to survive the [[Savage Land]] together.&lt;ref name="Wolverine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19510/marvel_now_qa_savage_wolverine |title=Marvel NOW!

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Shanna2.jpg|left|thumb|''Shanna the She-Devil'' #2 (Feb. 1973). Cover art by [[Jim Steranko]].&lt;!--per Grand Comics Database--&gt;]]
'''Shanna O'Hara, Lady Plunder''' is the daughter of a diamond miner named Gerald O'Hara. Born in [[Africa]], she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the [[jungle]]s of [[Zaire]]. At the age of six, her father went to kill a rogue [[leopard]] that belonged to her mother, Patricia O'Hara. While hunting for the leopard, Shanna's father accidentally killed her mother. This traumatic incident led to Shanna's lifelong crusade against the use of [[firearms]]. After the incident, Shanna moved back to the [[United States]] to live with relatives. Shanna grows up to become an accomplished Olympic athlete, specializing in [[competitive swimming]] and [[track and field]]. She then became a licensed [[veterinarian]].

After completing college, Shanna began to work for the [[Central Park Zoo|Central Park Municipal Zoo]] in [[New York City]] as a [[zoology|zoologist]]. While working at the [[zoo]], Shanna raised many [[animal]]s, including a female leopard named Julani. During this period another shock to her system came when Julani was shot and killed by a zoo guard. The following day, the zoo director proposes Shanna take Julani's cubs, '''Ina''' and '''Biri''' — [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] names meaning "bright" and "black", respectively&lt;ref name = bip4 /&gt; — to the [[Dahomey]] Reserve in Africa.

While in Africa, Shanna becomes more attuned to nature, patrolling the jungle and living freely in the wild lands. She begins to wear Julani's fur [[pelage|pelt]] as a sight-and-sense cue to help with the raising of the cubs. In the jungle, Shanna becomes more and more at home with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the [[Nature reserve|reserve]] from [[poaching|poachers]] as Shanna the She-Devil.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During her stay in Africa, her father is [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]]. Shanna searches for him until the wizard [[Malgato]] [[kidnapping|kidnaps]] her to the [[Savage Land]], a [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric]] jungle within [[Antarctica]]. She escapes with the help of Lord Kevin Plunder, a.k.a. the jungle lord [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. Shanna returns to Africa to look for her father, and learns he was killed by the Mandrill. Seeking revenge, she goes to North America to aid [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] in stopping the Mandrill and [[Nekra]]'s plan to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #109-112 (May-Aug. 1974), ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #3 (May 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Shanna travels between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and the Savage Land, finally returning to Africa only to find Ina and Biri have been killed by a religious cult leader named Raga-Shah. After a short grieving period in North America, Shanna tracks and kills Raga-Shah by feeding him to her python Ananta. Around this time, she begins therapy with [[psychologist]] Dr. Dorothy Betz.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Shanna returned to the Savage Land and became Ka-Zar's lover. They discovered their lost world was only part of a larger realm, Pangea, filled with wondrous races. The couple's relationship was tempestuous: Shanna married Mele of the Botor who died in a hunting accident while with Ka-Zar. Shanna was also targeted by the demonic [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] (who felt she resembled his lost love Beatrice). When Ka-Zar was seemingly killed while they were in New York, a distraught Shanna rampaged, was institutionalized, and nearly romanced [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. Shanna was rescued by a revived Ka-Zar, aided by Spider-Man, and the two returned to Antarctica, where they were married despite interference from Belasco and others. They employed the native warrior woman Zhira as nanny and protector of their son Matthew.

They survived the temporary destruction of the Savage Land by Terminus and its later re-creation by the [[High Evolutionary]] and [[Garokk]].

Shanna briefly attained a mystical bond to the spirit of Africa, foiling Sir Guy Cross-Wallace who slaughtered and consumed wildlife, seeking the bond himself to rule the continent. Shanna was also briefly given power over the natural world by the High Evolutionary. Together, Ka-Zar and Shanna fight to preserve the Savage Land from external threats and from pollution by technology.

Shanna and Ka-Zar find [[Skrull]]s mining the rare metal [[vibranium]] in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until it is hit by a dart that causes it to regress to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli. Shanna then kills Pit'o Nilli.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #42&lt;/ref&gt; Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land while Ka-Zar heads with the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers to New York to fight the Skrulls.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 5 #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] branding in the pages of ''[[Savage Wolverine]]'', Shanna agrees to guide to a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to a mysterious island within the Savage Land. A dampening field generator causes the transport to crash, and all the agents are killed by the native Neanderthals. At the same time, Wolverine crashes on the island,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cho, Frank]] (w, a). "Savage Part 1", ''Savage Wolverine'' #1 (March 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and joins with Shanna the She-Devil to destroy the dampening field generator.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Frank (w, a). "Savage Parts 2 - 5", ''Savage Wolverine'' #2 - 5 (April - July 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Shanna is gifted with Olympic-class [[sportsperson|athleticism]] along with extraordinary agility. She is a well-trained [[veterinarian]], with the capability of being close to wild animals. Shanna is adept at [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], healing and [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]]. She is an experienced fighter, familiar with knives, spears, bows and arrows and other primitive forms of weapons. She has Olympic athlete-level strength: naturally excelling at swimming, diving, climbing, leaping, and running with great speed and determination.

After her resurrection, Shanna is tied into the life force of the Savage Land. She also instinctively knows the languages and history of the Savage Land and its people. Shanna also now possesses the strength of ten men. She was able to run 52 miles per hour over uneven terrain.

==Other versions==

===Frank Cho version===
A blonde, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] version of the character starred in the seven-issue [[miniseries]] ''Shanna, the She-Devil'' vol. 2 (April-Oct. 2005), written and drawn by [[Frank Cho]]. This Shanna is the result of a [[cloning|genetic experiment]] that endows her with [[superhuman]] strength and agility. One member of a scientific expedition that encounters her names her Shanna "after the comic book character". The series was published with a "PSR+" rating through issue #4, and a "Parental Advisory" rating afterward.

A four-issue sequel miniseries, ''Shanna The She-Devil: Survival of the Fittest'' (Oct. 2007 - Jan. 2008) by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[James Palmiotti]] and penciller [[Khari Evans]], features this same alternate version of Shanna.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Shanna and Ka-Zar first appear in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] on the final page of ''[[Ultimates|Ultimates 3]]'' #3. Flashbacks reveal that she, Ka-Zar, and Zabu have been friends since childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Ultimates 3 #1-5&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|the Ultimatum wave]], they join the [[New Ultimates]] where they helped to fight Loki.&lt;ref&gt;Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky-Watcher''' is a commercial [[Distribution (business)|distribution company]] established in 1999 by the [[Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan]] (Synta Taiwan) that markets [[telescopes]] and astronomical equipment, like [[telescope mount|mounts]] and [[eyepiece]]s, aimed at the [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomical]] market. The products are manufactured at Synta Taiwan's [[Suzhou Synta Optical Technology|Suzhou Synta Optical Technology Co., Ltd.]] in [[Suzhou|Suzhou (Jiangsu)]], China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/41852/the-sky-watcher-az4-102-refractor-telescope-how-sweet-it-is/  Tammy Plotner, The Sky-Watcher AZ4 102 Refractor Telescope… How Sweet It is!, universetoday.com,   30 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is distributed in Canada and Europe and, in the late 2000s, extended to the USA market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/22/idUS287328+22-May-2008+BW20080522 Reuters - press release, Synta Optical Technology and Celestron Announce a New Telescope Supplier in the US. Thu 22 May 2008 7:18pm EDT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924133250/http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/22/idUS287328+22-May-2008+BW20080522 |date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
In 1999, the brand "Sky-Watcher" was established to sell Synta Taiwan's optics with head offices in [[Richmond, British Columbia]], Canada. From 2000, the first [[dobsonian telescope|dobsonians]] were produced, then in 2001 the first [[Maksutov telescope|Maksutov-Cassegrain]]s, and in 2004 their first [[Apochromat|Apochromat ED-APO]] refracting telescopes. Since 2008, there has been cooperation with [[Schott AG]], a German manufacturer of high-quality industrial glass.

Sky-Watcher's product line-up contains telescopes from 2.4" (60&amp;nbsp;mm) up to 16" (406&amp;nbsp;mm) [[aperture]] with manual, motor-driven or [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo]] mounts. Since 2008, Sky-Watcher has manufactured dobsonians with collapsible tubes, a product line they call FlexTube-dobsonians.

==Products==
Products include telescopes, spotting scopes, mounts, and many accessories.

===Telescopes===
Sky-Watcher has eleven model series of telescopes. These are listed below.

====Esprit====
Esprit 80ED, 100ED, 120ED and 150ED Super APO refractors have a doublet field flattener to get a flat field and minimize aberration and distortion. Their wide 48mm opener ensures a larger and clearer aperture and also extremely minimized halation. Connect the triplet and doublet field flattener with a high precision thin thread to keep the optical axis perpendicular to the image.

====Equinox====
The Equinox series are relatively affordable Extra-low Dispersion (ED) [[apochromat]]ic refractors in Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) between 66&amp;nbsp;mm and 120&amp;nbsp;mm (2.60" - 4.72"), suitable for [[astrophotography]]. The smaller apertures have medium focal ratios and the larger ones have long focal ratios. These telescopes have black-colored tubes.

====ED Refractors Series====
The pro series telescopes include two-element air-spaced OTA ED FPL-53 [[fluorite]] apochromatic refractors between 80&amp;nbsp;mm and 120&amp;nbsp;mm (3.15" - 4.72") with long focal ratios, also suitable for astrophotography, as well as OTA [[Maksutov telescope|Maksutov]]s with very long focal ratios and apertures of 150&amp;nbsp;mm and 180&amp;nbsp;mm (5.91" and 7.09"). They are presented in Black Diamond tubes.

====Refractors====
The refractors series are multi-coated [[achromat]]ic refractors between 70 and 150&amp;nbsp;mm (2.76" - 5.91"). They are available in [[altitude|alt]]-azimuth mounting for smaller apertures, and [[equatorial mount]]ing for larger ones. They have long focal ratios, and are constructed with a black [[aluminum]] tube.

====Reflectors====
The Reflector series telescopes are [[reflecting telescope|reflectors]] with optics aluminized and overcoated with [[silicon dioxide]], available in 76&amp;nbsp;mm to 254&amp;nbsp;mm sizes (2.99" – 10.00"). All but the smallest size are presented in equatorial mounting; the smallest one in Alt-azimuth. They are available in short, medium, and long focal ratios and chiefly parabolic mirrors. They are made with Black Diamond aluminum tubes. The 130 to 200&amp;nbsp;mm aperture parabolic mirror scopes are available with shorter tubes and dual speed [[Crayford focuser]]s and are optimised for astrophotography.

====Table top====
Table top telescopes have a 13" (330&amp;nbsp;mm) high equatorial mount, designed to be extremely portable. They include a 130&amp;nbsp;mm (5.10") reflector and an 80&amp;nbsp;mm (3.15") refractor of short and medium focal lengths respectively, as well as a long-focal length 90&amp;nbsp;mm (3.54") Maksutov. They are presented in variable-colored tubes.

====Solid-tube Dobsonians====
The Solid-tube (traditional) [[Dobsonian mount|Dobsonian]]s are Dobsonian-mounted Newtonian reflectors available in 153&amp;nbsp;mm (6"), 203&amp;nbsp;mm (8"), 254&amp;nbsp;mm (10"), and 305&amp;nbsp;mm (12") models. They have thin 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.02")-thick secondary mirror supports, tension control handles, and the 10" - 12" version is made from [[Pyrex]] glass. They have long, medium, and short focal ratios respectively, in order of increasing aperture. They have white-colored tubes.

====Collapsible Dobsonians====
The Collapsible Dobsonians are Dobsonian-mounted Newtonian reflectors available in 200&amp;nbsp;mm (8"), 254&amp;nbsp;mm (10"), 305&amp;nbsp;mm (12") and 406&amp;nbsp;mm (16") models. They are similar in design to the Solid-Tube Dobsonians but have black-colored tubes with the middle section of the tube replaced with struts. The struts allow the top portion of the tube to collapse down on the bottom portion, decreasing the tube length when in storage or being transported. The Collapsible Dobsonians also feature [[Crayford focuser]]s instead of the traditional [[rack and pinion]] focuser that was included with the Solid-tube Dobsonians.

====Short-tube Refractors====
The Short-tube Refractors series are multi-coated two-element air-spaced [[Rich Field Telescope|Rich Field]] achromatic refractors with focal ratios that allow them to have short and compact tube lengths. They are available in Alt-azimuth versions for smaller apertures and equatorial mounts for larger ones, and are available in 70&amp;nbsp;mm to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (2.76" - 5.91") apertures. They are presented with blue tubes, and are suited for terrestrial photography as well as astrophotography in the larger versions.

====Maksutov-Cassegrain====
The Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes are compact portable multi-coated [[Maksutov telescope#Maksutov–Cassegrains|Maksutov-Cassegrains]]. They are sold in equatorial mounts and are available in 90 – 180&amp;nbsp;mm (3.54" - 7") apertures. They have very long focal ratios and are sold in blue aluminum tubes. As with the Newtonians, newer ones can have the "Black Diamond" finish.

====Auto-tracking====
The auto-tracking series telescopes are motorized alt-azimuth telescopes, allowing the user to automatically track celestial objects. They are available in 70&amp;nbsp;mm and 80&amp;nbsp;mm (2.76" and 3.15") apertures for refractors with medium, long, and very long focal ratios, as reflectors with 76&amp;nbsp;mm and 114&amp;nbsp;mm (2.99" and 4.49") apertures and have long and short focal ratios respectively, as well as in 80&amp;nbsp;mm (3.15") Maksutov form with a very long focal ratio. They are sold in blue tubes with [[Red dot sight|red-dot]] style [[reflector sight]] finders.

===Spotting scopes===
Sky-Watcher spotting scopes come in three different designs. Maksutov Spottings are sold as Maksutov telescopes available in 80&amp;nbsp;mm - 127&amp;nbsp;mm (3.15" – 5") apertures, and are sold as OTA with very long focal ratios and red-dot style reflector sight finders. They are constructed with blue tubes and include a carrying bag. ST1545 and ST2060 spotting scopes are wide-angle and available in 50&amp;nbsp;mm and 60&amp;nbsp;mm (1.97" and 2.36") sizes with 15-45x and 20-60x zoom respectively. They are sold with tripod attachment capability and a camera adapter and blue tubes. Digital spotting scopes are a multi-purpose  [[digital camera]], spotting scope, and telescope. They have a 70&amp;nbsp;mm (2.36") refractor design at 14x with zoom capability between 6x and 22x, and have many features including an optional solar filter, video capability, and a tripod adaptor.

===Mounts===
Alt-azimuth mount: AZ1, AZ2, AZ3, and AZ4

Equatorial mount: EQ1, EQ2, EQ3, and EQ5

SynScan GoTo mount: EQ3 SynScan, EQ5 SynScan, HEQ5, EQ6, AZ-EQ5, AZ-EQ6 and EQ8

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">{{For|the sports writer and author of children's books|Stephen Krasner}}

'''Stephen David Krasner''' (born 15 February 1942, [[New York City|New York]]) is an [[international relations]] professor at [[Stanford University]] and is a former [[Director of Policy Planning]] at the [[United States Department of State]], a position he held from 2005 until April 2007 while on leave from Stanford. He is a senior fellow at Stanford's [[Hoover Institution]].

== Awards ==

Krasner received his bachelor's degree from the [[Cornell University Department of History|Department of History]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1963, where he was a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society. He then earned his master's degree from [[Columbia University]], and his PhD from [[Harvard University]]. Krasner is the author of six books and over ninety articles.  He has taught courses on [[international relations]], [[international political economy]], international relations theory, policy making, and state-building at Stanford University. He received a dean’s award for excellence in teaching in 1991.

One of his most famous accomplishments in the realm of political science was defining "international regimes" as, "implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures around which actors’ expectations converge in a given area of international relations", in a special issue of the journal ''[[International Organization]]'' in 1982. He has also written extensively about statehood and [[sovereignty]].

== Weak state stabilization ==

Stephen Krasner is what political scientists define as a neorealist.  He writes about the United States as being threatened by weakened nations in the increasingly interconnected international system in his article, ''Addressing State Failure'' (2005).  Krasner believes in conflict prevention, in which he believes the United States and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) should make it clear that stabilizing weak states in the world is high on the policy agenda. Krasner lays out three steps to what he believes are the main goals in managing weak post-conflict states successfully, for example the [[Investment in post-invasion Iraq|United States rebuilding of Iraq]]).
* Stabilization
* The root causes being addressed
* The creation of laws and institutions of a [[market democracy]]

== Executive power ==

Krasner also argues that bureaucratic procedures and bureaucratic politics are not what shape [[American foreign policy]].  Instead, he states that the undisputed power of the [[U.S. President]] is what ultimately leads to the foreign policy decisions ''Are Bureaucracies Important?'' (1972).  He also states that bureaucratic politics are dangerous and misleading, “because it undermines the assumptions of democratic politics by relieving high-ranking officials of responsibility” (1972). Bureaucratic theorists see the collective decisions of smaller actors in the bureaucratic procedure as what influences the foreign policy, not the decisions of the high-ranking executive officials. But Krasner argues that it is a dangerous theory because it gives leaders excuses for their  foreign policy failures, and it gives the public a skewed view of the ultimate power that the President possesses. He defines states political objectives as a direct reflection of the President’s national interest goals and beliefs of what he thinks society should be.

== State sovereignty ==
Stephen Krasner was made famous in the political science world for his extensive contributions on the topic of state sovereignty, in his influential book, ''Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy'' (1999), in which he defines state sovereignty as clearly drawn out rules in the international system.  In [[international law]], the rule is that a state has the exclusive right to have control over an area of governance, people, and that a state has a legitimate exercise of power and the interpretation of international law. Krasner, however, focuses on the rules of sovereignty continually being broken and specifies four conceptions of sovereignty in international relations:

* '''Legal sovereignty''' – states recognizing one another as independent territories
* '''Interdependence sovereignty''' – [[globalization]] (e.g., international flows of capital, people, and information) erodes state sovereignty
* '''Domestic sovereignty''' – the standard definition, which refers to state authority structures and their effectiveness of control within the state
* '''[[Westphalian sovereignty]]''' – states have the right to separately determine their own domestic authority

Krasner also describes the four situations in which the international community deems normal rules of sovereignty invalid and subject to outside intervention:
* Religious toleration
* Minority rights
* [[Human rights]]
* International stability

She started her career as a dancer on Broadway, making her debut in the musical ''[[Take Me Along]]'' in 1959. In 2010, she was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for her performance as [[Talullah Bankhead]] in the play ''Looped''.

==Early life==
Harper was born in [[Suffern, New York]], the daughter of Iva Mildred ([[née]] McConnell; February 8, 1910—Oct 7, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VPV7-563 |title=Iva Mcconell Harper |accessdate=2015-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004225833/https://familysearch.org/ark%3A/61903/1%3A1%3AVPV7-563 |archivedate=2015-10-04 |publisher=Family Search |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Howard Donald Harper (January 10, 1907- September , 1981). Her father was a lighting salesman, and her mother was born in Canada and trained as a nurse. She is the middle child of three siblings. She has an older sister, Leah; a younger brother, Merrill (who later took the name "Don") and a half-sister, Virginia, from her father's second marriage.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

She has stated that her parents were expecting a boy and after her arrival, her first and middle names derived from that year's women's doubles tennis champions, [[Valerie Scott (tennis player)|Valerie Scott]] and [[Kay Stammers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Harper| first=Valerie| title=I Rhoda: A Memoir| date=January 15, 2013| publisher=Gallery Books| isbn=978-1-4516-9946-3| page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ouzounian| first=Richard| date=April 12, 2006| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1019846381.html?dids=1019846381:1019846381&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+12%2C+2006&amp;author=Richard+Ouzounian&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Good+as+Golda%3B+Yes%2C+that+is+veteran+actress+Valerie+Harper+playing+Israel's+1970s+prime+minister+in+a+play+coming+soon+to+Toronto.+Turns+out+Rhoda+Morgenstern+has+Canadian+roots&amp;pqatl=google| title=Good as Golda; Yes, that is veteran actress Valerie Harper playing Israel's 1970s prime minister in a play coming soon to Toronto.

'''Victor Lord''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[patriarch]] of the [[Lord family]] from the American soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]''.

An original [[protagonist]] on the series, Victor is introduced in the first episode as the preeminent [[media proprietor|mass media magnate]]&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; of fictional [[Philadelphia Main Line]] suburb [[Llanview|Llanview, Pennsylvania]]. Victor was originally and most notably played by actor [[Ernest Graves (actor)|Ernest Graves]]. Graves debuted July 15, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=July 15, 1968 |season=1 |number=1 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played the role until he left the series and last appeared in March 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=March 1974 |season=6 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series creator [[Agnes Nixon]] and executive producer Doris Quinlan subsequently recast Victor to [[Shepperd Strudwick]], who first appeared in December 1974&lt;ref name="SS debut"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=December 1974 |season=7 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played the role until the character's initial onscreen death in June 1976.&lt;ref name="victordeath"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=June 16, 1976 |season=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character background==

===Conception===
Series creator and then-scriptwriter [[Agnes Nixon]] originally created the character of Victor Lord based on her father, Harry Eckhardt.&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Callahan |year=2007 |title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife |journal=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]] |issue=May 2007 |publisher=[[Metrocorp]] |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/ |accessdate=21 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She crafted the role in an attempt to understand the reserved, domineering Eckhardt patriarch, an entrepreneur who financially thrived during the [[Great Depression]] manufacturing funeral garments.&lt;ref name="Legends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=45 |title=She Made It: Agnes Nixon, Television Writer, Producer |work=[[Paley Center for Media|The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting and development===
[[Ernest Graves (actor)|Ernest Graves]] played the role from show's first episode in 1968 through March 1974. [[Shepperd Strudwick]] took over the role in December 1974, playing Victor continually through the character's onscreen death June 16, 1976.&lt;ref name="victordeath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schemering |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Schemering |chapter=''[[One Life to Live]]''|title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] (1st edition) |date=September 1985 |pages=158–166 |isbn=0-345-32459-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom O'Rourke briefly stepped into the role as a mirage in 1985, and [[Les Tremayne]] played the role of Victor in Heaven in 1987. Bill Moor briefly appeared in the role in 1995. The character was briefly brought back to life 26 years after his original death in January 2003, portrayed by William Stone Mahoney; the resurrection set the soap opera record for the longest span between a character's onscreen death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"&gt;{{cite book |title=The ''One Life to Live'' 40th Anniversary Trivia Book |last=Waggett |first=Gerry |year=2008 |publisher=[[Hyperion Books]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=9781401323097 |pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahoney went on to play resurrected Victor through his second onscreen death in March 2003, reappearing as a [[hallucination|vision]] for an episode in 2004.

==Storylines==

===1968–76===
In the summer of 1968, Victor Lord (Graves) is introduced as the owner of [[Lord Enterprises]] founder and publisher of the [[Philadelphia Main Line]] newspaper, ''The Banner'',&lt;ref name="Enterprises"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=14 December 1974 |title=Two Join ''One Life'' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/#11751797 |newspaper=[[High Point Enterprise]] |location=[[High Point, North Carolina]] |publisher= |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving the fictional town of [[Llanview|Llanview, Pennsylvania]]. A widower, he is the domineering single father of daughters [[Victoria Lord|Victoria]] or "Viki" (originally [[Gillian Spencer]]) and [[Meredith Lord|Meredith]] or "Merrie" (originally [[Trish Van Devere]]). The family inhabits Victor's inherited [[landed property|family estate]], [[Llanfair (One Life to Live)|Llanfair]]. His wife, [[Eugenia Randolph|Eugenia Randolph Lord]], died while giving birth to Meredith and was, ultimately, unable to produce his desired male [[heir]] to his estate (a picture of her hangs above the mantle of the Lord library in early episodes). Victor thereby goes about grooming his eldest child, Viki, to assume the role of running the estate by hiring her as an editor for his newspaper.&lt;ref name="Fathers"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Founding Fathers, Pop Culture, and Constitutional Law |last=Burgess |first=Susan |year=2009 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location=[[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], [[United Kingdom]] |isbn=9780754678410 |page=44 |accessdate=19 August 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1G3kJXpw9QC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;ots=kqiyO-s_FN&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria desperately seeks her father's approval and gleefully assumes the role of heiress to the family fortune. Victor eventually grows weary of Victoria's admiration for one of his star reporters, working class [[executive editor]] [[Joe Riley (One Life to Live)|Joe Riley]] ([[Lee Patterson]]). In the early years, Victor is also unhappy at the growing relationship of his younger daughter, [[Meredith Lord|Meredith]], with upwardly-mobile doctor [[Larry Wolek]] (Paul Tulley, [[Jim Storm (actor)|Jim Storm]]).&lt;ref name="Fathers"/&gt; He meddles in the personal relationships of his daughters, causing a rift between him and Victoria. In November 1968, unable to reconcile her feelings for Joe and for her father, Victoria develops [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple-personality disorder]], manifesting in an alter-ego, "Niki Smith," and begins dating [[Vince Wolek|Vinny Wolek]] ([[Antony Ponzini]]).

As Victoria recovers from her first bout with multiple personalities, Victor concedes to the relationships of his [[White-collar worker|white collar]] daughters to [[working class]] gentlemen when he uncovers that he had a long-lost son. Victor embarks on a search for the son he had long yearned for. Viki and Joe first marry in December 1969, and Merrie ([[Lynn Benesch]] onward) and Larry ([[Michael Storm]] onward) in June 1970. A short time later, Joe apparently dies in a [[car crash]] while reporting in [[California]], giving Victor the opportunity to set his widowed daughter up with a suitor more to his liking. With a vacant editor-in-chief position available, Victor replaces Joe with promoted upper-crust writer [[Steve Burke (One Life to Live)|Steve Burke]] (Bernie Grant).

In 1971, Victoria ([[Erika Slezak]] onward) announces her engagement to Steve, which her father approves of; Victor is, however, unhappy when he discovers his continually frail daughter Meredith is seeking to conceive a child with Larry. Merrie is prescribed [[bedrest]] and later gives birth to Victor's first onscreen grandchildren, twins (one which dies a childbirth and the other, a grandson named [[Daniel Wolek|Daniel]]). In the summer of 1973, in the midst of Victor's search for his son, Meredith is held hostage in the Llanfair [[carriage house]] with brother-in-law [[Vince Wolek|Vinny]] when burglars try to steal Victor's prized art collection. A distressed Victor pleads with the robbers to release Meredith during [[crisis negotiation|hostage negotiation]]s with Llanview Police Department [[Ed Hall (One Life to Live)|Lt. Ed Hall]] ([[Al Freeman, Jr.]]). Meredith is viciously assaulted by the thieves, who are killed by the police, and later dies at Llanview Hospital. Victor is devastated by her death, and he (Graves) leaves Llanview in 1974 in search for his [[heir-presumptive]] son.

The hostage crisis of Meredith and Vinny in 1973 saw the introduction of newly minted [[Dorian Lord|Dr. Dorian Cramer]] (originally, [[Nancy Pinkerton]]), who Viki dislikes at first sight. Dorian, at first, dates Llanview Hospital co-worker [[Mark Toland|Dr. Mark Toland]] ([[Tommy Lee Jones|Tom Lee Jones]]), and in the midst of the romance on-the-job in summer 1974. Dorian is suspected of [[medical malpractice]], and all of the hospital [[board of directors]] (except for Viki) vote to fire her. Dorian assumes that Viki's was the deciding vote to fire her and vows revenge. When Victor (Strudwick) reappears in December 1974&lt;ref name="SS debut"/&gt; and suffers a heart attack, and an unemployed Dorian decides to use him in order to get even with the Lord family.

Dorian becomes Victor's personal physician in 1975, and the two quickly [[elopement (marriage)|elope]] in May. Soon afterward, [[Tony Lord (One Life to Live)|Tony Harris]] ([[George Reinholt]]) arrives in Llanview, and Dorian quickly realizes he is Victor's long-sought son. Tony quickly becomes friends with Victor, and when Tony uncovers a diary from Viki and Meredith's mother, Eugenia, and realizing Victor to be his estranged father, to the chagrin of a greedy Dorian. Dorian connives and succeeds in creating a rift between Victor and his new son. When Tony and Victor learn of Dorian's scheme, Tony first confronts Dorian, who denies having done anything wrong. On April 30, 1976,&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt; when Victor begins questioning Dorian, the ensuing argument leads Victor to have a debilitating [[stroke]] which leaves him unable to speak &lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt; or dictate alterations to his [[will (law)|will]]. Determined to keep her Victor from speaking to anyone, Dorian brings him home and succeeds from keeping everyone away from him.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt; Soon, Victor suffers a second stroke which sends him back to the hospital.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt; Despite his attempts to speak to Viki,&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt; Victor apparently dies in June 16, 1976,&lt;ref name="victordeath"/&gt; and Dorian inherits half of his wealth.

===Postmortem===
{{further|Tina Lord|Todd Manning}}
In 1985, Viki commences celebrations of the 50th anniversary of her father's newspaper. During preparations for the celebration, Viki's goddaughter, [[Tina Lord|Tina]] ([[Andrea Evans]]), happens upon a [[secret passage|hidden door]] in the Llanfair library, leading to a secret room. While in the room, Tina stumbles upon a letter written by Victor addressed to Viki, telling of his affair and brief marriage with Viki's former college friend [[Irene Manning (One Life to Live)|Irene Manning Clayton]] and the siring of his daughter Tina. When Tina divulges the revelations, Viki reverts to alter-ego "Niki Smith" and Tina, for the following year, embarks on a mission to gain what she believes to be rightfully hers as a member of the Lord family. Recovered, Viki later uncovers in 1988 that she had a daughter, [[Megan Gordon]] ([[Jessica Tuck]]), while under the hypnosis insisted upon by Victor and delivered by her longtime friend and brother-in-law, Larry. Megan dies of [[lupus]] in 1992.

Viki engages in an extramarital affair in 1993 with writer [[Sloan Carpenter]] ([[Roy Thinnes]]), who authors Victor's biography, "Lord of ''The Banner''". While penning the book, Dorian (now, [[Robin Strasser]] onward) nervously plots to prevent its publication as Sloan's papers allude to Dorian's complicity in Victor's death, a tale which became a Llanview [[urban legend]] in the years following Victor's apparent death. Intrigued by Dorian's intense interest in the book, Viki implores the Llanview Police Department to investigate the circumstances of Victor's death. They comply, leading to the arrest (and conviction, after trial) of Dorian for Victor's murder. When Dorian is sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]], con man [[David Vickers]] ([[Tuc Watkins]]) arrives in town in 1994, claiming to possess the alleged diary of Viki's late friend and Tina's mother, Irene. Later revealed to be a forgery, the diary claims dead Irene smothered Victor, exonerating Dorian at the [[wiktionary:eleventh hour|eleventh hour]]. Soon afterward, an actual diary entry from Irene reveals she bore Victor another son, reformed rapist [[Todd Manning]] ([[Roger Howarth]]).

When Viki learns of the initial forgery, Viki, still loyal to her late father, vows to send Dorian back to jail for Victor's death in 1995. Dorian then divulges the source of Viki's multiple personalities—Victor had long molested his eldest daughter Victoria and her repressed memories of the molestation led to the creation of her initial alter-ego, Niki. Victoria then suffered a recurrence of her multiple personality disorder, subsequently releasing several new personalities, who accost Dorian and hold her hostage in Victor's secret room. Upon recovery, Viki comes to terms with her father's inappropriate behaviors.

Because of the pain she had to endure and dark secrets that were revealed, Viki, who had once worshiped the ground her father walked on and idealized him, now has nothing but contempt, rage, and disgust at Victor's depravity and actions.

Finally in 2003, following the arrival of Viki's long-lost daughter, [[Natalie Buchanan|Natalie]] ([[Melissa Archer]]), an ailing Victor (William Stone Mahoney) resurfaces. It is during this time when [[Mitch Laurence]] ([[Roscoe Born]]) marries Natalie in a plot spearheaded by Victor to kill his granddaughter and harvest her heart, as he was dying of old age and [[heart disease]]. Viki foils Victor and Mitch's plot, saving Natalie from impending death. Victor is again rushed to the hospital. Larry tells Victor's present children, Viki and Todd (Howarth), to say their final goodbyes to their dying father. Victor dies on-screen in March 2003, a month before a shocked Dorian returns to Llanview.

In 2007, during the funeral of [[Asa Buchanan]], Dorian and Viki are trapped together in Asa's [[wine cellar]]. The two argue and Dorian tells Viki that she, not Viki, killed Victor. Viki, flabbergasted, reminds Dorian that neither she nor Dorian had killed Victor because he had returned from the dead a few years before. Dorian then plants a seed of doubt in Viki's mind, responding "if that really was him." During the episode first aired on November 26, 2008, Viki visits her father's grave, and the date of death shown is "June 16, 1976", the date of the episode in which Victor originally died. It was never mentioned onscreen whether or not the Victor who appeared in 2003 was an imposter, and the 2003 storyline is not mentioned again in the series, leading to speculation that it was simply [[#A seed of doubt|retconned out of continuity]].

In 2011, it was revealed by a back-from-the dead Irene that the man known as Todd ([[Trevor St. John]]) since May 2003 was in fact his twin,  [[Victor Lord, Jr.]] (St. John), and the real Todd Manning (Howarth) had been held hostage by her since his disappearance in March 2003. Victor, Jr. is later seemingly killed on the episode that first aired August 31, 2011.  On the original finale January 13, 2012, however, Victor, Jr. is revealed to be alive and being held captive by [[Allison Perkins]] ([[Barbara Garrick]]).&lt;ref name="ABC finale"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=January 13, 2012 |season=44 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A seed of doubt====
During an interview with ''TV Guide Canada'' in February 2009, "Dorian Lord" actress [[Robin Strasser]], offered a belated explanation for the recent reversal about Victor's murderer:

{{quote|I was so happy that [head writer Ron Carlivati] addressed that mythology [in the August 2007 9,999th and 10,000th episodes]. I was very invested in the hopes that Ron was going to dismantle [former writer Michael Malone's] revised back story. This is just my opinion as Robin: I believe Dorian killed Victor. I didn’t play the part then, but I watched those scenes [with Nancy Pinkerton as Dorian], and I thought they were wonderful, in a ''[[The Little Foxes|Little Foxes]]'' sort of way. Dorian just didn't give Victor the medicine fast enough.

When Michael was head-writing our show, Viki and Dorian had been simmering on the back burner. They didn't quite know what to do with us at that time. At the time, I was doing research on multiple personalities for an acting class, which prompted me to suggest to Erika Slezak that over 90 per cent of DID cases have multiple personalities, not dual alters. Also, DID almost always results from childhood abuse. The next day, we pitched it to Michael Malone. What ensued was that Michael took the story on, but it was also at that point in which Michael had re-wrote history, revealing it was Viki who had killed Victor, not Dorian. That led to my [[wiktionary:no good deed goes unpunished|no-good-deed-goes-unpunished]] moment. Oh, nuts! But I have quietly held the opinion that that decision was revisionist history, and hopefully one day that will be straightened out. I’m sure you have seen the intensity in which I play Dorian protecting and guarding the [[Cramer family|Cramer women]]. That's the luggage I bring to the show. You can't erase that kind of history because it's embedded in the tapestry of the show. I always played that Dorian killed Victor because she knew he was a pedophile and suspected him of abusing Viki.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca/Soaps/Features/Articles/090209_robin_strasser_NB|title=Viva La Strasser!|last=Branco|first=Nelson|date=February 9, 2009|publisher=TVGuide.ca|accessdate=February 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225122121/http://tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca/Soaps/Features/Articles/090209_robin_strasser_NB|archivedate=February 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion that Dorian is Victor's true murderer is bolstered in the August 16, 2011 episode of ''One Life to Live''. When David Vickers Buchanan mentions that the (albeit forged) entry from Irene Manning's diary cleared Dorian of a murder she did not commit, Dorian comments to herself, "... or so Viki chooses to believe."&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

==Reception==
From the outset, the original portrayal of Victor Lord by actor Ernest Graves was received as ruthless and overbearing, playing a role introduced as the powerful center of the fictional town of [[Llanview]], and of the lives of his daughters Victoria and Meredith.&lt;ref name="Fathers"/&gt; For his portrayal of a dying Victor, actor Shepperd Strudwick earned a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series#1970s|Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] in 1976.

Leading series actress and onscreen daughter [[Erika Slezak]] reflected on Victor's transformation at the 25th anniversary of ''OLTL'' in 1993 recalling, "Once, Victor Lord was a [[wiktionary:paragon|paragon]] of [[virtue]], then producer [[Paul Rauch]] said, 'let's turn him into a dirty old man who sleeps with [[Irene Manning (One Life to Live)|young women]] and keeps [[pornography]] in the basement.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''One Life'' lives on: 25 Years for the Show that Threw Out Convention  |first=Marla |last=Hunt |url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Academy/6053/ar930715.html |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=July 15, 1993 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026231446/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Academy/6053/ar930715.html | archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2014-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Allee attended Earlham College and upon his graduation in 1908, pursued advanced studies at the [[University of Chicago]] where he received his PhD&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt; and graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; Allee’s most significant research occurred during his time at the University of Chicago and at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at [[Woods Hole]] in Massachusetts. His research findings led to many publications, with the most notable being ''Principles of Animal Ecology'' and ''Animal Aggregations''.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt;  Allee was married to author [[Marjorie Hill Allee]] and remained active in the field of biology until his death in 1955 at the age of 70.

==Early life==
Warder Clyde Allee was born on June 5, 1885, on a farm in [[Bloomingdale, Indiana]]. His father, John Wesley Allee, was orphaned as a child and grew up at the homes of various relatives in the Bloomingdale region.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; Clyde Allee attended a one-room country school and led his class in scholarship. At Bloomingdale Academy he was again at the head of his graduating class and the winner of the oratorical contest.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt;  At the age of seventeen, he taught country school for a year and then the fifth and sixth grades in the Bloomingdale elementary school for another year. Then, at nineteen, he began his first year at Earlham College.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; He was a Methodist, and joined the [[Society of Friends]] to marry Marjorie Hill, whose Quaker ancestry extended back into the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; His strong Quaker beliefs would play a large role in his research later in his academic and professional career.

==Personal life==
Family background combined with the Quaker influence at Earlham College contributed to the Quaker mold in which Allee was cast. In 1912, he confirmed himself as a member of the Society of Friends in order to marry Marjorie Hill.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; Allee met Marjorie when she was a freshman at Earlham College while Allee was a senior. Marjorie was most interested in English Literature and Writing and would go on to help her husband in his books and scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt; Specifically, she served as a critic, collaborator, and joint author to the works of her husband. Eventually, she established herself as an author, with a notable series of novels for girls.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt;

==University career==
Allee was born in Bloomingdale, Indiana. He received the S.B. degree from [[Earlham College]] in 1908, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1910 and 1912, where he graduated summa cum laude. He was a student of [[Victor Ernest Shelford]] and there imbibed the ideas of [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt; Allee worked as an assistant professor in Zoology from 1910 to 1912. Between 1912 and 1921 he taught at the [[University of Illinois]], [[Williams College]], [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Lake Forest College]], and the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at [[Woods Hole]], Massachusetts. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1921 as an assistant professor of zoology and was promoted to professor in 1928.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/ALLE1885.htm Allee, Warder Clyde (United States 1885–1955)]". [[Western Kentucky University]] website. Retrieved on April 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he served as dean in the College of Arts, Literature, and Science (1924–1926) and secretary of the Department of Zoology (1927–1934). After retirement in 1950, he worked at the [[University of Florida at Gainesville]], where he was head professor of biology until his death in March 1955.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;

==Career==
Allee was strongly influenced by [[Frank R. Lillie]], head of the Department of Zoology at the University of Chicago and one of the founders of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, Karl Patterson 1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt; Allee gained interest in the interactions and patterns of the distribution of marine mammals during his time as an instructor at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole in Massachusetts from 1914 to 1921.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2010"/&gt;

In 1923, Allee began to write a series of papers entitled, Animal Aggregations. Eight years later, he published his findings in a book under the same name. The results of Clyde Allee’s research demonstrated the existence of an unconscious drive within species for fellow individuals of the same species. This research helped to prove that under crowding was detrimental to some animals.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2010"/&gt; Allee’s research also helped to describe [[protocooperation]], where two species interact with one another in a beneficial way that is not essential to the survival of either organism. It should also be noted that Allee’s biological basis of [[democracy]] arrived at a time when the future of world politics and human kind’s morality were in question themselves. As a Quaker, Allee was committed to world peace and this commitment anteceded his theory of sociality.&lt;ref&gt;Mitman, Gregg. "From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson." ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Oklahoma, 06 January 1988. Retrieved on 2014-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Allee’s Quaker beliefs led to the development of his dedication to show how cooperation is essential in the natural world. This led to the development of the [[Allee effect]].

===Allee effect===
Allee dedicated his life to researching the benefits of organisms acting in a group rather than as individuals. Through observing groups of organisms, Allee discovered that cooperation is both beneficial and essential in nature. The Allee effect describes the positive correlation between population density and individual fitness of a population or species.

===Social Implications===
Allee's research on social aggregations and the evolution of cooperation coincided with his social activism, religious beliefs, and [[Peace Testimony|opposition to war]]. Raised as a Quaker, Allee publicly renounced war, which made him a target of harsh criticism and persecution.&lt;ref name="Scientific Biography 2008"&gt;"Warder Clyde Allee" ''[[Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''. 2008. Retrieved on 2014-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, Allee argued that his research on the social behaviors of animals provided clear evidence against a biological basis for war. Specifically, he believed that his theory on the sociality of organisms based on cooperation among individuals proved that war was not a natural occurrence.&lt;ref name="Scientific Biography 2008"/&gt; According to Gregg Mitman, Allee saw ecologists as "social healers" who were able to provide a naturalistic foundation for ethics through their research.&lt;ref name="Scientific Biography 2008"/&gt;

==Involvement in other scientific work==
A spinal tumor caused paralysis, and Allee used a wheelchair after 1935. He nevertheless maintained a full schedule of teaching, research and writing. Allee continued to spend summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, and served as a trustee from 1932 to 1955. Having been on the editorial board of Physiological Zoology, a journal published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], since its founding in 1928, Allee took over as managing editor in 1937 and remained in that position until his death. He also chaired the Committee on the Ecology of Animal Populations of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] which was established in 1941 to solicit and administer funds for research projects in the field. He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Allee's dedication to research resulted in more than 200 papers and over a dozen books, including ''Animal Aggregations: A Study in General Sociology'' (1931), ''Animal Life and Social Growth'' (1932), ''The Social Life of Animals'' (1938), ''Principles of Animal Ecology'', co-authored by Alfred E. Emerson, Orlando Park, Thomas Park, and Karl P. Schmidt (1949), and ''Cooperation among Animals, with Human Implications'' (1951).

==Commemoration, death, and legacy==
Many biologists and historians believe that Allee's reputation was diminished by the work of another ecologist, [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]].&lt;ref name="Scientific Biography 2008"/&gt; Williams's work, Adaptation and Natural Selection (1996), refutes Allee's research on group cooperation by stressing the importance of individual selection and providing samples that invalidated the idea of group selection.&lt;ref name="Scientific Biography 2008"/&gt; However, the research and legacy of Allee is still recognized and discussed today as many scientists remain interested in the principles behind the Allee effect. In 1973, the [[Animal Behavior Society]] began to offer the W.C. Allee Award for the best presentation of an ethological work of research by a student in a juried competition held at their annual meeting.

Allee died in [[Gainesville, Florida]], aged 69, in 1955.

==Biography==
Born 5 June 1967 in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], Turner-Webster had two sisters, presenter [[Anthea Turner]] and Ruth who had [[spina bifida]] and died at the age of 15. Turner-Webster grew up in [[Norton le Moors]], Staffordshire, and was educated at St Dominic’s Independent Junior School at [[Hartshill]].

===Career===
Turner-Webster started her career at [[Signal Radio]], writing, producing and presenting on-air features including film, travel and book reviews.&lt;ref name=TISBio&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/wendywebsterturner.html|title=Wendy Turner Webster|publisher=This is Staffordshire|date=2009-02-02|accessdate=2010-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328010352/http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/wendywebsterturner.html|archivedate=2010-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also wrote for magazines including [[OK!]]. A part-time actress, while appearing in the [[pantomime]] ''[[Cinderella]],'' she was spotted by a producer from the UK cable channel ''[[L!VE TV]].''&lt;ref name=TISBio/&gt; Moving to [[London]], she became a news reporter covering sports and fashion. She then hosted her own shows ''Videobox'' and the [[psychic]] phone-in ''Revelations with Nina.''

Turner-Webster was chosen to take over hosting [[Channel 4]]’s ''Absolutely Animals'' from [[Dani Behr]];&lt;ref name=TISBio/&gt; the show was a forerunner to ''[[Pet Rescue (TV series)|Pet Rescue]]'' which Turner-Webster hosted for 7 years.&lt;ref name=TISBio/&gt; Turner-Webster's other TV projects include [[BBC One]]'s ''Your Kids Are In Charge'', presented with sister Anthea.

The proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishing.co.uk/article.php3?id=717 |title=Freedom and the price of Fishing |website=Fishing.co.uk |date=31 May 2001 |author=M. A. Roe |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she launched an on-line footwear company, "Secret Goddess", which specialised in ultra glamorous boots and shoes of non-animal origin.

In November 2010, Wendy became the patron of Chancepixies Animal Rescue, a charity dedicated to educating, rescuing and taking action to prevent dogs in the UK from finding themselves unwanted, abused and killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2010/Nov2010/News261110/animal.htm Animal rescue continues fight to change UK dog laws&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He only received a basic instruction in the principles of Islam, and lived in the desert with [[Bedouin]] tribesmen, familiarising himself with the life of [[Emiratis|the people]], their traditional skills and their ability to survive under the harsh climatic conditions.&lt;ref name="zayedbio1"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5ptN7yw8y?url=http://faculty.uaeu.ac.ae/~eesa/History/zayed.html UAEU Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and reign==
Zayed was appointed the governor of the [[Al-Ain Region, Abu Dhabi|Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi]] in 1946,&lt;ref name=jof3nov/&gt; and was based in the Muwaiji fort in Al Ain. At this time, the area was poor and prone to outbreaks of disease. When  parties from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt;

In 1952, a small Saudi Arabian force led by Turki bin Abdullah al-Otaishan occupied the village of Hamasa in the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]] (the '[[Buraimi Dispute]]'). Zayed was prominent in his opposition to Saudi territorial claims and reportedly rejected a bribe of about £30 million to allow [[Aramco]] to explore for oil in the disputed territory. As part of this dispute, Zayed and his brother [[Hazza bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Hazza]] attended the Buraimi arbitration tribunal in Geneva in September 1955 and gave evidence to tribunal members. When the tribunal was abandoned amid allegations of Saudi bribery, the British initiated the reoccupation of the Buraimi Oasis through a local military force, the [[Trucial Oman Scouts|Trucial Oman Levies]]. A period of stability followed during which Zayed helped to develop the region and took a particular interest in the restoration of the ''falaj'' system, a network of water channels which kept the plantations of the Buraimi Oasis irrigated and fertile.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Quartet Books|isbn = 0-7043-2671-X|publication-place = London|title = This strange eventful history|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1844865M/This_strange_eventful_history|author = Edward Henderson|publication-date = 1988|id = 070432671X|accessdate = 3 August 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312200628/https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1844865M/This_strange_eventful_history|archivedate = 12 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1475775/Sheikh-Zayed-bin-Sultan-Al-Nahyan.html|title = Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|newspaper = Daily Telegraph|location = London|date = 4 November 2004|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130625073818/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1475775/Sheikh-Zayed-bin-Sultan-Al-Nahyan.html|archivedate = 25 June 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of oil in 1958, and the start of oil exports in 1962, led to frustration among members of the ruling family about the lack of progress under Sheikh Shakhbut’s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://specialoperationshistory.com/items/show/1160 |title=Farewell Arabia (1968) |work=Special Operations History Foundation |accessdate=18 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429073026/http://specialoperationshistory.com/items/show/1160 |archivedate=29 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August 1966, Shakhbut was deposed in a bloodless palace coup.&lt;ref name=Bismarck2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Helene von Bismarck|title=British Policy in the Persian Gulf, 1961–1968: Conceptions of Informal Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iih_tdb1rlIC&amp;pg=PT155|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=29 March 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-32673-7|page=155|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164804/http://www.na.ae/en/Images/LIWA12.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to replace Shakhbut with Zayed had the unanimous backing of the Al Nahyan family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Now the Dust Has Settled|last=De Butts|first=Freddie|publisher=Tabb House|year=1995|isbn=1873951132|location=|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was conveyed to Shakhbut by British Acting Resident Glen Balfour-Paul who added the support of the British to the consensus of the family.

In the late 1960s, Zayed hired Dr. Katsuhiko Takahashi, a Japanese architect, to design and plan the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/building-a-city-from-the-sands Building a city from the sands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164804/http://www.na.ae/en/Images/LIWA12.pdf |date=5 February 2017 }} ''The National''. 11 September 2008.

Between 8–11 January 1968, the UK's Foreign Office Minister [[Goronwy Roberts]] visited the Trucial States and announced to its shocked rulers that the United Kingdom would abrogate its treaties with them and intended to withdraw from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Heard-Bey|first = Frauke|publisher = Longman|year=1996|isbn = 0582277280|location = UK|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a seminal meeting on 18 February 1968 at a desert highland on the border between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai shook hands on the principle of founding a Federation and attempting to invite other trucial rulers to join in order that a viable nation be formed in the wake of the British withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Maktoum|first = Mohammed|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 9781860633300|location=UAE|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, after occasionally difficult negotiations with the other six rulers of the [[Trucial States]], the United Arab Emirates was formed. Zayed was appointed to the presidency of the [[UAE]] in 1971 and was reappointed on four more occasions: 1976, 1981, 1986, and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Kessinger Publishing|author = Federal Research Division|url = https://books.google.com/?id=H5PjAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=uae|title = United Arab Emirates: A Country Study|publication-date = 2004|accessdate = 3 August 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160610052655/https://books.google.com/books?id=H5PjAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=uae&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=deQjTuLKH8KDhQfX0OGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgo|archivedate = 10 June 2016|df = dmy-all|isbn = 9781419292118|date = June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Zayed apparently settled the outstanding border dispute with Saudi Arabia by the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1974)|Treaty of Jeddah]] by which Saudi Arabia received the output of the Shaybah oilfield and access to the lower [[Persian Gulf]] in return for recognising the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield R., Evans K.E. (eds) ''Arabian Boundaries: New Documents'' (2009), vol. 15, pp. viii–xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes==
[[File:Sheikh Zayed visiting Kairouan.jpg|thumb|left|Sheikh Zayed salutes Tunisian crowd during his visit to [[Kairouan|Kairouan City]] in the mid-70s]]

Sheikh Zayed was determined to unite the Emirates into [[federation]]. His calls for cooperation extended across the Persian Gulf to [[Iran]]. He advocated dialogue as the means to settle the row with [[Iran|Tehran]] over three strategic Persian Gulf islands which Iran seized from the (future) UAE Emirate of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in 1971. The islands remain in Iranian hands, despite over three decades of UAE diplomatic initiatives.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

He was considered a relatively [[Social liberalism|liberal ruler]], and permitted private media. However, they were expected to practice self-censorship and avoid criticism of Zayed or the ruling families. Freedom of worship was permitted, and to a certain extent allowances were made for expatriate cultures, but this did not always sit comfortably in the eyes of the wider Arab world with Zayed's role as a Muslim head of state.&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

Zayed did not shy away from controversy when it came to expressing his opinions on current events in the Arab world. Troubled by the suffering of Iraqi civilians, he took the lead in calling for the lifting of economic sanctions on [[Iraq]] imposed by the United Nations in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990, despite Kuwaiti displeasure and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/viewnews.asp?NewsFileName=20000131.htm|title=UAE – News Reports|newspaper=UAE Interact|accessdate=29 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504105409/http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/viewnews.asp?NewsFileName=20000131.htm|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zayed was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world. A ''[[Forbes]]'' estimate put his fortune at around US$20 billion in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/0315/130.html|newspaper=Forbes|title=Royals &amp; Rulers|date=15 March 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110235514/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/0315/130.html|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this wealth could be almost exclusively attributed to the immense oil wealth of [[Abu Dhabi]] and the Emirates, which sit on a pool of a tenth of the world's proven oil reserves.

==Policies and charity==

At the time the British withdrew from the [[Persian Gulf]] in 1971, Zayed oversaw the establishment of the [[Abu Dhabi]] Fund for Arab Economic Development; some of its oil riches were channeled to some forty less fortunate Islamic nations in Asia and Africa during the decades that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Using the country's enormous oil revenues, Zayed built institutions such as hospitals, schools and universities and made it possible for [[UAE]] citizens to enjoy free access to them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

When asked by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in April 1997 why there is no elected [[parliamentary democracy|legislature]], Zayed replied, &lt;blockquote&gt;Why should we abandon a system that satisfies our people in order to introduce a system that seems to engender [[dissent]] and confrontation? Our system of government is based upon our religion and that is what our people want. Should they seek alternatives, we are ready to listen to them.
We have always said that our people should voice their demands openly. We are all in the same boat, and they are both the captain and the crew. Our doors are open for any opinion to be expressed, and this well known by all our citizens. It is our deep conviction that Allah has created people free, and has prescribed that each individual must enjoy [[freedom of choice]]. No one should act as if they own others.
Those in the position of leadership should deal with their subjects with compassion and understanding, because this is the duty enjoined upon them by Allah, who enjoins upon us to treat all living creatures with dignity. How can there be anything less for mankind, created as Allah's successors on earth? Our system of government does not derive its authority from man, but is enshrined in our religion and is based on = Allah's Book, the [[Quran]]. What need have we of what others have conjured up? Its teachings are eternal and complete, while the systems conjured up by man are transitory and incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhpFQpXwddoC|title=Folklore and Folklife in the United Arab Emirates|first=Sayyid H.|last=Hurreiz|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=12 July 2016|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164804/http://www.na.ae/en/Images/LIWA12.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Land was also often distributed gratis. However, while this policy benefited many landless families, enormously wealthy clans and individuals were given free land grants in proportion to their status and influence with the royal family. His majlis (a traditional Arab [[Public consultation|consultation]] council) was open to the public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} He allowed non-Muslim religious buildings, such as churches and a temple, to be built.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Zayed was also in favour of certain rights for women, such as access to education and women's labour-rights, within traditional parameters. His views regarding [[women's rights]] were considerably more [[Social liberalism|liberal]] than his counterparts in the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] nations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

After floods ravaged [[Yemen]]'s [[Ma'rib Governorate]] in 1982, Zayed financed the construction of the [[Marib Dam#Current Dam|current dam]] of [[Ma'rib]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="KhaleejTimes2013"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Emirates News Agency|WAM]] |title=Key aid projects during Zayed’s time |publisher=[[Khaleej Times]] |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20130728/ARTICLE/307289891/1002 |date=29 July 2013 |access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National2015Ma’ribDam"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Al-Qalisi, M. |author2=Vela, J. |title=The dam that Sheikh Zayed built |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-dam-that-sheikh-zayed-built-1.128295 |date=30 September 2015 |access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to replace the historical one that was damaged in antiquity, and support the country's agriculture and economy.

==Zayed Centre==
{{main|Zayed Centre}}
Controversy over the opinions of the [[Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up|Zayed Centre]] caused the Harvard Divinity School to return Sheikh Zayed's $2.5 million gift to the institution in 2000 as "tainted money." Former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]] accepted the Zayed International Prize for the Environment in 2001. The award included a monetary prize of $500,000 from the Zayed Centre, and Carter stated in his acceptance speech that the award carried extra significance to him, since it was named after his personal friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greif|first=Lloyd|title=To see Jimmy Carter's true allegiances, just follow the money|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/04/27/2008-04-27_to_see_jimmy_carters_true_allegiances_ju.html|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News|date=26 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708063611/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/04/27/2008-04-27_to_see_jimmy_carters_true_allegiances_ju.html|archivedate=8 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was similar controversy when the [[London School of Economics]] accepted a large donation by the Zayed Centre, to build a new lecture theatre in the New Academic Building in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-lses-jawdropping-16371m-structure-is-a-building-to-wow-students-1025412.html|location=London|newspaper=The Independent|first=Lucy|last=Hodges|title=The LSE's jaw-dropping £71m structure is a building to wow students|date=20 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328225648/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-lses-jawdropping-16371m-structure-is-a-building-to-wow-students-1025412.html|archivedate=28 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite student protests,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} the gift was accepted with the Sheik Zayed Theatre being the second largest lecture hall on the campus.
