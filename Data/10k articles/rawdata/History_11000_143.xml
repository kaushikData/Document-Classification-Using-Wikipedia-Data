The '''1994 Shankill Road killings''' took place on 16 June 1994 when the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) shot dead three [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) members – high-ranking member of the UVF Belfast Brigade staff [[Trevor King]] and two other UVF members, Colin Craig and David Hamilton – on the [[Shankill Road]] in Belfast, close to the UVF headquarters. The following day, the UVF launched two retaliatory attacks. In the first, UVF members shot dead a Catholic civilian taxi driver in [[Carrickfergus]]. In the second, they shot dead two Protestant civilians in [[Newtownabbey]], whom they believed were Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=17&amp;month=06&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Loughinisland massacre]], two days later, is believed to have been a further retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=18&amp;month=06&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The UVF had been considering calling a ceasefire soon, which they believed would be from a position of strength. 
The [[Irish National Liberation Army]] had been in decline since the late 1980s after the feud with [[Irish People's Liberation Organization]] in which the loss of their best operators in Belfast 1987 had left them weak and largely inactive. But in 1992 the INLA had somewhat of a resurgence in its campaign. On 14 April 1992, a [[British Army]] (BA) recruiting sergeant Michael Newman (33) was shot dead by two INLA volunteers outside an army recruiting office in [[Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-10723635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=14&amp;month=04&amp;year=1992|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significant incident as Newman was the first serving member of British Armed Forces to be killed by the INLA since 1984 when they shot dead UDR soldier Colin Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/the-irish-mail-on-sunday/20180121/282046212515926|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] &amp; [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] - ''INLA: Deadly Divisions'' p.363&lt;/ref&gt; It was also significant in that this was the first person the INLA had killed in England since the [[Airey Neave]] killing.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Holland &amp; Henry McDonald - ''INLA: Deadly Divisions'' p.360 - 366&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later they struck in England again with two firebombs in stores in [[Leeds]] causing £50,000 worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/two-jailed-for-firebomb-campaign-court-told-security-cameras-recorded-inla-men-planting-incendiary-1508873.html|title=Two jailed for firebomb campaign: Court told security cameras recorded|date=1993-10-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 14 January 1993 an INLA hit team drove around the Shankill road and the team fired rifle shots through the window of the home of UVF leader [[John "Bunter" Graham]] and seriously injured him. It was a prelude to the 1994 June killings and the INLA was a force to be feared again. In June 1993 they killed retired RUC officer, John Patrick Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Holland &amp; Henry McDonald - ''INLA: Deadly Divisions'' p.366&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shootings ==
[[File:Trevor King mural.JPG|thumb|Trevor King mural, Disraeli Street, May 2012]]
On 16 June 1994, high-ranking UVF Commander volunteer [[Trevor King]] was standing on the Shankill Road not far from "The Eagle" ("The Eagle" was the UVF's Belfast GHQ) and he was talking to fellow UVF members, David Hamilton (43) and Colin Craig (31). They were about one hundred yards away from the UVF headquarters, which was located in rooms above a shop known as "The Eagle". A car drove past them and as it did so, [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) gunmen inside the vehicle opened fire on the three men.  The car was later found burning close to Divis tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKittrick|first1=David | authorlink = David McKittrick |title=Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles|date=2001|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Lister and Hugh Jordan claimed that [[Gino Gallagher]], who was himself shot dead in 1996 during an internal dispute, was the main gunman in the attack. However, [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] and [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] said that Gallagher was inside the car which was scouting the area for UVF members, and not one of the gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald &amp; Holland|first1=Henry &amp; Jack|title=INLA - Deadly Divisions|date=2016|publisher=Poolbeg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Craig was killed on the spot. King and David Hamilton lay in the street, seriously wounded as panic and chaos erupted on the Shankill in the wake of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch94.htm|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1994|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Roy Magee was in "The Eagle" discussing an upcoming [[Combined Loyalist Military Command]] (CLMC) meeting and the possibility of a loyalist ceasefire with the UVF Brigade Staff when the attack took place. He and the others raced out of the building after hearing the gunfire. He later described the scene he came upon outside.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With some others, I ran down to where the men were. One was already dead and the others were in a very, very bad physical state. The road was in pandemonium at that stage. You could see that the leadership of the UVF was quite naturally very, very broken and disturbed about the shooting of their colleague. He [Trevor King] was a senior commander".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

King was rushed to hospital where he was put on a life-support machine. The shooting had left him paralysed from the neck down. He died on 9 July with Reverend Magee at his bedside. According to Magee, King himself made the decision to turn off the machine.

The killings were a blow for the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] and a morale boost for the INLA. The attack was the INLA's most notorious since the [[Droppin Well bombing]] in 1982 which killed seventeen people, 11 British soldiers and 6 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=text&amp;keyword=Droppin%20Well%20Bar|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=6&amp;month=12&amp;year=1982|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch82.htm|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1982|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
 
The following day, the UVF launched two 'retaliatory' attacks. In the first, UVF members shot dead a Catholic civilian taxi driver in [[Carrickfergus]]. In the second, they shot dead two Protestant civilians in [[Newtownabbey]], whom they believed were Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=17&amp;month=06&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the killings the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] decided to launch another  revenge attack when they killed six Catholic civilians in a bar while they were watching the Ireland vs Italy [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] game opener in what became known as [[Loughinisland massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=18&amp;month=06&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tit-for-tat attacks continued on and off for the spring and summer of 1994 until the [[Provisional IRA]] ceasefire of 31 August 1994 and the [[Combined Loyalist Military Command]] ceasefire in October. The attacks on the Shankill were the INLA's most deadliest attack of the 1990s.

When interviewed for [[Boston College]] for research on the conflict, [[Progressive Unionist Party]] leader [[David Ervine]] suggested the INLA might have been working in cahoots with the [[Provisional IRA]] in targeting prominent Loyalists, as the month after in July the Provisional IRA killed three leading UDA men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books/about/Voices_from_the_Grave.html?id=Eh8Q2areX6oC|title=Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland|last=Moloney|first=Ed | authorlink =Ed Moloney |date=2010-06-01|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586489335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=31&amp;month=07&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=11&amp;month=07&amp;year=1994|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=Conflict Archive on the Internet|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">The '''Academy of Certified Archivists''' is an [[United States|American]] independent, [[nonprofit organization]] of professional archivists founded in 1989.

== History ==
The professional qualifications of archivists became an issue in the 1950s, when the [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA) and the [[American Historical Association]] made the case that the archivist of the [[United States]] should be a professional, not political, appointee. The 1970s saw much internal SAA discussion of education and professional development, but few colleges and universities were interested in program accreditation. By the mid-1980s, it became clear that individual certification was the viable option. In 1987, SAA established an Interim Board for Certification (IBC) to set standards for professional certification and the exam to be administered. It also evaluated practicing archivists' [[petition]]s for certification. In 1989, one hundred such petitions were approved and the Academy of Certified Archivists (ACA) was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Linn | first      = Mott | date       = 2015 | title      = Not Waiting for Godot: The History of the Academy of Certified Archivists and the Professionalization of the Archival Field | journal    = The American Archivist | publisher  = Society of American Archivists | volume     = 78 | issue      = 1 | pages      = 99–115 | doi        = 10.17723/0360-9081.78.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2016, 231 applicants had registered for the examination and there were over 1,100 Certified Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/record-number-of-exam-applicants-for-2016/|title=Record Number of Exam Applicants for 2016!|accessdate=4 August 2016|date=July 25, 2016|last=Blalack|first=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/directory/directory.cgi|title=ACA Online Membership Directory|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership requirements ==
[[Archivist]]s seeking certification must meet eligibility requirements regarding their education and experience. That certification may be maintained by various professional development activities, including workshop attendance, and professional service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/|title=About Us|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/members-area/certification-maintenance/|title=Certification Maintenance|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examination ==
The ACA exam, offered annually at various locations, is a multiple choice test that covers seven domains of knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/get-certified/role-delineation-statement/|title=Role Delineation Statement|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate over certification ==
The benefits of certification have been a subject of debate within the profession and in its literature. When [[SAA polled]] its members in 1985, over 70% supported the ACA's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Linn | first      = Mott | date       = 2015 | title      = Not Waiting for Godot: The History of the Academy of Certified Archivists and the Professionalization of the Archival Field | journal    = The American Archivist | publisher  = Society of American Archivists | volume     = 78 | issue      = 1 | pages      = 102 | doi        = 10.17723/0360-9081.78.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 survey, [[Susan Hamburger]] found that "archival certification has a [[wikt:lukewarm|lukewarm]] to hostile response from hiring managers." Only 3% of employers required certification, and 30% preferred it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Hamburger | first      = Susan | date       = June 2014 | publisher  = Society of American Archivists | url        = https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/files/8623hx85s | access-date= 4 August 2016 |title = Archival Certification – Necessity or Nicety?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eira Tansey]]'s analysis of listserv job postings between October 2006 and May 2014 revealed a distinct regional split: "Few
jobs indicate a hiring preference for ACA archival certification, however those that do tend to be in the South and Midwest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Tansey | first = Eira | date   = 2015 | title      = The landscape of archival employment: A study of professional archivist job advertisements, 2006-2014 | url = http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ap/article/view/1084/787 | journal = Archival Practice | publisher  =  | volume     = 2 | access-date= 4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mott Lin argues that certification places archives firmly in line with other professions, and that "archivists of today are fortunate" for the practice in light of the failure to implement accreditation of individual archives or educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Linn | first      = Mott | date       = 2015 | title      = Not Waiting for Godot: The History of the Academy of Certified Archivists and the Professionalization of the Archival Field | journal    = The American Archivist | publisher  = Society of American Archivists | volume     = 78 | issue      = 1 | pages      = 115 | doi        = 10.17723/0360-9081.78.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabization''' [[Ise vs ize|or]] '''Arabisation''' ({{lang-ar|تعريب}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|taʻrīb}}'') is either the conquest and/or [[colonialism|colonization]] of a non-Arab area and growing Arab influence on non-Arab populations, causing a [[language shift]] by their gradual adoption of the [[Arabic language]] and/or their incorporation of [[Arab culture]] or [[Arab people#Identity|Arab identity]]. Generally, elements of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] origin were combined in various forms with elements from conquered civilizations and ultimately denominated "Arab". Arabization also continued in modern times, most prominently being enforced by the Arab nationalist regimes of [[Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq|Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;''Iraq, Claims in Conflict: Reversing Ethnic Cleansing in Northern Iraq''. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=S36CEfg_hp4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=forced+arabization+iraq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2GcQl7psRD&amp;sig=YW3G-Kks9o8rfW7N6I3Zi7HHIM0&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBmoVChMI0MHmytCbyAIVgbgUCh1mjQB3#v=onepage&amp;q=forced%20arabization%20iraq&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]], [[Sudan]],&lt;ref name=dwight49/&gt; [[Mauritania]], [[Algeria]]&lt;ref name="dwight49"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifcGBwAAQBAJ|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture|last=Reynolds|first=Dwight F. |date=2 April 2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521898072}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Libya]] and enforcement of Arab identity and culture upon non-Arab populations, in particular by means of not permitting autochthonous mother tongues other than Arabic in education.

After the [[rise of Islam]] in the [[Hejaz]], the Arabic culture and language were spread outside the Arabian peninsula through conquest, trade and intermarriages between members of the non-Arab local population and the peninsular Arabs. The Arabic language began to serve as a lingua franca in these areas and [[dialect]]s were formed. Although [[Yemen]] is traditionally held to be the homeland of the Arabs, most of the Yemeni population in fact did not speak [[Old Arabic]] prior to the spread of Islam, but instead [[South Semitic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nebes, Norbert, "Epigraphic South Arabian," in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Kogan and [[Andrey Korotayev]]: Sayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian) // Semitic Languages. London: Routledge, 1997, p[. 157-183.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Arabic has also been profound in many other countries whose cultures have been influenced by Islam. Arabic was a major source of vocabulary for various languages. This process reached its zenith between the 10th and 14th centuries, the high point of Arab culture, and although many Arabic words have since fallen out of use, many still remain.

== Early Arab expansion in the Near East ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
After [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Nabataean kingdom]] emerged and ruled a region extending from north of Arabia to the south of Syria. the former originating from the Arabian peninsula, who came under the influence of the earlier [[Aramaic]] culture, the neighbouring Hebrew culture of the Hasmonean kingdom, as well as the Hellenistic cultures in the region (especially with the Christianization of Nabateans in 3rd and 4th centuries). The pre-modern Arabic language was created by Nabateans, who developed the [[Nabataean alphabet]] which became the basis of modern [[Arabic script]]. The [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean language]], under heavy Arab influence, amalgamated into the [[Arabic language]].

The Arab [[Ghassanid]]s were the last major non-Islamic Semitic migration northward out of [[Yemen]] in late classic era. They were [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christian]], and clients of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They arrived in [[Theodorias (province)|Byzantine Syria]] which had a largely [[Aramean]] population. They initially settled in the [[Hauran]] region, eventually spreading to modern Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan, briefly securing governorship of parts of Syria and Transjordan away from the [[Nabataeans]].

The Arab [[Lakhmid]] Kingdom was founded by the Lakhum tribe that emigrated from [[Yemen]] in the 2nd century and ruled by the [[Banu Lakhm]], hence the name given it. They adopted the religion of the [[Church of the East]], founded in [[Assyria]]/[[Asōristān]], opposed to the Ghassanids Greek Orthodox Christianity, and were clients of the [[Sasanian Empire]].

The Byzantines and Sasanians used the Ghassanids and Lakhmids to fight proxy wars in Arabia against each other.

== History of Arabization ==
[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|Arab conquests 622 AD to 750 AD|292x292px]]

=== Arabization during the early Caliphate ===
The earliest and most significant instance of "Arabization" was the first Muslim conquests of Muhammad and the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphates]]. They built a [[Muslim Empire]] that grew well beyond the Arabian Peninsula, eventually reaching as far as [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] in the West and Central Asia to the East.

==== Southern Arabia ====
{{Further information|Southern Arabia}}
[[Old South Arabian]] was driven to extinction by the Islamic expansion, being replaced by [[Classical Arabic]] which is written with the [[Arabic script]]. The [[South Arabian alphabet]] which was used to write it also fell out of use. A separate branch of south semitic, the [[Modern South Arabian languages]] still survive today as spoken languages.

Although [[Yemen]] is traditionally held to be the homeland of Arabs, most&lt;ref&gt;Nebes, Norbert, "Epigraphic South Arabian," in Uhlig, Siegbert, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Kogan and [[Andrey Korotayev]]: Sayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian) // Semitic Languages. London: Routledge, 1997, pp. 157-183.&lt;/ref&gt; of the sedentary Yemeni population did not speak Arabic (but instead [[South Semitic]] languages) prior to the spread of Islam.

====Eastern Arabia====
{{Further information|Eastern Arabia|Bahrani people|Dilmun civilization}}
The sedentary people of pre-Islamic [[Eastern Arabia]] were mostly [[Aramaic language|Aramaic speakers]] and to some degree [[Persian language|Persian speakers]], while [[Syriac language|Syriac]] functioned as a [[liturgical language]].&lt;ref name="om"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrmJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq|title=The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity|work=Averil Cameron|year=1993|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2018}} According to [[Robert Bertram Serjeant|Serjeant]], the indigenous [[Bahrani people]] are the [[Arabized]] "descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), Jews and [[Persian people|ancient Persians (Majus)]] inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] at the time of the [[Arab conquest]]".&lt;ref name="maj"/&gt; In pre-Islamic times, the population of eastern Arabia consisted of partially Christianized Arabs,   [[Aramean]] agriculturalists and, Persian-speaking [[Zoroastrians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq|title=E.J.

====The [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Syria (region)]]====
{{Further information|Assyrian Christians|Fall of Sassanids|Muslim conquest of Syria|Islamization of Palestine}}
After the rise of Islam, the Arab tribes unified under the banner of Islam and conquered modern Jordan, Palestine, Iraq and Syria. However, even before the emergence of Islam, the Levant was already a home for several pre-Islamic Arabian kingdoms. The [[Nabateans]] kingdom of Petra which was based in Jordan, the [[Ghassanids]] kingdom which was based in the Syrian desert. Some of these kingdoms were under the indirect influence of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]]. The Nabateans transcript developed in Petra was the base for the current Arabic transcript while the Arab heritage is full of poetry recording the wars between the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] Arabian tribes in Syria. In the 7th century, and after the dominance of Arab Muslims within a few years, the major [[garrison|garrison towns]] developed into the major cities. The local [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic]] speaking population, which shared a very close Semitic linguistic/genetic ancestry with the [[Qahtanite|Qahtani]] and [[Adnani]] Arabs, was somewhat Arabized. the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] largely resisted Arabization in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], The Assyrians of the north continued to speak [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] influenced [[Neo-Aramaic]] dialects descending from the [[Imperial Aramaic]] of the [[Assyrian Empire]], together with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] which was founded in Assyria in the 5th century BC, and retaining [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] Christianity. These linguistic and religious traditions still persist to the present day. The [[Gnostic]] [[Mandeans]] also retained their ancient culture, religion and [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]-[[Aramaic]] language after the Arab Islamic conquest, and these too still survive today.

====Egypt====
{{See also|Muslim conquest of Egypt}}
Since the foundation of the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt had been under the influence of Greek culture, and later fell under the control of the [[Persian Empire]] and [[Roman Empire]]. Eventually it was conquered from the Eastern [[Romans]] by the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate in the 7th century CE. The [[Coptic language]], which was written using the [[Coptic script|Coptic variant]] of the [[Greek alphabet]], was spoken in Egypt before the Islamic conquest. As a result of Egypt's cultural Arabization, the adopted Arabic language began to serve as a lingua franca. The [[Egyptian Arabic]] dialect has retained a number of Coptic words, and [[Egyptian Arabic#Coptic substratum|the grammar takes some influence from Coptic]], as well. Currently the Ancient Coptic language only survives as a liturgical language of the Coptic Church and is fluently spoken by many Egyptian priests.

====North Africa and Iberia====
Neither North Africa nor the Iberian Peninsula were strangers to Semitic culture: the [[Phoenicians]] and later the [[Carthaginians]] dominated parts of the North African and Iberian shores for more than eight centuries until they were suppressed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and by the following [[Vandal]] and [[Visigoth]]ic invasions, and the [[Berber people|Berber]] incursions. After the [[Arab]] invasion of North Africa, The [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes allied themselves with the [[Umayyad]] Arab Muslim armies in invading Spain. Later, in 743 AD, the Berbers defeated the Arab Umayyad armies and expelled them for most of West North Africa (al-Maghreb al-Aqsa) during the [[Berber Revolt]], but not the territory of Ifriqiya which stayed Arab (East Algeria, Tunisia, and West-Libya). Centuries later some migrating [[Arab tribes]] settled in some plains while the Berbers remained the dominant group mainly in desert areas including mountains. The Inland North Africa remained exclusively Berber until the 11th century; the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the other hand, remained Arabized, particularly in the south, until the 16th century.

After finishing the establishment of the Arab city of [[Mahdia|Al Mahdiya]] in Tunisia and spreading the Islamic [[Shiite]] faith, some of the many [[Arab]] [[Fatimids]] left Tunisia and parts of eastern Algeria to the local [[Zirids]] (972–1148).&lt;ref name="stearns"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Stearns|first1 = Peter N.|last2 = Leonard Langer|first2 = William|title = The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged|publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year = 2001|edition = 6|pages = 129–131|isbn = 0-395-65237-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of Ifriqiya by the [[Banu Hilal]], a warlike Arab [[Bedouin]] tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of Egypt to seize North Africa, sent the region's urban and economic life into further decline.&lt;ref name="stearns" /&gt; The Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref name="islamic-dynasties"&gt;{{cite book |last = Singh|first = Nagendra Kr|title = International encyclopaedia of islamic dynasties|volume = 4: A Continuing Series|publisher = Anmol Publications PVT.

===Arabization in Islamic Iberia===
After the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], under the [[Arab]] [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] Iberia (''al-Andalus'') incorporated elements of Arabic language and culture. The [[Mozarab]]s were [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] [[Christian]]s who lived under Arab Islamic rule in [[Al-Andalus]]. Their descendants remained unconverted to [[Islam]], but did however adopt elements of Arabic language and [[Arab culture|culture]] and dress. They were mostly [[Roman Catholics]] of the [[Mozarabic Rite|Visigothic or Mozarabic Rite]]. Most of the Mozarabs were descendants of [[Hispania|Hispano]]–[[Visigoths|Gothic]] Christians and were primarily speakers of the [[Mozarabic language]] under Islamic rule. Many were also what the [[Arabist]] Mikel de Epalza calls ''"Neo-Mozarabs"'', that is [[Northern Europe]]ans who had come to the Iberian Peninsula and picked up Arabic, thereby entering the Mozarabic community.

Besides Mozarabs, another group of people in Iberia eventually came to surpass the Mozarabs both in terms of population and Arabization. These were the [[Muladi|Muladi or Muwalladun]], most of whom were descendants of local Hispano-Basques and Visigoths who converted to Islam and adopted Arabic culture, dress, and language. By the 11th century, most of the population of al-Andalus was Muladi, with large minorities of other Muslims, Mozarabs, and [[Sephardic Jews]]. It was the Muladi, together with the Berber, Arab, and other ([[Saqaliba]] and [[Zanj]]) Muslims who became collectively termed in Christian Europe as "[[Moors]]".

The [[Andalusian Arabic]] language was spoken in Iberia during Islamic rule.

===Arabization in Islamic Sicily, Malta, and Crete===
A similar process of Arabization and Islamization occurred in the [[Emirate of Sicily]] (''as-Siqilliyyah''), [[Emirate of Crete]] (''al-Iqritish''), and Malta (''al-Malta''), albeit for a much shorter time span than al-Andalus. However, this resulted in the now defunct [[Sicilian Arabic]] language to develop, from which the modern [[Maltese language]] derives.

===Arabization in Sudan===
[[File:Migration of Arabs into Sudan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing the late medieval migration of Arabs into Sudan]] 
In the 12th century, the Arab [[Ja'alin tribe]] migrated into [[Nubia]] and [[Sudan]] and formerly occupied the country on both banks of the [[Nile]] from [[Khartoum]] to [[Abu Hamad]]. They trace their lineage to [[Abbas ibn 'Abdul Muttalib|Abbas]], uncle of the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]]. They are of Arab origin, but now of mixed blood mostly with [[Sudan (region)|Northern Sudanese]] and [[Nubians]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSDBkKgNgx8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=jaalin#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 17|author=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, JSTOR (Organization)|year=1888|edition=|editor=|publisher=Books.google.com|location=|page=16|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were at one time subject to the [[Funj]] kings, but their position was in a measure independent. [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] said that the true Ja'alin from the eastern desert of Sudan are exactly like the [[Bedouin]] of eastern [[Arabia]].

In 1846, many Arab [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]] migrated from [[Hejaz]] in present-day Saudi Arabia into what is now [[Eritrea]] and north-east Sudan after tribal warfare had broken out in their homeland.  The Rashaida of Sudan and Eritrea live in close proximity with the [[Beja people]]. Large numbers of [[Bani Rasheed]] are also found on the Arabian Peninsula. They are related to the [[Banu Abs]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2010/02/eritrea-rashaida-people.html|title=Eritrea: The Rashaida People|publisher=Madote.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashaida speak [[Hejazi Arabic]].

In 1888, the [[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute]] of Great Britain claimed that the Arabic spoken in Sudan was "a pure but archaic Arabic". The pronunciation of certain letters was like [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]] and [[Khaleeji Arabic]], and not like the [[Egyptian Arabic]] which is very different from both. In Sudanese Arabic, the g letter is being the pronunciation for [[Kaph]] and J letter is being the pronunciation for [[Gimel|Jim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSDBkKgNgx8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=jaalin#v=onepage&amp;q=arab%20speaking%20tribes%20of%20the%20sudan%20archaic%20pure&amp;f=false|title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 17|author=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, JSTOR (Organization)|year=1888|location=|page=11|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabization in Sahel===
{{main article|Baggara}}
[[Image:Baggara Arabs Belt.svg|thumb|right|300px|Baggara belt]]
In Medieval times, the [[Baggara Arabs]] a grouping of [[Arab]] ethnic groups who speak [[Shuwa Arabic]] (which is one of the regional [[varieties of Arabic]] in Africa) migrated into Africa, mainly between [[Lake Chad]] and southern [[Kordofan]].

Currently, they live in a belt stretching across [[Sudan]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]] and [[South Sudan]] and numbering over six million people. Like other Arabic speaking tribes in the [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]], Baggara tribes have origin ancestry from the [[Juhaynah]] Arab tribes who migrated directly from the [[Arabian peninsula]] or from other parts of [[north Africa]]. {{sfn|deWaal and Flint|2006|pp=9}}

Arabic is an official language of Chad and Sudan as well as a [[national language]] in Niger, [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and South Sudan. In addition, Arabic dialects are spoken of minorities in [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Central African Republic]].

===Arabization in Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Tunisia===
{{See also|Berberism}}
Arabization means introduction of Arabic speech and education and an increased usage of Arabic where the [[Berber language]] was used before. Governments in North African countries have long promoted Arabization as a nationalist platform. Both [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and [[Darija|Dārija]] are on the rise.

After the [[Evian Accords]], while trying to build an independent and unified nation state, the Algerian government under [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]’s rule began a policy of “Arabization”. Indeed, due to the lasting and deep colonization, French was the major administrative and academic language in Algeria, even more than in neighbor countries. The unification and research of a true Algerian identity was to be found in language and religion, as stated in the 1963 constitution : “La langue arabe est la langue nationale et officielle de l’État.” (Arabic is the official state language) and “L'islam est la religion de l'État [...]” (Islam is the state religion) and confirmed in 1969, 1976, 1989, 1996 and 2018. In 1964 the first practical measure was the Arabization of primary education and the introduction of religious education, the state relying on Egyptian teachers – belonging to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and thus religious&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Haidar, Farida. 2000. ‘Arabisation in Algeria’. International Journal of Francophone Studies 3 (3): 151–163.&lt;/ref&gt; – due to its lack of literary Arabic-speakers. In 1968, during the [[Houari Boumediene]] regime, Arabization was extended, and a law&lt;ref&gt;ordonnance n° 68-92 du 26 avril rendant obligatoire, pour les fonctionnaires et assimilés, la connaissance de la langue nationale (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; tried to enforce the use of Arabic for civil servants, but again, the major role played by French was only diminished. Many laws followed, trying to ban French, Algerian Arabic and [[Berber languages|Berber]] from schools, administrative acts and street signs, but this revived Berber opposition to the state and created a distinction between those educated in Arabic and those in French, the latter still being favored by elites.
The whole policy was not efficient, French had kept its importance&lt;ref&gt;Benrabah, Mohamed. 2007. ‘Language Maintenance and Spread: French in Algeria’. International Journal of Francophone Studies 10 (1–2): 193–215&lt;/ref&gt; and Berber opposition was growing, contributing to the [[1988 October Riots]]. Some Berber groups  (such as the [[Kabyle people]]) felt that their ancestral culture and language were threatened and that Arabic was given more focus at the expense of their own identity. After the [[Algerian Civil War]], the government tried to enforce even more the use of Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/afrique/algerie_loi-96.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but the relative effect of this policy after 1998 (the limit fixed for complete Arabization) forced the heads of state to make concessions toward [[Berber languages]], recognising it in 2002&lt;ref&gt;article 3bis in the 2002 constitutional revision&lt;/ref&gt; as another national language that will be promoted. But because of the unicity of literary Arabic, which gives an advantage to it over divided [[Berber languages]], Arabization is still an objective for the state, for example with laws on civil and administrative procedures.&lt;ref&gt;loi du 25 fevrier 2008 Bttp://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/afrique/algerie_loi-diverses.htm#Loi_n°_08-09_du_25_février_2008_portant_code_de_procédure_civile_et_administrative_&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabization in Iraq===
{{main article|Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq|Al-Anfal Campaign}}
[[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'ath Party]] had aggressive Arabization policies involving driving out many pre-Arab and non-Arab races – mainly [[Kurds]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Yezidis]], [[Shabaks]], [[Armenians]], [[Turcomans]], [[Kawliya]], [[Circassians]] and [[Mandeans]] – replacing them with Arab families. [[Kirkuk#1970 Autonomy Agreement|This policy]] drove out 500,000 people in the years 1991-2003. The Baathists also pressured many of these ethnic groups to identify as Arabs, and restrictions were imposed upon their languages, cultural expression and right to self-identification. The [[Anfal campaign]] destroyed many Kurdish, Assyrian and other ethnic minority villages and enclaves, and their inhabitants were often forcibly relocated to large cities in the hope that they would be Arabized.

===Arabization in Islamic State of Iraq and Levant campaign===
{{See also|Human rights in Rojava|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}
While formally committed to [[Islamism]] and [[polyethnicity]], the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Levant]] (ISIL) has frequently targeted non-Arab groups such as such as [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Turcomans]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] and [[Yezidis]].&lt;ref name=OHCHR-2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic: Twenty-seventh session|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/HRC_CRP_ISIS_14Nov2014.doc|website=UN Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OHCHR-27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session27/Documents/A-HRC-27-CRP1.pdf|title=Selected testimonies from victims of the Syrian conflict: Twenty-seventh session|website=UN Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been claimed that these (ISIL) campaigns were a part of an organized Arabization plan.&lt;ref name=OHCHR-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OHCHR-27 /&gt; A Kurdish official in Iraqi Kurdistan claimed that in particular the [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|ISIL campaign]] in Sinjar was a textbook case of Arabization.&lt;ref name="rudaw29122014"&gt;[http://rudaw.net/mobile/english/interview/29122014]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested in academia that modern [[Islamism]] in general and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Levant]] (ISIL) in particular would be motivated and driven by a desire to reinforce Arab cultural dominion over the religion of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unviability of Islamic Caliphate: Ethnic Barriers - Part 1|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/liaquat-ali-khan/unviability-of-islamic-caliphate_b_8922080.html|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabization in Sudan===
[[File:Darfur report - Page 4 Image 2.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Arab [[Janjaweed]] tribes have been accused of killing hundreds of thousands of non-Arab Sudanese in a 2004/05 genocide in Darfur.]] [[Sudan]] is an ethnically-mixed country that is economically and politically dominated by the society of central northern Sudan, where many strongly identify as Arabs and Muslims. The population in southern Sudan consists mostly of Christian and Animist [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic people]]. The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005) is typically characterized as a conflict between these two groups of people. In the 2011 [[Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|Southern Sudanese independence referendum]], the latter voted for secession and became independent.

The unrelated [[War in Darfur]] was an uprising in the western [[Darfur]] region of Sudan, caused by oppression of Darfur's non-Arab [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] and [[Masalit people|Masalit]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3496731.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Sudan's Darfur conflict |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/SD_DAR.htm |title=Reuters AlertNet – Darfur conflict |publisher=Alertnet.org |accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sudanese government responded to the armed resistance by carrying out a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against Darfur's non-Arabs.

===Arabization in Syria===
{{See also|Human rights in Rojava}}
Since the independence of Syria in 1946, the ethnically diverse [[Rojava]] region in northern Syria suffered grave human rights violations, because all governments pursued a most brutal policy of Arabization.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=SYRIA: The Silenced Kurds; Vol. 8, No. 4(E)|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm|website=Human Rights Watch|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all non-Arab ethnic groups within Syria, such as [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Armenians]], [[Turcomans]] and [[Mhallami]] have faced pressure from [[Arab Nationalism|Arab Nationalist]] policies to identify as ''Arabs'', the most archaic of it was directed against the [[Kurds]]. In his report for the 12th session of the UN [[Human Rights Council]] titled ''Persecution and Discrimination against Kurdish Citizens in Syria'', the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] held:&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Persecution and Discrimination against Kurdish Citizens in Syria, Report for the 12th session of the UN Human Rights Council|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session12/SY/KIS-KurdsinSyria-eng.pdf|website=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Successive Syrian governments continued to adopt a policy of ethnic discrimination and national persecution against Kurds, completely depriving them of their national, democratic and human rights — an integral part of human existence. The government imposed ethnically-based programs, regulations and exclusionary measures on various aspects of Kurds’ lives — political, economic, social and cultural."

The [[Kurdish language]] was not officially recognized, it had no place in public schools and was outlawed at the workplace.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tejel&gt;{{cite book|first=Jordi |last=Tejel |url=http://www.kurdipedia.org/books/74488.pdf |format=PDF |title=Syria's kurds history, politics and society |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-203-89211-9 |pages=X-X |edition=1. publ. |author2=Welle, Jane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001038/http://www.kurdipedia.org/books/74488.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as well as businesses could not be given Kurdish names.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009" /&gt; Books, music, videos and other material could not be published in Kurdish language.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tejel /&gt; Expressions of Kurdish identity like songs and folk dances were outlawed&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tejel /&gt; and frequently prosecuted under a purpose-built criminal law against "weakening national sentiment".&lt;ref name="HRW-2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=HRW World Report 2010|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010|website=Human Rights Watch|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating the [[Nowruz]] holiday was often constrained.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tejel /&gt;

In 1973 the Syrian authorities confiscated 750 square kilometers of fertile agricultural land in [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], which were owned and cultivated by tens of thousands of Kurdish citizens, and gave it to Arab families brought in from other provinces.&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSmonitor-2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=A murder stirs Kurds in Syria|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0616/p01s03-wome.html|website=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 in another such scheme in Al-Hasakah governate, 6,000 square kilometers around [[Al-Malikiyah]] were granted to Arab families, while tens of thousands of Kurdish inhabitants of the villages concerned were evicted.&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009" /&gt; These and other expropriations of ethnic Kurdish citizens followed a deliberate masterplan, called "Arab Belt initiative", attempting to depopulate the resource-rich Jazeera of its ethnic Kurdish inhabitants and settle ethnic Arabs there.&lt;ref name="HRW-1996" /&gt;

==Reversing Arabization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:Flag of Syrian Democratic Forces.svg|thumb|The multilingual flag of [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] expresses the [[Polyethnicity|polyethnic]] agenda of the faction in the [[Syrian Civil War]] as opposed to Arabization policies.]]

===Historic reversions===
The [[Reconquista]] in Spain is the most notable example for a historic reversion of Arabization. The process of Arabization and Islamization was reversed as the mostly Romance speaking Christian kingdoms in the north of the peninsula gradually conquered al-Andalus and [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] and [[Christianization|Christianized]] the region, although the culture, languages and religious traditions imposed differed from those of the previous Visigothic kingdom.

===Reversions in modern times===
In modern times, there have been various political developments to reverse the process of Arabization. Notable among these are:

* The 1929 introduction of the [[Latin Alphabet]] instead of the [[Arabic Alphabet|Arabic Abjad]] in [[Turkey]] as part of the [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] reforms.
* The 1948 founding of the non-Arab state of [[Israel]] in a previously Arab dominated area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|date=14 May 1948|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The recent establishment of Kurdish-dominated polities in the [[Mesopotamia]] as [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and multi-ethnic [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-kurdistan-self-governance-teach-kurdish-language.html|title=After 52-year ban, Syrian Kurds now taught Kurdish in schools|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=6 November 2015|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Berberism]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] political-cultural movement of ethnic, geographic, or cultural [[nationalism]] present in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and broader North Africa including [[Mali]]. The Berberist movement is in opposition to [[Islamist]]-driven cultural Arabization and the [[pan-Arabist]] political ideology and also associated with [[secularism]].
* There is a longstanding campaign in [[Iran]] to remove Arabic [[loanwords]] from the [[Persian language]] or even give up the [[Arabic Alphabet|Arabic Abjad]] for a different script, e.g. the [[Manichaean alphabet]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[Image:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|Statue of Arete in [[Library of Celsus|Celsus' Library]] in [[Ephesus]]]]

'''''Arete''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]), in its basic sense, means "excellence of any kind".&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, H.G.]] &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, R.]] ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'', 9th ed. (Oxford, 1940), [[Sub voce#sub verbo|s.v.]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=LSJ%20a)reth/&amp;lang=original {{lang|grc|ἀρετή}}].&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also mean "moral virtue".&lt;ref name="LSJ"/&gt; In its earliest appearance in [[Greek language|Greek]], this notion of excellence was ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.

The term from [[Homeric]] times onwards is not gender specific. Homer applies the term of both the Greek and Trojan heroes as well as major female figures, such as [[Penelope]], the wife of the Greek hero [[Odysseus]]. In the Homeric poems, Arete is frequently associated with bravery, but more often with effectiveness. The person of Arete is of the highest effectiveness; they use all their faculties—strength, bravery, and wit—to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, then, Arete involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans.

In some contexts, Arete is explicitly linked with human knowledge, where the expressions "virtue is knowledge" and "Arete is knowledge" are used interchangeably. The highest human potential is knowledge and all other human abilities are derived from this central capacity. If Arete is knowledge and study, the highest human knowledge is knowledge about knowledge itself; in this light, the theoretical study of human knowledge, which Aristotle called "contemplation", is the highest human ability and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hooker {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/ARETE.HTM |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104052613/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/ARETE.HTM |title=Areté |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Ancient Greeks]] applied the term to anything: for example, the excellence of a chimney, the excellence of a bull for breeding, and the excellence of a man.  The meaning of the word changes depending on what it describes since everything has its own peculiar excellence; the ''arete'' of a man is different from the ''arete'' of a horse.  This way of thinking comes first from [[Plato]], where it can be seen in the [[Allegory of the Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/ALLEGORY.HTM Greek Philosophy: The Allegory of the Cave, The Divided Line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116162350/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/ALLEGORY.HTM |date=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[aristocracy|aristocratic class]] was presumed, essentially by definition, to be exemplary of ''arete'': "The root of the word is the same as ''aristos'', the word which shows superlative ability and superiority, and ''aristos'' was constantly used in the plural to denote the [[nobility]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Paideia; the Ideals of Greek Culture'', [[Werner Jaeger]], Oxford University Press, NY, 1945. Vol. I, pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 5th and 4th centuries BC, ''arete'' as applied to men had developed to include quieter virtues, such as ''dikaiosyne'' ([[justice]]) and ''[[sophrosyne]]'' (self-restraint).  [[Plato]] attempted to produce a [[moral philosophy]] that incorporated this new usage,&lt;ref&gt;And in so doing, developed ideas that played a central part in later [[Christian]] thought&lt;/ref&gt; but it was in the work of [[Aristotle]] that the doctrine  of ''arete'' found its fullest flowering. Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics|Doctrine of the Mean]]'' is a paradigm example of his thinking.

''Arete'' has also been used by Plato when talking about athletic training and also the education of young boys. Stephen G. Miller delves into this usage in his book ''Ancient Greek Athletics''. Aristotle is quoted as deliberating between education towards ''arete'' "...or those that are theoretical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Stephen|title=Arete: Greek Sports from Ancient Sources|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|isbn=978-0520241541|pages=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating towards ''arete'' in this sense means that the boy would be educated towards things that are useful in life. However, even Plato himself says that ''arete'' is not something that can be agreed upon. He says, "Nor is there even an agreement about what constitutes ''arete'', something that leads logically to a disagreement about the appropriate training for ''arete''."&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller 2004&lt;/ref&gt; To say that ''arete'' has a common definition of excellence or fulfillment may be an overstatement simply because it was very difficult to pinpoint ''arete'', much less the proper ways to go about obtaining it.

==Athletics==
It was commonly believed that the mind, body, and soul each had to be developed and prepared for a man to live a life of arete. This led to the thought that athletics had to be present in order to obtain arete. They did not need to consume one's life, merely exercise the body into the right condition for arete, just like the mind and soul would be exercised by other means.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Homer==
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', "''arete''" is used mainly to describe [[hero]]es and nobles and their mobile dexterity, with special reference to [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[courage]], but it is not limited to this.  [[Penelope]]'s ''arete'', for example, relates to [[co-operation]], for which she is praised by [[Agamemnon]].  The excellence of the gods generally included their power, but, in the ''Odyssey'' (13.42), the gods can grant excellence to a life, which is contextually understood to mean prosperity.  [[Arete (mythology)|Arete]] was also the name of [[Alcinous|King Alcinous]]'s wife.

According to [[Bernard Knox]]'s notes found in the [[Robert Fagles]] translation of ''The Odyssey'', "arete" is also associated with the Greek word for "pray", ''araomai''.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. The Odyssey. trans. by Robert Fagles. Introduction and notes by Bernard Knox. Penguin Classics Deluxe Ed, London. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the Iliad the way Homer describes Achilles is an example of Arete (187). Arete is associated with the goodness and prowess of a warrior (187). Debra Hawhee points out that the norms and practices of Athenian virtuosity “operate within the politics of reputation, whose normative poles are honor and shame” (187). This means Arete functions as an external phenomenon depending on outside reception and acknowledgement for its instantiation (188). Dying in battle or securing a victory in the Olympic Games were considered ''agathos'' (good) and, hence, deserving of ''timê'' (honor).  So, not only is Achilles a brave and brilliant warrior but also, from the outset, he is destined to die in battle at Troy with the utmost glory—a guarantor of Arete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawhee|first=Debra|title=Agonism and Arete|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/par/summary/v035/35.3hawhee.html|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personification==
{{Further|Virtus (deity)}}
Arete was occasionally personified as a [[Arete (goddess)|goddess]], the sister of [[Homonoia (mythology)|Homonoia]] (not to be confused with [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]]), and the daughter of the goddess of [[justice]], [[Praxidike]].

Arete and Homonoia were known jointly as the ''Praxidikai'' (Exacters of Justice).  As with many minor Greek deities, there is little or no real mythical background to Arete, who is used at most as a personification of virtue.

The only story involving Arete was originally told in the 5th century BC by the [[sophist]] [[Prodicus]], and concerns the early life of the [[hero]] [[Heracles]]. At a crossroads, Arete appeared to Heracles as a young maiden, and offered him glory and a life of struggle against evil; her counterpart [[Kakia (mythology)|Kakia]] (κακία, "badness"), offered him wealth and pleasure. Heracles chose to follow the path of Arete.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This story was later used by [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, such as [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]]. Justin and Basil portray Arete as a squalidly dressed and unattractive figure,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} but Methodius portrays her positively in ''[[Banquet of the Ten Virgins]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Paideia==
Arete is a significant part of the [[paideia]] of ancient Greeks: the training of the boy to manhood. This training in arete included [[physical training]], for which the Greeks developed the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]; mental training, which included [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[rhetoric]], and [[basic science]]s; and [[spirituality|spiritual]] training, which included [[music]] and what is called [[virtue]].

==Examples of usage==
* "Virtue (''arete'') then is a settled disposition of the mind determining the choice of actions and emotions, consisting essentially in the observance of the mean relative to us, this being determined by principle, that is, as the prudent man would determine it."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'', II vi 15, translated H. Rackham (1934: Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence (''arete''), if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things" (the Admonition of Paul in Philippians).&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament'', Philippians 4.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Pirsig]] uses "arete" as a synonym for Quality in his book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''. This includes an extensive discussion of Plato's "Phaedrus" and the historical contrast between Dialectic and Rhetoric. "And what is good, Phaedrus, And what is not good—Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?" Pirsig's line plays off a line in the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|The Phaedrus]]'' which reads: "And what is well and what is badly—need we ask Lysias, or any other poet or orator, who ever wrote or will write either a political or any other work, in metre or out of metre, poet or prose writer, to teach us this?"&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Benjamin Jowett&lt;/ref&gt;
* "O father Zeus, give honor to this hymn for a victor at Olympia, and to his now famous ''arete'' in boxing". From a Pindarian ode inscribed on an Olympic victor's statue of Diagoras of Rhodes that is set up in Olympia.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;
* Arete is the name of a key protagonist in [[The Philosopher Kings (novel)|''The Philosopher Kings'']], the second book of [[Jo Walton]]'s [[The Just City|''Thessaly trilogy'']] in which a group of people gathered by the [[time-traveling]] [[goddess]] [[Athena]] work to achieve the ideal society as described in [[Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']]. She is a precocious teenager who also appears in the sequel. Arete's name and its meaning ("excellence") is a small but important plot point in the book - as well as a general theme of the series as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">'''Bethanure''', also known as '''Beth Tanura''' ({{lang-arc|בית תנורא}}) and '''Bar Tanura''' ({{lang-arc|באר תנורא}}), was a Jewish and now [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populated village located in the [[Barwari]] region in [[Duhok Governorate]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

== History ==
The town was inhabited by Jews which claimed that their ancestors founded it after their return from [[Babylon]], although many documents shows that the village existed in pre-Jewish era as an Assyrian pagan village: Judaism probably became the village's religion in the first centuries BC or AD. Economically speaking, the villagers supported themselves through manual labor and agriculture, and in 1893 the community was pillaged by Kurds from the mountains, who killed two Jews and wounded others. The remainder fled to the neighbouring villages, and did not dare return to their homes until assured of the protection of the Vali of [[Mosul]], which they secured through a letter from [[Moses ha-Levi]], [[chief rabbi]] of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=959&amp;letter=M&amp;search=mosul Mosul], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Beth Tanura has declined and even by the 1900s it was still smaller than in the centuries before because of  massacres led by [[Kurds]] against the village's population. However, The village population grew after the [[Assyrian genocide]], when many [[Tyari]]-Assyrians from the [[Hakkari]] mountains to the north in [[Turkey]] settled in the village. The Assyrian population was almost equal in numbers to the Jewish one, however the Jewish population remained a majority and the farmlands remained under Jewish ownership up until 1951, when the 17 Jewish families that remained, left ''en masse'' to [[Israel]]. After the exodus of the Iraqi Jews, Beth Tanura became a Christian village until Saddam's campaign against the Kurds, which led to the exodus of many Assyrians from the area. The Iraqi army destroyed the village in 1971, and destroyed the ancient houses that were mostly built by the original Jewish population.

== Language ==
The local dialect, known as the [[Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Betanure]], is among the rarest and most seriously endangered varieties of [[neo-Aramaic]] spoken at the present time.&lt;ref&gt;Mutzafi, Hezy. [http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/dzo/artikel/201/537_201.pdf?t=1203694721 The Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Betanure], 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-447-05710-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of Moses''', dictated by [[Joseph Smith]], is part of the [[Biblical canon|scriptural canon]] for some in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].

==Origin==
{{See also|Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible}}
In June 1830, Smith began a new [[Bible]] translation that was intended to restore "many important points touching the salvation of men, [that] had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith ([[Joseph Fielding Smith]] ed.), ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'', 16 February 1832, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters that now make up the Book of Moses were first published in the church newspapers ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'' and ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' in the 1830s and 1840s.

===Publication by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Book of Moses is considered part of the scriptural canon of the LDS Church. The eight chapters of the Book of Moses were included as a separate book within the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] through a series of events subsequent to Smith's death. [[Franklin D. Richards (Mormon apostle)|Franklin D. Richards]], who published the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price in 1851, only had access to the early versions of the JST found in church newspapers along with another incomplete handwritten part of JST Genesis, not the original manuscripts. For this reason the Book of Moses ended abruptly in the middle of the story of Noah. Richards published everything he had at the time, and what is now the Book of Moses was later added by [[Orson Pratt]] in the 1878 edition of the Pearl of Great Price.&lt;ref name=Matthews1986/&gt; The Pearl of Great Price, including the Book of Moses, was officially canonized by the LDS Church in 1880.

===Publication by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints===
The [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church, now the [[Community of Christ]]) began publishing portions of the Book of Moses in its canonical [[Doctrine and Covenants]] (D&amp;C) in 1864. Section 22 of the D&amp;C contains Moses chapter 1, and section 36 contains Moses chapter 7. The inclusion of these excerpts in the Doctrine and Covenants was officially approved by the RLDS Church in 1970.

The RLDS Church began publishing the complete [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] in 1867 (giving it the name "The Holy Scriptures" and more commonly known as the "Inspired Version"); the portions of the Book of Moses that are not contained in the RLDS Church's D&amp;C are contained within this larger translation.

* Moses 1: The events described in Moses 1 are portrayed as taking place sometime after Jehovah spoke to Moses out of the [[burning bush]] but before Moses had returned to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel (See Exodus 4:27). The details of Moses' experience in chapter 1 place it squarely in the tradition of ancient "[[Merkabah|heavenly ascent]]" literature (e.g., the pseudepigraphal [[Apocalypse of Abraham]]) and its relationship to temple theology, rites, and ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley]]. [http://farms.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=71 "To open the last dispensation: Moses chapter 1"] in ''Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless: Classic Essays of Hugh W. Nibley'', edited by [[Truman G. Madsen]], pp. 1–20. Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, [[Brigham Young University]], 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey M. Bradshaw]]. [http://deutsch.fairlds.org/konferenz/conf08a.htm "The ''Apocalypse of Abraham'': An ancient witness for the book of Moses"], ''FAIR Germany Conference,'' Frankfurt, Germany, 28 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief prologue, Moses is given a description of God’s majesty and a confirmation of the work to which he had previously been foreordained as a "son of God." He is then shown the "world upon which he was created" and "all the children of men which are, and which were created."&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Apocalypse of Abraham 21:7; 22:2, 5; and the LDS [[Book of Abraham]] 3:22–23)&lt;/ref&gt; Then, having gone out the presence of God and no longer being clothed with His glory, Moses falls to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Apocalypse of Abraham 10:1–3)&lt;/ref&gt; He is then left to himself to be tested in a dramatic encounter with [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Apocalypse of Abraham 13–14)&lt;/ref&gt; Having banished Satan through the power of the Only Begotten, Moses is "filled with the Holy Ghost." He "calls upon the name of God" in prayer, and is answered by a voice enumerating specific blessings. While "the voice is still speaking," Moses beholds every particle of the earth and all of its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Apocalypse of Abraham 21:1)&lt;/ref&gt; The culminating sequence begins in verse 31 when Moses, having continued to inquire of the Lord, returns to his presence.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. the corresponding illustration in the ''Codex Sylvester'', the oldest complete account of the Apocalypse of Abraham)&lt;/ref&gt; God then speaks with Moses face to face, describing his purposes for this earth and its inhabitants ("this is my work and my glory: to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" Moses 1:39). Finally, the chapter closes with an allusion referring to Smith's restoration of the lost words of scripture (echoing a similar prophecy in the pseudepigraphal [[Second Book of Enoch|2 Enoch]] 35:1–2), and stating that these words are to be shown only to those that believe (paralleling the pseudepigraphal [[2 Esdras#4 Ezra|4 Ezra]] 14:6, 45–47). Then follows a vision outlining the creation, the [[fall of man]], and subsequent events in the lives of Adam and Eve and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Apocalypse of Abraham 21:3–5, 23:1–14)&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with ancient Jewish sources which affirm that Moses saw these events in vision.&lt;ref&gt;E. Douglas Clark. "A prologue to Genesis: Moses 1 in light of Jewish traditions." ''[[BYU Studies]]'' '''45'''(1) (2006): 129–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses 2–8===
Moses 2–8 generally follow the first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]], but often provide alternative interpretations of the text or significant additional detail not found in the [[Bible]]. Among the notable differences are the following:
* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/2 Moses 2] (cf. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&amp;version=KJV Genesis 1]): A brief prologue affirming that the account derives from the words of God directly to Moses is added in verse 1. The repetition of the phrase "I, God" throughout the chapter also emphasizes the purported firsthand nature of the account. The idea that all things were created "by mine Only Begotten" (i.e., Jesus Christ, in his premortal state) is made clear, as is the Son’s identity as the co-creator at the time when God said "Let us make man." Otherwise, the structure and basic premises of the Genesis account of the Creation are left intact. While following generally similar schemas, the two later versions of the creation story given in the [[Book of Abraham]] and in the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|temple endowment]] are replete with additional changes—some subtle and others stunning—that give new perspectives on the events portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nielsen |first1= F.

* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/3 Moses 3] (cf. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&amp;version=KJV Genesis 2]): The Book of Moses explains the meaning of verse 5 in terms of the LDS idea of a ''spiritual'' creation. God explains that He: "''created all things … spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth.'' For ''I,'' the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. ''And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and'' not ''yet'' a man to till the ground; ''for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air'' (additions italicized).{{#tag:ref|see also vv. 7, 9|group="cf"}} Consistent with this concept, some ancient sources assert that the heavenly hosts—variously described as including the angels, the sons of God, and/or the souls of humanity—were part of the light that appeared on day one of creation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Margaret Barker]]. [http://www.marquette.edu/maqom/veil.html  "Beyond the veil of the temple: The High Priestly origins of the apocalypses"] ''Scottish Journal of Theology'' '''51'''(1) (1998): 1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Verse 17 is expanded in a way that reinforces the LDS teaching that Adam and Eve were placed in a situation where they were required to exercise freedom of choice in order to continue their progression through the experience of earth life{{#tag:ref|"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, ''nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it,'' for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."|group="cf"}} As in the [[Qur'an]], the transgression of Adam and Eve that led to their coming to earth is seen as a positive and necessary step that would provide the preparatory schooling they needed for an eventual glorious return to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;at-Tabataba'i, Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn. 1973.''

* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/4 Moses 4] (cf. [http://kingjbible.com/genesis/3.htm Genesis 3]): Four verses are added to the beginning of the Genesis version of this chapter, interrupting the flow of the story to give an account of heavenly councils where the nature and purposes of creation were discussed and decided. These verses echo stories in Jewish [[midrash]] recording that God "took counsel with the souls of the righteous before creating the world"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner]], ed. ''[[Genesis Rabba]]h: The Judaic Commentary to the Book of Genesis, A New American Translation''. 3 vols. Vol. 1: Parashiyyot One through Thirty-Three on Genesis 1:1 to 8:14.

''Midrash Rabbah''. 3rd ed. 10 vols. London, England: Soncino Press, 1983, Ruth 2:3, 7:28.&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the story of Satan's fall from heaven is also given. Like the Qur'an, and in contrast to Genesis, the corresponding accounts of Satan’s rebellion and Adam and Eve's fall form a "single, continuous story."&lt;ref&gt;at-Tabataba'i, Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn. 1973. [[Tafsir al-Mizan|''Al-Mizan]]: An Exegesis of the [[Qur'an]].'' Translated by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. 3rd ed. Tehran, Iran: World Organization for Islamic Services, 1983, 2:35, 1:179.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/5 Moses 5] (cf. [http://kingjbible.com/genesis/4.htm Genesis 4]): The Book of Moses adds fifteen verses to the beginning of the Genesis account. Verses 1–6 highlight the obedience of Adam and Eve by enumerating their faithfulness to each of the commandments they had been given. Adam and Eve began to "till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow." Likewise Eve fulfilled the commission she had received in the Garden of Eden and "bare … sons and daughters, and they began to replenish the earth." Moreover, "Adam was obedient to the commandments of the Lord" to "offer the firstlings of their flocks" for "many days," despite the fact that he did not yet fully understand the reason why he had been thus commanded. The period of testing for Adam involving "many days" mentioned in the Book of Moses corresponds to the "testing" of the first couple described in [[pseudepigraphal]] accounts such as the [[Life of Adam and Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;This pattern of testing is described in, e.g., Michael E. Stone. ''Adam's Contract with Satan: The Legend of the Cheirograph of Adam.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2002, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Also recalling parallels in these ancient stories is the book of Moses account of how Adam and Eve's enduring obedience is rewarded by the announcement of their redemption through the eventual sacrifice of the son of God (vv. 6–13). In light of this extended prologue extolling the virtue of obedience and the promise of redemption, the Book of Moses' expanded story of [[Cain and Abel|Cain's rebellion and murder of his brother Abel]] appears in even starker relief. Cain's murderous pact with Satan is portrayed as the foundation of "secret combinations" that later flourish among the wicked, and provide a plausible context for the more fragmentary Genesis account of [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]]'s slaying of his rival. The chapter ends with the declaration that "all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and a decree sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end thereof."
* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6 Moses 6] (cf. [http://kingjbible.com/genesis/5.htm Genesis 5]): Expansions in the early part of the chapter further describe the story of the righteous [[Seth]]. The "genealogy" of his descendants are said to be kept in a "book of remembrance." Jewish and Islamic sources describe a similar book, intended to preserve "the primordial wisdom of paradise for Adam and his generations" and also "the genealogy of the entire human race".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Matt, ed. ''The [[Zohar]], Pritzker Edition.'' Vol. 1. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2004, Be-Reshit  1:37b, pp. 237–38; cf. Be-Reshit 1:55b, pp. 310–13.

Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1989, 1:151, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Moses chapter 6 contains the story of the call and preaching of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]. Though the biblical account of Enoch's life occupies only two verses, his story fills most of chapter 6 and all of chapter 7 of the book of Moses. Extended accounts of the experiences of Enoch, containing surprising parallels with the Book of Moses, also circulated widely in [[Second Temple Judaism]] and early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Hugh Nibley]]. [http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=53 ''Enoch the Prophet'']. Edited by [[Stephen D. Ricks]]. Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mormoninterpreter.com"&gt;[[Jeffrey M. Bradshaw]] and [[David J. Larsen]].

As an example of parallels with [[Second Book of Enoch]] and [[3 Enoch]], Moses 6:31 calls the 65-year-old Enoch a "lad" (the only use of this term in LDS scripture), corresponding to the somewhat puzzling use of this term to describe Enoch/Metatron in, e.g., 2 Enoch 10:4 and 3 Enoch 3:2, 4:2, and 4:10.&lt;ref name="mormoninterpreter.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/maqom/metatronyouth.html|title=Metatron as the Youth Andrei Orlov|website=www.marquette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strangething"&gt;[[Hugh Nibley]], http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=53&amp;chapid=484.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of a reference to "lad" in the [[Second Book of Enoch]], non-Mormon scholar Gary Anderson writes: "The acclamation of Enoch as 'lad' is curious .… It is worth noting that of all the names given Enoch, the title 'lad' is singled out as being particularly apt and fitting by the heavenly host."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Gary A. "The exaltation of Adam", in ''Literature on Adam and Eve: Collected Essays'', edited by Gary A. Anderson, Michael E. Stone and Johannes Tromp, 83–110. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2000, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the [[Book of the Giants]] the parallels with the Enoch chapters in the Book of Moses are concentrated in a scant three pages of Qumran fragments. These resemblances range from general themes in the story line (secret works, murders, visions, earthly and heavenly books of remembrance that evoke fear and trembling, moral corruption, hope held out for repentance, and the eventual defeat of Enoch’s adversaries in battle, ending with their utter destruction and imprisonment) to specific occurrences of rare expressions in corresponding contexts (the reference to the "wild man," the name and parallel role of Mahijah/Mahujah, and the "roar of the wild beasts").&lt;ref name="mormoninterpreter.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strangething" /&gt;
* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/7 Moses 7]: This chapter continues the story of Enoch's preaching, including a vision of the "Son of Man"—a favorite motif in pseudepigraphal Book of Parables in [[Book of Enoch|1 Enoch]]{{#tag:ref|See 46:2–4; 48:2; 60:10; 62:5, 7, 9, 14; 63:11; 69:26-27, 29; 70:1; 71:14, 17|group="cf"}} that also appears in marked density throughout the Book of Moses vision of Enoch{{#tag:ref|Moses 7:24, 47, 54, 56, 59, 65|group="cf"}}.

After considering the sometimes contentious debate among scholars about the single or multiple referent(s) of these titles and their relationship to other texts, Nickelsburg and VanderKam conclude that the author of 1 Enoch (like the author of the Book of Moses) "saw the … traditional figures as having a single referent and applied the various designations and characteristics as seemed appropriate to him."&lt;ref name="Nickelsburg, George W.

Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Religious Studies Center, 1989, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Smith’s Enoch straightforwardly equates the filial relationship between God and His Only Begotten Son in the New Testament to the Enochic notion of the perfect Man and the Son of Man: "Man of Holiness is [God’s] name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time" (Moses 6:57). The single specific description of the role of the Son of Man given in this verse from the book of Moses as a "righteous judge" is highly characteristic of the Book of the Parables within 1 Enoch, where the primary role of the Son of Man is also that of a judge (e.g., 1 Enoch 69:27. Cf. John 5:27)."&lt;ref name="Nickelsburg, George W. E. 2012"/&gt; In a vision of Enoch found in the book of Moses, three distinct parties weep for the wickedness of mankind: God (Moses 7:28; cf. v. 29), the heavens (Moses 7:28, 37), and Enoch himself (Moses 7:41, 49). In addition, the earth mourns for her children (Moses 7:48–49). This chorus of weeping is consistent with the ancient Enoch literature.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Daniel C.

* [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/8 Moses 8] (cf. [http://kingjbible.com/genesis/5.htm Genesis 5]-[http://kingjbible.com/genesis/6.htm 6]): Additional details are given about the story of [[Methuselah]] and the preaching of Noah, again stressing the coming of Jesus Christ and the necessity of [[baptism]]. The term, "sons of God," as it occurs in the enigmatic episode of mismatched marriages in the Bible (Genesis 6:1) and relating to passages in [[1 Enoch]] 6–7 about the "[[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]" has been the source of controversy among scholars. Contradicting traditions that depict these husbands as fallen angels, the Book of Moses (Moses 8:13–15) is consistent with early Christian traditions that portray them as mere mortals who lay claim on the title of sons of God by virtue of their priesthood (see Moses 6:64–68).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Ephrem the Syrian. ca. 350–363. "The Hymns on Paradise." In Hymns on Paradise, edited by Sebastian Brock, 77–195. Crestwood, New York: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1990, 1:11, 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Moses ends abruptly just before the [[flood of Noah]], but the story continues in the remainder of the JST version of Genesis.

==Scholarship==
In contrast to numerous scholarly analyses of Smith's translations of the [[Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]] that began to appear in the 19th century, explorations of the textual foundations of the JST began in earnest only in the 1960s, with the pioneering work of the [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] scholar [[Richard P. Howard]] and the LDS scholar [[Robert J. Matthews]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Richard P. ''Restoration Scriptures''. Independence, MO: Herald House, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. Matthews]] ''A Plainer Translation: Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible—A  History and Commentary.''

Faulring]], [[Kent P. Jackson]], and [[Robert J. Matthews]], eds.'' Joseph Smith's New Translation of the Bible: Original Manuscripts.'' Provo, UT: [[Religious Studies Center]], Brigham Young University, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other studies of the JST, [[Brigham Young University]] Professor [[Kent P. Jackson]], a longtime student of these topics, prepared a detailed study of the text of the portions of the JST relating to the Book of Moses in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kent P. Jackson]].

Although several brief studies of the teachings of the Book of Moses had previously appeared as part of apologetic and doctrinally focused LDS commentaries on the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]], the first detailed verse-by-verse commentary—and the first to incorporate significant amounts of modern non-LDS Bible scholarship—was published by Richard D. Draper, [[S. Kent Brown]], and [[Michael D. Rhodes]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Draper, [[S. Kent Brown]], and [[Michael D. Rhodes]]. ''The Pearl of Great Price: A Verse-by-Verse Commentary.'' Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an 1100-page volume by [[Jeffrey M. Bradshaw]] was published, entitled ''In God's Image and Likeness'', which contains a comprehensive commentary on Moses 1–6:12, and incorporates a wide range of scholarly perspectives and citations from ancient texts. The book features an extensive annotated bibliography on ancient sources and over a hundred relevant illustrations with detailed captions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey M. Bradshaw]].

In his master’s thesis, Salvatore Cirillo cites and amplifies the arguments of [[D. Michael Quinn]]&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, D. Michael. ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View''. Revised and enlarged ed. Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books, 1998, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; that the available evidence that Smith had access to published works related to 1 Enoch has moved "beyond probability—to fact."&lt;ref&gt;Cirillo, Salvatore. [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/236/  "Joseph Smith, Mormonism, and Enochic Tradition."] Masters Thesis, Durham University, 2010, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that there is no other explanation than this for the substantial similarities that he finds between the Book of Moses and the pseudepigraphal Enoch literature.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Cirillo (2010), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; However, reflecting on the "coincidence" of the appearance of the first English translation of 1 Enoch in 1821, just a few years before Smith received his Enoch revelations, [[Richard L. Bushman]] concludes: "It is scarcely conceivable that Joseph Smith knew of Laurence's Enoch translation."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, Richard Lyman. ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, A Cultural Biography of Mormonism's Founder]]''. New York City, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps even more significant is the fact that the principal themes of "Laurence’s 105 translated chapters do not resemble Joseph Smith’s Enoch in any obvious way."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman (2005), p. 138; cf. Woodworth, Jed L. "Extra-biblical Enoch texts in early American culture." In Archive of Restoration Culture: Summer Fellows' Papers 1997–1999, edited by Richard Lyman Bushman, 185–93. Provo, Utah: Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History, 2000, 190–92&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the shared prominence of the Son of Man motif in the 1 Enoch Book of the Parables and the Book of Moses and some common themes in Enoch's visions of Noah, the most striking resemblances to Smith's writings are found not in 1 Enoch, but in Enochic literature published after the Smith's death. As an impressive example of such post-mortem resemblances, Cirillo cites (but does not provide any explanation of provenance) for the Mahujah/Mahijah character in Qumran [[Book of the Giants]] and the Book of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Cirillo, Salvatore. [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/236/ "Joseph Smith, Mormonism, and Enochic Tradition."] Masters Thesis, Durham University, 2010, 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative explanation for the Mahujah/Mahijah name and role in the Book of Moses, [[Matthew Black]] formulated a hypothesis in a conversation reported by Mormon scholar Gordon C. Thomasson that "certain carefully clandestine groups had, up through the middle-ages, maintained, sub rosa, an esoteric religious tradition based in the writings of Enoch, at least into the time of and influencing Dante" and "that a member of one of the esoteric groups he had described previously must have survived into the 19th century, and hearing of Joseph Smith, must have brought the group’s Enoch texts to New York from Italy for the prophet to translate and publish."&lt;ref&gt;Panel discussion in Provo (Kent Brown; William Hamblin; Gordon Thomasson), Academy of Temple Studies Conference on Enoch and the Temple, Logan, Utah and Provo, Utah, February 19 and 22, 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaRw40r-TfM.

Brooke: The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844." BYU Studies 34, no. 4 (1994): 167–81. See pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Mormon scholar Stephen Webb agreed with Hamblin, et al., concluding that "actual evidence for any direct link between [Joseph Smith’s] theology and the hermetic tradition is tenuous at best, and given that scholars vigorously debate whether hermeticism even constitutes a coherent and organized tradition, Brooke’s book should be read with a fair amount of skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Stephen H. ''Jesus Christ, Eternal God: Heavenly Flesh and the Metaphysics of Matter''. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 260. See also Barlow, Philip L. "Decoding Mormonism." Christian Century, 17 January 1996, 52–55; Shipps, Jan. ''Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years among the Mormons''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 2000, 204–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-Mormon scholars have signaled their appreciation of the significance of the Smith's translation efforts in light of ancient documents. Yale University critic of secular and sacred literature [[Harold Bloom]], who classes the Book of Moses and the [[Book of Abraham]] among the "more surprising" and "neglected" works of LDS scripture,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]]. ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine''. New York City, NY: Riverhead Books (Penguin Group), 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is intrigued by the fact that many of their themes are "strikingly akin to ancient suggestions" that essentially restate "the archaic or original Jewish religion, a Judaism that preceded even the Yahwist." While expressing "no judgment, one way or the other, upon the authenticity" of LDS scripture, he finds "enormous validity" in the way these writings "recapture … crucial elements in the archaic Jewish religion … that had ceased to be available either to normative Judaism or to Christianity, and that survived only in esoteric traditions unlikely to have touched Smith directly."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]]. ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation.'' New York City, NY: Simon and Schuster, 1992, pp. 98, 99, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to any possibility that Smith could have drawn from ancient manuscripts in his writings, Bloom concludes: "I hardly think that written sources were necessary." Stephen Webb concludes that Smith "knew more about theology and philosophy than it was reasonable for anyone in his position to know, as if he were dipping into the deep, collective unconsciousness of Christianity with a very long pen."&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Stephen H. ''Jesus Christ, Eternal God: Heavenly Flesh and the Metaphysics of Matter''. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
A '''calendar date''' is a reference to a particular day represented within a [[calendar]] system. The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified. The number of days between two dates may be calculated. For example, "24 {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}" is ten days after "14 {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}" in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The date of a particular event depends on the observed [[time zone]]. For example, the air [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that began at 7:48&amp;nbsp;a.m. Hawaiian time on December 7, 1941, took place at 3:18&amp;nbsp;a.m. December 8 in Japan ([[Japan Standard Time]]). 

A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]], which have been used simultaneously in different places. In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the ''day of month'', ''month'', and the ''year''. There may also be additional parts, such as the ''day of week''. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], with [[era]] referring to the particular period of time (Note [[geologic time scale|the different use]] of the terms in [[geology]]).

The most widely used epoch is a [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Historical Jesus#Birth|birthdate of Jesus]] (which was established by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the sixth century). A date without the year part may also be referred to as a ''date'' or ''calendar date'' (such as "{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}" rather than "{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}"). As such, it defines the day of an annual event, such as a birthday or Christmas on 24/25 December.

Many computer systems internally store points in time in [[Unix time]] format or some other [[system time]] format.
The [[date (Unix)]] command—internally using the [[C date and time functions]]—can be used to convert that internal representation of a point in time
to most of the date representations shown here.

The current date in the Gregorian calendar is {{Date}}.  If this is not really the current date, then {{Purge|click here}} to update it.

==Date format==
{{See also|Date format by country}}

There is a large variety of formats for dates in use, which differ in the order of date components (e.g. 31/05/1999, 05/31/1999, 1999/05/31), component separators (e.g. 31.05.1999, 31/05/1999, 31-05-1999), whether leading zeros are included (e.g. 31/5/1999 vs. 31/05/1999), whether all four digits of the year are written (e.g., 31.05.1999 vs. 31.05.99), and whether the month is represented in [[Arabic numerals|Arabic]] or [[Roman numerals]] or by name  (e.g. 31.05.1999, 31.V.1999 vs. 31 May 1999).

===Gregorian, day-month-year (DMY)===
&lt;!--[[DMY]], [[Dmy], [[DMY date]] and [[Dmy date]] redirect here--&gt;
This [[little-endian]] sequence is common to the majority of the world's countries. This date format originates from the custom of writing the date as "the 9th day of November in the year of our Lord 2014" in Western religious and legal documents. The format has shortened over time but the order of the elements has remained constant.

*"9 November 2014" or "9. November 2014" (the latter is common in [[German language|German]]-speaking regions)
*9/11/2014 or 09.11.2014 or 9-11-2014
*09-Nov-2014
*09Nov14 – Used, even in the U.S., where space needs to be saved by skipping [[punctuation]].
*[The] 9th [of] November 2014 (The 'of' and 'the' may be included in speech; they are generally omitted in all but the most formal writing.)
* 09/Nov/2014 - used in the [[Common Log Format]]
*Sunday, 9 November 2014
*9/xi/14, 9.xi.14, 9-xi.14, or 9.XI.2014 (using the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] for the month) – This is usually confined to handwriting only and is not put into any form of print. It is associated with a number of schools and universities. It has also been used by the Vatican as an alternative to using months named after Roman deities. It is used on Canadian postmarks as a [[bilingual]] form of the month.
*9 November 2014 [[Common Era|CE]] or 9 November [[Anno Domini|AD]] 2014

===Gregorian, year-month-day (YMD)===
&lt;!--[[YMD]] and [[YMD date]] redirect here--&gt;
In this format the most significant data item is written before lesser data items i.e. year before month before day. It is consistent with the [[Endianness#Big|big-endianness]] of the [[Indian decimal numbering system]], which progresses from the highest to the lowest order magnitude. That is, using this format textual orderings and chronological orderings are identical. This form is standard in East Asia, Iran, Lithuania, Hungary and Sweden; and some other countries to a limited extent.

Examples for the 9th of November 2003:
*2003-11-09: the standard Internet date/time format,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime W3C Date and Time Formats] Internet date/time format&lt;!-- retrieved 23 September --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a profile of the international standard [[ISO 8601]], orders the components of a date like this, and additionally uses leading zeros, for example, 1996-05-01, to be easily read and sorted by computers. It is used with [[UTC]] in RFC 3339. This format is also favoured in certain [[Asia]]n countries, mainly [[East Asian]] countries, as well as in some European countries. The big-endian convention is also frequently used in [[Canada]], but all three conventions are used there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdnpay.ca/news/new_cheque_specs.asp Canadian Payments Association – Specifications for Imageable Cheques and Other Payment Items] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706225538/http://www.cdnpay.ca/news/new_cheque_specs.asp |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2003 November 9
*2003Nov9
*2003Nov09
*2003-Nov-9
*2003-Nov-09
*2003-Nov-9, Sunday
*2003. {{sic|hide=y|no|vember}} 9. – The official format in [[Hungary]], point after year and day, month name with small initial. Following shorter formats also can be used: 2003. {{sic|hide=y|nov}}. 9., 2003. 11. 9., 2003. XI. 9.
*2003.11.9 using [[Full stop|dots]] and no leading zeros, common in [[China]].
*2003.11.09
*2003/11/09 using [[slash (punctuation)|slash]]es and leading zeros, common in [[Internet in Japan]].
*20031109 : the "basic format" profile of ISO 8601, an 8-digit number providing [[monotonic]] date codes, common in computing and increasingly used in dated computer file names. It is used in the standard [[iCalendar]] file format defined in RFC 5545. A big advantage of the ISO 8601 "basic format" is that a simple textual sort is equivalent to a sort by date.

It is also extended through the universal big-endian format clock time: 9 November 2003, 18h 14m 12s, or 2003/11/9/18:14:12 or (ISO 8601) 2003-11-09T18:14:12.

===Gregorian, month-day-year (MDY)===
&lt;!--[[MDY date]] redirects here--&gt;
{{see also|Date and time notation in the United States}}
This sequence is used primarily in the [[Philippines]], [[English Canada]] and the [[United States]]. This date format was commonly used alongside the little-endian form in the United Kingdom until the mid-20th century and can be found in both defunct and modern print media such as the ''[[London Gazette]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'', respectively. In the United States, it is said as Sunday, November 9, although usage of "the" isn't uncommon (e.g. ''Sunday, November the 9th'', and even ''November the 9th, Sunday'', are also possible and readily understood).

*Sunday, November 9, 2014
*November 9, 2014
*Nov. 9, 2014 or 11/9/2014
*11-9-2014, 11.9.2014, 11.09.14, or 11/09/14

The modern convention is to avoid using the ordinal (th, st, rd, nd) form of numbers when the day follows the month (July 4 or July 4, 1776).  The ordinal was common in the past, and is still sometimes used (4th July or July 4th).

===Gregorian, year-day-month (YDM)===
This date format is used in [[Latvia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Turkmenistan]].

===Standards===
There are several standards that specify date formats:
* [[ISO 8601]] ''Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times'' specifies ''YYYY-MM-DD'' (the separators are optional, but only hyphens are allowed to be used), where all values are fixed length numeric, but also allows ''YYYY-DDD'', where ''DDD'' is the ordinal number of the day within the year, e.g. 2001-365.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874 ISO 8601:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* RFC 3339 ''Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps'' specifies ''YYYY-MM-DD'', i.e. a particular subset of the options allowed by ISO 8601.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6 RFC 3339 ''Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps'', section 5.6 Internet Date/Time Format]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[RFC 5322]] ''Internet Message Format'' specifies ''day month year'' where ''day'' is one or two digits, ''month'' is a three letter month abbreviation, and ''year'' is four digits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.3 RFC 5322 ''Internet Message Format'', section 3.3 Date and Time Specification]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage overloading===
Many numerical forms can create confusion when used in international correspondence, particularly when abbreviating the year to its final two digits.

For example, "7/8" could refer to either 7 August or July 8. In the [[United States]], dates are rarely written in purely numerical forms in formal writing, although they are very common elsewhere; when numerical forms are used, the month appears first. In the United Kingdom, while it is regarded as acceptable albeit less common to write ''month-name day, year'', this order is never used when written numerically. However, as an exception, the American shorthand "9/11" is widely understood as referring to the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name="BBC-ADOT"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/americas/2001/day_of_terror/ BBC News – America's Day of Terror"] (Example of British website using "9/11" shorthand)&lt;/ref&gt;

When numbers are used to represent months, a significant amount of confusion can arise from the ambiguity of a date order; especially when the numbers representing the day, month or year are low, it can be impossible to tell which order is being used. This can be clarified by using four digits to represent years, and naming the month; for example, "Feb" instead of "02". The ISO 8601 date order with four-digit years: YYYY-MM-DD (introduced in ISO 2014), is specifically chosen to be unambiguous. The ISO 8601 standard also has the advantage of being language independent and is therefore useful when there may be no language context and a universal application is desired (expiration dating on export products, for example). Many Internet sites use YYYY-MM-DD, and those using other conventions often use -MMM- for the month to further clarify and avoid ambiguity (2001-MAY-09, 9-MAY-2001, MAY 09 2001, etc.).

In addition, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] considers its ISO 8601 standard to make sense from a logical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/date_and_time_format | accessdate=2008-04-27 | title=Numeric representation of Dates and Time }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed units, for example feet and inches, or pounds and ounces, are normally written with the largest unit first, in decreasing order. Numbers are also written in that order, so the digits of 2006 indicate, in order, the millennium, the century within the millennium, the decade within the century, and the year within the decade. The only date order that is consistent with these well-established conventions is year-month-day. A plain text list of dates with this format can be easily sorted by [[file manager]]s, [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s and other software tools with built-in sorting functions. Some database systems use an eight-digit YYYYMMDD representation to handle date values. Naming folders with YYYY-MM-DD at the beginning allows them to be listed in date order when sorting by name - especially useful for organising document libraries.

An early U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] recommended 2-digit years. This is now widely recognized as a bad idea, because of the [[year 2000 problem]]. Some U.S. government agencies now use ISO 8601 with 4-digit years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221020451/http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html |date=February 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iprocessmart.com/techsmart/iso-time.htm |title=International Standard Date and Time Notation |publisher=Iprocessmart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When transitioning from one date notation to another, people often write both styles; for example [[Old Style and New Style dates]] in the transition from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.

==Advantages for ordering in sequence==
One of the advantages of using the [[ISO 8601]] date format is that the [[lexicographical order]] ([[ASCIIbetical]]) of the representations is equivalent to the chronological order of the dates, assuming that all dates are in the same time zone. Thus dates can be sorted using simple string comparison algorithms, and indeed by any left to right [[collation]]. For example:

 1998-02-28 (28 February 1998) sorts before
 1999-03-01 (1 March 1999) which sorts before
 2000-01-30 (30 January 2000)

The YYYY-MM-DD layout is the only common format that can provide this.&lt;ref name=W3CFAQ&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format | accessdate=2008-10-21 | title=FAQ: Date formats | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorting other date representations involves some [[parsing]] of the date strings. This also works when a time in 24-hour format is included after the date, as long as all times are understood to be in the same time zone.

ISO 8601 is used widely where concise, human readable yet easily computable and unambiguous dates are required, although many applications store dates internally as [[UNIX time]] and only convert to ISO 8601 for display. It is worth noting that all modern computer [[Operating Systems]] retain date information of files outside of their titles, allowing the user to choose which format they prefer and have them sorted thus, irrespective of the files' names.

==Specialized usage==

===Day and year only===
{{See also|calendar|time|date-time group|Japanese calendar|Wikibooks:English in Use/Time and Date}}

The U.S. military sometimes uses a system, which they call "Julian date format"&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, John (?). A summary of time formats and standards. Retrieved on 2011-02-09 from http://www.decimaltime.hynes.net/p/dates.html.&lt;/ref&gt; that indicates the year and the actual day out of the 365 days of the year (and thus a designation of the month would not be needed). For example, "11 December 1999" can be written in some contexts as "1999345" or "99345", for the 345th day of 1999.&lt;ref name=km-iso&gt;Kuhn, Markus (2004-12-19). A summary of the international standard date and time notation. University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Retrieved on 2006-08-01 from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This system is most often used in US military logistics, since it makes the process of calculating estimated shipping and arrival dates easier. For example: say a tank engine takes an estimated 35 days to ship by sea from the US to Korea. If the engine is sent on 99104, it should arrive on 99139. Note that outside of the US military and some US government agencies, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]], this format is usually referred to as "[[ordinal date]]", rather than "Julian date"&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense. [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/06-MAPAD_DEFINITIONS_TERMS_12-17-01.pdf "Definition of Terms."] March 11, 1997. Retrieved October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ordinal date formats are also used by many computer programs (especially those for mainframe systems). Using a three-digit [[Julian date|Julian day number]] saves one byte of computer storage over a two-digit month plus two-digit day, for example, "January 17" is 017 in Julian versus 0117 in month-day format. [[OS/390]] or its successor, [[z/OS]], display dates in yy.ddd format for most operations.

[[UNIX time]], which stores time as a number in seconds since the UNIX Epoch (1970-01-01).

Another "ordinal" date system ("ordinal" in the sense of advancing in value by one as the date advances by one day) is in common use in astronomical calculations and referencing and uses the same name as this "logistics" system. The continuity of representation of period regardless of the time of year being considered is highly useful to both groups of specialists. The astronomers describe their system as also being a "[[Julian date]]" system. Unlike the system described above, the astronomical system does not consider years, it only counts days. Thus it is unperturbed by complications such as leap years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Week number used===
Companies in Europe often use year, week number and day for planning purposes.
So, for example, an event in a project can happen on w43 (week 43) or w43-1 (Monday, week 43) or, if the year needs to be indicated, on w0543 or w543 (year 2005 week 43).

The ISO does present a standard for [[ISO week date|identifying weeks]], but as it does not match up with Gregorian calendar (the beginning and ending days of a given year do not match up), this standard is somewhat more problematic than the other standards for dates.

===Expressing dates in spoken English===
In [[English language|English-language]]  outside North America (mostly in Anglophone Europe and some countries in Australasia), full dates are written as ''7 December 1941'' (or ''7th December 1941'') and spoken as "the seventh of December, nineteen forty-one" (exceedingly common usage of "the" and "of"), with the occasional usage of ''December 7, 1941'' ("December the seventh, nineteen forty-one"). In common with most continental European usage, however, all-numeric dates are invariably ordered dd/mm/yyyy.

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the usual written form is ''December 7, 1941'', spoken as "December seventh, nineteen forty-one" or colloquially "December the seventh, nineteen forty-one". [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]] numerals, however, are not always used when writing and pronouncing dates, and "December seven, nineteen forty-one" is also an accepted pronunciation of the date written ''December 7, 1941''. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Fourth of July]] (U.S. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2751">The '''''Chilieteris''''' ({{lang-gr|Χιλιετηρίς}}, "The Millennium") was a [[history of Rome]] in fifteen books, written in [[Ionic Greek]] by [[Gaius Asinius Quadratus]], which spanned a thousand years, from the [[founding of Rome]] until his time. 

==History==
The ''Chilieteris'' was written by [[Gaius Asinius Quadratus]] in the 3rd century{{nbsp}}AD, to celebrate the thousandth year since the founding of Rome.{{sfn|Rechenauer|2011|p=81}} Quadratus, for the purpose of having the time period of a thousand years end in his own time, dates the founding of Rome at 776{{nbsp}}BC.{{sfn|Feeney|2007|p=144}} It was written in [[Ionic Greek]], in 15 books.{{sfn|Feeney|2007|p=144}}{{sfn|Clarke|Croke|Nobbs|Mortley|1990|p=66}} It was probably written during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]]; however, its account ends in the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] in 224/225.{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|p=64}}{{sfn|Clarke|Croke|Nobbs|Mortley|1990|p=87}}{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=84}}

==Style==
The ''Chilieteris'' bears many stylistic similarities to the ''[[Historia Romana]]'' of [[Cassius Dio]]. Both were written in Ionian Greek, and both began at the founding of Rome, and ended in the reign of Alexander Severus.{{sfn|Millar|Troiani|Zecchini|2005|p=28}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9807">A '''combination company''' was a theatrical [[touring company]] which performed only one [[Play (theatre)|play]]. Unlike [[repertory]] companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions. Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated. Combination companies contributed to the early success of [[Broadway theatre]], as most combination companies began their tours in [[New York City]]. Combination companies were fueled by stars. The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company. The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform. Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there. “The engagements of the first important stars… were rare and special events”(Poggi 4). Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars. The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star. The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5). After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual. Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them. They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201). This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies.

== Repertory vs. combination ==
Repertory companies, both those in residence and those on tour, featured several actors who rehearsed multiple plays which were performed in rotation, adding and removing shows from their repertoire over time. Repertory theaters, also known as ''stock theaters'', generally employed generic [[theatrical properties]] for use in each of their productions. This system was popular throughout the [[United States]] in the 19th century (Somerset-Ward).

Because combination companies only performed a single play, they were not restricted by the need to use generic properties. Combination companies took advantage of this fact by specializing each asset of the company&amp;mdash;actors, rehearsals, [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], properties, costumes and personnel&amp;mdash;to tailor to the needs of the one play being performed (Londré). In particular, this enabled combination companies to use more elaborate scenery than their repertory counterparts (Somerset-Ward).

== Origin ==
It is not entirely clear how the combination system originated. American actress [[Laura Keene]] toured with a combination company as early as 1862. American actor [[Joseph Jefferson]] claimed that both he and [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] independently established the combination system in 1868 with their productions of ''[[Rip van Winkle]]'' and ''[[The Lancers]]'', respectively. The advent of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] may have contributed to the success of touring companies (Londré).

Many early touring companies found success by exclusively performing renditions of the immensely popular [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], an anti-[[slavery]] novel published in 1852 by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. In 1927, 75 years after Uncle Tom's Cabin had been published, these renditions, known as [[Tom Shows]] (Londré), were still being performed exclusively by twelve combination companies worldwide (Somerset-Ward).

Most of the combination companies in the United States rehearsed and began their tours in [[New York City]], which contributed to the early success of what would eventually be known as [[Broadway theatre]]. The combination company system was so successful throughout the United States that [[Dion Boucicault]], an Irish actor and playwright, brought it to England for the first tour of his play ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]'' in the 1860s (Somerset-Ward).

== Circuits and the syndicate ==
Another way the combination business was run was through circuits. Local managers struggled with finding a continuous flow of touring companies, because it required them to take multiple trips to New York to make deals with producers. “Booking a successful season of touring productions was a complex gamble for the theatre manager,” so the solution was to create a travel circuit. (Toten Beard 35).  A travel circuit is when a group of the theaters all in the same state or neighboring states would band together under one theater manager who would then go to New York to make deals with the Broadway Producers (Toten Beard 25). This idea was much more beneficial for the producer because it provided multiple stops of a tour all guaranteed under one business deal and made tour planning much simpler. It was helpful to the local theater managers because it provided a steady stream of business to help keep their theater afloat and also helped them to get the most popular and raved about shows to travel through their city (Poggi10).  This soon grew into managers from theaters in a large city taking advantage of the smaller theaters by buying them out or making them pay interest to the larger theater (Poggi 10). M.B. Leavitt was the manager of a popular theater in San Francisco and is given the credit of developing “loosely organized circuits” into centralized booking agencies, which controlled the theatre in large segments of the country (Poggi 11). He did this by adding small theaters from Omaha to San Francisco to the circuit and having them pay him to provide for the traveling expenses of the company. This brought attention to the company because they would be guaranteed sold out one-night stands in smaller towns and a sold out long run in San Francisco (Poggi 10-11). This became the foundation of what became a Syndicate.
Through the centralization of booking, booking agents became extremely important in negotiations between local managers and circuit representatives. These booking agencies grew in power by monopolizing all the theaters in a certain region of America, claiming “that it was more efficient for a theater or a circuit to do all its booking through one agency” (Poggi 11).  In 1896 the ultimate monopoly of the theater booking industry of traveling companies was created. It was called the [[Theatrical Syndicate]] and was formed by six booking agents who pooled together thirty-three of the top theaters from major cities around the country, which were then called Syndicate houses (Poggi 11). If a producer played in one Syndicate house on his tour then every city he performed in, if there was a syndicate house there, he would have to perform at that house and no other theater (Poggi 12). The Syndicate was the foremost business power in Theater during the late 1800s and early 1900s and was very similar to the other “giant ‘trusts’ of its day”(Poggi 13). It had no competition so it was able to choose its prices and fees that it took from the producers, managers and circuits under their control and demanded percentages of the profits of the shows. It was the height of the centralization of the theater business (Poggi 13-14). The Theatrical Syndicate allowed for the business of touring shows and combination companies to be managed in one centralized place, New York City. The Syndicate began to lose power with what is called the death of the road and the rise of motion pictures.

== The death of the road ==
The death of the road started happening after 1915 due to sinking profits, increased travel expenses and lower quality touring productions (Toten Beard 37). Theater began to be based in New York with no intentions of touring, because the Syndicate monopoly had been corrupted and was producing low art productions (Toten Beard 37). New York became the producing center and the most important city for producing theater. The long runs were reestablished and producers now began looking for the next best play that could last multiple performances. Also the rise of motion pictures drew audiences away from touring shows, because they offered the same stars and entertainment but at a cheaper price and more diverse productions. Slowly but surely playhouses converted back to regional theaters and combination companies became non-existent.

The '''Dighton Rock''' is a 40-ton [[boulder]], originally located in the riverbed of the [[Taunton River]] at [[Berkley, Massachusetts]] (formerly part of the town of [[Dighton, Massachusetts|Dighton]]). The [[rock (geology)|rock]] is noted for its [[petroglyphs]] ("primarily lines, geometric shapes, and schematic drawings of people, along with writing, both verified and not."),&lt;ref name="Kenneth L page 80"&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', page 80 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; carved designs of ancient and uncertain origin, and the controversy about their creators.  In 1963, during construction of a [[coffer dam]], state officials removed the rock from the river for preservation.  It was installed in a museum in a nearby park, [[Dighton Rock State Park]]. In 1980 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP).

==Appearance==
The boulder has the form of a slanted, six-sided block, approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) high, 9.5 feet (2.9 m) wide, and 11 feet (3.4 m) long. It is gray-brown [[crystalline]] [[sandstone]] of medium to coarse texture.  The surface with the inscriptions has a [[trapezoid]]al face and is inclined 70 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s to the northwest. It was found facing the water of the bay.

==History==
In 1680, the [[English people|English]] [[colonist]] Rev. John Danforth made a drawing of the petroglyphs, which has been preserved in the [[British Museum]]. His drawing conflicts with the reports of others and the current markings on the rock.&lt;ref name="Kenneth L page 80"/&gt; In 1690 Rev. [[Cotton Mather]] described the rock in his book, ''The Wonderful Works of God Commemorated'': &lt;blockquote&gt;“Among the other Curiosities of New-England, one is that of a mighty Rock, on a perpendicular side whereof by a River, which at High Tide covers part of it, there are very deeply Engraved, no man alive knows How or When about half a score Lines, near Ten Foot Long, and a foot and half broad, filled with strange Characters: which would suggest as odd Thoughts about them that were here before us, as there are odd Shapes in that Elaborate Monument.…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/enigma-dighton-rock|author=Edward Brecher|title=The Enigma Of Dighton Rock|work=American Heritage|date=June 1958|accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 19th century, many popular publications and public figures mentioned the rock. The [[satire|satirist]] [[James Russell Lowell]] suggested that it should be mentioned by [[United States presidential election, 1848|presidential candidates]] in letters to newspapers: "[I]f letters must be written, profitable use might be made of the Dighton rock [[hieroglyphic]] or the [[cuneiform]] script, every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, James R. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22680/22680-h/22680-h.htm#Page_84 The Biglow Papers (VIII)] London, Trubner (1861), via Project Gutenberg- accessed 2007-12-08&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell made other references to the rock in his widely circulated satirical writing, and may thus have helped to popularize it.
[[File:Dighton Rock State Park, Berkley MA.jpg|thumb|right|The rock today is on display in a small museum]]
In 1912 [[Edmund B. Delabarre]] wrote that markings on the Dighton Rock suggest that [[Miguel Corte-Real]] reached [[New England]]. Delabarre stated that the markings were abbreviated Latin, and the message, translated into English, read as follows: "I, Miguel Cortereal, 1511. In this place, by the will of God, I became a chief of the Indians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/dightonrockstudy00dela#page/n247/mode/2up/search/1511|author=Edmund B. Delabarre|title=Dighton Rock A Study of the Written Rocks of New England|work=Walter Neal|date=1928|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hypotheses about the creation of the markings include:
*[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples of North America]] – who were known to have inscribed petroglyphs in rocks (a schematic face on the Dighton Rock is similar to an Indian petroglyph in Eastern Vermont)&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', page 81(Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ancient [[Phoenicians]] – proposed in 1783 by [[Ezra Stiles]] in his "Election Sermon."
*[[Norsemen|Norse]] – proposed in 1837 by [[Carl Christian Rafn]] and debunked by [[Jason Colavito]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Review of America Unearthed S01E12 "America's Oldest Secret"|author=[[Jason Colavito]]|date=March 9, 2013|url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/review-of-america-unearthed-s01e12-americas-oldest-secret}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] – proposed in 1912 by [[Edmund B. Delabarre]], who (after seeing Portuguese writing) believed that they then used the rock for their own inscriptions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=D0090|author=Martha Mitchell|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Brunoniana]]|title=Delabarre, Edmund B.|date=1993|publisher=Brown University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dightonrockstudy00dela DelaBarre 1928]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[China|Chinese]] – proposed by [[Gavin Menzies]] in his 2002 book ''[[1421: The Year China Discovered America]]''

==State park==
[[File:Dighton Rock State Park entrance sign.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Park sign]]
In November 1952, the [[Miguel Corte-Real| Miguel Corte-Real Memorial Society]] of [[New York City]] acquired 49½ acres (200,000 m²) of land adjacent to the rock to create a park. However, in 1951 the Massachusetts Legislature expropriated the same land for a [[State Park]].  More land was purchased. [[Dighton Rock State Park]] now has an area of 100 acres (400,000 m²). The vicinity of Dighton Rock has been beautified and furnished with parking and picnic facilities.

==Depths of inscriptions==
Although Mather described these as deeply cut, a statement which has been repeated to the present day, early reports suggested that this was not exactly the case. DelaBarre wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One thing is certain, that former descriptions of the depth of the incisions cannot be used as evidence for any change. The first who describes them calls them "deeply engraved" in 1690; but Cotton Mather had never seen the rock, so far as we know, and this statement of his is doubtless on a par with his other statement that the characters are on "a mighty Rock." Greenwood gives the first reliable description, in 1730. He definitely says that the "indentures are not very considerable," and his drawing and his other statements prove that he had as much difficulty in making out the real characters as has ever been experienced since then. Even on the lowest part of the face, which alone does show evident signs of much wear, Mather's draughtsman, and Greenwood, and their next followers, were even less successful in making out apparent characters than have been some later observers. Sewall in 1768 and Kendall in 1807 made definite statements to the effect that the greater part of the lines were so much effaced as to make their decipherment impossible, or wholly subject to the fancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delabarre|first=Edmund Burke|title=Recent History Of Dighton Rock|year=1919|publisher=John Wilson and Son|url=https://archive.org/stream/recenthistoryofd20delauoft#page/409/mode/1up/search/successful+in+making|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Engels founded [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] together with [[Karl Marx]] and in 1845 published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844|The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'', based on personal observations and research in [[Manchester]]. In 1848, Engels co-authored ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' with Marx and also authored and co-authored (primarily with Marx) many other works. Later, Engels supported Marx financially to do research and write ''[[Das Kapital]]''. After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes. Additionally, Engels organised Marx's notes on the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which he later published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', in ''Collected Works of Marx and Englels: Volumes 30, 31 and 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels died in London on 5 August 1895, at the age of 74 and following cremation his ashes were scattered off [[Beachy Head]], near [[Eastbourne]]. 

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[File:280505 001 Engelshaus Barmen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Engels family house at [[Barmen]] (now in [[Wuppertal]]), Germany]]
Engels was born on 28 November 1820 in [[Barmen]], [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Wuppertal]], Germany).&lt;ref&gt;A copy of Friedrich Engels's birth certificate appears on page 577 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 2'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Barmen was an expanding industrial metropolis and he was the eldest son of a wealthy German [[textile industry|cotton-textile manufacturer]], Friedrich Sr. (1796–1860) and of Elisabeth "Elise" Franziska Mauritia von Haar (1797–1873). The young Friedrich's parents were [[Pietism|Pietist]] Protestants&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt; and he was raised accordingly. However, as Engels grew up, he developed [[Atheism |atheistic]] beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Friedrich Engels |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/letters/45_03_17.htm |title= Letters of Marx and Engels, 1845 |publisher= Marxists.org |date= |accessdate= 2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother wrote to him of her concerns.&lt;ref name="mothersletter"&gt;Elisabeth Engels's letter contained at No. 6 of the Appendix, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' (International Publishers: New York, 1982) pp. 540–541.&lt;/ref&gt; She commented that he had "really gone too far" and "begged" him "to proceed no further".&lt;ref name="mothersletter"/&gt; She continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have paid more heed to other people, to strangers, and have taken no account of your mother's pleas. God alone knows what I have felt and suffered of late. I was trembling when I picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my son's arrest.&lt;ref name="mothersletter"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When his mother wrote, Engels was in hiding in [[Brussels]], Belgium, and soon to make his way to [[Switzerland]]. In 1849 he travelled to the Kingdom of Bavaria for the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Baden and Palatinate revolutionary uprising]].

At the age of 17, Engels had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances.{{clarify|date= August 2017}} Engels spent a year in Barmen. In 1838 his father sent the young Engels to work as a nonsalaried office-clerk at a commercial house in [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="engels-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm |title= Lenin: Friedrich Engels |publisher= Marxists.org |date= |accessdate= 2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;Tucker, Robert C. ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; His parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in [[business sector | business]]. Their son's revolutionary activities disappointed them. It would be some years before he joined the family firm.

Whilst at Bremen, Engels began reading the philosophy of [[Hegel]], whose teachings dominated German philosophy at that time. In September 1838 he published his first work, a poem entitled "The Bedouin", in the ''Bremisches Conversationsblatt'' No. 40. He also engaged in other literary and journalistic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Progress Publishers |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/preface.htm |title= Preface by Progress Publishers |publisher= Marxists.org |date= |accessdate= 2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/footnote.htm#188 |title= Footnotes to Volume 1 of Marx Engels Collected Works |publisher= Marxists.org |date= 15 November 1941 |accessdate= 2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at Bremen, Engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation. He wrote under the pseudonym "Friedrich Oswald" to avoid connecting his  Pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings. In 1841 Engels performed his military service in the [[Prussian Army]] as a member of the Household Artillery ({{lang-de|Garde-Artillerie-Brigade}}). Assigned to Berlin,  he attended university lectures at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and began to associate with groups of [[Young Hegelians]]. He anonymously published articles in the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]],'' exposing the poor employment- and living-conditions endured by factory workers.&lt;ref name="tucker" /&gt; The editor of the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was Karl Marx. Engels did not meet Marx until late November 1842.&lt;ref&gt;
Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, Germany, 1972) p. 53.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Engels acknowledged the influence of German philosophy on his [[intellectual]] development throughout his career.&lt;ref name="engels-bio" /&gt; He also wrote, "To get the most out of life you must be active, you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young ... " (1840).{{citation needed|date= January 2017}}

===Manchester===
In 1842, his parents sent the 22-year-old Engels to [[Manchester]], England, a manufacturing centre. He was to work in [[Weaste]] in the offices of [[Baumwollspinnerei Ermen &amp; Engels|Ermen and Engels]]'s Victoria Mill, which made sewing threads.&lt;ref name="en-1893"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm |title=Biography on Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-art1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_1.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 1 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Salford Star,'' issue 6 Winter 2007, read on http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=461&lt;/ref&gt; Engels's father thought that working at the Manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his radical opinions.&lt;ref name="engels-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-art1" /&gt; On his way to Manchester, Engels visited the office of the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' in Cologne and met Karl Marx for the first time. They were not impressed with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis ''Karl Marx: A Life'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx mistakenly thought that Engels was still associated with the Berliner [[Young Hegelians]], with whom Marx had just broken off ties.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, Germany, 1972) pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Manchester, Engels met [[Mary Burns]], a fierce young working woman with radical opinions. They began a relationship that lasted 20 years until her death in 1863.&lt;ref name="bbc-art2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_2.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 2 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Friedrich Engels in Manchester", Roy Whitfield, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The two never married, as both were against the institution of marriage. While Engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue, he considered the current state and church-regulated marriage as a form of class oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Carver | first = Terrell | authorlink = Terrell Carver| year = 2003 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | title = Engels: A Very Short Introduction | pages = 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=draper&gt;{{cite journal | last = Draper| first = Hal| author-link = Hal Draper | title = Marx and Engels on Women's Liberation| journal = [[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]] |accessdate = 2011-11-29| date = July 1970| url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1970/07/women.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns guided Engels through Manchester and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], showing him the worst districts for his research.

While in Manchester between October and November 1843, Engels wrote his first economic work, entitled "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy."&lt;ref&gt;"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy," ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 3'' ([[International Publishers]]: New York, 1975), pp. 418–445.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels sent the article to Paris, where Marx published it in the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'' in 1844.&lt;ref name="en-1893"/&gt;

While observing the slums of Manchester in close detail, Engels took notes of its horrors, notably [[child labour]], the despoiled environment, and overworked and impoverished labourers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/books/19garner.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Fox Hunter, Party Animal, Leftist Warrior] by Dwight Garner, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a trilogy of articles to Marx. These were published in the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' and then in the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', chronicling the conditions among the working class in Manchester. He later collected these articles for his influential first book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844|The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.&lt;/ref&gt; Written between September 1844 and March 1845, the book was published in German in 1845. In the book, Engels described the "grim future of capitalism and the industrial age",&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived.&lt;ref name="salfordstar.com"&gt;''Salford Star,'' Issue 6 Winter 2007, [http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=456 "Friedrich Engels in Salford" part 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in English in 1887. Archival resources contemporary to Engels's stay in Manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes, including a manuscript ([http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133mmm-p13.shtml#MMM-10-1 MMM/10/1]) held by special collections at the University of Manchester which recounts cases seen in the Manchester Royal Infirmary, where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the disfigured persons seen walking round Manchester as a result of such accidents.

Engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented areas popular among members of the English [[Labour movement|labour]] and [[Chartism|Chartist]] movements, whom he met. He also wrote for several journals, including ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|The Northern Star]]'', [[Robert Owen]]'s ''[[New Moral World]],'' and the ''[[Democratic Review]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="bbc-art2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040314204539/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 March 2004 |title=Introduction to the French Edition of Engels |date=1880 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-02-13 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roy (1988) "The Double Life of Friedrich Engels."

Engels decided to return to Germany in 1844. On the way, he stopped in Paris to meet [[Karl Marx]], with whom he had an earlier correspondence. Marx had been living in Paris since late October 1843, after the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was banned in March 1843 by Prussian governmental authorities.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev et al, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 41–42 &amp; 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to meeting Marx, Engels had become established as a fully developed [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]] and [[Scientific socialism|scientific socialist]], independent of Marx's philosophical development.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Marx was publishing the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]].'' Engels met Marx for a second time at the [[Café de la Régence]] on the Place du Palais, 28 August 1844. The two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives. Marx had read and was impressed by Engels's articles on ''The Condition of the Working Class in England.''&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, "The Condition of the Working Class of England," ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295 through 596.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx adopted Engels's idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism, and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In late May 1845 Engels published his new book. He wrote, "A class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … Who can demand that such a class respect this social order?"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 4,'' p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels stayed in Paris to help Marx write ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Family,'' ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3 through 211.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an attack on the [[Young Hegelians]] and the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] brothers, and was published in late February 1845. Engels's earliest contribution to Marx's work was writing for the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', edited by both Marx and [[Arnold Ruge]], in Paris in 1844.

During this time in Paris, both Marx and Engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the [[League of the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The League of the Just had been formed in 1837 in France to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments. In 1839, the League of the Just participated in the 1839 rebellion fomented by the French utopian revolutionary socialist, [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]].

However, as Ruge remained a Young Hegelian in his belief, Marx and Ruge soon split and Ruge left the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, following the split, Marx remained friendly enough with Ruge that he sent Ruge a warning on 15 January 1845 that the Paris police were going to execute orders against him, Marx and others at the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'' requiring all to leave Paris within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Marx to Ruge" (15 January 1845) contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 38'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx himself was expelled from Paris by French authorities on 3 February 1845 and settled in Brussels with his wife and one daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; Having left Paris on 6 September 1844, Engels returned to his home in Barmen, Germany, to work on his ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', which was published in late May 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''. ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the publication of his book, Engels moved to Brussels in late April 1845, to collaborate with Marx on another book, ''[[German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''German Ideology'' is located in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels'' pp. 19 through 539.&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Barmen, Engels began making contact with Socialists in the Rhineland to raise money for Marx's publication efforts in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these contacts became more important as both Marx and Engels began political organising for the German Workers Party.

===Brussels===
From 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in [[Brussels]], spending much of their time organising the city's German workers. Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground [[Communist League|German Communist League]]. The Communist League was the successor organisation to the old League of the Just which had been founded in 1837, but had recently disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, England, 1963) pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Wilhelm Weitling]], the Communist League was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various European cities.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist League also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]. Many of Marx's and Engels's current friends became members of the Communist League. Old friends like [[Georg Herwegh|Georg Friedrich Herwegh]], who had worked with Marx on the ''Rheinsche Zeitung'', [[Heinrich Heine]], the famous poet, a young doctor by the name of Roland Daniels, [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]] and [[August Herman Ewerbeck]] all maintained their contacts with Marx and Engels in Brussels. [[Georg Weerth]], who had become a friend of Engels in England in 1843, now settled in Brussels. [[Karl Wallau]] and [[Stephen Born]] (real name [[Simon Buttermilch]]) were both German immigrant typesetters who settled in Brussels to help Marx and Engels with their Communist League work. Marx and Engels made many new important contacts through the Communist League. One of the first was [[Wilhelm Wolff]], who was soon to become one of Marx's and Engels's closest collaborators. Others were [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] and [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]], a famous revolutionary poet. While most of the associates of Marx and Engels were German immigrants living in Brussels, some of their new associates were Belgians. [[Phillipe Gigot]], a Belgian philosopher and [[Victor Tedesco]], a lawyer from Liège, both joined the Communist League. [[Joachim Lelewel]] a prominent Polish historian and participant in the Polish uprising of 1830–1831 was also a frequent associate.&lt;ref&gt;P. N.Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 86–88.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist League commissioned Marx and Engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism. This became ''[[Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', better known as the ''Communist Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'' contained in the ''Collected Works Volume 6'' pp. 477–517.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on 21 February 1848 and ends with the world-famous phrase: "Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win ... Working Men of All Countries, Unite!"&lt;ref name="engels-bio" /&gt;

===Return to Prussia===
There was a [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in France in 1848]] that [[Revolutions of 1848|soon spread to other Western European countries]]. These events caused Engels and Marx to return to their homeland of the Prussian Empire, specifically to the city of [[Cologne]]. While living in Cologne, they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''.&lt;ref name="en-1893" /&gt; Besides Marx and Engels, other frequent contributors to the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' included [[Karl Schapper]], [[Wilhelm Wolff]], [[Ernst Dronke]], [[Peter Nothjung]], [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]], [[Ferdinand Wolf]] and Carl Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Banquet in Gűrzenich" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich Engels's mother, herself, gives unwitting witness to the effect of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' on the revolutionary uprising in Cologne in 1848. Criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a 5 December 1848 letter to Friedrich that "nobody, ourselves included, doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke, and also the language of ''(Neue) Rh.Z.'' were largely the cause of these disturbances."&lt;ref name=p543&gt;Elisabeth Engels's letter to Friedrich Engels contained at No. 8 of the Appendix in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of this letter, Engels's even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in Baden and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] in 1849, still lay ahead of him. Engels's parents hoped that young Friedrich would "decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been {{sic|?|pursing|expected=pursuing}} in recent years and which have caused so much distress."&lt;ref name=p543/&gt; At this point Friedrich's parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to America and start his life over. They told him that he should do this or he would "cease to receive money from us."&lt;ref name=p543/&gt; However, the problem in the relationship between Friedrich and his parents was worked out without Engels having to leave England or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents. In July 1851, Friedrich Engels's father arrived to visit him in Manchester, England. During the visit his father arranged for Friedrich to meet Peter Ermen of the office of ''Ermen &amp; Engels'', to move to Liverpool, and to take over sole management of the office in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels letter to Karl Marx dated 6 July 1851 and contained at No. 186 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with an article called "The Magyar Struggle", written on 8 January 1849, Engels, himself, began a series of reports on the Revolution and War for Independence of the newly founded Hungarian Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "The Magyar Struggle" contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 227–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels's articles on the Hungarian Republic became a regular feature in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' under the heading: "From the Theater of War."&lt;ref&gt;See Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 451–480 and ''Volume 9, pp. 9–463.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the June 1849 Prussian [[coup d'état]] the newspaper was suppressed. After the coup, Marx lost his Prussian [[citizenship]], was deported, and fled to Paris and then London. Engels stayed in Prussia and took part in an armed uprising in South Germany as an [[aide-de-camp]] in the volunteer corps of [[August Willich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1892.htm |title=Engels, Friedrich (encyclopedia) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', 4th ed. 1978, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 130, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510326-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Rapport, ''1848 Year of Revolution'', London: Little Brown, 2008, p. 342, {{ISBN|978-0-316-72965-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in [[Elberfeld]] on 10 May. 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Elberfeld" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Later when Prussian troops came to Kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there, Engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of August Willich, who were going to fight the Prussian troops.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, 1972) p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; When the uprising was crushed, Engels was one of the last members of Willich's volunteers to escape by crossing the Swiss border. Marx and others became concerned for Engels's life until they finally heard from him.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Engels to Jenny Marx" (25 July 1849) contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 38'' pp. 202–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels traveled through [[Switzerland]] as a [[refugee]] and eventually made it to safety in England.&lt;ref name="engels-bio" /&gt; On 6 June 1849 Prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Engels which contained a physical description as "height: 5 feet 6 inches; hair: blond; forehead: smooth; eyebrows: blond; eyes: blue; nose and mouth: well proportioned; beard: reddish; chin: oval; face: oval; complexion: healthy; figure: slender. Special characteristics: speaks very rapidly and is short-sighted."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 9'', p. 524,&lt;/ref&gt; As to his "short-sightedness", Engels admitted as much in a letter written to Joseph Weydemeyer on 19 June 1851 in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the Prussian military because of "my eye trouble, as I have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels letter contained at No. 183 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he was safe in Switzerland, Engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the Prussians. This writing eventually became the article published under the name "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 10'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back in Britain===
[[File:Engel House in Primrose.jpg|thumb|Engels's house in [[Primrose Hill]], London]]
In order to help Marx with the new publishing effort in London, ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politische-okonomische Revue|Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-ökonomische Revue]]'', Engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to London. On 5 October 1849, Engels arrived in the Italian port city of Genoa.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Letter to from Engels to George Julian Harney" dated 5 October 1849, in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Engels booked passage on the English schooner, ''Cornish Diamond'' under the command of a Captain Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Engels to George Julian Harney (5 October 1849) ''Collected Works: Volume 38'' p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The voyage across the western Mediterranean, around the Iberian Peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks. Finally, on 10 November 1849 the ''Cornish Diamond'' sailed up the River Thames to London with Engels on board.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Engels made it to Britain, he decided to re-enter the Manchester company in which his father held shares, in order to be able to support Marx financially, so that Marx could work on his masterpiece ''[[Das Kapital]]''. Engels didn't like the work but did it for the good of the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 4 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_5.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 5 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his first period in England (1843), Engels was now under police surveillance. He had "official" homes and "unofficial homes" all over Salford, Weaste and other inner-city Manchester districts where he lived with Mary Burns under false names to confuse the police.&lt;ref name="salfordstar.com"/&gt; Little more is known, as Engels destroyed over 1,500 letters between himself and Marx after the latter's death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle.&lt;ref name="salfordstar.com"/&gt;

Despite his work at the mill, Engels found time to write his monumental work on [[Martin Luther]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[German Peasants' War|1525 revolutionary war of the peasants]]. This work was entitled ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peasant War in Germany" and s contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' pp. 397 through 482.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" which he finished in February 1850,&lt;ref&gt;The article called "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" written in October 1850.&lt;ref&gt;The article "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 10'' p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1851, Engels wrote the pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France".&lt;ref&gt;The pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Napoleon III|Louis Bonaparte]] carried out a coup against the French government and made himself president for life on 2 December 1851, Marx and Engels, like many people, were shocked. In condemning this action, Engels wrote to Marx about the coup on 3 December 1851.&lt;ref name=letter1851&gt;Friedrich Engels's letter to Karl Marx dated 3 December 1851 contained in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38", p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels characterised the coup as "comical"&lt;ref name=letter1851/&gt; and referred to it as occurring on "the 18th Brumaire"—the date of the coup according to the [[French Republican Calendar|1799 republican calendar of France]] under Napoleon I.&lt;ref&gt;See note 517 located at page 635 in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of Louis Bonaparte's coup into his essay about the coup. Indeed, Marx even called the essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' again using Engels's suggested characterisation.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also borrowed Engels characterisation of Hegel's notion of the [[Geist#Hegel|World Spirit]] that history occurred twice, "once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce" in the first paragraph of his new essay.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, at the mill owned by his father in Manchester, Engels started working as an office clerk, the same position he held in his teens while in Germany where his father's company was based. However, Friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in 1864.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Five years later, Engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies.&lt;ref name="en-1893" /&gt; At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence. One of the ideas that Engels and Marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the Russias. As early as April 1853, Engels and Marx anticipated an "aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia&lt;ref&gt;See the letter from Friedrich Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated 12 April 1853, contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'' (New York: International Publishers, 1983) pp. 305–306.&lt;/ref&gt; which would begin in "St. Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Fredereick Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated 12 April 1853 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; The model for this type of aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the [[Decembrist Revolt]] of 1825.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs: Autocrats of All the Russias'' (New York: Dial Press, 1981) pp. 408–413.&lt;/ref&gt; Although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government, both Engels and Marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in Russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in Russian development to precede a communist stage. By 1881, both Marx and Engels began to contemplate a course of development in Russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage. This analysis was based on what Marx and Engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the Russian village commune or [[obshchina]].&lt;ref&gt;See the letter from Karl Marx to Vera Zasulich contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 46'', (New York: International Press, 1992), pp. 71–72, and Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although doubt was cast on this theory by [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Plekhanov's reasoning was based on the first edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867), which predated Marx's interest in Russian peasant communes by two years. Later editions of the text demonstrate Marx's sympathy for the argument of [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], that it should be possible to establish socialism in Russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Stedman Jones, note on Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto'' (London: Penguin Books, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Engels moved to London where he and Marx lived until Marx's death in 1883.&lt;ref name="engels-bio" /&gt; His London home during this period and until his death was 122 Regent's Park Road, [[Primrose Hill]], NW1.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|213}} – Accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's first London residence was a cramped apartment at 28 [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]]. From 1856, he lived at 9 Grafton Terrace, [[Kentish Town]], and then in a tenement at 41 Maitland Park Road from 1875 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/photo/places/index.htm |title=Photos of Marx's Residence(s) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Burns suddenly died of a heart disease in 1863, after which Engels became close with her younger sister Lydia ("[[Lizzie Burns|Lizzie]]"). They lived openly as a couple in London and married on 11 September 1878, hours before Lizzie's death.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|author=Henderson, William Otto |title=The Life of Friedrich Engels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teYf8gwzoB4C&amp;pg=PA567|year=1976|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-3040-3|page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b2&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hollander|title=Friedrich Engels and Marxian Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIn_Sa2wdx0C&amp;pg=PA358|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49844-9|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
After Marx's death, Engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing Marx's unfinished volumes of ''Capital''. However, he also contributed significantly in other areas. Engels made an argument using [[anthropology|anthropological evidence]] of the time to show that family structures changed over history, and that the concept of [[monogamous]] marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property. He argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints. One of the best examples of Engels's thoughts on these issues are in his work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

Fredrich Engels died of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in London on 5 August 1895, at the age of 74.&lt;ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1895/letters/95_05_21.htm |title=Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1895 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]], his ashes were scattered off [[Beachy Head]], near [[Eastbourne]] as he had requested.&lt;ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerrigan |first=Michael |title=Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves |year=1998 |publisher=Fourth Estate Limited |location=London |isbn=978-1-85702-258-2 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels's interests included poetry, [[fox hunting]], and hosting regular Sunday parties for London's left-wing [[intelligentsia]] where, as one regular put it, "no one left before two or three in the morning". His stated personal motto was "take it easy", while "jollity" was listed as his favourite virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |title=Friedrich Engels's "Confession" |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |first=Friedrich |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427034624/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |archivedate=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Tristram Hunt]], author of ''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'',&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt; sums up the disconnect between Engels's personality, and the Soviet Union which later utilised his works, stating:
{{quote|This great lover of the good life, passionate advocate of individuality, and enthusiastic believer in literature, culture, art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the Soviet Communism of the 20th century, all the Stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;}}

As to the religious persuasion attributable to Engels, Hunt writes:
{{quote|In that sense the latent rationality of Christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family, civil society, and the state. What Engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern [[pantheism]] (or, rather, [[pandeism]], a merging of divinity with progressing humanity, a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement. "Through [[David Strauss|Strauss]] I have now entered on the straight road to Hegelianism... The Hegelian idea of God has already become mine, and thus I am joining the ranks of the 'modern pantheists,{{'"}} Engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soon-to-be-discarded Graebers [Wilhelm and Friedrich, priest trainees and former classmates of Engels].&lt;ref&gt;''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'' By Tristram Hunt. 2010. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Engels was a [[polyglot]] and was able to write and speak in languages including Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Spanish, Polish, French, English and [[Milanese dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friedrich Engels|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1905/08/engels.htm|work=Marxists Internet Archive (from The Social Democrat journal)|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=15 April 2013|author=Paul Lafargue|author2=Jacques Bonhomme |date=15 August 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "After his friend Karl Marx (who died in 1883), Engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world.... In their scientific works, Marx and Engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers, but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Vladimir Ilyich Lenin |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm|title=Friedrich Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Labour Party politician [[Tristram Hunt]] argues that Engels has become a convenient [[scapegoat]], too easily blamed for the state crimes of the [[Soviet Union]], Communist Southeast Asia and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. "Engels is left holding the bag of 20th century ideological extremism," Hunt writes, "while Marx is rebranded as the acceptable, postpolitical seer of [[global capitalism]]."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Hunt largely exonerates Engels stating that "in no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later, even if the policies were offered up in their honor."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Other writers, while admitting the distance between Marx and Engels and Stalin, are less charitable, noting for example that the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas. "It is a fallacy that Marxism's flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power.... [Marx and Engels] were centralisers. While talking about 'free associations of producers', they advocated discipline and hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades: A World History of Communism'' (London: Macmillan, 2007) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Thomas, of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], claims that while Engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of Marx's writings, he significantly altered Marx's intents as he held, edited and released them in a finished form, and commentated on them. Engels attempted to fill gaps in Marx's system and extend it to other fields. He stressed [[historical materialism]] in particular, assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine, indeed forming [[Marxism]] as such. A case in point is ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', which supporters of socialism, like its detractors, treated as an encompassing presentation of Marx's thought. And while in his extensive correspondence with German socialists Engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couple's intellectual relationship and always emphasised Marx's outstanding role, Russian communists like Lenin raised Engels up with Marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous. Soviet Marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of [[Dialectical Materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | pages = 36–42 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | editor-link = Terrell Carver | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;!--He cites Carver 1981 a lot, and Hobsbawm (ed) 1982 "History of Marxism", more on contextual points.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Engels's "magnificent beard" inspired a [[climbing wall]] sculpture in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]. The {{convert|16|ft|m}} high beard statue — a "symbol of wisdom and learning" — was planned to stand on the campus of the [[University of Salford]]. The arts company behind the piece, Engine, said that "the idea came from a 1980s plan to relocate an Eastern Bloc statue of the thinker to Manchester."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-30375063 |title=Friedrich Engels' beard inspires climbing sculpture in Salford |date=2014-12-09 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2017-01-31|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1931 Engels has also had an entire city named after him – [[Engels, Saratov Oblast|Engels]] in [[Saratov Oblast]], Russia.

In the summer of 2017, as part of the [[Manchester International Festival]], a Soviet-era statue of Engels, moved from [[Ukraine]], was installed by sculptor Phil Collins at Tony Wilson Place in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/watch-friedrich-engels-statue-put-13331317 |title=Watch as Friedrich Engels statue is put together in Manchester city centre |date=2017-07-14 |publisher=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation drew criticism from Kevin Bolton in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/19/manchester-soviet-statue-engels-ukrainians|title=Manchester has a Soviet statue of Engels.

==Major works==

===''The Holy Family'' (1844)===
[[File:OriginOfFamily-1884.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of Engels's ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', first published in 1884]]

''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' is a book written by [[Marx]] and Engels in November 1844. The book is a critique on the [[Young Hegelians]] and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] Brothers and their supporters.&lt;ref name="holy-family"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm |title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book created a controversy with much of the [[Print media|press]] and caused [[Bruno Bauer]] to attempt refuting the book in an article published in {{ill|Wigand's|de|Otto Wigand}} ''Vierteljahrsschrift'' in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal ''{{ill|Gesellschaftsspiegel|de}}'' in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of ''[[The German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref name="holy-family" /&gt;

===''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845)===
{{Main article|The Condition of the Working Class in England}}
''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in Britain during Engels's stay in Manchester and Salford. The work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development. It was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eye-opener for most Germans. The work initially made rather little impact in England as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century. It was however very influential with historians of British industrialisation throughout the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=The 'industrial revolution': interpretations from 1830 to the present|url=https://www.academia.edu/1843995|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in English in 1887.

===''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (1878)===
{{Main article|Anti-Dühring}}
Popularly known as ''Anti-Dühring'', ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of [[Eugen Dühring]], a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to Dühring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''. Three chapters of ''Anti-Dühring'' were later edited and published under the separate title, ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''.

===''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880)===
{{Main article|Socialism: Utopian and Scientific}}
In what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote = From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish edition were prepared. In 1883, our German friends brought out the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and Roumanian translations, based upon the German text, have since been published.

I am not aware that any other Socialist work, not even our Communist Manifesto of 1848, or Marx's Capital, has been so often translated.

===''Dialectics of Nature'' (1883)===
''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' (German: "Dialektik der Natur") is an unfinished 1883 work by Engels that applies Marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science. It was first published in the USSR in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1883/don/|title=1883-Dialectics of Nature-Index|last=Engels|website=marxists.anu.edu.au|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' (1884)===
{{Main article|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State}}
''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' is a work connecting capitalism with what Engels argues is an ever-changing institution – the family. It was written when Engels was 64 years of age and at the height of his [[intellectual]] power. It contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and [[private property]].

'''Gearóid Mac Niocaill''' (1932–2004) was one of the foremost twentieth-century scholars and interpreters of late medieval Irish tracts.

==Life==
Gearóid was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[England]] in 1932 to an Irish mother. His lifelong work in the Irish language built upon an earlier tradition of involvement in the Irish revival by English-born scholars like [[Robin Flower (Bláithín)]] and [[George Thomson (Seoirse Mac Tomáis)]]. Mac Niocaill graduated with a BA in Latin and French from the University of Leeds in 1953.&lt;ref name=historiaurbium&gt;[http://www.historiaurbium.org/english/mac_niocaill__en.html In Memoriam, Gearóid Mac Niocaill 1932-2004].&lt;/ref&gt; He presently travelled to [[Ireland]] where he was awarded a post-graduate scholarship by the School of Celtic Studies in the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]]. In 1956 he was given responsibility for manuscripts in the [[National Library of Ireland]]. He submitted a dissertation entitled ''Cáipéisí i Dli i nGaeilge 1493-1621'' in 1962 for which he was duly awarded his doctorate.&lt;ref name=historiaurbium /&gt; Three years later, in 1965, Mac Niocaill was made an Assistant Professor in the School of Celtic Studies at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]].

Mac Niocaill was professor of history at NUI Galway from 1977 until his retirement in 1997. His publication of key late medieval manuscripts in Latin and, especially, Irish restricted his academic audience but affirmed his commitment to the Irish language. Nonetheless, his ''Na Buirgéisi, xii-xv aois'' (1964), written in Irish and Latin, is one of the most widely cited and indispensable texts on the burgesses and boroughs in late medieval Ireland. The growing school of literature examining the geographical and archaeological nature of [[Hiberno-Norman]] towns have utilised this two-volume text in order to understand the constitutional structure of these towns.

A '''half hat''' (also sometimes '''half-hat''') is a millinery design in which the hat covers part of the head.&lt;ref name="HS Hat Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hat Shaper's Hat Dictionary|url=http://www.hatshapers.com/Hat%20DictionaryG_L.htm|website=hatshapers.com|publisher=Hat Shapers|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the design is close-fitting, in the manner of the [[Cloche hat|cloche]], and frames the head, usually stopping just above the ears. It may be similar to a [[halo hat]] in the way that it frames the face and can be worn straight or at an angle.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=2010|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|pages=164, 161, 162|edition=1999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=Brooks+Picken+%2B+halo+h.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adtmkpLqGC&amp;sig=5HFu3H3cyTso3Z-dPCBuc-VWttA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=afarVObAJsuz7gbU9oHgDg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooks%20Picken%20%2B%20halo%20h.&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The half-hat is said to have been created by the French-born and US-based milliner [[Lilly Daché]], who won an award for the design in 1941.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|page=76|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=hatatorium+%2B+eggshell+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_cI1MUdU&amp;sig=0mBNu05gc52mKbC2FTfhQRRPvv8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LferVPuwKOeE7QagtYCYBg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hatatorium%20%2B%20eggshell%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==
The half hat became popular in the [[World War II|post-war]] period, especially in the 1950s. This was a design considered suitable for day and evening wear, and some designs included details such as sequins and veils.&lt;ref name="PH sequin brim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequin Brim Half Hat (vintage advert)|url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/1950accessories.html|website=thepeoplehistory.com|publisher=The People History|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs were often stiffened to create a halo shape – a 1952 design from Ascot Millinery was made of decorated straw with an inner lining of velvet.&lt;ref name="The Observer 150652"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ascot Millinery (advert)|publisher=The Observer|date=15 June 1952|ref=pg. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Four Miss America contestants NYWTS.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Four [[Miss America]] contestants in 1959, with two sporting fashionable half-hat designs]]
While many designs stopped a little way beyond the crown of the head, there was also a fashion for more [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]-like shapes to half hats. Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', also in 1952, fashion correspondent Phyllis Heathcote reported on the off-the-brow trend emerging from Paris, noting: "the majority of the hats are still very small, very soft, and very much alike, except – and this is important – that whereas last season and the one before the tendency was to an arched line over the front of the head, leaving the back uncovered, this season the movement tends to uncover the front and cover the back".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 310752"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heathcote|first1=Phyllis|title=Autumn hats: the sou'wester style|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 July 1952|ref=pg. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Heathcote also noted the practicality of this shape, describing it as a design that could be folded up and stowed in a handbag or pocket.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 310752"/&gt; 
Such was its popularity in the United States – particularly when embellished – that a 1957 report in ''[[The Times]]'' on American hat fashions said: "The hat norm, godlike for Hera, is regal for American womanhood...the half-hat, usually jewelled, is plainly a diadem, sometimes secured by jewelled springs behind the head".&lt;ref name="The Times 53887"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Matriarchal Crown|issue=53887|publisher=The Times|date=8 July 1957|ref=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MomDadwedding1955 photos.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1955 half-hat design incorporated into a wedding veil]]
This was a hat design that became popular with brides. A 1955 wedding reported in ''The Times'' describes the bride wearing: "a beige lace dress of ballerina length with a high upturned collar and a half-hat to match trimmed with fine light-brown feathers".&lt;ref name="The Times 53236"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriages|issue=53236|publisher=The Times|date=2 June 1955|ref=pg. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The half hat could be shaped close to frame the skull in the manner of the [[Juliet cap]] (also known as a capulet) and some variations were known as the cape hat; typically in these designs draped fabric or felt was attached to a bicycle clip, creating a more scarf-like effect.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"/&gt; Another variation is sometimes informally known as the 'cracked egg hat' or 'eggshell hat', due to its curved and irregular shape and is said to have been popularised by [[Givenchy]] and introduced by [[Christian Dior|Dior]].&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|page=73|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=hatatorium+%2B+eggshell+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_cI1MUdU&amp;sig=0mBNu05gc52mKbC2FTfhQRRPvv8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LferVPuwKOeE7QagtYCYBg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hatatorium%20%2B%20eggshell%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatatorium eggshell half-hat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asymmetrical eggshell half-hat by Urbi et Orbi|url=http://hatatoriumemporium.com/item.php?id=11|website=hatatoriumemporium.com|publisher=Hatatorium|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design of this style worn by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] during a 1954 tour of Australia had the addition of a pom-pom.

'''Halil Berktay''' is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] historian at [[Sabancı University]]&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/hberktay/ Curriculum vitæ], [[Sabanci University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and columnist for the daily ''[[Taraf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taraf.com.tr/yazar.asp?id=21 Okuma Notlari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082536/http://www.taraf.com.tr/yazar.asp?id=21 |date=2008-09-13 }}, ''[[Taraf]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Berktay was born into an intellectual Turkish Communist family. His father, Erdogan Berktay, was a member of the old clandestine [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]]. As a result of this influence, Halil Berktay remained a Maoist for two decades, before becoming "an independent left-intellectual".&lt;ref name=hairenik&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/ArmenianWeeklyGenocideInsert2007.pdf|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2008-09-04|work=Armenian Weekly|first=Halil|last=Berktay|page=4|title=A Genocide, Three Constituencies, Thoughts for the Future (Part I)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903010001/http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/ArmenianWeeklyGenocideInsert2007.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}} (Talk given at the "Armenians and the Left" symposium on March 31, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Robert College]] in 1964, Berktay studied economics at [[Yale University]] receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1968 and [[Master of Arts]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He went on to earn a PhD from [[Birmingham University]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He worked as lecturer at [[Ankara University]] between 1969–1971 and 1978–1983.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He took part in the founding of the Yale chapter of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref name=hairenik/&gt;

Between 1992–1997, he taught at both the [[Middle East Technical University]] and [[Boğaziçi University]]. He was a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]] in 1997, and taught at [[Sabancı University]] before returning to Harvard in 2006.

Berktay's research areas are the history and [[historiography]] of [[Turkish nationalism]] in the 20th century. He studies social and economic history (including that of [[Europe]], and especially [[medieval history]]) from a [[Comparative history|comparative perspective]]. He has also written on the construction of Turkish [[national memory]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In September 2005, Berktay and fellow historians, including [[Murat Belge]], [[Edhem Eldem]], [[Selim Deringil]], convened at an academic conference to discuss the [[fall of the Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=conf&gt;[http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/hberktay/conferences/ Conferences], personal Web site, Sabanci University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didem Turkoglu, ''[http://www.personal.ceu.hu/students/06/Nationalism_Media/TurkogluMAThesis.pdf Challenging the National History--Competing discourses about a Conference]'', Submitted to Central European University Nationalism Studies Program In Partial Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts, Budapest, Hungary, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As a supporter of open dialogue in Turkey regarding the Armenian Genocide and Turkey's denial, Berktay has received threats in his country. He has two daughters, Ada Berktay and Aslıgül Berktay, from two separate marriages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Berktay uncovered that the Turkish government purged many of the evidence's and documents regarding the [[Armenian Genocide]] found in the Turkish archives.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|last=Abrahamyan|first=Gayane|title=WikiLeaks on Armenian Genocide: Turkey ‘Purged’ Archives to Destroy Evidence|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2011/09/16/wikileaks-on-armenian-genocide-turkey-%E2%80%98purged%E2%80%99-archives-to-destroy-evidence/|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=The Armenian Mirror-Spectator|date=September 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916220232/http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2011/09/16/wikileaks-on-armenian-genocide-turkey-%E2%80%98purged%E2%80%99-archives-to-destroy-evidence/|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the archive cleaning was “most probably implemented by Muharrem Nuri Birgi, a former Turkish ambassador to London and NATO and Secretary General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.”&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt; Berktay also claims that “at the time he was combing the archives, Nuri Birgi met regularly with a mutual friend and at one point, referring to the Armenians, ruefully confessed: ‘We really slaughtered them.’”&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt;

{{quote|Why don’t we reconsider this idea of a commission? The Turkish government appoints ten Turkish historians but also picks and appoints 5 Armenian or Diaspora Armenian historians. And the Armenian government, likewise, appoints 10 Armenian and 5 Turkish or Turkish Diaspora historians. Then these thirty historians collectively appoint ten international historian, non-Turks and non-Armenians. Now in that case we would have real dialogue.|Berktay{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}}}

==Life and career==

Fox was born and raised in [[Chicago]] as a devout [[Catholic]], but converted to [[Judaism]] in later life. He received a Ph.D. in American Literature from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], and was a professor at [[Michigan State University]] in the Department of American Thought and Language from 1968 until his retirement in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120905222055/http://www.juice-press.com/poetry/links/hughfoxbio.html Profile for Hugh Fox]&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Fox died on September 4, 2011 in East Lansing, MI.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

==Works==

Fox was the author of over sixty-two books, including six books on [[anthropology]]. He wrote over fifty-four books on poetry and many volumes on short fiction, and published many novels. Fox also wrote a number of books on pre-Columbian American cultures and [[catastrophism]]. Some of these works were labeled in the [[pseudoarchaeological]] category, such as his book ''Gods of the Cataclysm: A Revolutionary Investigation of Man and his Gods Before and After the Great Cataclysm'' (1976). Some of his books with these themes have been compared to the work of [[Ignatius Donnelly]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Midwestern Literature: The authors''by Philip A. Greasley, Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature (U.S.) 2001, p. 202,&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Gods of the Cataclysm'' received a number of positive reviews. Editor Curt Johnson praised the book claiming "Hugh Fox’s Gods of the Cataclysm...ought to be required reading for cultural historians of all disciplines," and Robert Sagehorn of The Western World Review cited Hugh Fox as "... one of the foremost authorities (perhaps ''the'' foremost authority) on pre-Columbian American cultures." ''Gods of the Cataclysm'' was revised and re-released in the summer of 2011 by Aardwolfe Books.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Johnson, December Press, editor-publisher of ''Who's Who in U.S. Writers, Editors and Poets''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aardwolfe Books, http://www.aardwolfe.com&lt;/ref&gt;

His novel ''Shaman'' was published by [[Permeable Press]] in 1993. Shaman is a semi-autobiographical account of a cross-dressing poet and novelist traveling to literary conferences and events, and details the reactions of the narrator's friends, rivals, and academic colleagues.

The Ibbetson Street Press of [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] published ''Way, Way Off the Road: The Memoirs of an Invisible Man'' by Hugh Fox with an introduction by Doug Holder in 2006. This book recounts Fox's life and the people he knew from his extensive associations with the "Small Press" marketplace over the years, including Charles Bukowski, [[A. D. Winans]], Sam Cornish, Len Fulton, and numerous other people.

Skylight Press of Cheltenham, United Kingdom published the novels "Depths and Dragons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/9781908011077.html|title=Depths and Dragons|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100226/http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/9781908011077.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Immortal Jaguar"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/9781908011091.html|title=Immortal Jaguar|last=|first=|date=2016-03-04|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070536/http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/9781908011091.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hugh Fox in 2010, followed by the novel "The Dream of the Black Topaze Chamber"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/9781908011398.html&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011. Skylight Press will also be publishing a posthumous novel "Portrait of Sweeney"  in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skylightpress.co.uk/fiction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunbury Press of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania published "Who, Me?" by Hugh Fox in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunburypressstore.com/Who-Me-9781934597514.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This autobiography recounted his personal life and some of his unusual relationships. His collection of short stories "Through a Glass Darkly" was released in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunburypressstore.com/Through-a-Glass-Darkly-9781934597453.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox's novel ''The Lord Said Unto Satan'' was published in the spring of 2011 by Post Mortem Press ([[Cincinnati]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postmortem-press.com/lord.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103154741/http://www.postmortem-press.com/lord.php |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His final novel was ''Reunion'', published by Luminis Books in summer 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luminisbooks.com/books/Reunion&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in summer, 2011, Ravenna Press published his description in prose poems of one year of his life in E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1224">The {{nihongo|'''Japan War-Bereaved Families Association'''|日本遺族会|nippon izokukai}} is an association in Japan that was set up to represent the interests of relatives of deceased war veterans in [[World War II|the Second World War]]. Its headquarters are in [[Kudanminami|Kudanminami, Tokyo]]. The group supports visits to [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo to pay respects to Japan's war dead.

In 2014 the [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] chapter of the association called for the A-class war criminals enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine to be removed to make the site less controversial. The statement stated that the chapter “hopes that the emperor and empress, as well as the prime minister and all other Japanese nationals, will be able to pay their respects at Yasukuni without reserve”.&lt;ref&gt;Fackler, Martin [[New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/world/asia/japan-yasukuni-shrine-izokukai.html?_r=0 Conservative Group Urges Changes at Japanese War Shrine ''New York Times'' Oct 28, 2014] Retrieved March 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in the late 1930s, Hearder was the son of one of three founders of the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]], former British army officer Roblin Hearder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/lifting-the-cloak-on-spies-like-us-20120719-22czn.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=20 July 2012|title=Lifting the cloak on spies like us|first=Daniel|last=Flitton|archivedate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611060149/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/lifting-the-cloak-on-spies-like-us-20120719-22czn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Hearder joined the [[Department of External Affairs (1921–70)|Department of External Affairs]] in January 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Jeremy|last=Hearder|interviewer=Alice Garner|date=26 November 2009|title=Fulbright scholars oral history project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fijiappoint&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126992283|title=New envoy to Fiji|date=1 May 1984|page=3|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Hearder was appointed the first High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, shortly after Zimbabwe's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media/pressrel/HPR10028900%22 |title=High Commissioner in Zimbabwe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611052746/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3DId%3A%22media/pressrel/HPR10028900%22 |archivedate=11 June 2016 |date=21 April 1980 |author=[[Department of Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaining his High Commissioner position, in 1981 Hearder was accredited High Commissioner to Botswana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127064225|title=Botswana status|date=14 August 1981|page=3|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982 he was accredited also as Australia's first Ambassador to Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126901556|title=Mozambique|date=10 June 1982|newspaper=The Canberra Times|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, after his posting in Harare came to an end, Hearder moved to Suva, Fiji, to take up a second High Commissioner posting.&lt;ref name=Fijiappoint/&gt;

Hearder was Consul-General in Chicago from 1988 to 1991, responsible for promoting Australian trade and investment to America's mid-west.&lt;ref name=NAA&gt;{{citation|title=CA 8034: Australian Consulate-General, Chicago [United States of America]|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+8034|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/111975655|title=New consul-general|date=26 May 1988|page=3|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Hearder launched his book, ''Jim Plim: Ambassador Extraordinary'', a biography of diplomat [[James Plimsoll]] whom Hearder had worked with in the late 1970s in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/media_library/hobart-launch-of-jeremy-hearders-jim-plim-ambassador-extraordinary-a-biography-of-sir-james-plimsoll/|title=Hobart Launch of Jeremy Hearder's 'Jim Plim Ambassador Extraordinary: A biography of Sir James Plimsoll'|date=29 May 2015|publisher=Australian Institute of International Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404035828/http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/media_library/hobart-launch-of-jeremy-hearders-jim-plim-ambassador-extraordinary-a-biography-of-sir-james-plimsoll/|archivedate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/betweenthelines/the-lessons-of-a-distinguished-diplomatic-career/6654372|title=The lessons of a distinguished diplomatic career|first=Tom|last=Switzer|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=6 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611053920/http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/betweenthelines/the-lessons-of-a-distinguished-diplomatic-career/6654372|archivedate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book, [[Philip Flood]] wrote that Hearder had done justice to Plimsoll's career as a great Australian ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/book-review-jim-plim--ambassador-extraordinary-20150519-gh2lgc.html|title=Book review: Jim Plim - Ambassador Extraordinary|first=Philip|last=Flood|author-link=Philip Flood|date=15 May 2015|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|archivedate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611054808/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/book-review-jim-plim--ambassador-extraordinary-20150519-gh2lgc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book had been 17 years in the making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://dfat.gov.au/news/speeches/Pages/secretarys-speech-jim-plim-ambassador-extraordinary-book-launch.aspx|title=“Jim Plim”: Ambassador Extraordinary book launch|date=14 April 2015|first=Peter|last=Varghese|author-link=Peter Varghese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814025435/http://dfat.gov.au/news/speeches/Pages/secretarys-speech-jim-plim-ambassador-extraordinary-book-launch.aspx|archivedate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Cham Sculpture''' is a museum located in [[Hải Châu District]], [[Đà Nẵng]], central [[Vietnam]], near the [[Han River (Vietnam)|Han River]].

The establishment of a Cham sculpture museum in Da Nang was first proposed in 1902 by the Department of Archaeology of [[EFEO]]. [[Henri Parmentier]], a prominent archaeologist of the department, made great contributions to the campaign for its construction.  Reportedly founded in 1915 as the ''Musée Henri Parmentier'', its first building opened in 1919 and was designed by two French architects, M. Deleval and M. Auclair, who were inspired by Parmentier to use some traditional Cham elements in the composition.  Prior to the establishment of the museum, the site was known as the "garden of sculptures" and many Cham sculptures that had been collected in [[Da Nang]], [[Quảng Nam Province|Quảng Nam]] and elsewhere had been brought there over the preceding twenty years.

The museum has been expanded twice. The first expansion was in the mid-1930s, with two new galleries providing display space for the objects added in the 1920s and 1930s. Henri Parmentier directed the display based on the areas where sculptures were found. The 1000 meter square of floor space was arranged for the collections of [[Mỹ Sơn]], [[Trà Kiệu]], [[Đồng Dương]], [[Tháp Mẫm]], [[Quảng Trị Province|Quang Tri]], [[Quảng Ngãi Province|Quảng Ngãi]], [[Bình Định Province|Bình Định]] and [[Kon Tum Province|Kon Tum]].  In 2002, the Museum was again expanded with the two-story building providing an additional 1000 square meters.  The new building provides not only space for display, but also for storage, a library, a restoration workshop and offices for staff.

Before 2007, the Museum was managed by Da Nang Museums, an administrative organ in charge of the city's museums and heritage.  In 2008 it became affiliated with the city Department of Culture, Sport and Tourism.

The museum houses the world's largest collection of [[Art of Champa|Cham sculpture]] and is a popular tourist destination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2717">'''Phillip Gowan''' (October 17, 1952 &amp;ndash; May 1, 2018), was an [[United States of America|American]] [[RMS Titanic]] historian.

Born in [[Corsicana, Texas]] on October 17, 1952 from Theodore Phillip "Ted" Gowan and Julia Thedia "Judy" Morris Gowan, he graduated from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and business at [[Howard Payne University]]. He was really interested in genealogy and travelling since a child which he later demonstrated throughout his research on the Titanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obituaries.corsicanadailysun.com/obituary/phil-gowan-1058661956 Phil's Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The parents-in-law of his mother perished on the disaster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/reflections-on-the-titanic-historian-phil-gowan Reflections on the Titanic: Historian Phil Gowan]&lt;/ref&gt;.

His research field focused more on passengers and crew, and the [[Sinking of RMS Titanic|sinking]] itself, getting exclusive photographs and stories that he made public and interviewing several survivors, like [[Milvina Dean]] and the families of those who died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.dfw.cbslocal.com/arlington/events/phil-gowan-history-titanic-/E0-001-045405052-8 Phil Gowan - The History of the Titanic]&lt;/ref&gt;
He's also known for his accurate calculation of the number of passengers on board, calculation that bears the name ''Gowan Numbers'': 1,496 people died and 712 survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://titanicnewschannel.com/blog/tag/phil-gowan/ RECENT TITANIC NEWS: TITANIC SURVIVOR ACCUSED OF COWARDICE CLEARED;DEATH OF TITANIC EXPERT]&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in several international congresses about the Titanic as a guest by [[Titanic Historical Society]], was interviewed by [[National Geographic]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Titanic-survivor-status-in-question-3618124.php Titanic survivor status in question]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/history/15-facts-about-the-titanic.aspx 15 FACTS ABOUT THE TITANIC]&lt;/ref&gt; and television networks of several countries of the world; and published articles in newspapers.
Although having serious illnesses during his life, he lost the battle against cancer on May 1, 2018 at the age of 65, being recognized by many as a renowned Titanic historian.

[[File:Pieter Christiaensz Bor - Frans Hals pinxit - Adriaen Matham sculpsit 1634.jpg|thumb|right|Pieter Bor from the second edition of his 1601 book; 1637 engraving by [[Adriaen Matham]] after the Frans Hals portrait]]

'''Pieter Bor''', or '''Pieter Christiaensz Bor''' (1559-1635) was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] writer and historian. His portrait was painted by Frans Hals in 1634, and it was engraved for his book in 1637.
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-oorloghen MGG 1257.tif|thumb|Print from the Nederlantsche oorloghen]]

==Biography==
He was born in [[Utrecht (city)]] and settled in [[Haarlem]] in 1578, where he became a [[public notary]]. He moved in 1591 to [[Leiden]], where he is registered as being a notary. He is also registered as having lived and worked in [[The Hague]], [[Rijswijk]], and [[Beverwijk]], before returning to Haarlem, in 1602, where he received an annuity from the [[States-General of the Netherlands|Staten General]] for his history writing. Through his work, he had access to city archives in the places he stayed, and he transcribed these sources for his history writing.

==Works==
Although he is not registered as a member of a [[Chamber of Rhetoric]], he wrote a few plays that were published in 1617. This ''stapelspel'' is based on the same story as [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]. This work, which occupied him for 25 years (according to the introduction), was never finished in rhyme, necessary for performances in those days.

He is best known for the historical work he wrote during his years traveling through various cities, called ''Origin, Beginning, and Continuation of the Dutch Wars'' (Dutch title: ''Oorsprongk, Begin, en Vervolgh der Nederlantsche Oorlogen''). This work, which was published in 37 installments from 1595-1601, is one of the longest publications generated in the 17th century. It was consolidated and published in 8 volumes in Amsterdam in 1679 and forms an important historic resource for the [[Dutch Revolt]]. Bor was a perfectionist who was careful to include both sides to every battle, transcribing documents from both the Dutch rebels and the Spanish Catholics. Many of the original documents have since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0011/dutch.html Article] on [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
In his history, Bor also wrote descriptions of non-military accomplishments such as the last trip to [[Novaya Zemlya]] by [[Willem Barentz]].

==Life==

===Early life===
[[File:Delphi temple of Apollo dsc06283.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Pythia|Delphi]], where Plutarch served as one of the priests responsible for interpreting the predictions of the [[Pythia|oracle]]]]

Plutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of [[Chaeronea]], about 80&amp;nbsp;km (50 miles) east of [[Delphi]], in the Greek region of [[Boeotia]]. His family was wealthy. The name of Plutarch's father has not been preserved, but based on the common Greek custom of repeating a name in alternate generations, it was probably Nikarchus ({{lang|grc|Nίκαρχoς}}). The name of Plutarch's grandfather was [[Lamprias]], as he attested in ''[[Moralia]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Symposiacs'', Book IX, questions II &amp; III&lt;/ref&gt; and in his ''Life of Antony''.

His brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms. [[Joannes Rualdus|Rualdus]], in his 1624 work ''Life of Plutarchus'', recovered the name of Plutarch's wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence afforded by his writings. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother. He hinted at a belief in [[reincarnation]] in that letter of consolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Consolatio_ad_uxorem*.html|title=Plutarch • Consolatio ad Uxorem|author=|date=|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact number of his sons is not certain, although two of them, Autobulus and the second Plutarch, are often mentioned. Plutarch's treatise ''De animae procreatione in Timaeo'' is dedicated to them, and the marriage of his son Autobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner parties recorded in the "Table Talk". Another person, [[Soklarus]], is spoken of in terms which seem to imply that he was Plutarch's son, but this is nowhere definitely stated. His treatise on marriage questions, addressed to [[Eurydice]] and [[Pollianus]], seems to speak of her{{who|date=March 2017}} as having been recently an inmate of his house, but without any clear evidence on whether she was his daughter or not.&lt;ref name=Stewart-Long&gt;{{cite book|title=Plutarch's ''Lives'', Volume I (of 4)|author=Aubrey Stewart, George Long|chapter=Life of Plutarch|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033.txt|publisher=The Gutenberg Project|accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch studied [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] of [[Athens]] under [[Ammonius of Athens|Ammonius]] from 66 to 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Intros/Plutarch.php|title=Plutarch Bio(46c.-125)|publisher=The Online Library of Liberty|accessdate=2006-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210181513/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Intros/Plutarch.php|archivedate=2006-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, Plutarch took [[Roman citizenship]]. As evidenced by his new name, '''Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus''', his sponsor for citizenship was [[Lucius Mestrius Florus]], a Roman of [[Roman consul|consular]] status whom Plutarch also used as a historical source for his ''Life of Otho''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Otho'' 14.1&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|"The [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], being eternal, after [[death]] is like a caged bird that has been released. If it has been a long time in the body, and has become tame by many affairs and long habit, the soul will immediately take another body and once again become involved in the troubles of the world. The worst thing about old age is that the soul's memory of the other world grows dim, while at the same time its attachment to things of this world becomes so strong that the soul tends to retain the form that it had in the body. But that soul which remains only a short time within a body, until liberated by the higher powers, quickly recovers its fire and goes on to higher things."
|-
|style="text-align: left;"|Plutarch (''The Consolation'', Moralia)
|}

He lived most of his life at Chaeronea, and was initiated into the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] of the Greek god [[Apollo]]. For many years Plutarch served as one of the two priests at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the site of the famous Delphic Oracle, twenty miles from his home. By his writings and lectures Plutarch became a celebrity in the [[Roman Empire]], yet he continued to reside where he was born, and actively participated in local affairs, even serving as mayor. At his country estate, guests from all over the empire congregated for serious conversation, presided over by Plutarch in his marble chair. Many of these dialogues were recorded and published, and the 78 essays and other works which have survived are now known collectively as the ''Moralia''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0fbzpWKe0EC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=At+his+country+estate,+guests+from+all+over+the+empire+congregated+for+serious+conversation,+presided+over+by+Plutarch+in+his+marble+chair.+Many+of+these+dialogues+were+recorded+and+published,+and+the+78+essays+and+other+works+which+have+survived+are+now+known+collectively+as+the+Moralia.%5B&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VXdDQ5g-Rq&amp;sig=h4EyhCw82xYWrVZRXRPjDvE0Bj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzsIfcr8nbAhVLsxQKHQKwAMcQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20his%20country%20estate,%20guests%20from%20all%20over%20the%20empire%20congregated%20for%20serious%20conversation,%20presided%20over%20by%20Plutarch%20in%20his%20marble%20chair.%20Many%20of%20these%20dialogues%20were%20recorded%20and%20published,%20and%20the%2078%20essays%20and%20other%20works%20which%20have%20survived%20are%20now%20known%20collectively%20as%20the%20Moralia.%5B&amp;f=false|title=The Secert Castle: The Key to Good and Evil|last=Bronchud|first=Miguel H.|date=2007|publisher=DigitalPulp Publishing.com|isbn=9780976308393|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work as magistrate and ambassador===
In addition to his duties as a priest of the Delphic temple, Plutarch was also a magistrate at Chaeronea and he represented his home{{clarify|date=March 2017}} on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years. Plutarch held the office of [[archon]] in his native municipality, probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once. He busied himself with all the little matters of the town and undertook the humblest of duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plutarch's Lives|last=Clough|first=Arthur Hugh|year=1864|publisher=Liberty Library of Constitutional Classics|url=http://www.constitution.org/rom/plutarch/intro.htm|chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Suda]]'', a [[medieval]] Greek encyclopedia, states that Emperor [[Trajan]] made Plutarch [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Illyria]]. However, most historians consider this unlikely, since Illyria was not a procuratorial province, and Plutarch probably did not speak [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianakaris, C. J. Plutarch. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 8th/9th-century historian [[George Syncellus]], late in Plutarch's life, Emperor [[Hadrian]] appointed him nominal [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] – which entitled him to wear the vestments and ornaments of a consul.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. A. Plutarch. New York: Scribner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late period: Priest at Delphi===
[[File:Plutarch and herm.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a philosopher and Hermaic stele at Delphi Museum]]
Plutarch spent the last thirty years of his life serving as a priest in Delphi. He thus connected part of his literary work with the sanctuary of Apollo, the processes of oracle-giving and the personalities who lived or traveled there. One of his most important works is the "Why Pythia does not give oracles in verse" (Moralia 11) ( "Περὶ τοῦ μὴ χρᾶν ἔμμετρα νῦν τὴν Πυθίαν").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%BC%CE%B7_%CF%87%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BD_%CE%AD%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1_%CE%BD%CF%85%CE%BD_%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%A0%CF%85%CE%B8%CE%AF%CE%B1%CE%BD_(%CE%A0%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%82)|title=Περί του μη χραν έμμετρα νυν την Πυθίαν (Πλούταρχος) - Βικιθήκη|author=|date=|website=el.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more important is the dialogue "On the E in Delphi"  ("Περὶ τοῦ Εἶ τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς"),&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Moralia, On the E at Delphi (in ancient Greek) https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%97%CE%B8%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC/%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%95%CE%B9_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B5%CE%BD_%CE%94%CE%B5%CE%BB%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%AF%CF%82
&lt;/ref&gt; which features [[Ammonius of Athens|Ammonius]], a Platonic philosopher and teacher of Plutarch, and Lambrias, Plutarch's brother. According to Ammonius, the letter E written on the temple of Apollo in Delphi originated from the following fact: the wise men of antiquity, whose [[Delphic maxims|maxims]] were also written on the walls of the vestibule of the temple, were not seven but actually five: [[Chilon]], [[Solon]], [[Thales]], [[Bias of Priene|Bias]] and [[Pittakos]]. However, the tyrants [[Cleobulus|Cleobulos]] and [[Periandros]] used their political power in order to be incorporated in the list. Thus, the E, which corresponds to number 5, constituted an acknowledgment that the Delphic maxims actually originated from the five real wise men. 
The portrait of a philosopher exhibited at the exit of the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum|Archaeological Museum of Delphi]], dating to the 2nd century AD, had been in the past identified with Plutarch. The man, although bearded, is depicted at a relatively young age. His hair and beard are rendered in coarse volumes and thin incisions. The gaze is deep, due to the heavy eyelids and the incised pupils. The portrait is no longer thought to represent Plutarch.  
Next to this portrait stands a fragmentary [[hermaic]] [[stele]], bearing a portrait probably of the author from Chaeronea and priest in Delphi. Its inscription, however, reads: Δελφοὶ Χαιρωνεῦσιν ὁμοῦ Πλούταρχον ἔθηκαν |  τοῖς Ἀμφικτυόνων δόγμασι πειθόμενοι. (Syll.3 843=CID 4, no. 151) The citizens of Delphi and Chaeronea dedicated this to Plutarch together, following the precepts of the Amphictyony.

==Works==

===Lives of the Roman emperors===
Plutarch's first biographical works were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Vitellius]]. Of these, only the Lives of [[Galba]] and [[Otho]] survive. The Lives of [[Tiberius]] and [[Nero]] are extant only as fragments, provided by Damascius (Life of Tiberius, cf. his Life of Isidore)&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Konrad, Plutarchos von Chaironeia (Stuttgart 1964), 258. Citation translated by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plutarch himself (Life of Nero, cf. Galba 2.1), respectively. These early emperors’ biographies were probably published under the [[Flavian dynasty]] or during the reign of Nerva (AD 96–98).

There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant, those of Galba and Otho, "ought to be considered as a single work."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. among others, Holzbach, M.-C.(2006). Plutarch: Galba-Otho und die Apostelgeschichte : ein Gattungsvergleich. Religion and Biography, 14 (ed. by Detlev Dormeyer et al.). Berlin London: LIT, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies – as represented by the Life of [[Aratus of Sicyon]] and the Life of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (the biographies of [[Hesiod]], [[Pindar]], [[Crates]] and [[Daiphantus]] were lost). Unlike in these biographies, in ''Galba-Otho'' the individual characters of the persons portrayed are not depicted for their own sake but instead serve as an illustration of an abstract principle; namely the adherence or non-adherence to Plutarch’s morally founded ideal of governing as a [[Princeps]] (cf. Galba 1.3; Moralia 328D–E).&lt;ref name="Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83"&gt;Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing from the perspective of Platonic political philosophy (cf. Republic 375E, 410D-E, 411E-412A, 442B-C), in ''Galba-Otho'' Plutarch reveals the constitutional principles of the [[Principate]] in the time of the civil war after Nero's death. While morally questioning the behavior of the autocrats, he also gives an impression of their tragic destinies, ruthlessly competing for the throne and finally destroying each other.&lt;ref name="Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83"/&gt; "The Caesars' house in Rome, the Palatium, received in a shorter space of time no less than four Emperors", Plutarch writes, "passing, as it were, across the stage, and one making room for another to enter" (Galba 1).&lt;ref&gt;The citation from Galba was extracted from the Dryden translation as given at the [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/galba.html MIT Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Galba-Otho'' was handed down through different channels. It can be found in the appendix to Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'' as well as in various Moralia manuscripts, most prominently in [[Maximus Planudes]]' edition where Galba and Otho appear as ''Opera'' XXV and XXVI. Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that ''Galba-Otho'' was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral-ethical approach, possibly even by Plutarch himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Parallel Lives''===
[[File:Plutarch Han.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the 1470 Ulrich Han printing of Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]'']]

{{Main article|Parallel Lives}}

Plutarch's best-known work is the ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', a series of [[biography|biographies]] of famous Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common [[morality|moral]] virtues and vices. The surviving ''Lives'' contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek ''Life'' and one Roman ''Life'', as well as four unpaired single ''Lives''.

As is explained in the opening paragraph of his ''Life of Alexander'', Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw [[Physiognomy|parallels between physical appearance]] and [[moral character]]. In many ways, he must be counted amongst the earliest [[ethics|moral philosophers]].

Some of the ''Lives'', such as those of [[Heracles]], [[Philip II of Macedon]], [[Epaminondas]] and [[Scipio Africanus]], no longer exist; many of the remaining ''Lives'' are truncated, contain obvious [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] or have been tampered with by later writers. Extant ''Lives'' include those on [[Solon]], [[Themistocles]], [[Aristides]], [[Agesilaus II]], [[Pericles]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Nicias]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Pelopidas]], [[Philopoemen]], [[Timoleon]], [[Dion of Syracuse]], [[Eumenes]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Coriolanus]], [[Theseus]], [[Aemilius Paullus]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Sertorius]], [[Lucullus]], [[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]], [[Cato the Elder]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Junius Brutus]].

====Spartan lives and sayings====
Since Spartans wrote no history prior to the Hellenistic period, and since their only extant literature is fragments of 7th-century lyrics, Plutarch's five Spartan lives and ''Sayings of Spartans'' and ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', rooted in sources that have since disappeared, are one of the richest sources for historians of [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]].&lt;ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, and Tolbert Roberts Jennifer. Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; But while they are important, they are also controversial. Plutarch lived centuries after the Sparta he writes about (and a full millennium separates him from the earliest events he records) and even though he visited Sparta, many of the ancient customs he reports had been long abandoned, so he never actually saw what he wrote.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"/&gt; Plutarch's sources themselves can be problematic. As the historians Sarah Pomeroy, Stanley Burstein, Walter Donlan, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts have written, "Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past, real or imagined."&lt;ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"/&gt; Turning to Plutarch himself, they write, "the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature, minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change."&lt;ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"/&gt; Thus the Spartan egalitarianism and superhuman immunity to pain that have seized the popular imagination are likely myths, and their main architect is Plutarch. While flawed, Plutarch is nonetheless indispensable as one of the only ancient sources of information on Spartan life. Pomeroy et al. conclude that Plutarch's works on Sparta, while they must be treated with skepticism, remain valuable for their "large quantities of information" and these historians concede that "Plutarch's writings on Sparta, more than those of any other ancient author, have shaped later views of Sparta", despite their potential to misinform.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"/&gt;

====''Life of Alexander''====
Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'', written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of only five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror [[Alexander the Great]]. It includes [[anecdote]]s and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarch's portrait of [[Numa Pompilius]], the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early [[Roman calendar]].

Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of [[Lysippus]], Alexander's favourite [[sculptor]], to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance. When it comes to his character, Plutarch emphasizes his unusual degree of self-control.  As the narrative progresses, however, the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury. The murder of [[Cleitus the Black]], which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end.

Much, too, is made of Alexander's scorn for luxury: "He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory." This is mostly true, for Alexander's tastes grew more extravagant as he grew older only in the last year of his life and only{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} as a means of approaching the image of a ruler his Persian subjects were better accustomed to — thus making it easier for him to succeed in uniting the Greek and Persian worlds together, according to the plan he had announced in his famous Speech given in Opis in 324 BC.

====''Life of Caesar''====
Together with [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s own works [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|''de Bello Gallico'']] and ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|de Bello Civili]]'', this ''Life'' is the main account of [[Julius Caesar]]'s feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna's]] daughter, [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]]. Other important parts are these containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar's capacity of inspiring the soldiers.

{{quotation|His soldiers showed such good will and zeal in his service that those who in their previous campaigns had been in no way superior to others were invincible and irresistible in confronting every danger to enhance Caesar's fame. Such a man, for instance, was Acilius, who, in the sea-fight at Massalia, boarded a hostile ship and had his right hand cut off with a sword, but clung with the other hand to his shield, and dashing it into the faces of his foes, routed them all and got possession of the vessel. Such a man, again, was Cassius Scaeva, who, in the battle at Dyrrhachium, had his eye struck out with an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one javelin and his thigh with another, and received on his shield the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles. In this plight, he called the enemy to him as though he would surrender. Two of them, accordingly, coming up, he lopped off the shoulder of one with his sword, smote the other in the face and put him to flight, and came off safely himself with the aid of his comrades. Again, in Britain, when the enemy had fallen upon the foremost centurions, who had plunged into a watery marsh, a soldier, while Caesar in person was watching the battle, dashed into the midst of the fight, displayed many conspicuous deeds of daring, and rescued the centurions, after the Barbarians had been routed. Then he himself, making his way with difficulty after all the rest, plunged into the muddy current, and at last, without his shield, partly swimming and partly wading, got across. Caesar and his company were amazed and came to meet the soldier with cries of joy; but he, in great dejection, and with a burst of tears, cast himself at Caesar's feet, begging pardon for the loss of his shield. Again, in Africa, Scipio captured a ship of Caesar's in which Granius Petro, who had been appointed quaestor, was sailing. Of the rest of the passengers Scipio made booty, but told the quaestor that he offered him his life. Granius, however, remarking that it was the custom with Caesar's soldiers not to receive but to offer mercy, killed himself with a blow of his sword.|''Life of Caesar'', XVI}}

However, this ''Life'' shows few differences between Suetonius' work and Caesar's own works (see ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[De Bello Civili]]''). Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the ''De Bello Gallico'' and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works.

In the final part of this ''Life'', Plutarch counts Caesar's assassination, and several details. The book ends on telling the destiny of his murderers, and says that Caesar's "great guardian-genius" avenged him after life.

====''Life of Pyrrhus''====
Plutarch's ''Life of Pyrrhus'' is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264 BC, for which neither [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] nor [[Livy]] have surviving texts.&lt;ref name=TJCornell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornell|first=T.J.|title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000-264 BC)|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|pages=3|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of ''Parallel Lives''====

|style="text-align: left;"|"It is not histories I am writing, but lives; and in the most glorious deeds there is not always an indication of virtue or vice, indeed a small thing like a phrase or a jest often makes a greater revelation of a character than battles where thousands die."
|-
|style="text-align: left;"|Plutarch (''Life of Alexander/Life of Julius Caesar'', Parallel Lives, [tr. E.L. Bowie])
|}

Plutarch stretches and occasionally fabricates the similarities between famous Greeks and Romans in order to be able to write their biographies as parallel. The lives of Nicias and Crassus, for example, have little in common except that "both were rich and both suffered great military defeats at the ends of their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarch|others=translated by Rex Warner|title=Fall Of The Roman Republic: Six Lives by Plutarch|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1972|page=8|chapter=Translator's Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Life of Pompey'', Plutarch praises Pompey's trustworthy character and tactful behaviour in order to conjure a moral judgement that opposes most historical accounts. Plutarch delivers anecdotes with moral points, rather than in-depth comparative analyses of the causes of the fall of the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] and the [[Roman Republic]],&lt;ref name=Livius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/pi-pm/plutarch/plutarch.htm|work=Livius.Org|title=Plutarch of Chaeronea|accessdate=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tends on occasion to fit facts to hypotheses{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

On the other hand, he generally sets out his moral anecdotes in chronological order (unlike, say, his Roman contemporary [[Suetonius]])&lt;ref name=Livius/&gt; and is rarely narrow-minded and unrealistic, almost always prepared to acknowledge the complexity of the human condition where moralising cannot explain it.

===''Moralia''===
[[Image:Plutarchus - Moralia. De placitis philosophorum, 1531 - 3020537.tif|thumb|''Moralia'', 1531]]

{{Main article|Moralia}}

The remainder of Plutarch's surviving work is collected under the title of the ''[[Moralia]]'' (loosely translated as ''Customs and Mores''). It is an eclectic collection of seventy-eight essays and transcribed speeches, including ''On Fraternal Affection''—a discourse on honour and affection of siblings toward each other, ''On the Fortune or the Virtue of [[Alexander the Great]]''—an important adjunct to his Life of the great king, ''On the Worship of [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]]'' (a crucial source of information on [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] religious rites),&lt;ref&gt;(but which according to Erasmus referred to the Thessalonians){{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/library/texts/bl_isisandosiris.htm|title=Isis and Osiris|accessdate=2006-12-10|last=Plutarch|others=Frank Cole Babbitt (trans.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with more philosophical treatises, such as ''On the Decline of the Oracles'', ''On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance'', ''On Peace of Mind'' and lighter fare, such as ''[[Odysseus]] and [[Gryllus]]'', a humorous [[dialogue]] between [[Homer]]'s Odysseus and one of [[Circe]]'s enchanted pigs. The ''Moralia'' was composed first, while writing the Lives occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarch's own life.

====''Questions''====
Book IV of the ''Moralia'' contains the ''Roman and Greek Questions'' (Αἰτίαι Ῥωμαϊκαί and Αἰτίαι Ἑλλήνων). The customs of Romans and Greeks are illuminated in little essays that pose questions such as 'Why were patricians not permitted to live on the Capitoline?' (no. 91)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#91|title=Plutarch • Roman Questions, 90‑113|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then suggests answers to them.

===''On the Malice of Herodotus''===
[[File:Herodotus Massimo Inv124478.jpg|thumb|left|A bust of the early Greek historian [[Herodotus]], whom Plutarch criticized in ''On the Malice of Herodotus'']]

In ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' Plutarch criticizes the historian [[Herodotus]] for all manner of prejudice and misrepresentation. It has been called the "first instance in literature of the slashing review."&lt;ref name=NewCriterion/&gt; The 19th-century English historian [[George Grote]] considered this essay a serious attack upon the works of Herodotus, and speaks of the "honourable frankness which Plutarch calls his malignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grote|first=George|title=A History of Greece: From the Time of Solon to 403 B.C.|origyear=1830|publisher=Routledge|date=2000-10-19|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch makes some palpable hits, catching Herodotus out in various errors, but it is also probable that it was merely a rhetorical exercise, in which Plutarch plays devil's advocate to see what could be said against so favourite and well-known a writer.&lt;ref name=Stewart-Long/&gt; According to Plutarch scholar R. H. Barrow, Herodotus’ real failing in Plutarch’s eyes was to advance any criticism at all of those states that saved Greece from Persia. “Plutarch”, he concluded, “is fanatically biased in favor of the Greek cities; they can do no wrong.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=R.H.|title=Plutarch and His Times|origyear=1967|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost works===
The Romans loved the ''Lives'', and enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives has survived to the present day. An ancient list of works attributed to Plutarch, the 'Catalogue of Lamprias' contains 227 works, of which 78 have come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D.A.F.M. (1970) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, p.849&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lost work#Classical world|lost works]] of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors' references over time. There are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parallel Lives|publisher=Loeb Classical Library Edition|edition=Vol. I|year=1914|chapter=Translator's Introduction|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Introduction*.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch's general procedure for the ''Lives'' was to write the life of a prominent Greek, then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel, and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives. Currently, only 19 of the parallel lives end with a comparison, while possibly they all did at one time. Also missing are many of his ''Lives'' which appear in a list of his writings, those of Hercules, the first pair of ''Parallel Lives'', [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Epaminondas]], and the companions to the four solo biographies. Even the lives of such important figures as [[Augustus]], [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]] have not been found and may be lost forever.&lt;ref name=NewCriterion&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimball|first=Roger|title=Plutarch &amp; the issue of character|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/19/dec00/plutarch.htm|publisher=The New Criterion Online|accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-classics.com/plutarch.htm|title=Plutarch - His Life and Legacy|accessdate=2006-12-10|last=McCutchen|first=Wilmot H.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205061217/http://e-classics.com/plutarch.htm|archive-date=2006-12-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Plutarch was a [[Middle Platonism|Platonist]], but was open to the influence of the [[Peripatetics]], and in some details even to [[Stoicism]] despite his criticism of their principles.&lt;ref name="zeller306"&gt;Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, page 306&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected only [[Epicureanism]] absolutely.&lt;ref name="zeller306"/&gt; He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them.&lt;ref name="zeller307"&gt;Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; He was more interested in moral and religious questions.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt;

In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean atheism he cherished a pure idea of [[God]] that was more in accordance with [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt; He adopted a second principle (''[[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]]'') in order to explain the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt; This principle he sought, however, not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil world-soul which has from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt; Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt; He elevated God above the finite world, and thus [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] became for him agents of God's influence on the world. He strongly defends freedom of the will, and the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt;

Platonic-Peripatetic [[ethics]] were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans.&lt;ref name="zeller307"/&gt; The most characteristic feature of Plutarch's ethics is, however, its close connection with religion.&lt;ref name="zeller308"&gt;Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, page 308&lt;/ref&gt; However pure Plutarch's idea of God is, and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes, his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations, which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in "enthusiasm" from all action; this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in [[divination]] in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics.&lt;ref name="zeller308"/&gt;

His attitude to popular religion was similar. The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it.&lt;ref name="zeller308"/&gt; The [[Greek mythology|myths]] contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically.&lt;ref name="zeller308"/&gt; Thus Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition.&lt;ref name="zeller308"/&gt;

Plutarch's writings had an enormous influence on [[English Literature|English]] and [[French literature]]. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] paraphrased parts of [[Thomas North]]'s translation of selected ''Lives ''in [[Shakespeare's plays|his plays]], and occasionally quoted from them verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;Honigmann 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] quotes from Plutarch in the 1762 ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship.  Rousseau introduces a passage from Plutarch in support of his position against eating meat:  "'You ask me,' said Plutarch, 'why Pythagoras abstained from eating the flesh of beasts...'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emile, or On Education|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=JM Dent &amp; Sons / EP Dutton &amp; Co|year=1911|isbn=|location=http://lf-oll.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/2256/Rousseau_1499_Bk.pdf|pages=118|translator-last=Foxley|translator-first=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] were greatly influenced by the ''Moralia'' and in his glowing introduction to the five-volume, 19th-century edition, he called the ''Lives'' "a bible for heroes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Ralph Waldo|editor=William W. Goodwin|title=Plutarch's Morals|year=1870|publisher=Sampson, Low|location=London|page=xxi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opined that it was impossible to "read Plutarch without a tingling of the blood; and I accept the saying of the Chinese [[Mencius]]: 'A sage is the instructor of a hundred ages. When the manners of Loo are heard of, the stupid become intelligent, and the wavering, determined.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Ralph Waldo|title=Representative Men|year=1850|chapter=Uses of Great Men}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s  ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' draw extensively on Plutarch's ''Moralia'' and are consciously modelled on the Greek's easygoing and discursive inquiries into science, manners, customs and beliefs. ''Essays'' contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works.&lt;ref name=NewCriterion/&gt;

[[James Boswell]] quoted Plutarch on writing lives, rather than biographies, in the introduction to his own ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]''. Other admirers included [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Milton]], [[Louis L'amour]], and [[Francis Bacon]], as well as such disparate figures as [[Cotton Mather]] and [[Robert Browning]].

Plutarch's influence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it remains embedded in the popular ideas of Greek and Roman history. One of his most famous quotes was one that he included in one of his earliest works. "The world of man is best captured through the lives of the men who created history."

==Translations of ''Lives'' and ''Moralia''==
There are translations, from the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], in [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

“One advantage to a modern reader who is not well acquainted with Greek is, that being but a moderate stylist, Plutarch is almost as good in a translation as in the original.”&lt;ref&gt;[[H. J. Rose]]. ''A Handbook of Greek Literature: From Homer to the Age of Lucian.''. New York: Dutton, 1960. p. 409 (a Dutton paperback).&lt;/ref&gt;

===French translations===
[[Jacques Amyot]]'s translations brought Plutarch's works to Western Europe. He went to Italy and studied the Vatican text of Plutarch, from which he published a French translation of the ''Lives'' in 1559 and ''Moralia'' in 1572, which were widely read by educated Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1910-1911)|title=Amyot, Jacques (1513-1593)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amyot's translations had as deep an impression in England as France, because Thomas North later published his English translation of the ''Lives'' in 1579 based on Amyot’s French translation instead of the original Greek.

===English translations===
Plutarch's ''Lives'' were translated into English, from Amyot's version, by [[Sir Thomas North]] in 1579. The complete ''Moralia'' was first translated into English from the original Greek by [[Philemon Holland]] in 1603.

In 1683, [[John Dryden]] began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the ''Lives'' by several hands and based on the original Greek. This translation has been reworked and revised several times, most recently in the 19th century by the English poet and classicist [[Arthur Hugh Clough]] (first published in 1859). One contemporary publisher of this version is [[Modern Library]]. Another is Encyclopædia Britannica in association with the University of Chicago, {{ISBN|0-85229-163-9}}, copyright 1952, Library of Congress catalogue card number 55-10323.

In 1770, English brothers [[John Langhorne (poet)|John]] and [[William Langhorne (clergyman)|William Langhorne]] published "Plutarch's Lives from the original Greek, with notes critical and historical, and a new life of Plutarch" in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone. Their translation was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1819.

From 1901 to 1912, an American classicist, [[Bernadotte Perrin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1018|title=Bernadotte Perrin Papers (MS 1018). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library.}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a new translation of the ''Lives'' for the [[Loeb Classical Library]]. The ''Moralia'' is also included in the Loeb series, translated by various authors.

[[Penguin Classics]] began a series of translations by various scholars in 1958 with ''The Fall of the Roman Republic'', which contained six Lives and was translated by Rex Warner.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Alexander'', rev. ed. (Penguin, 2012), "Penguin Plutarch".&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin continues to revise the volumes.

===Hebrew translations===
Following some Hebrew translations of selections from Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'' published in the 1920s and the 1940s, a complete translation was published in three volumes by the [[Bialik Institute]] in 1954, 1971 and 1973. The first volume, ''Roman Lives'', first published in 1954, presents the translations of Joseph G. Liebes to the biographies of [[Coriolanus]], [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]], [[Cato the Elder]] and [[Cato the Younger]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Sertorius]], [[Lucullus]], [[Pompey]], [[Crassus]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Brutus]] and [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]].

The second volume, ''Greek Lives'', first published in 1971 presents A. A. Halevy's translations of the biographies of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], [[Aristides]], [[Cimon]], [[Pericles]], [[Nicias]], [[Lysander]], [[Agesilaus]], [[Pelopidas]], [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], [[Timoleon]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Eumenes]] and [[Phocion]]. Three more biographies presented in this volume, those of [[Solon]], [[Themistocles]] and [[Alcibiades]] were translated by M. H. Ben-Shamai.

The third volume, ''Greek and Roman Lives'', published in 1973, presented the remaining biographies and parallels as translated by Halevy. Included are the biographies of [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], [[Agis IV|Agis]] and [[Cleomenes III|Cleomenes]], [[Aratus]] and [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], [[Philopoemen]], [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]], [[Flamininus]], [[Aemilius Paulus]], [[Galba]] and [[Otho]], [[Theseus]], [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]] and [[Poplicola]]. It completes the translation of the known remaining biographies. In the introduction to the third volume Halevy explains that originally the Bialik Institute intended to publish only a selection of biographies, leaving out mythological figures and biographies that had no parallels. Thus, to match the first volume in scope the second volume followed the same path and the third volume was required.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Pseudo-Plutarch==
{{Main article|Pseudo-Plutarch}}

Some editions of the ''Moralia'' include several works now known to have been [[Pseudepigrapha|falsely attributed]] to Plutarch. Among these are the ''Lives of the Ten Orators'', a series of biographies of the [[Attic orators]] based on [[Caecilius of Calacte]]; ''On the Opinions of the Philosophers'', ''On Fate'', and ''On Music''.&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite book| last= Blank| first= D.| year= 2011| title= 'Plutarch' and the Sophistry of 'Noble Lineage'| editor-first= J. |editor-last= Martínez | work= Fakes and Forgers of Classical Literature| place= Madrid| publisher= Ediciones Clásicas| pages= 33–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works are all attributed to a single, unknown author, referred to as "[[Pseudo-Plutarch]]".&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt; Pseudo-Plutarch lived sometime between the third and fourth centuries A.D. Despite being falsely attributed, the works are still considered to possess historical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Don E.| last= Marietta| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gz-8PsrT32AC&amp;dq= |title= Introduction to Ancient Philosophy| publisher= M.E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1299">'''Raphael Badius''' was a  [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] of the seventeenth century.

==Overview==

Badius was versed in [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] and Florentine antiquities, and his researches made him conversant with matters of [[history]] and [[hagiography]]. He rendered assistance to the [[Jesuit]] Fathers, [[Godfrey Henschen]] and [[Papebroch]], in their labours on the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', as they themselves acknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;T. II, Junii, ad diem X, de Joanne Dominici, p. 395, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chronicler of the Convent of [[Santa Maria Novella, Florence]], he was also known to the historian and bibliographer [[Cinellus]], who makes frequent mention of the learned Dominican's knowledge of the literature and writers of Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Bibb. Volante, Scanzia VI, 88; XII, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1681, he was Dean of the [[University of Florence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">'''Renato Constantino''' (March 10, 1919 – September 15, 1999) was a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[historian]] known for being part of the [[leftist]] tradition of Philippine historiography. Apart from being a historian, Constantino was also engaged in foreign service, working for the Philippine Mission to the [[United Nations]] and the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]].

He is the father of former [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission]] Chairperson [[Karina Constantino-David]] and father-in-law of [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] sociology [[professor emeritus]] [[Randy David]].

==Education and early career==
Constantino attended the [[University of the Philippines]] where he became the youngest editor of the University's student publication, ''The [[Philippine Collegian]]''. He wrote editorial columns criticizing President [[Manuel Quezon]], which earned the attention of the President by responding to the article in one of his speeches. When the [[Second World War]] erupted, Constantino fought in [[Bataan]] and was a member of an intelligence team spying on the Japanese. He also worked as a journalist during the war.

At the conclusion of the war, Constantino joined the Philippine Mission to the [[United Nations]] from 1946 to 1949 as its Executive Secretary. He worked as a counselor for the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] from 1949 to 1951. These exposures to foreign service became the foundations of a book he wrote about the United Nations.

==Academic career==
Constantino held professorial positions at the University of the Philippines ([[University of the Philippines Diliman|Diliman]] and [[University of the Philippines Manila|Manila]]), [[Far Eastern University]], [[Adamson University]], and [[Arellano University]]. He was also a visiting lecturer in universities in London, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Malaysia and Thailand. He served as a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Contemporary Asia, and Trustee of Focus on the Global South in Bangkok.

He wrote around 30 books and numerous pamphlets and monographs. Among Constantino's well-known books are ''A Past Revisited'' and ''The Continuing Past. ''He also wrote ''The Making of a Filipino'' (a biography of [[Claro M. Recto]]), ''Neo-colonial Identity and Counter-Consciousness'', and ''The Nationalist Alternative''. Several of his books have been translated into Japanese and The Nationalist Alternative has a Malaysian translation.

Constantino earned various distinctions for his historical work. He received nationalism awards from Quezon City in 1987, Manila in 1988, The Civil Liberties Union in 1988, and the [[University of the Philippines Manila]] in 1989. Constantino was also the Manila's Diwa ng Lahi awardee in 1989. He was conferred the Doctor of Arts and Letters ''(honoris causa)'' from the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] in 1989 and a [[Doctor of Laws]] ''(honoris causa)'' from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1990.

'''Ronald Hutton''' (born 1953) is an English historian who specialises in the study of [[Early Modern Britain]], [[English folklore|British folklore]], [[Polytheism|pre-Christian religion]] and [[Modern Paganism|contemporary Paganism]]. A professor in the subject at the [[University of Bristol]], Hutton has published fourteen books and has appeared on British television and radio. He has held a fellowship at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] and is a Commissioner of [[English Heritage]].

Born in [[Ootacamund]], [[India]] into a middle-class English family, Hutton subsequently returned to England, attended a school in [[Ilford]] and became particularly interested in [[archaeology]]. He took part in a number of excavations until 1976 and toured the country's chambered tombs. Ultimately he decided to study history at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] and then [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] before gaining employment as a Reader in history at the University of Bristol in 1981. Focusing his efforts on Early Modern Britain, he published a trio of books on the subject during that decade; ''The Royalist War Effort'' (1981), ''The Restoration'' (1985) and ''Charles the Second'' (1989).

During the 1990s he produced a string of books dealing with historical paganism, folklore and contemporary Paganism in Britain; ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]'' (1991), ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England'' (1994), ''The Stations of the Sun'' (1996) and ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'' (1999), the latter of which would come to be praised as a seminal text in the discipline of [[Pagan studies]]. In the following decade he moved on to look at other topics, publishing a book about [[Siberian shamanism]] in the western imagination, ''[[Shamans (Hutton book)|Shamans]]'' (2001), a collection of essays on folklore and Paganism, ''Witches, Druids and King Arthur'' (2003) and then two books on the role of the Druids in the British imagination, ''The Druids'' (2007) and ''Blood and Mistletoe'' (2009).

==Biography==

===Early Life: 1953–1980===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="I had begun in the 1960s by believing completely in the concept of early modern witchcraft as a Pagan religion of feminism, liberation, and affirmation of life. In 1973 I debated against the historian [[Norman Cohn]] at Cambridge University, defending the historical legitimacy of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s "witches' gospel" ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches|Aradia]]'', and was floored by him. During the rest of the decade my belief in the old orthodoxy concerning the witch trials slipped away, as I read more and more of the new research and checked the original records (for England and Scotland) myself."|source=Hutton on his views of European witchcraft, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut10|Hutton 2010]]. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hutton was born on 19 December 1953 in [[Ootacamund]], India to a colonial family,{{sfn|International Who's Who|2003|p=265}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. dust jacket.&lt;/ref&gt; and is of part-Russian ancestry.&lt;ref name="histod"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (Dec 1998). "Roots and rituals". ''[[History Today]]'' '''48''' (12): 62–63. {{ISSN|0018-2753}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in England, he attended [[Ilford County High School]], whilst becoming greatly interested in [[archaeology]], joining the committee of a local archaeological group and taking part in excavations from 1965 to 1976, including at such sites as [[Pilsdon Pen]] hill fort, [[Ascott-under-Wychwood]] long barrow, [[Hen Domen]] castle and a temple on [[Malta]]. Meanwhile, during the period between 1966 and 1969, he visited "every prehistoric chambered tomb surviving in England and Wales, and wrote a guide to them, for myself [Hutton] and friends."&lt;ref name="blam"&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. xii–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his love of archaeology, he instead decided to study history at university, believing that he had "probably more aptitude" for it. He won a scholarship to study at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], where he continued his interest in archaeology alongside history, in 1975 taking a course run by the university's archaeologist [[Glyn Daniel]], an expert on the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="blam"/&gt; From Cambridge, he went on to study at [[Oxford University]], where he gained a [[Doctorate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronald|first=Hutton|date=|year=1980|title=The Royalist war effort in Wales and the West Midlands, 1642-1646|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ada4858c-75a0-4749-be17-769b7ae97eb0|journal=|publisher=Oxford University Research Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took up a fellowship at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Bristol University and First Publications: 1981–1990===
In 1981, Hutton moved to the [[University of Bristol]] where he took up the position of reader of History. In that year he also published his first book, 'The Royalist War Effort 1642–1646', and followed it with three more books on 17th century British history by 1990.

===''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'': 1991–1993===
{{Main|The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles}}
Hutton followed his studies on the Early Modern period with a book on a very different subject, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy'' (1991), in which he attempted to "set out what is at present known about the religious beliefs and practices of the British Isles before their conversion to Christianity. The term 'pagan' is used as a convenient shorthand for those beliefs and practices, and is employed in the title merely to absolve the book from any need to discuss [[early Christianity]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; It thereby examined religion during the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]], as well as a brief examination of their influence on folklore and contemporary Paganism. In keeping with what was by then the prevailing academic view, it disputed the widely held idea that ancient paganism had survived into the contemporary and had been revived by the Pagan movement.

The book proved controversial amongst some contemporary Pagans and feminists involved in the [[Goddess movement]], one of whom, Asphodel Long, issued a public criticism of Hutton in which she charged him with failing to take non-mainstream ideas about ancient goddess cults into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lon92|Long 1992]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Hutton would later relate, she "recognised that she had misunderstood me" and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut10|Hutton 2010]]. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Another feminist critic, [[Max Dashu]], condemned the work as containing "factual errors, mischaracterizations, and outright whoppers" and claimed that she was "staggered by the intense [[anti-feminism]] of this book". She went on to attack Hutton's writing style, calling the book "dry as dust" and claimed that she was "sorry I bothered to plough through it. If this is [[rigour|rigor]], it is [[rigor mortis|mortis]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Das98|Dashu 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, whilst he faced criticism from some sectors of the Pagan community in Britain, others came to embrace him; during the late 1980s and 1990s, Hutton befriended a number of practicing British Pagans, including "leading Druids" such as Tim Sebastion, who was then Chief of the Secular Order of Druids. On the basis of ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'' (which he himself had not actually read), Sebastion invited Hutton to speak at a conference in [[Avebury]] where he befriended a number of members of the Pagan Druidic movement, including [[Philip Carr-Gomm]], [[Emma Restall Orr]] and John Michell.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut099|Hutton 2009]]. p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of British folklore: 1994–1996===
In the following years, Hutton released two books on British [[folklore]], both of which were published by [[Oxford University Press]]: ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year 1400–1700'' (1994) and ''The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain'' (1996). In these works he criticised commonly held attitudes, such as the idea of [[Merry England]] and the idea that folk customs were static and unchanging over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collett|first1=Barry|title=Reviewed Work: Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain. byRonald Hutton|jstor=2544475|journal=Sixteenth Century Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Graham|title=Pagan Britain by Ronald Hutton – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/23/pagan-britain-ronald-hutton-review|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, he was following prevailing expert opinion in doing so.

===''The Triumph of the Moon'': 1997–1999===
{{Main|The Triumph of the Moon}}
In 1999, his first work fully focusing on Paganism was published by Oxford University Press; ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft''. The book dealt with the [[history of Wicca|history]] of the Pagan religion of [[Wicca]], and in the preface Hutton stated that:

:the subtitle of this book should really be 'a history of modern pagan witchcraft in [[South Britain]] (England, Wales, Cornwall and Man), with some reference to it in the rest of the [[British Isles]], [[Continental Europe]] and [[North America]]'. The fact that it claims to be ''a'' history and not ''the'' history is in itself significant, for this book represents the first systematic attempt by a professional historian to characterise and account for this aspect of modern Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton questioned many assumptions about Wicca's development and argued that many of the claimed connections to longstanding hidden pagan traditions are questionable at best. However, he also argued for its importance as a genuine [[new religious movement]].

====Response from the Neopagan community====

The response from the Neopagan community was somewhat mixed. Many Pagans embraced his work, with the prominent Wiccan Elder [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]] referring to it as "an authority on the history of [[Gardnerian Wicca]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lam04|Lamond 2004]]. p. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Public criticism came from the practicing Wiccan Jani Farrell-Roberts, who took part in a published debate with Hutton in ''The Cauldron'' magazine in 2003. Farrell-Roberts was of the opinion that in his works, Hutton dismissed [[Margaret Murray]]'s theories about the [[Witch-Cult]] using [[Norman Cohn]]'s theories, which she believed to be heavily flawed. She stated that "he is... wrongly cited as an objective neutral and a 'non-pagan' for he happens to be a very active member of the British Pagan community" who "had taken on a mission to reform modern paganism by removing from it a false history and sense of continuance".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell-Roberts, Jani. (May 2003). ''The Cauldron''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Shamans'' and ''Witches, Druids and King Arthur'': 2000–2006===

Hutton next turned his attention to Siberian [[shamanism]], with [[Hambledon and London]] publishing ''Shamans: Siberian Spirituality in the Western Imagination'' in 2001, in which he argued that much of what westerners think they know about shamanism is in fact wrong.

In his review for the academic ''Folklore'' journal, Jonathan Roper of the [[University of Sheffield]] noted that the work "could profitably have been twice as long and have provided a more extended treatment of the issues involved" and that it suffered from a lack of images. On the whole however he thought it "certainly [should] be recommended to readers as an important work" on the subject of shamanism, and he hoped that Hutton would "return to treat this fascinating topic in even greater depth in future."&lt;ref name=roper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roper|first1=Jonathan|title=Review: Shamans. Siberian Spirituality and the Western Imagination by Ronald Hutton|journal=Folklore|date=2005|volume=116|issue=1|pages=113–115|jstor=30035256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Hambledon &amp; London also published ''Witches, Druids and King Arthur'', a collection of various articles by Hutton, including on topics such as the nature of myth and the pagan themes found within the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]].

===''The Druids'' and ''Blood and Mistletoe'': 2007–2009===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Predictably, Hutton finds himself defending his position on two fronts. Neo-pagans, clinging to the notion that their beliefs are part of an ancient nature religion, and radical feminists upholding the idea of a primeval matriarchal society (which Hutton finds "rather delightful"), scorn Hutton's refreshingly cheerful acceptance that there seems little evidence for either of these. And his less unbuttoned colleagues shake their heads at his optimism about Druidry and other 'alternative spiritualities' as valid contemporary religions."|source=[[Gary Lachman]], 2007.&lt;ref name="Lachman 2007"&gt;[[#Lac07|Lachman 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; }}

After studying the history of Wicca, Hutton went on to look at the history of [[Druidry]], both the historical and the contemporary. His first book on the subject, ''The Druids'', was published in 2007. Part of this material was given as the first lecture of the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids|Mount Haemus Award]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://druidry.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PagEd&amp;file=index&amp;topic_id=1&amp;page_id=98|title=The First Mount Haemus Lecture&amp;nbsp;– The Origins of Modern Druidry |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's next book, which was also about Druidry, was entitled ''Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain'', and released in May 2009.

In a review by [[David V. Barrett]] in ''[[The Independent]]'', ''Blood and Mistletoe'' was described as being more "academic and more than three times the length" of ''The Druids'', although Barrett argued that despite this it was still "very readable", even going so far as to call it a "tour de force".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar09|Barrett 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt; The review by [[Noel Malcolm]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was a little more critical, claiming that whilst Hutton was "non-sensationalist and scrupulously polite" about the various Druidic eccentrics,  "occasionally, even-handedness tips over towards relativism&amp;nbsp;– as if there are just different ways of looking at reality, each as good as the other. And that cannot be right."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mal09|Malcolm 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="My colleagues would kill me for saying this, but historians are increasingly conscious of the fact that we can't write history. What we can write about is the way in which people see history and think history happens."|source=Hutton on history, 2007.&lt;ref name="Lachman 2007"/&gt; }}

Hutton was married to Lisa Radulovic from August 1988 to March 2003, when they divorced.{{sfn|International Who's Who|2003|p=265}}
Although he has written much on the subject of Paganism, Hutton insists that his own religious beliefs are a private matter. He has instead stated that "to some extent history occupies the space in my life filled in that of others by religion or spirituality. It defines much of the way I come to terms with the cosmos, and with past, present and future."&lt;ref name="blam"/&gt; He was raised Pagan, and was personally acquainted with Wiccans from youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''Witches, Druids and King Arthur'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; He has become a "well-known and much loved figure" in the British Pagan community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whi11|Whitlock 2011]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewing Hutton for ''[[The Independent]]'', the journalist [[Gary Lachman]] commented that he had "a very pragmatic, creative attitude, recognising that factual error can still produce beneficial results", for instance noting that even though their theories about the Early Modern [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]] were erroneous, [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] would help lay the foundations for the creation of the new religious movement of Wicca.&lt;ref name="Lachman 2007"/&gt;

==Works==
Hutton's books can be divided into those about seventeenth-century Britain and those about paganism and folk customs in Britain.

===Seventeenth-Century Britain===
In his ''What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded?'', Hutton has considered what might have happened if the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 had succeeded in its aims of the death of [[James I of England|King James I]] and the destruction of the [[House of Lords]]. He concluded that the violence of the act would have resulted in an even more severe backlash against suspected Catholics than was caused by its failure, as most Englishmen were loyal to the monarchy, despite differing religious convictions. England could very well have become a more "Puritan absolute monarchy", rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded? | author=Ronald Hutton | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=1 April 2001 | accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sequoyah National Research Center''' (SNRC), located in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], is home of the American Native Press Archives (ANPA).  ANPA is one of the largest repositories of Native American publications in the world.  The Center is also home to the J.W. Wiggins Native American Art Collection, a collection of over 2400 pieces of art by contemporary Native American artists.

From the SNRC [http://ualr.edu/seqoyah|SRC website]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The American Native Press Archives began in 1983 as a clearinghouse for information on American Indian and Alaska Native newspapers and periodicals. In the ensuing years, it has evolved from a joint effort of the Department of English and the Ottenheimer Library [the UALR library] to a freestanding unit in the University. Its mission has changed from an information exchange to a research facility that collects and archives the products of the Native press and materials related to Native press history, collects and documents the works of Native writers, constructs bibliographic guides to Native writing and publishing, creates digital editions of writers' works, and conducts and publishes original research on topics of importance to Indian communities. It stands today as one of the world's largest repositories of Native thought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ANPA was founded in 1983 by Dr. Daniel F. Littlefield and Dr. James W. Parins.  The SRC is the physical housing, educational, and research portion of ANPA, and ANPA is usually just referred to as "SRC".  The SRC is housed and supported by the [[University of Arkansas, Little Rock]].

The name "Sequoyah Research Center", comes from [[Sequoyah]], a [[Cherokee]] silversmith and inventor of that tribe's [[syllabary]].

==Archival holdings==

* Newspaper and periodical collections of more than 2100 titles published primarily by Native nations, organizations, and individuals.
* Manuscripts and special collections including papers of scholars and writers, records of media organizations and press history, Native organizations, and tribal history.
* Files on an estimated 4500 Native writers.
* An extensive library.
* Microform holdings of Native newspaper and periodicals, records of tribal nations and organizations, and records of federal agencies.

'''Social cycle theories''' are among the earliest [[social theories]] in [[sociology]]. Unlike the theory of [[social evolutionism]], which views the [[evolution of society]] and [[human history]] as progressing in some new, unique direction(s), sociological cycle theory argues that events and stages of society and history are generally repeating themselves in cycles. Such a theory does not necessarily imply that there cannot be any [[social progress]]. In the early theory of [[Sima Qian]] and the more recent theories of long-term ("secular") political-demographic cycles&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=299&amp;Itemid=1 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Law of Social Cycle|Varnic theory]] of [[P.R. Sarkar]] an explicit accounting is made of social progress.

==Historical forerunners==
Interpretation of [[history]] as repeating cycles of Dark and Golden Ages was a common belief among ancient cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance By Daniel W. Rossides. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTYAGD7aKBkC&amp;lpg=PA69 Pg. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more limited cyclical view of history defined as repeating cycles of events was put forward in the academic world in the 19th century in [[historiosophy]] (a branch of [[historiography]]) and is a concept that falls under the category of [[sociology]]. However, [[Polybius]], [[Ibn Khaldun]] (see [[Asabiyyah]]), and [[Giambattista Vico]] can be seen as precursors of this analysis. The [[Saeculum]] was identified in Roman times. In recent times, P. R. Sarkar in his [[Social cycle theory (Sarkar)|Social Cycle Theory]] has used this idea to elaborate his interpretation of history.

==19th and 20th century theories==
Among the prominent historiosophers&lt;!--(?) (removed the question mark from the article, "historiosopher" yields a bunch of results on google, for whatever it's worth. if the term is correct feel free to remove this comment)--&gt;, [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Nikolai Danilewski]] (1822–1885) is important. In ''Rossiia i Evropa'' (1869) he differentiated between various smaller [[civilization]]s (Egyptian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, Roman, German, and Slav, among others). He wrote that each civilization has a life cycle, and by the end of the 19th century the Roman-German civilization was in decline, while the Slav civilization was approaching its [[Golden Age]]. A similar theory was put forward by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) who in his ''[[The Decline of the West|Der Untergang des Abendlandes]]'' (1918) also argued that the [[western world|Western civilization]] had entered its final phase of development and its decline was inevitable.

The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by [[Italy|Italian]] sociologist and economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) in his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an [[elite]] [[social class]], which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the [[power (sociology)|power]] constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.

Sociological cycle theory was also developed by [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] (1889–1968) in his ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (1937, 1943). He classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be ideational (reality is spiritual), sensate (reality is material), or idealistic (a synthesis of the two). He interpreted the contemporary West as a sensate civilization dedicated to [[technological progress]] and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era.

[[Alexandre Deulofeu]] (1903–1978) developed a mathematical model of social cycles that he claimed fit historical facts. He argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles in his book  ''Mathematics of History'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], published in 1951). He claims that each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of [[Romanesque art]], during the 9th century, in an area between [[Empordà]] and [[Roussillon]], which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization.

==Contemporary theories==
One of the most important recent findings in the study of the long-term dynamic social processes was the discovery of the political-demographic cycles as a basic feature of the dynamics of complex [[agrarian system]]s.

The presence of political-demographic cycles in the pre-modern history of [[Europe]] and [[China]], and in [[chiefdom]] level societies worldwide has been known for quite a long time,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Michael Postan|Postan]] 1950, 1973; [[Marshall Sahlins|Sahlins]] 1963; Abel 1974, 1980; [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|Ladurie]] 1974; Hodder 1978; [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]] 1973; Chao 1986; H. T. Wright 1984; Cameron 1989; [[Jack Goldstone|Goldstone]] 1991; Kul'pin 1990; [[David G. Anderson|Anderson]] 1994; Mugruzin 1986, 1994, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and already in the 1980s more or less developed [[mathematical models]] of demographic cycles started to be produced (first of all for Chinese "[[dynastic cycle]]s") (Usher 1989). At the moment we have a considerable number of such models (Chu and Lee 1994; Nefedov 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004; S. Malkov, Kovalev, and A. Malkov 2000; S. Malkov and A. Malkov 2000; Malkov and Sergeev 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Malkov et al. 2002; Malkov 2002, 2003, 2004; [[Peter Turchin|Turchin]] 2003, 2005a; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] et al. 2006).

Recently the most important contributions to the development of the [[mathematical]] models of long-term ("secular") sociodemographic cycles have been made by Sergey Nefedov, [[Peter Turchin]], [[Andrey Korotayev]], and Sergey Malkov.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Turchin|Turchin, P.]] (2003) ''Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147; [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; What is important is that on the basis of their models Nefedov, Turchin and Malkov have managed to demonstrate that sociodemographic cycles were a basic feature of complex agrarian systems (and not a specifically Chinese or European phenomenon).

The basic logic of these models is as follows:
* After the population reaches the ceiling of the [[carrying capacity]] of land, its growth rate declines toward near-zero values.
* The system experiences significant stress with decline in the living standards of the common population, increasing the severity of [[famine]]s, growing rebellions etc.
* As has been shown by Nefedov, most complex agrarian systems had considerable reserves for stability, however, within 50–150 years these reserves were usually exhausted and the [[system]] experienced a [[demographic]] collapse (a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]), when increasingly severe famines, [[epidemics]], increasing internal [[war]]fare and other disasters led to a considerable decline of [[population]].
* As a result of this collapse, free resources became available, per capita production and consumption considerably increased, the [[population growth]] resumed and a new sociodemographic cycle started.
It has become possible to model these dynamics mathematically in a rather effective way. Note that the modern theories of political-demographic cycles do not deny the presence of trend dynamics and attempt at the study of the interaction between cyclical and trend components of historical dynamics.

{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
'''Soviet phraseology''', or '''Sovietisms''', i.e., the [[neologism]]s and [[cliche]]s in  [[Russian language]] of the epoch of the [[Soviet Union]], has a number of distinct traits that reflect the Soviet way of life and [[Soviet culture]] and politics. Most of these distinctions are ultimately traced (directly or indirectly, as a cause-effect chain) to the [[utopic]] goal of creating a new society, the ways of the implementation of this goal and what was actually implemented.

The topic of this article is not limited to the Russian language, since this phraseology permeated all national languages in the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Russian was the language of "inter-nationality communication"&lt;!-- yazyk mezhnatsionalnogo obshcheniya--&gt; in the Soviet Union (although it was declared [[official language]] of the state in 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm "ЗАКОН СССР ОТ 24.04.1990 О ЯЗЫКАХ НАРОДОВ СССР"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |date=2016-05-08 }} (the 1990 USSR Law about the Languages of the USSR) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;), therefore it was the major source of Soviet phraseology.

==Taxonomy==
The following main types of Sovietism coinage may be recognized:&lt;ref&gt;V. M. Mokiyenko, T.G. Nikitina, "Vocabulary of the [[Sovdepiya]] Language", St. Petersburg, ''[[Folio-Press]],'' 1998, 704 pp. (В. М. Мокиенко, Т. Г. Никитина. [http://old.russ.ru/journal/kniga/98-06-19/kreidl.htm Толковый словарь языка Совдепии]. СПб.: Фолио-Пресс, 1998. - 704 с.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Semantic shift]]: for example, "to throw out" acquired the colloquial meaning of "to put goods for sale". In the circumstances of [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|total consumer goods shortage]], putting some goods on shelves had a character of certain suddenness, captured in the expression. "Ivan, grab your ''[[avoska]],'' oranges have been thrown out down on the corner!" &amp;mdash; it was not that someone jettisoned oranges; rather a makeshift [[Market stall|stall]] was set up in the street to sell oranges.
*Intentional [[word coinage]] for new elements arisen Soviet/Socialist world, often as [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s: [[Gosplan]], [[KGB]], [[gulag]], [[kombed]], [[agitprop]], etc.
*Colloquial word coinage: [[khrushchovka]], [[psikhushka]]
*Stylistic cliches: "forever alive" (about [[Vladimir Lenin]]), "laboring [[intelligentsia]]", to distinguish "good" intelligentsia from "bad" intelligentsia of the past, etc.
*Political and ideological slogans Soviet people saw everyday everywhere. Often they were exploited in [[Russian political joke]]s. For example, the formula "[[CPSU|The Party]] is Intellect, Honor, and Conscience of our Epoch" was mathematically transformed into "Intellect is party minus honor minus conscience of our epoch."
*Quite a few pejorative terms were standardized for numerous [[enemies of the people]] and other [[anti-Soviet]] subjects: "sharks of imperialism", "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s".  "[[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union#Biology|The whore of capitalism]]" was an [[epithet]] for [[genetics]].

==Beginnings==
An initial surge of intentional word coinage appeared immediately after the [[October Revolution]]. The declared goal of [[Bolshevik]] was "to abolish the capitalist state with all its means of oppression". At the same time, the instruments of the state were  objectively, necessary, and they did exist, only under new names. The most notable example is [[People's Commissar]]/[[People's Commissariat]] which corresponded to [[minister (government)|minister]]/[[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] (and in fact the latter terms were restored in 1946).

==Soviet political humor==
{{main|Russian political jokes}}
Ben Lewis wrote in his essay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/communist-jokes/#.U4hGSyjwuSo "Hammer &amp; tickle"], ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'', May 2006, essay by [[Ben Lewis (filmmaker)|Ben Lewis]] on jokes in Communist countries
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also at www.radiodaniel.com/clippings/jokes%20and%20communism.doc --&gt; book,&lt;ref name=lewis-book&gt;Ben Lewis (2008) "Hammer and Tickle", {{ISBN|0-297-85354-6}} ([http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11662223 a review online])&lt;/ref&gt; and film&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|870117|Hammer &amp; Tickle}}&lt;/ref&gt; (all titled ''[[Hammer &amp; Tickle]]'') that "[[Communism]] was a humour-producing machine. Its economic theories and system of repression created inherently funny situations. There were jokes under [[fascism]] and the [[Nazi]]s too, but those systems did not create an absurd, laugh-a-minute reality like communism."

Soviet people coined irreverent definitions for their leaders. "Mineralny sekretar" was a nickname for President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (due to his anti-alcohol campaign). "Kukuruznik" (from ''kukuruza'', maize) referred to [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

'''''The Voyage That Shook The World''''' is a 2009 dramatised [[documentary film]] commissioned by [[Creation Ministries International]], a Christian [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] organisation, and produced by Fathom Media. It was released to mark the 200th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=Bally&gt;{{cite news  |title= 'The Voyage that shook the world'|url=http://www.ballymoneytimes.co.uk/churches/39The-Voyage-that-shook-the.5351195.jp  |publisher=Ballyemoney and Moyle Times |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Crawley |title=Creationists defend Darwin film |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/06/creationists_defend_darwin_fil.html |publisher=BBC  |date=21 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A historian featured in the film has stated that the creationist backing of the film had been concealed when he agreed to take part, that the editing of his words could give a false impression of his views, and that the film presents a historically distorted portrait of Darwin. Creation Ministries agreed that they had set up a "front company" to approach experts.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; They denied any deception and stated that one of the interviewees had admitted that while the producers choose comments they "didn't distort what we said", and compared their approach to that used by the [[BBC]] in making documentaries.&lt;ref name=cms/&gt;

==Production==
The 52-minute-long film includes interviews with scholars, academics and scientists covering a wide range of views.  These include some who accept the [[scientific consensus]] on [[evolution]] as well as proponents of [[intelligent design]] and [[young earth creationism]]. It features wild-life footage from the [[Galapagos Islands]] as well as on-location footage from [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the United Kingdom. The film's dramatised sequences were shot on location in [[Tasmania]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevoyage.tv/behindthescenes.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414141741/http://www.thevoyage.tv/behindthescenes.aspx |archivedate=14 April 2011 }} "Making of The Voyage" video&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
[[Ted Baehr]] on [[Movieguide]], a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] website offering film reviews, gave the movie four stars and called the film "a beautifully produced program" that shows the flaws and "anti-Christian" attitudes in Darwin's work, but is done "with dignity and respect". Baehr asserted that many of Darwin's ideas "now prove unscientific", and concluded that "if people watch it with an open mind, it may turn their hearts and minds away from the confusion that is [[Darwinism]] toward asking the right questions that can lead them to the truth."&lt;ref name=Movieguide&gt;{{cite web |first=Ted |last=Baehr |title=TV Review: The Voyage That Shook the World |url=http://www.movieguide.org/articles/1/316 |publisher=Movieguide |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701084421/http://www.movieguide.org/articles/1/316 |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2009|07|21}}, this was the only review cited on the film's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevoyage.tv/feedback.aspx |title=The Voyage That Shook the World |work=Industry Reviews |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its neutral name, Movieguide describes itself as a ministry "dedicated to redeeming the values of the mass media according to biblical principles, by influencing entertainment industry executives and helping families make wise media choices".

The movie is listed on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], an aggregator of film reviews, but {{asof|2014|4|alt=as of April 2014}} without a score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/voyage_that_shook_the_world/ The Voyage that Shook the World], Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2014|4|alt=As of April 2014}} the movie received a rating of 5.2 out of 10 at the [[Internet Movie Database]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1447799/ The Voyage that Shook the World], Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement by the three historians featured in the film says that it is "clearly intended to challenge evolution, but stops short of openly endorsing the more extreme alternatives favored by some creationists." They described it as being highly critical of [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarianism]] and featuring geologists who point to evidence of limited catastrophes in earth history, but said that "it does not imply that the whole geological record is the product of a single flood." They state that the reconstruction of Darwin's life is used to give the overall impression that he "had an enquiring mind but was led astray by his theoretical preconceptions, a view backed up through interviews with several scientists, including one who expresses open doubts about evolution. The film also suggests that what is ultimately at stake is a clash of world views rather than the resolution of scientific questions." They recommended websites for information on the history of Darwin and evolution;&lt;ref name=Newsletter/&gt; the [[Darwin Correspondence Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/ |title=Darwin Correspondence Project—Home |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Center for Science Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/ |title=NCSE &amp;#124; National Center for Science Education—Defending the Teaching of Evolution in Public Schools |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have sections on science and religion, and the [[National Science Foundation]]'s "Evolution of Evolution" report featuring interviews with [[historians of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/ |title=Evolution of Evolution—150 Years of Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Review by Jim Lippard===
In his review of the film, [[Jim Lippard]] described it as professionally produced with excellent cinematography and high-quality graphics and effects. He had no criticism of the acting, which is mostly shown as visual effects during voice-overs of interviews or narration. As a documentary it starts reasonably, though putting unusual emphasis on Darwin "making up stories" as a child, and has the professional historians as the first experts shown. Lippard thought the film veered into creationist areas when discussing the influence of [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarianism]], showing [[Peter J. Bowler|Peter Bowler]] stating that it was then a settled question that the earth is of great age, but not today: in emails, [[Carl Wieland]] of [[Creation Ministries International]] and Steve Murray who directed the film advised that the statement was about the fact that there was no [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist movement]] at that time. The film then presented as experts several people without identifying them as creationists and [[intelligent design]] advocates. Lippard thought perhaps the most deceptive aspect of the film was that these people were shown as though they were on a par with established experts, misleadingly representing their subject areas and not mentioning that two work for CMI while an intelligent design proponent is a professor at [[Biola University]]. They identified [[Truth in Science#Council of Reference|Stuart Burgess]] as "Design &amp; Nature, Bristol University": Burgess, the Professor of Engineering Design and department head at [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]], is Lecturer and Unit Director for a 4th year course on Design and Nature about mechanical solution principles found in nature. In their emails, Wieland and Murray disclaimed any attempt to be deceptive in choice of on-screen credentials.&lt;ref name=Lippardreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/mecheng/people/person.html?id=14218 |title=Bristol University—Personal Details |work=Professor  Stuart Burgess, BSc, PhD(Brun), CEng, FIMechE, Professor of Engineering Design |quote= |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creationist Emil Silvestru presents arguments for a young earth and for [[catastrophism|catastrophic flood]] producing geological formations, taking as an example the [[Channeled Scablands]], but omits evidence of the great age of the earth. The film argues that Darwin was misled by Lyell's ideas, and presents a [[McLean v. Arkansas#McLean v. Arkansas ruling|two-model approach]] in which science of the age of the earth is contrasted with religion as the creationist view that the diversity and distribution of species evolved rapidly in the few thousand years since [[Noah's Ark|Noah's Flood]]. The film then presents creationist claims that there are limits to evolution and random [[mutation]] cannot generate new information or structures, claims at odds with the [[synthetic biology]] research of [[Synthetic Genomics]]. The film touches on claims that evolutionary views caused [[racism]], but omits to mention religious support for racism, such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] being set up to promote slavery. [[Alvin Plantinga]] presents philosophical arguments against the validity of scientific evidence, and the film completely omits the overwhelming evidence supporting [[common descent]] and [[human evolution]]. The film concludes that there are opposing views of evolution and creation, and implies that religion and science are incompatible, finally stating that questions of origins and meaning in existence will not go away. Overall, Lippard thought the film was better than he had expected, and appeared to be trying to hide its own creationism.&lt;ref name=Lippardreview/&gt;

==Controversies==
The documentary has been criticised by the three historians featured in the film, [[Peter J. Bowler|Peter Bowler]], [[Janet Browne]], and Sandra Herbert.
Bowler made his complaint known in a [[BBC]] interview, and later all three issued a statement published in the [[History of Science Society]] Newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2009/July_Perils_Publicity.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Creation Ministries International has responded to the criticisms, in the latter case with supporting extended quotes from the interviews.

===Bowler's BBC interview===
[[File:Peter J. Bowler, HSS 2007.jpg|thumb|Historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] felt he and the other historians were deceived.]]
In a [[BBC]] interview Bowler complained that he and other expert historians had been "duped" into participating in an "anti-Darwinian" film presenting a historically distorted portrait of Darwin without realising it was being produced by a creationist organisation. He claimed that the narrative of the film wrongly implies racism, contrary to current historical research, and also expressed concern that the way his words had been edited could give viewers a false impression of his own views on Darwin.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; In the same interview, Philip Bell, CEO of Creation Ministries UK, stated that his organisation had established a "front company" called Fathom Media for the purposes of approaching experts such as Bowler, who would not agree to take part in the film if they realised it was an "overtly Creationist" production. "At the end of the day," he said, "[when] people see 'Creationist', instantly the shutters go up and that would have shut us off from talking to the sort of experts, such as Professor Bowler, that we wanted to get to."  When asked if this method of securing an interview was "deceptive", Bell replied, "Well, it could be called deceptive. But I think, at the end of the day . . . more people are concerned about how we've made a documentary, that's a world-class documentary, clearly with wonderful footage, with excellent interviews, and balanced open discussion."  Bell also denied that his organisation had broken the Biblical [[Ten Commandments|Ninth Commandment]] by "bearing false witness" against Bowler and his colleagues. "Nobody was told any lies," he said.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

Creation Ministries International answered these allegations in a statement about how the film was made. This included a statement by the director, Steve Murray, and the text of the document sent to all interviewees prior to their interview. In responding to accusations of "lying by omission" it stated that in an email response to a query, an unnamed interviewee said, "They didn't actually distort what we said, but did cherry-pick the comments." The producers deny any deception and accuse their critics of being inconsistent in not criticising the BBC and other documentary producers when they do not reveal the purpose of their documentary to their interviewees when, for example, making an undercover documentary of repression behind the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref name=cms&gt;{{cite web |title=Did CMI 'lie' in making The Voyage? |url=http://creation.com/the-voyage-darwin-film-defended/|publisher=Creation Ministries International|date=27 June 2009|accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a similar controversy over the film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' when interviewees critical of [[intelligent design]] stated that they were misled into taking part by the film producers misrepresenting the aims of the film.&lt;ref name=HistoriansNCSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/historians-misrepresented-by-creationists-004926 |title=Historians misrepresented by creationists |date=20 July 2009 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of Science Society statement===
The statement issued in the [[History of Science Society]] Newsletter said that the three historians had been misrepresented by the film company's selective reconstruction of Darwin's voyage. They said that they had been led to believe that "the movie was being made to be shown as an educational film on Australian broadcast television and possibly elsewhere", and had only been alerted to the true nature of the movie shortly before its release. They describe the interviews filmed with themselves as having been edited to highlight certain aspects of Darwin's views and character. Browne's description of Darwin's childhood delight in making up stories to impress people was "used to imply that the same motive may have driven his scientific thinking." The film uses the description of Darwin's later views on racial inequality but, the statement says, omits Bowler's account of the thesis that Darwin's work was inspired by his opposition to racism and slavery, as put forward by [[Adrian Desmond]] and [[James Moore (biographer)|James Moore]]. A comment by Sandra Herbert that "Darwin's theory required explanation of many aspects of life" was, the statement said, edited down to imply that his theory required explanation of all aspects of life. They stated that this opportunity to reach out to a wider public had turned out differently from their expectations, and that academics perhaps "do need to be more aware of the fact that the media organisations are not always open about their underlying agendas." While they probably would not have contributed had they known the true origins of Fathom Media, they thought that the producers had a point in that if academic historians refuse to participate when historical information is sought by organisations they disapprove of, they cannot complain if less reputable sources are used instead.&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2009/July_Perils_Publicity.html |title=Newsletter |author=Peter Bowler |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler |author2=[[Janet Browne]] |author3=Sandra Herbert |date=July 2009 |work=The Perils of Publicity |publisher= [[History of Science Society]] |quote=Three historians of science find themselves misrepresented by a film company's selective reconstruction of Darwin's voyage. |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMI has responded to these criticisms by quoting more extensive transcripts of the interviews to show that Bowler made no mention of Desmond or Moore, and that Herbert's views were not misrepresented.&lt;ref name="cmi2" /&gt;  On Bowler's claim, they quote the director (Steve Murray) as saying, ". . . in my interview with Prof. Bowler he offered no reference at all that I or others could tell (even on re-examining the transcripts), to the work of Desmond and Moore, nor was there any statement that Darwin was inspired by his opposition to racism and slavery, or anything to that effect".
In answer to Herbert's claims, Murray said, "Professor Herbert seems to imply that somehow we twisted the meaning of her words, so that 'many aspects of life' was edited to imply 'all aspects of life'. Yet where did she refer to 'many aspects of life'? We simply included what seems to be a very clear statement that Darwin had to 'explain everything!' (Implied: 'all aspects of life')"

American skeptic [[Jim Lippard]], commenting on CMI's response before he had seen the film, said, ". . . the CMI rebuttal appears to be sound with respect to those two specific allegations." and added that prospective interviewees should do due diligence to find out who is backing the film before agreeing to appear, should check that the release gives a way of defending against misrepresentation, and if going public with feelings that they have been misrepresented, should "consult the raw footage to make sure your charges of misrepresentation are themselves accurate".&lt;ref name="JL" /&gt; Having seen the film, he thought that it started off reasonably, but deceptively presented creationists as though they had reputations on a par with well credentialed experts, and as the film went on more standard creationism began to emerge.&lt;ref name=Lippardreview/&gt;

==Box office==
''The Voyage That Shook The World'' grossed $116,436 at the box office in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas of Metsoph''' ({{lang-hy|Թովմա Մեծոփեցի}}, Thovma Metsobetsi) (1378–1446) was an [[Armenia]]n cleric and chronicler who left an account of [[Timur]]’s [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|invasions]] of the [[Caucasus]] (1386–1403). What we know of Thovma's life comes from a biography written by his own student Kirakos Banaser as well as a number of 15th-century [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s.

== Biography ==
Born in Aghiovit, north of [[Lake Van]], Thovma received his early education at the monastery of Metsob, northwest of the city of [[Erciş|Arjesh]] (Erciş in modern Turkey). He had to spend a peripatetic life fleeing the repeated attacks by the Timurid and [[Oghuz Turks|Turkoman]] armies. He engaged in teaching and literary activity at several religious centers of Armenian, including Sukhara, [[Tatev]], Lim, and Metsob. He was also involved in the struggle against the influence of [[Roman Catholicism]] within the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]], and helped transfer the Armenian [[catholicos]]ate from [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]] in [[Cilician Armenia]] to back to [[Echmiadzin]] in [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] (1441). His major work is The History of Timur and His Successors, which is essentially an eyewitness account written for the most part from memory. Although not flawless, it is an important source for Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The classical Armenian text was published K. Shahnazarian in Paris in 1860, translated into French by Felix Neve in 1855, and into English by Robert Bedrosian in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bedrosian (1987).

'''Anthony "Tony" P. Pizzo''' was a well-respected local historian and businessman, and was internationally recognized for his attempts to preserve the [[Italian American]] and [[Cuban American]] heritage and history of [[Tampa, Florida]], and in particular that of his home neighborhood of [[Ybor City]]. From 1982 until his death in 1994, Pizzo was the official historian of [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], and is author of several histories, most of which celebrate the unusual multicultural makeup of early Tampa. Pizzo also served as chairman of the Hillsborough County Historical Commission from 1968 to 1980, where he oversaw and was responsible for over eighty historical markers in Tampa and Ybor City.&lt;ref name="Tribune McEwen" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tony Pizzo was born in Ybor City to Italian parents Paul and Rosalia Pizzo, who were green grocers, in 1912.&lt;ref name="Tampa Today Ward" /&gt; His parents instilled in him a philanthropic nature and a quest to keep the Italian heritage alive. Paul Pizzo was the organizer of ''La Nuova Sicilia'' Lodge, the very first chapter in Florida for the [[Sons of Italy]] organization and was honored in the book ''El Volto d'Italia'' (The Faces of Italy).&lt;ref name="Tampa Today Ward" /&gt; Paul and Rosalia Pizzo created an environment filled with social and cultural stimulation, music and art, and placed a large emphasis on kindness and making contributions to your community.&lt;ref name="Tampa Today Ward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Taylor|title=Tony PIzzo|journal=Tampa Today|year=1994|pages=1B - 2B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzo described his childhood in fondly poetic terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I like to think of the days of my youth in Ybor city ... recall the sights, sounds and smells that enriched my childhood. Life was pleasant and carefree, often exciting. I can still hear the chatter in Spanish and Italian as the workers paraded to the long days of rolling cigars in the factories; the rumbling of wagons and the clump of horses' hooves on the brick streets delivering bottles of milk and loaves of Cuban bread before sunrise... The mellifluous Latin prattle along the sidewalks in the evenings was an enchantment. I can still hear the music from the ballrooms wafting on the night air during festive occasions. Remembering the haunting wail of the train whistle rumbling along Sixth Avenue in the middle of the night awakens a sad sense of nostalgia. The old haunts and departed friends capture my memories. It was a way of life that will not return. It filled the summers of my childhood.&lt;ref name="tribune otto"&gt;{{cite news|last=Otto|first=Steve|title=Tribute to historian almost right|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=1 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pizzo attended [[Hillsborough High School (Tampa, Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] before moving on to the [[University of Florida]] for two years. After graduation, he attended [[Stetson University]] for law school, but quit to go into business for himself.&lt;ref name="St. Pete Times Basse" /&gt; While at Stetson University, Pizzo met cousin of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] Grafton Payne, and together, the two of them toured Europe in 1938. Upon returning home, Pizzo enlisted with the military and served in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="St. Pete Times Basse" /&gt;

During the 1940s, Pizzo worked in the insurance business, but later left to start his own liquor company, International Brands, before 1950.  He left this business a short time later, and began working for House of Midulla, a wholesale liquor company, and served as vice president in charge of sales from 1950 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Tribune Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Brian|title=Tampa historian Tony Pizzo dies at 81|journal=The Tampa Tribune|date=3 January 1994|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1971, Pizzo was president of Rey Del Mundo Cigar Co., a mail-order business that was among the Midulla affiliates. Pizzo additionally served as vice president and general manager for another affiliate company of Midulla, Fruit Wines of Florida Inc., the first winery to be built in Tampa.&lt;ref name="Tribune Edwards" /&gt; Pizzo frequently traveled in Spain and Italy, and while in [[Sicily]] he gathered material in 1970 on Italians who came to Ybor City before the turn of the century.

Pizzo also was very active in Tampa history and heritage, teaching about Tampa's Hispanic roots at the [[University of South Florida]],&lt;ref name="Tampa Today Ward" /&gt; and served as a member of the University of South Florida's Presidents Council.  During his tenure as a professor in the [[American Studies]] department, Pizzo's ten part television series, "Tony Pizzo's Tampa,"(1979)  produced by the University of South Florida, won two National University Television Association awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillsborough County Bar Association|title=Liberty Bell Award to Tony Pizzo|journal=The Bulletin|date=May 1990|volume=25|issue=5|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzo was involved in a great number of organizations throughout his time. Some of his impact can be seen in:

* Historic Tampa/Hillsborough County Preservation Board
* [[Tampa General Hospital|Tampa General Hospital Foundation]]
* Barrio Latino Commission
* City of Tampa Planning and Zoning Board (1951 – 1961)

==Awards==
Pizzo's work preserving and discovering Tampa's heritage garnered him quite a few awards throughout his lifetime, and even has his own name attached to an award today (see below). Pizzo received the Medal of the National Order of Merit Carlos Manuel de Cespedes from the Cuban government in 1952, the highest award that can be given to a foreigner, presented to him by President [[Fulgencio Batista]] for the preservation of Cuban history in Tampa. The Italian government made Pizzo a Knight Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] in 1974 for similar work with Italian heritage and history in Tampa. In 1956 Pizzo was recognized as an Outstanding citizen with the Tampa Civitan Award, the highest honor bestowed by the city. In 1971 Pizzo founded the Tampa Historical Society, which then awarded him with the D.B. McKay State Award in 1980. The Hillsborough County Bar Association gave Pizzo the Liberty Bell Award on [[Law Day (United States)|Law Day]], 1990.&lt;ref name="Tribune McEwen"&gt;{{cite news|last=McEwen|first=Tom|title=Tony Pizzo|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=27 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And finally, Pizzo had been recognized many times in banquets during his life, and continued to receive praise in numerous posthumous celebrations.

==Legacy==
Today, the materials left from Tony Pizzo's historical research create one of the larger personal collections in the Special Collections department of the [[University of South Florida]] Tampa Library.

Pizzo Elementary School was named in his honor, and opened in 1998, four years after Pizzo's death.&lt;ref name="pizzo elementary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pizzo History|url=http://pizzo.mysdhc.org/|publisher=Pizzo Elementary School|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named in Pizzo's honor, the Tony Pizzo Award is given annually to "someone who has been actively involved in the City or County's Historical Education, Preservation, Research, or Community Service involving the history and heritage of Tampa".&lt;ref name="tony pizzo award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominations for Annual Tony Pizzo Award|url=http://www.tampagov.net/appl_tampa_announcements/ViewRelease.asp?ReleaseID=536|publisher=City of Tampa|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzo is depicted as one of the bronze statues that adorn Ybor City's streets—monuments to extraordinary citizens of this neighborhood. Pizzo's statue is situated at Ninth Avenue and 17th Street, where he is shown mid-lecture.&lt;ref name="Tribune Morgan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Philip|title=A Bronze Age for City|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was unveiled in September 1995, just one year after Pizzo's death.&lt;ref name="Tribune Gilpin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilpin|first=Francis|title=Statue honoring historian unveiled in Ybor City|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=24 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzo is also featured in a 12,000 square foot mural in Ybor City painted by artist Mike Parker that was dedicated in May 2013. Named "American Journey", it features prominent Ybor citizens through the years, including Ybor City's namesake [[Vicente Martinez Ybor|Vicente Martinez-Ybor]], who brought the cigar industry to Tampa from [[Key West, Florida|Key West]].&lt;ref name="tribune wiatrowski"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiatrowski|first=Kevin|title='American Journey' dedicated|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==

Pizzo worked tirelessly to preserve, document and share Tampa's historic culture and heritage. He is the author of numerous articles and books on Tampa History including:

*''Tampa town, 1824 – 1886; the cracker village with a Latin accent''. (1968. OCLC Number: 1527081). Print.
*''Tampa Town.'' (1977. OCLC Number: 47246317). Print.

'''Tor Julius Efraim Andræ''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈtuːr anˈdreː|lang}}; 9 July 1885 in [[Hultsfred Municipality|Vena]]&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1947 in [[Linköping]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] scholar of [[comparative religion]] and [[bishop of Linköping]] from 1936.

Coming from a clerical family, Tor Andræ studied Theology at [[Uppsala University]], where he completed his Ph.D. in 1917. He became professor of the History of Religions at the [[University College of Stockholm]] in 1927, and in Uppsala two years later. He was appointed bishop of [[Linköping]] in 1936 and was the same year briefly Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs (an archaic title which in reality meant Minister of Education) in the short-lived cabinet of [[Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp]].

Andræ was a student of [[Nathan Söderblom]], whom he succeeded as member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1932. As a historian of religion, his particular interest lay in the early history of [[Islam]], particularly its Jewish and Christian origins, and in the [[psychology of religion]], but he also combined these interests in the study of early [[Islamic mysticism]].

In 1985, [[Annemarie Schimmel]] remarked that until then only one study had "tried specifically to depict Muhammad's role in Islamic piety. Even today Tor Andrae's ''Die person Muhammeds in lehre und glaube seiner Gemeinde'' (1918) remains the standard work in this area, unsuperseded by any other major study, though complemented by random remarks in numerous modern work on Sufism. It is, however, unfortunately too little known even among Islamicists."&lt;ref name="Schimmel1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annemarie Schimmel|title=And Muhammad is his messenger: the veneration of the Prophet in Islamic piety|year=1985|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1639-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torgrim Sørnes''' (born March 2, 1956 in [[Moss]]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[physician]], [[historian]] and [[author]], who has written extensively on Norwegian [[Social History|social and forensic history]].

==Early life and education==
Sørnes was born in [[Moss]], [[Østfold]], and raised on the island of [[Jeløy]] in the [[Oslofjorden|Oslofjord]]. His father is the writer and engineer [[Tor Sørnes]] and he has three siblings. He attended Kirkeparken senior high school and later studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Bergen]], subsequently becoming an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician/gynecologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schibstedforlag.no/no/Kategorier/Authors/Torgrim-Sornes/|title=Torgrim Sørnes|language=Norwegian|publisher=Schibsted Forlag|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrk1/&gt; He currently resides in [[Lørenskog]], outside of [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name=nrk1/&gt;

==Career==
He made his publishing [[Debut novel|debut]] in 2009 with the book ''Cruelty: The executed in Norway 1815-1876'' ({{lang-no|Ondskap: De henrettede i Norge 1815-1876}}),&lt;ref name=ond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schibstedforlag.no/no/Kategorier/Sakprosa/Biografi-historie-og-dokumentar/Ondskap/|title=Ondskap: De henrettede i Norge 1815-1876|language=Norwegian|publisher=Schibsted Forlag|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which deals in detail with every case of capital punishment in the period 1815-1876, fellow crime author and historian [[Hans Olav Lahlum]] called it "a masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lahlum|first=Hans Olav|title=Ondskap av Torgrim Sørnes|url=http://www.bokavisen.no/bokanmeldelser/2010/02/ondskap_av_torgrim_soernes.php|work=Bokanmeldelser|publisher=Bokavisen.no|accessdate=2011-11-18|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aftenposten]] called it a "unique insight into the old norwegian society seen from below".&lt;ref name=Aftenposten1&gt;{{cite web|last=Andenæs|first=Ulf|title=Dødstraff ved Halshugging|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/litteratur/article3314681.ece|work=Aftenposten Litteratur|publisher=Aftenposten.no|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second work, ''No Mercy: The executed in Norway 1783-1814'' (2011), which can be regarded as a prequel to his first book, takes an in-depth look on Norwegian judicial history in general and  cases of [[capital punishment]] in the period 1783-1814 in particular, again dealing with every case individually and in relation to the [[Social History|society]] at the time. He puts some perspective on the influence of demography and social inequalities in dealing with both perpetrators and victims.&lt;ref name=nrk1&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruvik|first=Hilde|title=Skriver om henrettede nordmenn|url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur-og-underholdning/1.7846844|accessdate=2011-11-18|newspaper=NRK.no|date=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been noted for bringing the view of a [[clinician]] when regarding the [[Anatomy|anatomical]] methodology and the art and technique of the classical executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holck|first=Per|title=Fortidens Mordere|url=http://tidsskriftet.no/article/1929532|publisher=Tidskriftet for den norske legeforening|accessdate=2011-11-18|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anna Østmo mystery===
In October 2010, Sørnes was called in to investigate when startled construction workers in [[Åsnes]] uncovered centuries-old [[skeleton|human remains]] at their building site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gunnersen|first=Anja|title=Skjelettfunn kan være halshogd kvinne|url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/skjelettfunn-kan-vaere-en-halshogd-kvinne-3325050.html|accessdate=2011-11-18|newspaper=TV2 Nyheter|date=2011-10-25|author2=Asbjørn Øyhovden|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sørnes quickly determined it to be the remains of an 18th-century female, condemned child-murderer [[Anna Østmo]], who was executed for murdering her two infant children in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halvorsen|first=Kathrine|title=Skjelett var henrettet 3-barns mor|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.7357892|publisher=NRK.no|accessdate=2011-11-18|author2=Linda Vespestad |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravndal|first=Dennis|title=Mystisk skjelett var halshugget 3-barns mor|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10034333|accessdate=2011-11-18|newspaper=Verdens Gang|date=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial records indicated that her dying wish was to be interred at the church cemetery; however, this would not be granted until April 2012, 228 years later, at the request of Sørnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christiansen|first=Veslemøy|title=I dag får hun ønsket sitt oppfylt|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.8109170|accessdate=2012-04-30|newspaper=Nrk.no|date=2012-04-30|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incident occurred in  
October 2011 in [[Stavern]] when workers uncovered another set of mysterious skeletal human remains, which again turned out to be centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hodeløst skjelett funnet i Stavern|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10015299|accessdate=2011-11-18|newspaper=VG Nett|date=2011-10-26|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This time Sørnes deduced that it either belonged to a murderer executed in 1816, or one executed in 1775. Its precise identity was never confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Løsnæs|first=Elisabeth|title=Kan ha blitt halshugget i 1816|url=http://www.op.no/nyheter/article5786343.ece|publisher=Østlands-posten|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historical linguistics]], an '''''Urheimat''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʊər|h|aɪ|m|ɑː|t}} (from [[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ur-|ur-]]'' "original" and ''[[Heimat]]'', home, [[homeland]]) is the area of origin of the speakers of a [[proto-language]], the (reconstructed or known) parent language of a group of languages assumed to be [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]].

Depending on the age of the language family under consideration, its homeland may be known with near-certainty (in the case of historical or near-historical migrations) or it may be very uncertain (in the case of deep prehistory). The reconstruction of a prehistorical homeland makes use of a variety of disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[archaeogenetics]].

==Limitations of the concept ==
{{see|Language change}}
The concept of a (single, identifiable) "homeland" of a given language family implies a purely [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genealogical]] view of the development of languages. This assumption is often reasonable and useful, but it is by no means a logical necessity, as languages are well known to be susceptible to [[Areal feature|areal change]] such as [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate or superstrate]] influence.

===Time depth===
{{see|Behavioral modernity|Origin of language|Origin of speech|Proto-Human language|Borean languages|Nostratic languages|Dené–Caucasian languages}}
Over a sufficient period of time, in the absence of evidence of intermediary steps in the process, it may be impossible to observe linkages between languages that have a shared urheimat: given enough time, natural language change will obliterate any meaningful linguistic evidence of a  common genetic source.
This general concern is a manifestation of the larger issue of "time depth" in historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Time Depth in Historical Linguistics |editor1-first=Colin |editor1-last=Renfrew |editor2-first=April |editor2-last=McMahon |editor3-first=Larry |editor3-last=Trask |year=1999  |isbn=978-1902937069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, the [[languages of the New World]] are believed to be descended from a relatively "rapid" [[Settlement of the Americas|peopling of the Americas]] (relative to the duration of the Upper Paleolithic) within a few millennia (roughly between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=O'Rourke |first1=Dennis H. |last2=Raff |first2=Jennifer A. |title=The Human Genetic History of the Americas: The Final Frontier |journal=Current Biology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=R202–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20178768 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.051}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their genetic relationship has become completely obscured over the more than ten millennia which have passed between their separation and their first written record in the early modern period. Similarly, the [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] are divided into some 28 families and isolates for which no genetic relationship can be shown. &lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire; Atkinson, Quentin (2012). "Computational Phylogenetics and the Internal Structure of Pama-Nyungan". Language. 84 (4): 817–845. {{Citation |last1=Kayser |first1=Manfred |title=The Human Genetic History of Oceania: Near and Remote Views of Dispersal |journal=Current Biology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=R194–201 |year=2010 |pmid=20178767 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Urheimaten'' reconstructed using the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] typically estimate separation times dating to the [[Neolithic]] or later. It is undisputed that fully developed languages were present throughout the [[Upper Paleolithic]], and possibly into the deep [[Middle Paleolithic]] (see [[origin of language]], [[behavioral modernity]]). These languages would have spread with the [[early human migrations]] of the first "peopling of the world", but they are no longer amenable to linguistic reconstruction. The [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) has imposed linguistic separation lasting several millennia on many Upper Paleolithic populations in Eurasia, as they were forced to retreat into "[[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugia]]" before the advancing ice sheets. After the end of the LGM, [[Mesolithic]] populations of the [[Holocene]] again became more mobile, and most of the prehistoric spread of the world's major linguistic families seem to reflect the expansion of population cores during the Mesolithic followed by the [[Neolithic Revolution]].

The [[Nostratic languages]] theory is the best-known attempt to expand the deep prehistory of the main language families of Eurasia (excepting Sino-Tibetan and the languages of Southeast Asia) to the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. First proposed in the early 20th century, the Nostratic theory still receives serious consideration, but it is by no means generally accepted. The more recent and more speculative "[[Borean languages|"Borean" hypothesis]] attempts to unite Nostratic with [[Dené–Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]], in a "mega-phylum" that would unite most languages of Eurasia, with a time depth going back to the Last Glacial Maximum.

The argument surrounding the "[[Proto-Human language]]", finally, is almost completely detached from linguistic reconstruction, instead surrounding questions of phonology and the [[origin of speech]]. Time depths involved in the deep prehistory of all the world's extant languages are of the order of at least 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson and Ruhlen (1994) offered a list of 27 "global etymologies". Bengtson, John D. and Merritt Ruhlen. 1994. [http://www.merrittruhlen.com/files/Global.pdf "Global etymologies"]. In Ruhlen 1994a, pp.&amp;nbsp;277–336. This approach has been criticized as flawed by Campbell and Poser (2008) who used the same criteria employed by Bengtson and Ruhlen to identify "cognates" in Spanish known to be false. Campbell, Lyle, and William J. Poser. 2008. ''Language Classification: History and Method''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 370–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language contact and creolization===
The concept of an ''Urheimat'' only applies to populations speaking a proto-language defined by the [[tree model]]. This is not always the case.

For example, in places where language families meet, the relationship between a group that speaks a language and the urheimat for that language is complicated by "processes of migration, language shift and group absorption are documented by linguists and ethnographers" in groups that are themselves "transient and plastic." Thus, in the contact area in western Ethiopia between languages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic families, the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nyangatom and the Afroasiatic-speaking Daasanach have been observed to be closely related to each other but genetically distinct from neighboring Afroasiatic-speaking populations. This is a reflection of the fact that the Daasanach, like the Nyangatom, originally spoke a Nilo-Saharan language, with the ancestral Daasanach later [[language shift|adopting]] an Afroasiatic language around the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poloni | first1 = ES | last2 = Naciri | first2 = Y | last3 = Bucho | first3 = R | last4 = Niba | first4 = R | last5 = Kervaire | first5 = B | last6 = Excoffier | first6 = L | last7 = Langaney | first7 = A | last8 = Sanchez-Mazas | first8 = A. |date=Nov 2009  | title = Genetic evidence for complexity in ethnic differentiation and history in East Africa | url = https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:2714/ATTACHMENT01| journal = Ann Hum Genet | volume = 73 | issue = 6| pages = 582–600 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00541.x | pmid=19706029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Creole language]]s are hybrids of languages that are sometimes unrelated. Similarities arise from the creole formation process, rather than from genetic descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=McWhorter |first1=J. H. |title=Identifying the Creole Prototype: Vindicating a Typological Class |journal=Language |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=788–818 |year=1998 |doi=10.2307/417003|jstor=417003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a creole language may lack significant inflectional morphology, lack tone on monosyllabic words, or lack semantically opaque word formation, even if these features are found in all of the parent languages of the languages from which the creole was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=McWhorter | first=John H. | year=1999 | contribution=The Afrogenesis Hypothesis of Plantation Creole Origin | editor1-last=Huber | editor1-first=Magnus | editor2-last=Parkvall | editor2-first=Mikael | title=Spreading the Word: The Issue of Diffusion among the Atlantic Creoles | location=London | publisher=Westminster University Press | pages=111–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isolates===
Some languages are [[language isolates]]. That is to say, they have no well accepted language family connection, no nodes in a family tree, and therefore no known ''Urheimat''. An example is the [[Basque language]] of Northern Spain and south west France. Nevertheless, it is a scientific fact that all languages evolve. An unknown ''Urheimat'' may still be hypothesized, such as that for a [[Proto-Basque]], and may be defended by archaeological and historical evidence.

Sometimes relatives are found for a language originally believed to be an isolate. An example is the [[Etruscan language]], which, even though only partially understood, is believed to be related to the [[Rhaetic language]] and to the [[Lemnian language]]. A single family may be an isolate. In the case of the non-Austronesian indigenous languages of Papua New Guinea and the indigenous languages of Australia, there is no published linguistic hypothesis supported by any evidence that these languages have links to any other families. Nevertheless, an unknown urheimat is implied. The entire Indo-European family itself is a language isolate: no further connections are known. This lack of information does not prevent some professional linguists from formulating additional hypothetical nodes ([[Nostratic]]) and additional homelands for the speakers.

This theory is mostly rejected.

=="Altaic"==
{{main|Altaic languages}}
{{see|Proto-Mongols|Proto-Turkic language}}
[[Mongols]] and [[Turkic peoples]] share a common geographic origin in the [[Mongolian Plateau]] of [[Inner Asia]]. Both groups expanded westward founding vast semi-[[nomadic empires]], occasionally creating [[Turco-Mongol|a fusion of Turkic and Mongol culture]]. Medieval Europeans referred to the Turco-Mongol lands collectively as [[Tartary]].

Some historians suggest that the people associated with the [[Slab Grave culture]] were the direct ancestors of the [[Mongols]].&lt;ref name="Tumen"&gt;Tumen D., "Anthropology of Archaeological Populations from Northeast Asia [http://user.dankook.ac.kr/~oriental/Journal/pdf_new/49/11.pdf] page 25,27&lt;/ref&gt; Slab Grave cultural monuments are found in [[Mongolia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Northwest China]] ([[Xinjiang]] and [[Qilian Mountains]] etc.), [[Northeast China]], [[Lesser Khingan|Lesser Khingan Mountains]] and southern [[Siberia]]. The identity of the ethnic core of [[Xiongnu]] has been a subject of varied hypotheses and some scholars insisted on a [[Mongols|Mongolic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ts. Baasansuren "The scholar who showed the true Mongolia to the world", Summer 2010 vol.6 (14) ''Mongolica'', pp.40&lt;/ref&gt; Xiongnu Empire (209 BCE – 93 CE) became a dominant power on the steppes of [[Central Asia]]. They were active in regions of what is now southern Siberia, Mongolia, [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang Province]]. [[Genghis Khan]], starting around 1206 CE, waged a series of military campaigns that, together with campaigns by his successors, stretched from present-day [[Poland]] in the west to [[Korea]] in the east and from Siberia in the north to the [[Gulf of Oman]] and [[Vietnam]] in the south, after which the empire ultimately collapsed with little long lasting linguistic impact outside the core Mongolian area.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T.Allsen – Culture and conquest in Mongol Eurasia.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually withdrew back to its original ''Urheimat'', the [[Turkic migrations]] shifted the Turkic center of population and power westward to the [[Black Sea]] region.

Then, the Seljuk Turks from the 11th century invaded Anatolia, ultimately resulting in permanent Turkic settlement there and the establishment of the Turkish nation.

==Korean==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:History of Korea-576.png|thumb|Korea in 576 CE.]]
{{splitsection|Koreanic languages|date=February 2018}}
The Korean language is spoken in Korea and among emigrants from Korea.  Conservative historical linguists tend to classify the [[Korean language]] as a [[language isolate]], although other suggest a relationship to the proposed Altaic language family or to Japonic languages.

[[Old Korean]] is attested in Chinese histories, in the Three Kingdoms period of Korea (ca. 0 to 900 CE), when the [[Silla]] Kingdom (in Eastern Korea), [[Baekje]] Kingdom (in Southwestern Korea), and [[Goguryeo]] Kingdom (in Northern Korea) were simultaneously present on the Korean peninsula, although Korean was not a literary language until later; the hangul script of Korean was invented in the 15th century CE (the earlier [[Idu script]] dates to the 6th century CE).

There was a group of similar languages called the [[Buyeo languages]] in the northern Korean Peninsula and southern Manchuria and possibly Japan, which included, according to Chinese records, the languages of [[Buyeo language|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]], [[Baekje language|Baekje]], [[Dongye]], [[Okjeo]], —and possibly [[Gojoseon]], but was different from ancient Manchu languages like [[Mohe language|Mohe]] language.  [[Gojoseon]] was a kingdom in Northern Korea that is said by tradition to have been founded in 2333 BC (archaeological evidence and Chinese histories support a cultural civilization from around 1500 BCE and a kingdom fused from a federation of smaller states around the 7th century BCE), that was conquered by Han Dynasty China in 108 BC, and re-emerged from Chinese rule as the Kingdom Buyeo.  The Three Kingdoms era kingdoms of [[Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]] were successors to the Kingdom of Buyeo.  Dongye was a vassal state of Goguryeo in Northeast Korea founded in the 3rd-century BCE that was eventually absorbed by Goguryeo around the 5th century CE.  Okjeo was a minor state in Northern Korea to the North of Dongye that was a subordinate unit of Gojoseon from the 3rd century BCE to 108 BCE, then came under Han rule, and then was a subordinate state of Goguryeo.  None of these Buyeo language family kingdoms ever included the Kingdom of Silla, which was just a small kingdom on the Southern coast of Korea until the Three Kingdoms period during which it expanded and conquered the other two kingdoms.

Linguists including [[Christopher Beckwith]] argue for Japanese as a descendant of Goguryeo, and for Korean as a descendant of the Silla language, based on lexical similarities between Goguryeo and Japanese, and based upon Silla's ultimate triumph in the quest for political control of Korea. Other linguistists, including [[Kim Banghan]], [[Alexander Vovin]], and [[J. Marshall Unger]] argue that Japanese is related to the pre-Goguryeo language of the central and southern part of Korean peninsula, including what would become the Kingdom of Silla, and that Old Korean is Goguryeo with a pre-Goguryeo Japonic substrate, in part, because Japanese-like toponyms found in the historical homeland of Silla were also distributed in southern part of Korean peninsula, and are not found in the northern part of Korean peninsula or south-western Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Blažek, Václav. 2006. "Current progress in Altaic etymology." Linguistica Online, 30 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; None of the extinct languages is attested in writing well enough to reach definitive conclusions resolving the debate.

==Japonic==
{{splitsection|Japonic languages#Origins|date=February 2018}}
{{see|Classification of the Japonic languages}}
The [[Japonic languages]] are spoken in Japan and among emigrants from Japan and is attested in Japanese language writing from the 8th century CE, and in imperfect Chinese transcriptions from the late 5th century CE.  Conservative historical linguists tend to classify a small number of [[Japanese language]]s as a language family of their own.  The Ainu languages are a barely surviving family of languages or dialects that are spoken by indigenous populations on the island of Hokkaidō in what is now northern Japan as well as on the island of Sakhalin and the Kuril Archipelago in what is now the Russian Far East at the time of the oldest extant historical records concerning those islands.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

There are similarities between the Japanese language and the [[Korean language]] in lexicon and grammatical features, but there is dispute over whether these denote a common origin, or mere linguistic borrowing due to a [[sprachbund]] of neighboring languages that are adjacent to each other.  [[Samuel E. Martin]], [[Roy Andrew Miller]], and [[Sergei Starostin]] are linguists who have argued that they have common origins.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Samuel E.

University of Hawai'i Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis proposes that Japanese is a relative of the extinct languages spoken by the Buyeo-Goguryeo cultures of Korea, southern Manchuria, and Liaodong of which the best attested is the extinct language [[Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I. 2004. Koguryo: The Language of Japan's Continental Relatives: An Introduction to the Historical-Comparative Study of the Japanese-Koguryoic Languages. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I. 2006. "Methodological observations on some recent studies of the early ethnolinguistic history of Korea and vicinity." Altai Hakpo 16, 199–234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I. 2006b. "The ethnolinguistic history of the early Korean peninsula region: Japanese-Koguryoic and other languages in the Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla kingdoms." (page 33 ff.) Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies 2.2, 34–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
This proposal is attributed to [[Shinmura Izuru]], who proposed it in 1916.  Modern Korean, in contrast, according to proponents of this hypothesis, appears to have stronger connections the [[Silla language]], spoken in the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] (57 BCE – 935 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, whose similarity to the Goguryeo language is not clearly established.

The earliest Chinese historical records concerning the "Wa" in Japan indicate that they were fractured into many warring states.  But, modern Japanese dialects show a common origin, rather than a "bushy" one.  So, it is possible that there were many Yayoi dialects in the period before Old Japanese emerged, of which the dialect of the warring states that ended up prevailing politically as the Japanese state was unified superseded other early Yayoi languages or dialects.&lt;ref name="livjm1998"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jared |last=Diamond |date=June 1998 |title=Japanese Roots |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |volume=19 |number=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1998/jun/japaneseroots1455/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a new wave of immigration, probably from the Korean Peninsula some 2,300 years ago, of the [[Yayoi people]], the Jōmon were pushed into northern Japan. Genetic data suggest that modern Japanese are descended from both the Yayoi and the Jōmon. Tradition, as documented by the [[Nihon Shoki]], a legendary account of Japan's history, puts the date of the Yayoi arrival in Japan at 660 BCE.  Chinese historical records mention the existence of the Yayoi (called "Wa") starting in 57 BCE. The existing Japanese language has its origins at approximately this point in time, if not earlier (to the extent that Japanese derives primarily from either the language of the Bronze Age Yayoi people, as it existed prior to their arrival in Japan, or derives primarily from a language of the Jōmon at that point of time, rather than being a creole of some sort).  Skeletal remains suggests that the two cultures had fused into a group with a homogeneous physical appearance in Southern Japan by 250 CE.&lt;ref name="livjm1998"/&gt; It is possible that the Japanese language has roots related to the Ainu language, the historical language of the Yayoi, whatever that may have been, or could have been a creole of both.  It is also possible the Japanese has roots in a language spoken in Southern Japan that is lost and now unknown.&lt;ref name="livjm1998"/&gt;

[[File:Map of Republic of Ezo.png|thumb|Location of Ezo]]

The [[Ainu people]] are genetic descendants of the Jōmon, with some contribution from the Okhotsk people.&lt;ref&gt;Nakahori, Yutaka (2005). Y染色体からみた日本人 (Y Senshokutai kara Mita Nihonjin). Iwanami Science Library. {{ISBN|978-4-00-007450-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ainu languages]] that are now spoken by Ainu minorities in Hokkaidō; and were formerly spoken in southern and central Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands (an area also known as [[Ezo]]), and perhaps northern Honshū island by the [[Emishi]] people (until approximately 1000 CE), are associated with the founding [[Jōmon people]] of Japan from than 14,000 years ago or earlier, and the [[Satsumon culture]] of Hokkaidō, although the Ainu also had contact with the Paleo-Siberian [[Okhotsk culture]] whose modern descendants include the [[Nivkh people]] (whose original homeland was mostly occupied by the [[Tungusic peoples]]), which could have linguistically influenced the Ainu language.&lt;ref&gt;Chaussonnet, Valerie (1995) Native Cultures of Alaska and Siberia. Page 35. Arctic Studies Center. Washington, D.C. 112p. {{ISBN|1-56098-661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as a result of this important outside cultural influence, it is impossible to know with certainty how similar the language of the original language of the Jōmon people was to that spoken by the Ainu people today.  Some linguists have suggested other language family connections for the Ainu language: Shafer has suggested a distant connection to the Austroasiatic languages.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, R. (1965). "Studies in Austroasian II". Studia Orientalia 30 (5).&lt;/ref&gt;  Vovin, had viewed that suggestion as merely preliminary.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander (1993). A Reconstruction of Proto-Ainu. Leiden: Brill. {{ISBN|90-04-09905-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese linguist [[Shichirō Murayama]] tried to link Ainu to the Austronesian languages, which include the languages of the Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia through both vocabulary and cultural comparisons.  There is no consensus, however, that the Ainu languages have sources in any other known language, and the unique population genetics of the Ainu people support the hypothesis that they were largely isolated from the rest of the world for many thousands of years.

The [[Yayoi people]] had strong physical, genetic and cultural similarities to the Chinese during the [[Western Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE- 9 CE) in the [[Jiangsu]] province on China's Eastern Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:渡来系弥生人の故郷を中国に求めて |trans-title=Searching in China for the origin of the Yayoi people |work=Long Journey to Prehistorical Japan |language=Japanese |publisher=[[National Museum of Nature and Science]] (Japan) |url=http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html |accessdate=2013-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421054014/http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html |archivedate=2015-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yayoi also have strong cultural similarities to the Koreans of that time period.&lt;ref name="livjm1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.

[[File:East China Sea Map.jpg|thumb|Location of Ryukyu Islands]]

Some linguists, such as Turchin,&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.info"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Turchin |first1=Peter |last2=Peiros |first2=Ilia |last3=Gell-Mann |first3=Murray |title=Analyzing Genetic Connections between Languages by Matching Consonant Classes |url=http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/ConsClass.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; see a connection between Japanese and Korean and an [[Altaic]] language family or similar larger grouping of languages, with those speakers coming from an area North of Korea, based in part upon similarities in lexical roots.  The statistical method used by Turchin, however, would not discriminate between Jōmon and Yayoi sources for any Altaic linguistic affinities.  Turchin's analysis also did not look at the various proposed ancient predecessors of the Korean language in Korea or the relationship of those languages to any of the proto-Altaic languages, despite the fact that the hypothesis would require one of those ancient Korean peninsular languages to be intermediate between Japanese and one of the proto-Altaic languages.  Old Japanese when first attested had eight vowels, rather than the current five (which were lost within a century of the oldest preserved writings) which was close to the vowel system seen in Uralic and Altaic languages.&lt;ref&gt;大野 晋 (1982)『仮名遣いと上代語』(岩波書店)p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Old Japanese also had more grammatical similarity to Altaic languages than modern Japanese.

These classifications of the origins of Japanese language origins ignore significant borrowing from other languages in recent times.  Current estimates are that "wago" (i.e. words attributable to the original Yayoi language) make up 33.8% of the Japanese lexicon, that "kango" (i.e. words with roots borrowed from Chinese since the 5th century CE) make up 49.1% of Japanese words (and in addition, the Chinese ideograms used in the Japanese written language), that foreign words called gairaigo make up 8.8% of Japanese words, and that 8.3% of Japanese words are konshugo that draw upon multiple languages.&lt;ref&gt;新選国語辞典, 金田一京助, 小学館, 2001, {{ISBN|4-09-501407-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account attributes only a small number of words in modern Japanese to Ainu roots.

The six [[Ryukyuan languages]] spoken in the islands to the South of Japan, are descended from Proto-Japonic but are not mutually intelligble with Japanese with which they share about 72% of their words (or each other) and started to diverge from Japanese around the 7th century CE.  these islands were united in a Ryukyuan kingdom from 1429 CE (prior to that there were multiple divided kingdoms which were tributary states of China after 1372 CE); the kingdom was a tributary state of China until 1609 when it became a vassal state of Japan, until it was annexed by Japan in 1879.  These languages were then suppressed and while they have about a million native speakers, there are relatively few native speakers under the age of twenty.  They are effectively minority languages at this point due to the government's recognition of them as dialects.

==Uralic ==
[[File:European-late-neolithic-english.svg|thumb|right|400px|Neolithic period]]
{{splitsection|Uralic_peoples#Urheimat|date=February 2018}}
The [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] [[Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses|homeland]] is unknown. A possible focus is the [[Comb Ceramic Culture]] of ''ca'' 4200 – ''ca'' 2000 BCE (shown on the map to the right). This is suggested by the high language diversity around the middle [[Volga River]], where three highly distinct branches of the Uralic family, [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]], [[Mari language|Mari]], and [[Permic languages|Permic]], are located. Reconstructed plant and animal names (including [[spruce]], [[Siberian pine]], [[Siberian Fir]], [[Siberian larch]], [[Salix fragilis|brittle willow]], [[elm]], and [[hedgehog]]) are consistent with this location.  This is adjacent to the proposed homeland for Proto-Indo-European under the Kurgan hypothesis.

French anthropologist [[Bernard Sergent]], in ''La Genèse de l'Inde'' (1997),&lt;ref name="svabhinava.org"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sergent |first=Bernard |title=La Genèse de l'Inde |location=Paris |publisher=Payot |year=1997 |chapter=Dravidians and Melano-Indians |pages=45–84 |others=Translated from French by Visuvalingam, Sunthar |url=http://www.svabhinava.org/AITvsOIT/Sergent-AfroDravidian-frame.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Finno-Ugric (Uralic) may have a genetic source or have borrowed significantly from proto-Dravidian or a predecessor language of West African origins.

As noted below, many notable linguists have proposed that the [[Eskimo-Aleut languages]] and [[Uralic languages]] have a common origin, although there is no consensus that this connection is genuine. A [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] between Uralic and the Indo-European languages has also been proposed (see [[Indo-Uralic languages]]).

==Yeniseian ==
The [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] language family has been recently tied by linguist Edward Vajda to the Native American [[Na-Dene languages]] of North American (e.g. Navajo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dene–Yeniseic Symposium, University of Alaska Fairbanks, February 2008 |url=http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy2008.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526221250/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy2008.html |archivedate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a proposal named [[Dene-Yeniseian]]. Several well-known linguists have reviewed the hypothesis as favorable, although several linguists, such as [[Lyle Campbell]], still reject it.  This family of languages is sometimes described as [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]], a classification that rests on a belief that it represents a stratum of Siberian populations that preceded the speakers of the other modern languages of Siberia (mostly of the Indo-European and Altaic language families), possibly one that dates back to the Paleolithic era when North America was initially populated. However, ''Paleosiberian'' is usually considered a – negatively defined – collective term of convenience, not a genetic nor even areal grouping, similarly to ''[[Papuan languages|Papuan]]''. There is some evidence that the speakers of the Yeniseian languages (such as the [[Ket language]], which is the only surviving member of the moribund language family) migrated to their current homeland along the Yenisei River in Central Siberia from an area south of the Altai Mountains in the general vicinity of Mongolia or Northwest China within the last 2500 years or so (although there is no evidence that the Yeniseian languages are linguistically related to the Altaic languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vovin |first=Alexander |year=2000 |title=Did the Xiong-nu speak a Yeniseian language? |journal=Central Asiatic Journal |volume=44 |number=1 |pages=87–104 |jstor=41928223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander.

Other linguists have suggested, with far less widespread acceptance in the linguistics community, that the Yeniseian languages have a genetic relationship to one or more of the Caucasian languages and the Sino-Tibetan languages (such as Chinese).&lt;ref&gt;Starostin, Sergei A.

==Eurasian language isolates==
The only languages which are predominantly found in Europe, North Asia and South Asia and are not part of the language families above are the [[Basque language]] spoken in Northern Spain and Southwestern France, the three living language families of the [[Caucasus mountains]] (Northwest Caucasian, Northeast Caucasian and South Caucasian, with the first two sometimes proposed as members of a single North Caucasian language family), the [[Paleosiberian languages]] (the [[Yukaghir languages]] of Central Siberia, viewed by some linguists as a divergent branch of the Uralic languages;&lt;ref&gt;Collinder, Björn. Jukagirisch und Uralisch ('Yukaghir and Uralic') 1940.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinder, Björn. 1965. An Introduction to the Uralic Languages. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages]] of Eastern Siberia, a grouping which sometimes includes Yenesian language and the geographically adjacent, although sometimes treated as a language isolate, [[Nivkh language]]), and a few South Asian linguistic isolates, such as [[Burushaski]], spoken mostly in isolated pockets of Northern [[Pakistan]], and the two indigenous language families of the [[Andamanese people]] (Great Andamanese and Ongan), and perhaps [[Nihali]] (spoken in West Central India).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Trask, R.L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases, the languages are spoken in an area that is geographically compact, were spoken in that area at the time that they were first attested historically, and there is no definitive evidence of an origin for the languages in question outside the area where they are spoken now.

Joseph Greenberg and Stephen Wurm have both noted lexical similarities between the Great Andamanese language and the West Papuan languages. Wurm noted that the lexical similarities "are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances." There is no agreement, even between these two linguists, on a narrative that gave rise to these similarities.

Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo–Aleut in ''Language Relations Across Bering Strait'' (1998). He calls this proposed grouping [[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]].

There have been determined efforts by multiple linguists from at least the 19th century to link these languages to other language families, particularly in the case of the Basque language, where numerous connections to language families living and dead have been proposed by linguists.  Frequently, efforts to look for deeper linguistic origins of these languages will also attempt to integrate them into attested extinct languages of Europe, such as the [[Etruscan language]] of Northern Italy, the [[Ligurian (ancient language)|Ligurian language]] of Italy, the [[Lemnian language]] of the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] Island of [[Lemnos]], the [[Minoan language]] aka [[Linear A]] of ancient [[Crete]], the [[Sumerian language]] once spoken in [[Mesopotamia]] (which is the oldest attested written language), the language of the Indus River Valley civilization, the [[Elamite language]] of Iran, and the [[Hurrian language]] and [[Hattic language]] of [[Anatolia]]. None of these efforts has achieved wide support among linguists, although some have been viewed as sufficiently credible to receive serious consideration from multiple linguists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Ignacio Hualde, Joseba Lakarra, Robert Lawrence Trask (1995), Towards a history of the Basque language, p. 81.

[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map showing the distribution of the major language families represented in Africa.]]

==Khoisan==
The [[Khoisan]] [[click consonant|click]] languages of [[Africa]] do not form a language family and so do not, as a family, have a homeland. However, limited [[genetics|genetic]] evidence from some Khoisan-language speakers in southern Africa suggest an origin "along the [[East African Rift|African rift]] and a possible wider [[East Africa]]n range."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hammer |last2=Karafet, et al, |title=Hierarchical Patterns of Global Human Y-Chromosome Diversity |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=18 |pages=1189–1203 |year=2001 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/18/7/1189#T4 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003906|pmid=11420360  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Bushmen of the Kalahari who occupy the largest geographic region where click languages are spoken are viewed as a relict population far removed from the place where click languages probably originated. The [[Khoe languages]], [[Tuu languages]], [[Kx'a languages]], [[Hadza language]] and [[Sandawe language]] (the latter two being Tanzanian language isolates) are frequently grouped together in the catch all Khoisan categorization, despite the lack of a definitive recent common origin of these languages in a common language family. However, for the Khoe-[[Kwadi language|Kwadi]] group, a more recent origin by immigration from East Africa (around the beginning of the Christian Era) has been suggested by Tom Güldemann, based on his observation of similarities with Sandawe.

==Afro-Asiatic ==
{{Main|Afro-Asiatic Urheimat}}

The Afro-Asiatic languages include [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Berber language|Berber]], and a variety of other languages now found mostly in Northeast Africa, although the exact boundaries of this language family are disputed in the case of a small number of languages spoken by small numbers of individuals in a few localized areas of Sudan and East Africa.

The limited area of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] Sprachraum (prior to its expansion to new areas in the historic era) has limited the potential areas where that family's urheimat could be. Generally speaking, two proposals have been developed: that Afro-Asiatic arose in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] urheimat in the Middle East aka Southwest Asia, or that Afro-Asiatic languages arose in northeast Africa (generally, either between [[Darfur]] and [[Tibesti]] or in [[Ethiopia]] and the other countries of the [[Horn of Africa]]). The African hypothesis is considered to be rather more likely at the present time, because of the greater diversity of languages with more distant relationships to each other there.

There have been serious linguistic proponents of almost every conceivable possible set of relationships of the Afro-Asiatic language subfamilies to each other, although there is reasonably great consensus concerning the subfamily classification of all but a few of the Afro-Asiatic languages.  Some of this difficulty in resolving the Afro-Asiatic family tree flows from the time depth of these languages.  The Afro-Asiatic [[Egyptian language]] of ancient Egypt (whose latest stage is known as Coptic) is one of the two oldest written languages on Earth (the other being the [[Sumerian language]], a [[language isolate]]) dating in written form to approximately 3000 BCE, and the Semitic [[Akkadian language]] was also attested in writing from a very early date (ca. 2000 BCE).  A common Afro-Asiatic proto-language is necessarily older than these very old written languages which belonged to language families that had already diverged from each other considerably by that point.  There is also no one genetic profile that is uniform among Afro-Asiatic language speakers that clearly unites them.  There are also competing theories on whether the Afro-Asiatic language family owes its expansion to the Neolithic revolution that originated in an area that includes the range of the Afro-Asiatic language, or was already widespread in the Upper Paleolithic era.  Notably, the Afro-Asiatic language family is spoken in most of the places that are leading candidates for the origins of the modern human species and most of intermediate species between modern humans and the Great Apes in human evolution.

===Semitic ===
{{Main|Proto-Semitic language#Homeland}}
There has been speculation regarding the specific [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] subfamily of Afro-Asiatic languages, again with the Horn of Africa and Southwest Asia—specifically the [[Levant]]—being the most common proposals. The large number of Semitic languages present in the Horn of Africa seems at first glance to support the hypothesis that the Semitic homeland lies there. However, the Semitic languages in the Horn of Africa all belong to the [[South Semitic languages|South Semitic]] subfamily and appear to all have relatively recent common origins in a single Ethio-Semitic proto-language, while the [[East Semitic languages|East]] and [[Central Semitic languages]] are native solely to Asia. These features, and the presence of certain common Semitic lexical items in all Ethio-Semitic languages referring to items that arrived in Africa from the Levant at a time after Semitic languages were known to have been spoken in the Levant, have lent weight to the Levantine proposal.

Hebrew is relatively closely related to the [[Arabic language]] even within the Semitic language family, being part of the same Central Semitic group.

The [[Maltese language]], the only other Semitic language of Europe, is a derivative of the [[Sicilian Arabic|Arabic language]] as it was spoken in Sicily starting sometime after the rise of the Islamic empire in North Africa.

==Nilo-Saharan ==

Genetic studies of [[Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking populations are in general agreement with archaeological evidence and linguistic studies that argue for a Nilo-Saharan homeland in eastern [[Sudan]] before 6000 BCE, with subsequent migration events northward to the eastern Sahara, westward to the [[Chad Basin]], and southeastward into [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Michael C. Campbell and Sarah A. Tishkoff, "The Evolution of Human Genetic and Phenotypic Variation in Africa," ''Current Biology'', Volume 20, Issue 4, R166–R173, 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist Roger Blench has suggested that the Nilo-Saharan languages and the Niger–Congo languages may be branches of the same macro–language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Blench |title=KORDOFANIAN and Niger–Congo: NEW AND REVISED LEXICAL EVIDENCE" (Draft) |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Kordofanian/Kordofanian%20and%20Niger-Congo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blench, R.M. 1995, 'Is Niger–Congo simply a branch of Nilo-Saharan?' In: Proceedings of the Fifth Nilo-Saharan Linguistics Colloquium, Nice, 1992. ed. R. Nicolai and F. Rottland. 68–118. Köln: Rudiger Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier proposals along this line were made by linguist Edgar Gregersen in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregersen | first1 = Edgar A | year = 1972 | title = Kongo-Saharan | url = | journal = Journal of African Linguistics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 46–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals have not reached a linguistic consensus, however, and this connection presupposes that all of the Nilo-Saharan languages are actually related in a single family, which has not been definitively established.

[[Razib Khan]], based on analysis of the autosomal genetics of the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group of Africa, suggests that "the Tutsi were in all likelihood once a Nilotic speaking population, who switched to the language of the Bantus amongst whom they settled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Razib |last=Khan |title=Tutsi probably differ genetically from the Hutu |date=August 29, 2011 |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/tutsi-differ-genetically-from-the-hutu/#more-13708  |accessdate=September 12, 2011 |work=Gene Expression |publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Razib |last=Khan |title=Tutsi genetic, ii |date=August 31, 2011 |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/tutsi-genetics-ii/ |accessdate=September 12, 2011 |work=Gene Expression |publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niger–Congo ==
{{Main|Niger–Congo homeland}}
The homeland of the [[Niger–Congo]] languages, which has as its subfamily the [[Benue–Congo]] languages, which in turn includes the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, is not known in time or place, beyond the fact that it probably originated in or near the area where these languages were spoken prior to [[Bantu expansion]] (i.e. West Africa or Central Africa) and probably predated the Bantu expansion of ca. 3000 BCE by many thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Jared Diamond 2000"&gt;Jared Diamond, "Guns, Germs and Steel" (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Its expansion may have been associated with the expansion of Sahel agriculture in the African Neolithic period.&lt;ref name="Jared Diamond 2000"/&gt;

According to linguist [[Roger Blench]], as of 2004, all specialists in Niger–Congo languages believe the languages to have a common origin, rather than merely constituting a typological classification, for reasons including their shared noun-class system, their shared verbal extensions and their shared basic lexicon.&lt;ref name="rogerblench.info"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blench |first=Roger |year=2004 |title=THE BENUE-CONGO LANGUAGES: A PROPOSED INTERNAL CLASSIFICATION (Unpublished Working Draft) |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/BC/General/Benue-Congo%20classification%20latest.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Bendor-Samuel, J. ed. 1989.

Boston University Papers in African History, 1:1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; But, there has been active debate for many decades over the appropriate subclassifications of the languages in that language family, which is a key tool used in localizing a language's place of origin.&lt;ref name="rogerblench.info"/&gt; No definitive "Proto-Niger–Congo" lexicon or grammar has been developed for the language family as a whole.

An important unresolved issue in determining the time and place where the Niger–Congo languages originated and their range prior to recorded history is this language family's relationship to the [[Kordofanian languages]] now spoken in the Nuba mountains of [[Sudan]], which is not contiguous with the remainder of the Niger–Congo language speaking region and is at the northeasternmost extent of the current Niger–Congo linguistic region.  The current prevailing linguistic view is that Kordofanian languages are part of the Niger–Congo language family, and that among the many languages still surviving in that region these may be the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Bell. 1995. The Nuba Mountains: Who Spoke What in 1976?. (The published results from a major project of the Institute of African and Asian Studies: the Language Survey of the Nuba Mountains.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence is insufficient to determine if this outlier group of Niger–Congo language speakers represent a prehistoric range of a Niger–Congo linguistic region that has since contracted as other languages have intruded, or if instead, this represents a group of Niger–Congo language speakers who migrated to the area at some point in prehistory where they were an isolated linguistic community from the beginning.

The prehistoric range for the Niger–Congo languages has implications, not just for the history of the Niger–Congo languages, but for the origins of the Afro-Asiatic languages and Nilo-Saharan languages whose homelands have been hypothesized by some to overlap with the Niger–Congo linguistic range prior to recorded history.  If the consensus view regarding the origins of the Nilo-Saharan languages which came to East Africa is adopted, and a North African or Southwest Asian origin for Afro-Asiatic languages is assumed, the linguistic affiliation of East Africa prior to the arrival of Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic languages is left open.  The overlap between the potential areas of origin for these languages in East Africa is particularly notable because includes the regions from which the Proto-Eurasians who brought anatomically modern humans Out of Africa, and presumably their original proto-language or languages originated.

However, there is more agreement regarding the place of origin of the [[Benue–Congo]] subfamily of languages, which is the largest subfamily of the group, and the place of origin of the Bantu languages and the time at which it started to expand is known with great specificity.

The classification of the relatively divergent family of [[Ubangian languages]] which are centered in the Central African Republic, as part of the Niger–Congo language family where Greenberg classified them in 1963 and subsequently scholars concurred,&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Kay &amp; Blench, Roger (2000) 'Niger–Congo', in Heine, Bernd &amp; Nurse, Derek (eds.) African languages: an introduction, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was called into question, by linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal in a 2008 article.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Dimmendaal (2008) "Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent", Language and Linguistics Compass 2/5:841.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Blench]], relying particularly on prior work by Professor [[Kay Williamson]] of the University of Port Harcourt, and the linguist P. De Wolf, who each took the same position, has argued that a [[Benue–Congo]] linguistic subfamily of the Niger–Congo language family, which includes the Bantu languages and other related languages and would be the largest branch of Niger–Congo, is an empirically supported grouping which probably originated at the confluence of the Benue and Niger Rivers in Central Nigeria.&lt;ref name="rogerblench.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, K. 1971.

A proposed new classification of Benue–Congo languages. Afrikanische Arbeitspapiere,
Köln, 17:115–147.&lt;/ref&gt;  These estimates of the place of origin of the Benue-Congo language family do not fix a date for the start of that expansion other than that it must have been sufficiently prior to the Bantu expansion to allow for the diversification of the languages within this language family that includes Bantu.

There is a widespread consensus among linguistic scholars that [[Bantu languages]] of the Niger–Congo family have a homeland near the coastal boundary of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], prior to a rapid expansion from that homeland starting about 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jared Diamond 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J.H. 1972.

Linguistic, archeological and genetic evidence also indicates that during the course of the Bantu expansion, "independent waves of migration of western African and East African Bantu-speakers into southern Africa occurred."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In some places, Bantu language, genetic evidence suggests that Bantu language expansion was largely a result of substantial population replacement.&lt;ref name="plosgenetics.org"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=E. |last2=Laval |first2=G |last3=Barreiro |first3=L.

For example, one study found this to be the case in Bantu language speakers who are African [[Pygmies]] or are in [[Mozambique]],&lt;ref name="plosgenetics.org"/&gt; while another population genetic study found this to be the case in the Bantu language speaking [[Lemba people|Lemba]] of [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Spurdle |first1=A.

==Sino-Tibetan ==
{{splitsection|Sino-Tibetan homeland|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Sino-tibetan languages.png|thumb|right|280px|The Sino-Tibetan languages]]
According to the ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' project of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (2011), the Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST) homeland may have been in the general area in the east of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Regarding the time depth of Sino-Tibetan separation, they estimate an age of at least 6,000 years, comparable to the age of [[Proto-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;"where the great rivers of East and Southeast Asia (including the [[Yellow River|Yellow]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]], [[Mekong River|Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], [[Salween River|Salween]], and [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]]) have their source. The time of hypothetical ST unity, when the Proto-Han (= Proto-[[Sinitic languages|Chinese]]) and Proto-[[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] (PTB) peoples formed a relatively undifferentiated linguistic community, must have been at least as remote as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] period, perhaps around 4000 B.C." {{cite web |title=The Sino-Tibetan Language Family |work=Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |url=http://stedt.berkeley.edu/html/STfamily.html#TBlg |date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars place the Tibeto-Burman homeland in the area encompassing western [[Sichuan]], northern [[Yunnan]] and eastern [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;George van Driem, "Language change, conjugational morphology and the Sino-Tibetan Urheimat,"(1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetic evidence, favors an origin for Proto-Sino-Tibetan languages in the upper and middle [[Yellow River]] basin, with part of that source population branching off to settle in the Himalayas, with the split of the population that would provide the genesis of the Chinese language from the population that would provide the genesis of the larger Sino-Tibetan language family in the East Asian Neolithic era:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=B |last2=Zhang |first2=Y-B |last3=Zhang |first3=F |last4=Lin |first4=H |last5=Wang |first5=X |last6=Wan |first6=Ning |last7=Ye |first7=Zhenqing |last8=Weng |first8=Haiyu |last9=Zhang |first9=Lili |last10=Li |first10=Xin |last11=Yan |first11=Jiangwei |last12=Wang |first12=Panpan |last13=Wu |first13=Tingting |last14=Cheng |first14=Longfei |last15=Wang |first15=Jing |last16=Wang |first16=Duen-Mei |last17=Ma |first17=Xu |last18=Yu |first18=Jun |displayauthors=3 |year=2011 |title=On the Origin of Tibetans and Their Genetic Basis in Adapting High-Altitude Environments |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=e17002 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017002 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017002 |pmid=21386899 |pmc=3046130|bibcode=2011PLoSO...617002W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he closest relatives of the Tibetans are the [[Yi people]], who live in the [[Hengduan Mountains]] and were originally formed through fusion with natives along their migration routes into the mountains. The Tibetan and Yi languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman language group and their ancestries can be traced back to an ancient tribe, the Di-Qiang . . . After the ancestors of Sino-Tibetans reached the upper and middle Yellow River basin, they divided into two subgroups: Proto-Tibeto-Burman and Proto-Chinese. . . . The ancestral component which was dominant in Tibetan and Yi arose from the Proto-Tibeto-Burman subgroup, which marched on to south-west China and later, through one of its branches, became the ancestor of modern Tibetans. Proto-Tibeto-Burmans also spread over the Hengduan Mountains where the Yi have lived for hundreds of generations. Taking the optimal living condition and the easiest migration route into account, we favor the single-route hypothesis; it is more likely that their migration into the Tibetan Plateau through the Hengduan Mountain valleys occurred after Tibetan ancestors separated from the other Proto-Tibeto-Burman groups and diverged to form the modern Tibetan population."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the earliest [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic cultures of China]] in the upper to middle Yellow River basin was the [[Peiligang culture]] of 7000 BCE to 5000 BCE, so the population genetic reference in the quoted material is to a date on or after this time period.  The Neolithic era concluded in the Yellow River around 1500 BCE.  This is not inconsistent with the linguistically based estimate from the Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus project.  By the early and middle [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 BCE–256 BCE), the language spoken in the Zhou court had become the standardized dialect for that kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Schirokauer &amp; Brown 2006. "A Brief history of Chinese civilization: second edition" Wadsworth, a division of Thomson Learning, pp. 25–47&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, four of the other main language families of East Asia and Southeast Asia outside the Sino-Tibetan language family, [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], are generally believed to have at origins at some stage of their development in [[Southern China]].

==Austroasiatic ==
{{splitsection|Austroasiatic languages|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Austroasiatic-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Austroasiatic languages]]
The homeland of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] languages (e.g. [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]]) which are found from [[Southeast Asia]] to [[India]] is hypothesized to be located "the hills of southern [[Yunnan]] in [[China]]," between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sidwell |first=Pascale |title=Austroasiatic Languages |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/austroasiatic-languages-ema-01/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121120754/http://www.bookrags.com/research/austroasiatic-languages-ema-01/ |archivedate=2012-01-21 |work=[[BookRags]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with influences from [[Indo-Aryan languages|Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] languages at the Western edge of its expanse in India, and influence from [[Sinitic languages|Chinese]] at the Eastern edge of the regions where it is found. The disjoint distribution of Austroasiatic languages suggests that they were once spoken in most of the areas where the [[Tai–Kadai languages]] are now dominant.

However, [[Paul Sidwell]] has recently advocated a homeland in Southeast Asia instead,&lt;ref name="sidwell seminar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sidwell|first=Paul|title=Seminar: "A SEAsian homeland for the Austroasiatic Languages"|url=http://linguistics.hss.ntu.edu.sg/AboutLMS/newsevents/Pages/A_SEAsianHomelandForTheAustroasiatic%20Languages.aspx|accessdate=2 August 2011|authorlink=Paul Sidwell|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring a late date of dispersal of about 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name="sidwell abstract"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sidwell|first=Paul|title=Family Diversity and the Austroasiatic Homeland|url=http://icaal.org/abstract/sidwell-family.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011|authorlink=Paul Sidwell|format=PDF|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong correlation between the population genetic distribution Y-Chromosomal [[haplogroup O-M95 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup O2a1-M95]] and the distribution of Austroasiatic language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Vikrant et al., Y-chromosome evidence suggests a common paternal heritage of Austroasiatic populations, BMC Evol Biol. 2007, 7: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hmong–Mien ==
The most likely homeland of the [[Hmong–Mien languages]] (aka Miao–Yao languages) is in [[Southern China]] between the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Mekong River|Mekong]] rivers, but speakers of these languages may have migrated from [[Central China]] either as part of the [[Han Chinese]] expansion or as a result of exile from an original homeland by Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, "Stratification in the peopling of China: how far does the linguistic evidence match genetics and archaeology?," Paper for the Symposium "Human migrations in continental East Asia and Taiwan: genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence". Geneva June 10–13, 2004. Université de Genève.&lt;/ref&gt;  Migration of people speaking these languages from South China to [[Southeast Asia]] took place ca. 1600–1700 CE.  Ancient [[DNA]] evidence suggests that the ancestors of the speakers of the Hmong–Mien languages were a population genetically distinct from that of the Tai–Kadai and Austronesian language source populations at a location on the [[Yangtze River]].&lt;ref name=pmid17657509/&gt; Recent Y-DNA phylogeny evidence supports the proposition that people who speak the Hmong-Mien languages are descended from the population that now speaks Austroasiatic Mon-Khmer languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cai |first1=X |last2=Qin |first2=Z |last3=Wen |first3=B |last4=Xu |first4=S |last5=Wang |first5=Y |last6=Lu |first6=Y |last7=Wei |first7=L |last8=Wang |first8=C |last9=Li |first9=S |last10=Huang |first10=X |last11=Jin |first11=L |last12=Li |first12=H |last13=Genographic |first13=Consortium |year=2011 |title=Human Migration through Bottlenecks from Southeast Asia into East Asia during Last Glacial Maximum Revealed by Y Chromosomes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=8 |page=e24282 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024282 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024282 |pmid=21904623 |pmc=3164178|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624282C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austronesian ==
{{main|Austronesian homeland}}
[[File:Migraciones austronesias.png|thumb|right|300px|The Austronesian Expansion]]

The homeland of the [[Austronesian languages]] is widely accepted by linguists to be in what is now [[Taiwan]]. On this island the deepest divisions in Austronesian are found, among the families of the native [[Formosan languages]]. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999}}, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten primary branches of the Austronesian language family.  [[Bernard Comrie|Comrie]] (2001:28) noted this when he wrote:

{{quote|... the internal diversity among the... Formosan languages... is greater than that in all the rest of Austronesian put together, so there is a major [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] split within Austronesian between Formosan and the rest... Indeed, the genetic diversity within Formosan is so great that it may well consist of several primary branches of the overall Austronesian family.}}

Archaeological evidence (e.g., {{Harvnb|Bellwood|1997}}) suggests that speakers of pre-Proto-Austronesian spread from the [[Northern and southern China|South Chinese]] mainland to Taiwan at some time around 6000 BCE. Evidence from [[historical linguistics]] suggests that it is from this island that [[seafaring]] peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages {{Harvcol |Diamond|2000}}. It is believed that this migration began around 4000 BCE {{Harvcol |Blust|1999}}. However, evidence from historical linguistics cannot bridge the gap between those two periods.

It is possible that the ancient Taiwan aborigines were related to the ancient [[Minyue]], derived in ancient times from the southeast coast of Mainland China, as suggested by linguists Li Jen-Kuei and Robert Blust. It is suggested that in the southeast coastal regions of China, there were many sea nomads during the Neolithic era and they may have spoken ancestral Austronesian languages, and were skilled seafarers.

The specific origins of most far flung member of this language family, the [[Malagasy language]] of [[Madagascar]] off the coast of Africa, are described above in the part of this article concerning African languages.

The [[Austro-Tai]] hypothesis suggests a common origin for the Austronesian languages and the [[Tai–Kadai]] languages whose hypothesized place of origin is geographically close to Taiwan.

The [[Malagasy language]] of [[Madagascar]] is not related to nearby African languages, instead being the westernmost member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. The similarity between Malagasy and Malay and Javanese was noted as long ago as 1708 by the Dutch scholar Adriaan van Reeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blench |first=Roger |year=2007 |title=New palaeozoogeographical evidence for the settlement of Madagascar |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology/Indian%20Ocean/Blench%20final%20Azania%202007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy is related to the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] languages of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]], and more closely with the Southeast [[Barito languages|Barito group of languages]] spoken in [[Borneo]] except for its [[Polynesian language|Polynesian]] morphophonemics.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann, Henri (1972).

==Tai–Kadai==
[[File:Taikadai-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Tai–Kadai languages today]]
Many scholars have addressed the question of the origins of the [[Tai–Kadai languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurgood, G. (1994). "Tai–Kadai and Austronesian: the nature of the relationship." Oceanic Linguistics 33.345–368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger (2004). "Stratification in the peopling of China: how far does the linguistic evidence match genetics and archaeology?" (PDF) Paper for the Symposium : Human migrations in continental East Asia and Taiwan: genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. Geneva, June 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr. M. (1986). Austro-Tai *Tsum(b)anget 'spirit' and [[Archaic Chinese]] *XmwângXmwet 恍惚 'bliss'. Tōkyō: Tōkyō Gaikokugo Daigaku.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui (2005). Genetic structure of Austro-Tai populations. PhD Thesis of Human Biology, Fudan University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench &amp; Alicia Sanchez-Mazas, eds. The Peopling of East Asia: Putting Together Archaeology, Linguistics and Genetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a consensus that the Tai–Kadai languages have their origins in [[Southern China]] or on major nearby islands (such as [[Taiwan]] or [[Hainan]]).  The leading hypothesis is that the likely homeland of proto-[[Tai–Kadai]] was coastal [[Fujian]] or [[Guangdong]]. The spread of the Tai–Kadai peoples may have been aided by [[agriculture]], but any who remained near the coast were eventually absorbed by the [[Chinese people|Chinese]].  Weera Ostapirat is one academic who articulates this position.&lt;ref&gt;Ostapirat, Weera. 2005. "Kra–Dai and Austronesian: Notes on phonological correspondences and vocabulary distribution."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Sagart]], on the other hand, holds that Tai–Kadai is a branch of Austronesian which migrated back to the mainland from northeastern Taiwan long after Taiwan was settled, but probably before the expansion of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] out of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Sagart, Laurent. (2002). "Sino-Tibeto-Austronesian: An updated and improved argument." (PDF) Paper presented at Ninth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics (ICAL9). 8–11 January 2002. Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sagart, L. 2004. "The higher phylogeny of Austronesian and the position of Tai–Kadai." Oceanic Linguistics 43. 411–440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sagart, Laurent 2005. "Sino-Tibetan–Austronesian: an updated and improved argument." Laurent Sagart, Roger Blench &amp; Alicia Sanchez-Mazas, eds. The Peopling of East Asia: Putting Together Archaeology, Linguistics and Genetics. London: Routledge Curzon, pp. 161–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The language was then largely [[relexification|relexified]] from what he believes may have been an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language.  Sagart suggests that [[Austro-Tai languages|Austro-Tai]] is ultimately related to the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] and has its origin in the [[Neolithic]] communities of the coastal regions of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[North China]] or [[East China]].

Ostapirat, by contrast, sees connections with the Austroasiatic languages (in [[Austric languages|Austric]]), as has Benedict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benedict | first1 = Paul K | year = 1942 | title = Thai, Kadai and Indonesian: a new alignment in south east Asia | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 576–601 | doi=10.1525/aa.1942.44.4.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Paul K. (1975). Austro-Thai language and culture, with a glossary of roots. New Haven: HRAF Press. {{ISBN|0-87536-323-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Paul K. (1990). Japanese/Austro-Tai. Ann Arbor: Karoma. {{ISBN|0-89720-078-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid notes that the two approaches are not incompatible, if Austric is valid and can be connected to Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;* Reid, LA (2006). "Austro-Tai Hypotheses". Pp. 609–610 in Keith Brown (editor in chief), The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Blust]] (1999) suggests that proto-Tai–Kadai speakers originated in the northern [[Philippines]] and migrated from there to Hainan (hence the diversity of Tai–Kadai languages on that island), and were radically restructured following contact with Hmong–Mien and [[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]].  However, Ostapirat maintains that Tai–Kadai could not descend from Malayo-Polynesian in the Philippines, and likely not from the languages of eastern Taiwan either. His evidence is in the Tai–Kadai sound correspondences, which reflect Austronesian distinctions that were lost in Malayo-Polynesian and even [[Eastern Formosan]].

==Oceania==
{{see|Australian Aboriginal languages}}
The only language isolates or language families predominantly spoken in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania that do not belong to one of the language families above are the indigenous languages of Melanesia (which number more than eight hundred or more in perhaps sixty language families), which are described with a geographic term that does not presume a genetic relationship between them as the [[Papuan languages]], and the [[Australian aboriginal languages]] (of which there are about one hundred and fifty remaining in about ten language families, all of which, except the languages of the [[Pama–Nyungan languages]] are largely confined to the central Northern coast of Australia).  No linguists have found a language family connection between indigenous Papuan and Australian aboriginal languages and those of Asia, Africa, the Americas or any other part of the world.  Indeed, no linguistic connection has been established between the indigenous languages of Melanesia and the indigenous languages of the Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. 2002. Australian Languages: Their Nature and Development. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  This is consistent with the mainstream view, supported by population genetics and archaeology, that Papua New Guinea and Australia, as well as some of the islands neighboring Papua New Guinea, were first inhabited by hominins (humans or otherwise) at least 40,000 years ago in migrations that were either separate or swiftly segregated, and that many of these populations have had only limited contact with outside populations until the modern era.  While there are plausible reasons to infer that the Melanesian languages and the aboriginal Australian languages, respectively, have common origins in a small founding population with a single language, the linguists have not been able to marshal lexical, phonetic and grammatical evidence from these languages in their current form to support these inferences.

===Na-Dene===

[[File:Na-Dene langs.png|thumb|Area of the Na-Dene languages]]

Since 2008, linguist [[Edward Vajda]] has been advocating, and attempting to demonstrate, a genetic link between the [[Na-Dene languages]] of North America and the [[Yeniseian languages]] of central Siberia, suggesting a homeland in [[Siberia]] or a back migration of Na-Dene speakers from [[Beringia]].  Na-Dene languages are spoken by Native Alaskans and some people from the [[First Nations]] of Western [[Canada]], in the Pacific Northwest, and also includes the [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] spoken in the American Southwest (e.&amp;nbsp;g., the languages [[Apache language|Apache]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]). The proposal, which does not originate with Vajda but is considerably older, is not generally accepted among linguists.{{According to whom|date=August 2015}}

===Eskimo-Aleut===

The [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] are spoken by native peoples of the Arctic regions of [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]] and [[Greenland]], generally to the North of Na-Dene linguistic areas (shown on the map on the left).

[[File:Eskimo-Aleut langs.png|left|thumb|Eskimo-Aleut languages]]

Current ancient and modern DNA scholarship and archaeology supports a three-layer paradigm in which first the [[Saqqaq]] (Arctic [[Paleo-Eskimo]]s) which was present 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE, then the [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] (second wave Arctic Paleo-Eskimos), and finally the [[Thule]] (proto-Inuit) from ca. 500 CE – 1000&amp;nbsp;CE, successively sweep Arctic North America while having little genetic impact on Native American populations further South, that presumably have origins that date back to the initial colonization of the Americas by modern humans from Asia (who are the first hominins to live there), and ancient DNA shows genetic continuity from the Thule to modern Inuit (whose genetics are remarkably homogeneous), dominated by the A2a, A2b, and D3 mtDNA haplotypes, while "Haplotype D2 (3%), found among modern Aleut and Siberian Eskimos, was identified at a low frequency in the modern samples but not the ancient. This haplotype was recently identified in an ancient Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual from western Greenland. . . . Whole genomic sequencing of the 4,000-year-old PaleoEskimo, "Inuk," indicated that the Saqqaq sequences clustered with the Chukchi and Koryaks of Siberia-suggesting an earlier migration from Siberia along the northern slope of Alaska to Greenland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comparing Ancient and Modern DNA Variability in Human Populations |publisher=International Conference in Porto, Portugal (November 2011), Michael H. Crawford, "Current developments in molecular and population genetics of contemporary and ancient Aleut and Eskimo populations"; Maanasa Raghavan, "Prehistoric migrations into the New World High-Arctic: A genetic perspective"; Justin Tackney, "Ancient and modern genetic diversity of Iñupiat populations from the Alaskan North Slope: insights into Paleo- and Neo-Eskimo origins" |url=http://www.mnhn.fr/mnhn/ecoanthropologie/Porto2011/Porto2011_program.html#CRAWFORD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence such as bronze artifacts produced in East Asia from ca. 1000 CE, further supports a proto-Eskimo-Aleut arrival in the polar regions of North America ca. 500 CE – 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Bronze Artifact from East Asia Unearthed at Alaska Archaeology Site |work=Science Daily |date=Nov 14, 2011 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111114112314.htm |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wakashan langs.png|thumb|Wakashan languages]]
The proto-Eskimo-Aleut migration to North America, associated with the Thule expansion in North America ca. 500 CE, took place much more recently than the initial human population of North America, which took place more than 14,000 years ago.  Also, the modern [[Inuit]] populations are genetically distinct from other indigenous populations of the Americas.  Thus, evidence from genetics and archaeology strongly supports an East Asian origin for Eskimo-Aleut languages sometime in the last 1500 years that is distinct from most other indigenous languages of the Americas.  But there is no linguistic consensus on any particular languages of East Asia with which this family of North American languages is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleming | first1 = Harold C | year = 1987 | title = Towards a definitive classification of the world's languages | url = | journal = Diachronica | volume = 4 | issue = 1/2| pages = 159–223 | doi=10.1075/dia.4.1-2.09fle}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is entirely possible that Eastern Siberian languages most closely ancestral to Eskimo-Aleut are extinct.  Many indigenous languages and cultures of this region have died in the face of expanded Russian cultural and national influence starting in the 18th century.

[[Michael Fortescue]] in 1998 proposed a group of [[Uralo-Siberian languages]], in which [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] were related to Eskimo-Aleut languages supported by lexical correspondences and grammatical similarities, expanding upon a proposal of [[Morris Swadesh]] in 1962 that itself reiterates similarities that have been noted since at least 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Swadesh, "Linguistic relations across the Bering Strait" ''American Anthropologist'' 64, 1262–1291 (1962); Michael Fortescue, ''Language Relations across Bering Strait: Reappraising the Archaeological and Linguistic Evidence''. London and New York: Cassell. {{ISBN|0-304-70330-3}} (1998); see also Knut Bergsland, "The Eskimo–Uralic Hypothesis" Journal de la Societé finno-ougrienne 61, 1–29 (1959); Seefloth, Uwe "Die Entstehung polypersonaler Paradigmen im Uralo-Siberischen" ''Zentralasiatische Studien'' 30, 163–191 (2000); Greenberg, Joseph H., "Review of Michael Fortescue, Language Relations across Bering Strait: Reappraising the Archaeological and Linguistic Evidence." ''Review of Archaeology'' 21.2, 23–24 (2000); Künnap, A. "Indo-European-Uralic-Siberian Linguistic and Cultural Contacts." Tartu, Estonia: University of Tartu, Division of Uralic languages (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  Fortescue argues that the Uralo-Siberian proto-language (or a complex of related proto-languages) may have been spoken by [[Mesolithic]] hunting and fishing people in south-central Siberia (roughly, from the upper [[Yenisei]] river to [[Lake Baikal]]) between 8000 and 6000 BCE, and that the proto-languages of the derived families may have been carried northward out of this homeland in several successive waves down to about 4000 BCE, leaving the Samoyedic branch of [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] in occupation of the urheimat thereafter.

A 2005 proposal by Holst, also reiterating a proposal of Swadesh from 1962, suggests that the [[Wakashan languages]] (map on right) spoken in British Columbia around and on Vancouver Island, are part of the same language family as the Eskimo-Aleut languages.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Henrik 2005. Einführung in die eskimo-aleutischen Sprachen. Hamburg: Buske.&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposal, if accurate, would suggest that Na-Dene languages may have arrived in North America after (although not long after) Eskimo-Aleut languages.

Phonologically, the Eskimo–Aleut languages resemble other languages of northern North America and far eastern Siberia.

===Uto-Aztecan===
{{main|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}
[[File:Uto-Aztecan langs.png|thumb|right|Uto-Aztecan languages]]
Some authorities on the history of the Uto-Aztecan language group place its homeland in the border region between the USA and Mexico, namely the upland regions of Arizona and New Mexico and the adjacent areas of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, shown on the map (below left) roughly corresponding to the [[Sonoran Desert]]. The proto-language would have been spoken by foragers, about 5,000 years ago. [[Jane H. Hill|Hill]] (2001) proposes instead a homeland further south, making the assumed speakers of Proto-Uto-Aztecan maize cultivators in [[Mesoamerica]], who were gradually pushed north, bringing maize cultivation with them, during the period of roughly 4,500 to 3,000 years ago, the geographic diffusion of speakers corresponding to the breakup of linguistic unity.&lt;ref&gt;Jane H. Hill, "Proto-Uto-Aztecan", American Anthropologist, 2001. {{JSTOR|684121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tupian===
[[File:Tupi languages.png|left|thumb|Tupi languages]]
[[Tupian languages]] are predominantly spoken in eastern South America, Specially in Brazil and Paraguay with branches in neighboring countries. They are believed by some scholars to be related to Carib and Jê languages. The Tupian was once spoken by the powerful Tupian nations of the coast encountered by the Europeans. And still spoken by the tribes of Xingu and the Guarani to small nomadic peoples uncontacted in the Amazon. The language was adapted and used by the [[Bandeirantes]] who spent most of their lives among the natives. These armies of explorers and raiders from [[São Paulo]] who explored the then unknown interior of Brazil in search of gold and slaves. and transformed it in dialects who later become the Nhéngatu or Lingua Geral and made it the most widelly spoken language in Brazil until the [[Marquis of Pombal]] imposed the use of Portuguese in the Colony. Many branches are probably lost or were never recorded as the Tupian peoples don't have a writing system, And some dialects were spoken by groups were probably wiped out or enslaved by other groups or the Bandeirantes. [[José de Anchieta]] a Canarian jesuit priest active in the Brazilian coast during the early Portuguese settlement, Was the first person to write and translate the tupi language. Rodrigues (2007) considers the Proto-Tupian homeland to be somewhere between the Guaporé and Aripuanã rivers, in the Madeira River basin.[2] Much of this area corresponds to the modern-day state of Rondônia, Brazil. 5 of the 10 Tupian branches are found in this area, as well as some Tupi–Guarani languages (especially Kawahíb), making it the probable urheimat of these languages and maybe of its speaking peoples. Rodrigues believes the Proto-Tupian language dates back to around 5,000 B.P.

===Other groups===
{{further|Models of migration to the New World}}

Other than [[Dene-Yeniseian languages|Dene-Yeniseian]], and a possible connection between the Eskimo-Aleut language family and the Uralic language family, no proposals of genetic relations between languages of North or South America and languages of Eurasia, Africa, or other parts of the world, have been backed by credible evidence.  There is not, for example, any indication that the Vikings who had a brief presence in North America around 1000 CE left any linguistic trace.

Population genetic evidence suggests that the non-circumpolar indigenous peoples of the Americas have origins in a small common founder population in the Upper Paleolithic era that arrived via a Berginian land bridge from Asia.&lt;ref name=Zhivotovsky&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zegura SL, Karafet TM, Zhivotovsky LA, Hammer MF |title=High-resolution SNPs and microsatellite haplotypes point to a single, recent entry of Native American Y chromosomes into the Americas |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=164–75 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14595095 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh009|last2=Karafet |last3=Zhivotovsky |last4=Hammer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inuit&gt;{{cite journal|title=mtDNA Variation among Greenland Eskimos.

Vol 130, 153–162|accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This population genetic data point suggests the possibility that all indigenous Native American languages of non-circumpolar indigenous Americans (i.e. neither Inuit-Aleut nor Na-Dene) have genetic origins in a single language of the founding population of the Americas, and hence, as controversially proposed by Greenberg, that they all ultimately belong to the same linguistic superfamily, which Greenberg called Amerind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Ruhlen | first2 = M. | year = 1992 | title = Linguistic Origins of Native Americans | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 267 | issue = 5| pages = 94–99 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1192-94| bibcode = 1992SciAm.267e..94G }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, there is not clear evidence of this from efforts to use traditional comparative linguistic methods to classify indigenous Native American languages.  The process of identifying linguistic origins with traditional linguistic methods begins with the process of classifying languages into families.

In general, more progress has been made in identify language family relationships in North America, where the just under three hundred attested languages are grouped into twenty-nine language families and twenty-seven language isolates (some of which are simply incapable of being classified because they are extinct and were not sufficiently well attested to classify).  Two (super-) family proposals, [[Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] generally along the Pacific coast of North America that are gaining currency among linguists, would reduce the number of language families in North America to about fifteen.  However, in large portions of the Southeast United States where it is known that there was considerable pre-Columbian linguistic diversity, there are no attested indigenous languages and the populations in question either left no survivors, or all remaining speakers of relocated tribes with diminished numbers underwent language shift as their ancestral languages became moribund.

Mesoamerica was home to one of the most developed succession of farming societies in the Americas in the pre-Columbian era.  Mesoamerica's attested languages are likewise quite well systematized into six main language families and four other language isolates or small language families, as well as a few unclassified extinct languages, encompassing all of the languages in the region.  Mesoamerica is also the only part of the Americas in which written languages were in use in the pre-Columbian era.

In South America there are about 350 living indigenous languages (in addition to many creoles) and an estimated more than one thousand extinct languages, grouped into more than 140 categories, only ten of which have more than five languages which have been demonstrated to belong to the same language family.  This is about three times as much linguistic diversity at the language family/language isolate level as North America and Mesoamerica combined.  The naïve expectation from population genetics would have been that there would be less linguistic diversity, because the entire indigenous population of South America appears to derive genetically from only a subset of an already small indigenous founder population of the Americas as a whole, something illustrated, for example, by its lack several of the less common genetic haplotypes found in indigenous America outside South America (although genetic diversity has accumulated in these populations over time through mutations distinguishing these populations from the founder population genomes).  Some of the lack of classification of indigenous South American languages may be simply attributable to the small number of linguists devoted to the task and the limited amount of information available about many of the languages.  But the languages of the region may also simply be particularly diverse due to separation by great time depth and geographic isolation.  The only other place in the world with comparable linguistic diversity that has not been reduced to a small number of language families is Papua New Guinea, which also experienced many millennia of isolation from the rest of the world that ended only relatively recently.

== History ==

The Vikram Samvat is notable because many ancient and medieval era inscriptions use it. It is said to be named after the legendary king [[Vikramaditya]], but the term "Vikrama Samvat" does not appear in the historical records before the 9th century, rather the same calendaring system is found by other names such as ''Krita'' and ''Malava''.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p182"&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard Salomon| title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-4RDAAAQBAJ |year=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-509984-3| pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonial era scholarship, the era was believed to be based on the commemoration of King Vikramaditya expelling the Sakas from Ujjain. However, later epigraphical evidence and scholarship suggests that this theory has no historical basis and very likely was an error. Starting in the 9th century and thereafter, epigraphical artwork uses Vikrama-samvat, suggesting that sometime around the 9th-century, the Hindu calendar era that was already in use became popular as Vikram Samvat, while Buddhist and Jain epigraphy continued to use an era based on the Buddha or the Mahavira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-4RDAAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509984-3|pages=182–183, 194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vikramaditya legends ===
[[File:Westindischer Maler um 1400 001.jpg|thumb|300px|The Jain monk Kalakacharya and the [[Saka]] King (''Kalakacharya Katha'' manuscript, [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]], [[Mumbai]])]]
According to popular tradition, the legendary king [[Vikramaditya]] of [[Ujjain]] established the Vikrama Samvat era after defeating the [[Indo-Scythians|Śakas]].

''Kalakacharya Kathanaka'' ("An account of the monk Kalakacharya") by the [[Jainism|Jain]] sage Mahesarasuri gives the following account{{cn|date=April 2018}}: Gandharvasena, the then-powerful king of Ujjain, abducted a nun called Sarasvati, who was the sister of the monk. The enraged monk sought the help of the Śaka ruler King Sahi in [[Sistan]]. Despite heavy odds but aided by miracles, the Śaka king defeated Gandharvasena and made him a captive. Sarasvati was repatriated, although Gandharvasena himself was forgiven. The defeated king retired to the forest, where he was killed by a tiger. His son, Vikramaditya, being brought up in the forest, had to rule from [[Pratishthana]] (modern Paithan in [[Maharashtra]]). Later on, Vikramaditya invaded Ujjain and drove away the Śakas. To commemorate this event, he started a new era called the "Vikrama era". The Ujjain calendar started around 58–56 BCE, and the subsequent Shaka era calendar was started in 78 CE at Pratishthana.

=== Historical origins ===

The association of the era beginning in 57 BCE with Vikramaditya is not found in any source before the 9th century CE. The earlier sources call this era by various names, including ''Kṛṭa'' (343 CE and 371 CE), ''Kritaa'' (404 CE), ''the era of the [[Malavas|Malava tribe]]'' (424 CE), or simply, ''Samvat''.&lt;ref name="AA_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS_1974"/&gt;

The earliest known inscription that calls the era "Vikrama" is from 842 CE. This inscription of [[Chauhan]]a ruler Chandamahasena was found at [[Dholpur]], and is dated ''Vikrama Samvat 898, [[Vaishakha]] [[Shukla paksha|Shukla]] 2, Chanda'' (16 April 842 CE). The earliest known inscription that associates this era with a king called Vikramaditya is dated 971 CE. The earliest literary work that connects the era to Vikramaditya is ''Subhashita-Ratna-Sandoha'' (993-994 CE) by the Jain author Amitagati.&lt;ref name="MS_1974"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dVRvVyHaiQC&amp;pg=PA100 |title=History of Classical Sanskrit Literature |author=M. Srinivasachariar |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1974 |isbn=9788120802841 |pages=94–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, multiple authors believe that the Vikram Samvat was not started by Vikramaditya, who might be a purely legendary king or the title adopted by a later king who renamed the era after himself. [[Vincent Arthur Smith|V. A. Smith]] and [[D. R. Bhandarkar]] believed that [[Chandragupta II]] adopted the title ''Vikramaditya'', and changed the name of the era to "Vikrama Samvat". According to [[Rudolf Hoernlé]], the king responsible for this change was [[Yashodharman]]: Hoernlé also believed that he conquered Kashmir, and is same person as the "Harsha Vikramaditya" mentioned in [[Kalhana]]'s ''[[Rajatarangini]]''.&lt;ref name="MS_1974"/&gt;

Earlier, some scholars believed that the Vikrama Samavat corresponded to the [[Azes era]] of the Indo-Scythian (Śaka) king [[Azes I|King Azes]]. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of [[Vijayamitra]], which is dated in two eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC |date=2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18566-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory seems to be now thoroughly discredited by Falk and Bennett, who place the inception of the Azes era in 47–46 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Falk and Bennett (2009), pp. 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The traditional New Year of Vikram Samvat is one of the many festivals of Nepal, marked by parties, family gatherings, the exchange of good wishes, and participation in rituals to ensure good fortune in the coming year. It occurs in mid-April each year, and coincides with the traditional new year in Assam, Bengal, Burma, Cambodia, Kerala, Kashmir, Manipur, Odisha, Punjab, Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu and Thailand

In addition to Nepal, the Vikram Samvat calendar is also recognized in [[North India|North]] and [[East India]], and in [[Gujarat]] among Hindus. Hindu religious festivals are based on Vikram Samvat. In North India the new year in Vikram Samvat starts from the first day of Chaitra Skukla paksha. In Buddhist communities, the month of Baishakh is associated with [[Vesak]] or [[Buddha's Birthday]]. It commemorates the birth, Enlightenment and passing of Gautama Buddha on the first full moon day in May, except in a leap year when the festival is held in June. Although this festival is not held on the same day as Pahela Baishakh, the holidays typically fall in the same month (Baishakh) of the Bengali, Hindu, and Theravada Buddhist calendars, and are related historically through the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism in South Asia.

In [[Gujarat]], the second day of [[Diwali]] is celebrated as the first day of the Vikram Samvat calendar which is the first day of the month Kartik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://deshgujarat.com/2014/10/19/gujarat-cm-to-exchange-diwali-new-year-greetings-with-people/|title = Gujarat CM to exchange Diwali-New Year greetings with people|last = |first = |date = 19 October 2014|work = |accessdate = 24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==

The Vikrami era is an ancient calendar and has been historically used by [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc&gt;{{cite book | author=Eleanor Nesbitt| title=Sikhism: a Very Short Introduction | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 | year=2016| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-874557-0| pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the several regional Hindu calendars that have been in use on the [[Indian subcontinent]], and it is based on twelve synodical lunar months and 365 solar days.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuller2004p109"/&gt; The lunar new year starts on the new moon in the month of [[Chaitra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=djvXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=chaitra+sukhladi&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=chaitra+sukhladi Davivajña, Rāma (1996) Muhurtacintāmaṇi. Sagar Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; This day, known as Chaitra Sukhladi, is a restricted holiday in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://india.gov.in/calendar/calendar.php India.gov.in]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vikrami samvat (''Bikrami Samvat'' system) has been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remains in use by the [[Hindu]]s in north, west and central India as well as Nepal.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p182"/&gt; In south India, and some parts of east and west India such as Assam, Bengal and Gujarat, ''saka'' era has been widely used.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p181"/&gt;

With the arrival of the Islamic rule era, the [[Hijri]] Islamic calendar became the official calendar of various Sultanates and the Mughal Empire. During the colonial rule era of the Indian subcontinent, the Gregorian calendar was adopted and it is commonly used in the urban areas of India and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Tim Harper| author2=Sunil Amrith| title=Sites of Asian Interaction: Ideas, Networks and Mobility| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbiLBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |year=2014| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-1-316-09306-1| pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominantly Muslim countries of Pakistan and Bangladesh use the Islamic calendar since 1947, but older texts variously included the Bikrami and Gregorian calendar systems. In 2003, the India-based [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] of [[Sikhism]] adopted the [[Nanakshahi calendar]], a move that continues to be debated.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc/&gt; The Vikrami calendar is the official calendar of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bal Gopal Shrestha| title=The Sacred Town of Sankhu: The Anthropology of Newar Ritual, Religion and Society in Nepal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EwsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 | year=2012| publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing| isbn=978-1-4438-3825-2| pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The calendar system==
The Vikrami calendar is similar in conceptual design to the Jewish calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc/&gt; Unlike Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to lunar month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Orazio Marucchi| title=Christian Epigraphy: An Elementary Treatise with a Collection of Ancient Christian Inscriptions Mainly of Roman Origin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoBjBYdzrkQC&amp;pg=PA289 |year=2011| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-23594-5| page=289}}, Text: "...the lunar year consists of 354 days..."&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 365 solar days, the Vikrami and Jewish calendars maintain the integrity of the lunar month, but insert an extra full month by complex rules, every 4 years, to ensure that the festivals and crop related rituals fall in the appropriate season. This Indian system of calendar keeping is one of the luni-solar calendar systems innovated in ancient human cultures.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuller2004p109"&gt;{{cite book | author=Christopher John Fuller| title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC| year=2004| publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-69112-04-85| pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Buddhist communities of India adopted the ancient Indian calendar, later Vikrami calendar, and then local [[Buddhist calendar]]s. Buddhist festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anita Ganeri| title=Buddhist Festivals Through the Year| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-EawToG-6YC&amp;pg=PT11| year=2003| publisher=BRB| isbn=978-1-58340-375-4| pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vikram Samvat has two alternative systems. It started in 56 BCE in the southern (''purnimanta'') and 57–56 BCE in the northern (''amanta'') systems of the [[Hindu calendar]]. The Shukla Paksha, when most festivals occur, coincides in both systems. The era is named after King [[Vikramaditya]] of [[India]].&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p181"&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard Salomon| title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA181| year=1398| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=978-0-19-535666-3| pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AA_1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ashvini Agrawal |title=Rise and Fall of the Imperial Guptas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRjC5IaJ2zcC&amp;pg=PA174 |year=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0592-7 |pages=174–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The luni-solar Vikram Samvat calendar is 56.7 years ahead of the solar [[Gregorian calendar]]. For example, the year 2075 VS began in 2018 CE and will end in 2019 CE.

The Rana rulers of Nepal made Vikram Samvat the official Hindu calendar in 1901 CE, which started as Samvat 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cDTfCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=BIKRAM+SAMBAT&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgsMiG8ITVAhXL34MKHfmiBY4Q6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=BIKRAM%20SAMBAT&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of New Year's Holidays Worldwide, William D. Crump,  Publisher McFarland, 2014  p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, the new year begins with the first day of the month of [[Baishakh]], which usually falls around 13-15 April in the Gregorian calendar. The first day of the new year is passionately celebrated in a historical carnival that takes place every year in [[Bhaktapur]], called [[Bisket Jatra]]. From 2007 AD, [[Nepal Sambat]] is recognized as the national calendar.

In India, the reformulated [[Indian national calendar|Saka Calendar]] is officially used (although not for computing the dates of the traditional festivals). In the Hindi version of the Preamble of the [[Constitution of India]], however, the date of adoption of the constitution, 26 November 1949, is presented in Vikram Samvat (Margsheersh Shukla Saptami Samvat 2006). There have been calls for the Vikram Samvat to replace Saka as India's official calendar.&lt;ref name=tfpj12&gt;{{cite news | title=Vikram Samvat should be declared national calendar| url=http://freepressjournal.in/vikram-samvat-should-be-declared-national-calendar/| accessdate=28 March 2012| newspaper=''[[The Free Press Journal]]''| date=15 February 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426123959/http://freepressjournal.in/vikram-samvat-should-be-declared-national-calendar/| archivedate=26 April 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions of a year==
The classical Vikram Samvat uses lunar months and solar sidereal years. Because 12 months do not match a sidereal year exactly, correctional months (''[[Hindu calendar#Corrections between lunar and solar months|adhika māsa]]'') are added or, occasionally, subtracted (''kshaya masa''). A lunar year consists of 12 months. A lunar month has two fortnights. The lunar days are called "tithis". Each month has 30 tithis, which may vary from 20 – 27 hours. During the waxing phases, tithis are called "shukla" or the bright phase — the auspicious fortnight, beginning with the day after the new moon called "[[Amavasya]]". Tithis for the waning phases are called "krishna" or the dark phase, which is regarded as the inauspicious fortnight,&lt;ref&gt;http://hinduism.about.com/od/history/a/calendar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; starting from the day after the full moon or "purnima".

===Lunar metrics===
* A ''[[Tithi]]'' (or [[lunar day]]) is defined as the time it takes for the [[longitude|longitudinal]] angle between the Moon and the Sun to increase by 12[[degree (angle)|°]].&lt;ref name="Chap14"&gt;Burgess, Ebenezer [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Translation of the Sûrya-Siddhânta: A text-book of Hindu astronomy, with notes and an appendix''] originally published: ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', vol. 6, (1860), pp. 141–498, Chapter 14, Verse 12&lt;/ref&gt; Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration from approximately 19 to 26 hours.
* A ''Paksa'' (also ''[[paksha|{{IAST|Pakṣa}}]]'') or [[lunar fortnight]] consists of 15 ''tithi''s.
* A ''[[Masa|{{IAST|Māsa}}]]'' or [[lunar month]] (approximately 29.5 days) is divided into 2 ''[[paksha|{{IAST|Pakṣa}}]]''s: the one between [[new moon]] and [[full moon]] (waxing) is called ''gaura'' (bright) or ''[[shukla paksha|{{IAST|Śukla Pakṣa}}]]''; the one between full moon and new moon (waning) ''Kṛiṣhṇa'' (dark) or ''Vadhya Pakṣa''
* A ''[[Ritu (Hindu calendar)|{{IAST|Ṛitu}}]]'' (or ''season'') is two ''[[masa|{{IAST|Māsa}}]]''&lt;ref name="Chap14"/&gt;
* An ''Ayana'' is three [[Ritu (Hindu calendar)|{{IAST|Ṛitu}}]]s
* A year is two ''Ayanas'' [http://vedabase.net/sb/3/11/11/en1]&lt;ref name="Chap14"/&gt;

A day consists of 8 Peh'r/Pahars, every Peh'r/Pahar equals to 3 hours of the modern clock. These ''Pahars'' are named:
:1: ''Sajar vela or Sver vela'' = Morning/Day-break (6'o clock to 9'o clock).
:2: ''Dhammi vela'' = Pre- noon time(9'o clock to 12'o clock).
:3: ''Paishee vela'' = Noon(12'o clock to 3'o clock).
:4: ''Deegar vela'' = Afternoon(3'o clock to 6'o clock).
:5: ''nimasheen/namashan vela'' = Sunset + Evening + Early hours of night(6'o clock to 9'o clock).
:6: ''Kuftain vela'' = Pre-midnight time (9'o clock to 12'o clock).
:7: ''Adh Raat vela'' = Midnight to 3'o clock (12'o clock to 3'o clock).
:8: ''Sarghee vela'' = Pre Dawn/Very early morning before the sunrise(3'o clock to 6'o clock).

The word ''vela'' (or ''vailaa'') means "time of the day", whereas the word ''Adh'' means half. 'Dowpahar/dowpeh'r' denotes noon time; and 'shikardowpehr' when sun is right above.

==Converting Vikram Samvat to CE==
While an approximate conversion can be made by subtracting 56 or 57, a precise computation requires identification of the version of Vikam Samvat that was used:
* Year expired (default) or current
* Kartikadi (older or western India) or Chaitradi (modern Northern India). Kartikadi starts 7 months later in Kartika. Until 12th century Kartikadi year was common even in North India.
* Months Amanta (south) or Purminata (North). Amanta Chaitra Krishna Paksha is Purminata Vaishakh Krishna Paksha. For the Shukla Paksh, the month is the same.

A software program, ''Pancanga'', is available to make the calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/message314.html ''Pancanga'']; online; version 3.14&lt;/ref&gt;
