      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7835">An '''academic quarter''' refers to the division of an [[academic term|academic year]] into four parts.

== Historical context ==
The modern academic quarter calendar can be traced to the historic English law court / legal training pupillage four term system:  
* Hilary: January–March
* Easter: April–May
* Trinity: June–July
* Michaelmas: October–December
This quarter system was adopted by the oldest universities in the English-speaking world (Oxford, founded circa 1096,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/organisation/history|title=University of Oxford - History|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Oxford|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambridge, founded circa 1209&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/early-records|title=University of Cambridge - History|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Cambridge|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Over time, Cambridge dropped Trinity Term and renamed Hilary Term to Lent Term, and Oxford also dropped the original Trinity Term and renamed Easter Term as Trinity Term, thus establishing the three-term academic "quarter" year widely found in countries with a lineage to England or the United Kingdom.

==United States==

=== Background and trends ===
In the United States, quarters typically comprise 10 weeks of class instruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nafsa.org/knowledge_community_network.sec/education_abroad_1/managing_an_education/practice_resources_37/facts_figures/how_to_fill_out_the_open |title=''Practice Resources'', NAFSA: Association of International Educators |access-date=2008-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503123134/http://www.nafsa.org/knowledge_community_network.sec/education_abroad_1/managing_an_education/practice_resources_37/facts_figures/how_to_fill_out_the_open |archive-date=2008-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have historically ranged from eight to 13 weeks.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/487322 Kemp Malone, '' 'Semester' '', American Speech, Dec. 1946, p. 264]&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic quarters first came into existence as such when [[William Rainey Harper]] organized the [[University of Chicago]] on behalf of [[John D. Rockefeller]] in 1891.  Harper decided to keep the school in session year-round and divide it into four terms instead of the then-traditional two.&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt;

Of the four traditional [[academic term#Collegiate calendars|academic calendars]] (semester, quarter, trimester, and 4-1-4), the semester calendar is used the most widely, at over 60% of U.S. [[higher learning institution]]s, with fewer than 20% using the quarter system.&lt;ref name="Ad Hoc Report"&gt;[http://www.neu.edu/semesterinfo/Backgrounddocuments/calendar99.doc ''Report of the 1998-99'' ad hoc ''Calendar Committee'', Northeastern University, July 30, 1999]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This number has stayed fairly constant since 1930, when 75% of U.S. institutions surveyed indicated they used a semester plan, with 22% on the quarter system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1974175 H.W. James, ''The Semester versus the Quarter'', Journal of Higher Education, Oct. 1930, p. 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, a number of U.S. statewide educational systems made a switch from a semester to quarter system, typically in an attempt to accommodate the Tidal Wave I enrollment boom, most prominently the [[University of California system]].&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;[http://www.senate.ucla.edu/SenateVoice/Issue3/Debate_Semesters_Or_Quarters.htm ''Debate: Semesters or Quarters'', UCLA Faculty Senate Voice, Apr. 2003 (iss. 3)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221023451/http://www.senate.ucla.edu/SenateVoice/Issue3/Debate_Semesters_Or_Quarters.htm |date=February 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, [[UC Berkeley]] switched back to semesters in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.ucla.edu/2002/021119semester.html Harlan Lebo, ''Semester vs. quarter?'', UCLA Today, 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807141434/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2002/021119semester.html |date=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the new [[UC Merced]] branch opened with the semester system, and some UC professional schools have switched back to semesters at various points.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;  At various points since, committees have been established and official discussions have taken place within the UC system to discuss a systemwide switch back to the semester system.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nexus"&gt;[http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=13006 Chris Ziegler, ''Faculty Considers Switch from Quarter to Semester'', (University of California, Santa Barbara) Daily Nexus, Jan. 29, 1990 (reprinted Jan. 29, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525104618/http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=13006 |date=May 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of higher education institutions have considered or already approved a switch to a semester system including the higher education systems of [[Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/1451148/ou_ready_to_consider_switch_to_semesters/index.html Rich Rouan, ''OU Ready to Consider Switch to Semesters'', Columbus Dispatch, June 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/04/28/daily17.html ''University of Cincinnati planning switch to semesters'', Business Courier of Cincinnati, Apr. 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070804184752/http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/spr96/switch.html Hoyt Coffee, ''Regents Set Semester Switch'', Georgia Tech Alumni magazine, Spring 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; and individual public colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/2001/april/040301n2.htm Tony Boom, ''SOU studies semester switch'', Mail-Tribune, Apr. 3, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rochester Institute of Technology has announced their intention to convert to semesters by Fall 2013, although the decision is highly controversial, overriding a student vote to remain with quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rit.edu/conversion/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725110043/http://www.rit.edu/conversion/ |archive-date=2010-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments===
Concerns over the quarter system include faculty dislike of the brevity of the term, the loss of faculty research and collaboration time, the shortness of student internship periods, difficulties in recovering from illness-linked absence, and the heavy administrative workload.&lt;ref name="Ad Hoc Report" /&gt;

A quarter system calendar also may put schools at a disadvantage in competing for prospective students, who wish to keep in-step with friends, and offer more opportunities for students to "disconnect from school."&lt;ref name="Ad Hoc Report" /&gt;

Quarter systems do allow students to enroll in a richer variety of courses and school-coordinated [[internship]]s and may encourage students to take on double majors, minors, concentrations, and the like.&lt;ref name="Ad Hoc Report" /&gt;
A quarter system can maximize the use of college facilities in a time of enrollment growth, as it allows for four regular periods of academic instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.ucla.edu/ucla1960s/6465/mohajeri3.htm Sarah Mohajeri, ''From Semesters to Quarters'', in ''UCLA in the sixties'', May 24, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912163700/http://www.english.ucla.edu/ucla1960s/6465/mohajeri3.htm |date=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, quarters allow for faculty to engage in terms with a relatively light course load of teaching and greater opportunities for short [[sabbatical]]s.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;

The '''alligator drum''' is a type of [[drum]] once used in [[Neolithic China]], made from clay and alligator hides.

Alligator drums have been found over a broad area at the [[Neolithic]] sites from modern [[Shandong]] in the east to [[Qinghai]] in the west, dating to a period of 5500–2350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Li (2007). ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-01064-0}}. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Drums covered with alligator skin for ceremonial use are mentioned in the ''[[Shijing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterckx, Roel (2002). ''The Animal and the Daemon in Early China''. New York: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-5270-0}}. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Deborah Lynn (1996). ''From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Fiction''. New York: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3034-0}}. p 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Archaic period, [[Chinese alligator|alligator]]s probably lived along the east coast of China, including southern [[Shandong]]. The earliest alligator drums, comprising a wooden frame covered with alligator skin, are found in the archaeological sites at [[Dawenkou]] (4100–2600 BC), as well as several sites of [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] (3000–2000 BC) in Shandong and [[Taosi]] (2300– 1900 BC) in southern [[Shanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Li (2007).

'''Anacoenosis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|s|iː|ˈ|n|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}} is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker poses a question to an audience in a way that demonstrates a common interest.&lt;ref name="Pogue2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Emery Pogue|title=Shakespeare's Figures of Speech: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PBXW_wTwBIC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=25 June 2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4401-5192-7|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακοινοῦν}} (''anakoinoûn''), meaning "to communicate, impart".

Anacoenosis typically uses a rhetorical question, where no reply is really sought or required, thus softening what is really a statement or command. 

Asking a question that implies one clear answer is to put others in a difficult position. If they disagree with you, then they risk conflict or derision. In particular if you state the question with certainty, then it makes disagreement seem rude.

Particularly when used in a group, this uses social conformance. If there is an implied agreement by all and one person openly disagrees, then they risk isolating themselves from the group, which is a very scary prospect.

If I am in an audience and the speaker uses anacoenosis and I do not agree yet do not speak up, then I may suffer cognitive dissonance between my thoughts and actions. As a result, I am likely to shift my thinking toward the speaker's views in order to reduce this tension.

==Examples==
*Do you not think we can do this now?
*Now tell me, given the evidence before us, could you have decided any differently?
*What do you think? Are we a bit weary? Shall we stay here for a while?
*"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could I have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" Isaiah 5:3-4
*The entire speech of Marc Anthony in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Julius Caesar forms an extended example of anacoenosis. Marc Anthony begins by building common cause with the audience on stage, addressing them as "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." His speech then poses a number of rhetorical questions to them as part of his refutation of Brutus' words: "Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? / When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: / Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: / Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;/ And Brutus is an honourable man. / You all did see that on the Lupercal / I thrice presented him a kingly crown, / Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?" (Act 3, Scene 2)

'''Andalusian Arabic''', also known as '''Andalusi Arabic,''' was a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] or varieties of the [[Arabic language]] spoken in [[Al-Andalus]], the regions of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) under Muslim rule (and for some time after) from the 9th century to the 17th century. It became an [[extinct language]] in Iberia after the [[expulsion of the Moriscos]], which took place over a century after the [[Conquest of Granada]] by Christian Spain. Once widely spoken in Iberia, the expulsions and persecutions of Arabic speakers caused an abrupt end to the language's use on the peninsula. Its use continued to some degree in Africa after the expulsion although Andalusi speakers were rapidly assimilated by the Moroccan and Tunisian communities to which they fled.

Andalusi Arabic is still used in [[Andalusi music]] and has significantly influenced the dialects of such towns as [[Sfax]] in Tunisia, [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Rabat]], [[Nedroma]], [[Tlemcen]], [[Blida]], [[Cherchell]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alyamiah.com/cema/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=499 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214223902/http://alyamiah.com/cema/modules.php?name=News |archivedate=2009-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} by communities of the descendants of [[Moriscos]] (Andalusi Muslims) in cities like [[Tangier]] and [[Tetouan]] in [[Morocco]] and [[Testour]], [[Ghar al Milh]] and [[Sfax]] in [[Tunisia]] which welcomed Moriscos refugees. It also exerted some influence on [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (particularly [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]]), [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Classical Arabic]] and the  [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]], [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]], [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassani]] and [[Algerian Arabic]] dialects.

Andalusian Arabic appears to have spread rapidly and been in general oral use in most parts of Al-Andalus between the 9th and 15th centuries. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The number of speakers is estimated to have peaked at around 5–7 million speakers around the 11th and 12th centuries before dwindling as a consequence of the [[Reconquista]], the gradual but relentless takeover by the Christians. In 1502, the Muslims of Granada were forced to choose between conversion and exile; those who converted became known as the Moriscos. In 1526, this requirement was extended to the Muslims elsewhere in Spain ([[Mudéjar]]s). In 1567, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a royal decree in Spain forbidding Moriscos from the [[Language death|use of Arabic on all occasions]], formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn a "Christian" language, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. This triggered one of the largest [[Morisco Revolt]]s. Still, Andalusian Arabic remained in use in certain areas of Spain until the final [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] at the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], et al.: ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', [[Brill Publishers]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in every other Arabic-speaking land, native speakers of Andalusian Arabic were [[diglossic]], that is, they spoke their local dialect in all low-register situations, but only Classical Arabic was resorted to when a high register was required and for written purposes as well.

Andalusian Arabic belongs to Early Western Neo-Arabic, which does not allow for any separation between Bedouin, urban, or rural dialects, nor does it show any detectable difference between communal dialects, such as [[Muslim]], [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]].

The oldest evidence of Andalusian Arabic utterances can be dated from the 10th and 11th century, in isolated quotes, both in [[prose]] and [[stanza]]ic Classical Andalusi poems (''[[muwashahat]]''), and then, from the 11th century on, in stanzaic dialectal poems (''zajal'') and dialectal proverb collections, while its last documents are a few business records and one letter written at the beginning of the 17th century in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].{{ref|BRILL}}

== Features of Andalusian Arabic ==
Many features of Andalusian Arabic have been reconstructed by Arabists using Hispano-Arabic texts (such as the ''[[zajal|azjâl]]'' of [[Ibn Quzmân]], [[Abu al-Hasan al-Shushtari|Shushtari]] and others) composed in Arabic with varying degrees of deviation from classical norms, augmented by further information from the manner in which the Arabic script was used to transliterate Romance words. Such features include the following.

DO NOT USE IPA NARROW TRANSCRIPTION UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE PHONETIC VALUES

--&gt;
The [[phoneme]] represented by the letter ق in texts is a point of contention. The letter, which in Classical Arabic represented either a voiceless pharyngealized [[velar stop]] or a voiceless [[uvular stop]], most likely represented some kind of post-alveolar affricate or [[velar plosive]] in Andalusian Arabic.

The vowel system was subject to a heavy amount of fronting and raising, a phenomenon known as ''[[imāla]]'', causing {{IPA|/a(ː)/}} to be raised, probably to {{IPAblink|ɛ}} or {{IPAblink|e}} and, particularly with short vowels, {{IPAblink|ɪ}} in certain circumstances, particularly when i-mutation was possible.

Contact with native [[Romance language|Romance speakers]] led to the introduction of the phonemes {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|ɡ}} and, possibly, the affricate {{IPAslink|tʃ}}  from [[borrowed word]]s.

[[Monophthongization]] led to the disappearance of certain [[diphthong]]s such as {{IPA|/aw/}} and {{IPA|/aj/}} which were leveled to {{IPAslink|oː}} and {{IPAslink|eː}}, respectively, though Colin hypothesizes that these diphthongs remained in the more [[mesolect]]al registers influenced by the Classical language.

There was a fair amount of compensatory lengthening involved where a loss of consonantal gemination lengthened the preceding vowel, whence the transformation of {{lang|ar|عشّ}} &lt;!--don't use {{IPA-ar}}--&gt;{{IPA|/ʕuʃ(ʃ)/}} ("nest") into {{lang|ar|عوش}} &lt;!--don't use {{IPA-ar}}--&gt;{{IPA|/ʕuːʃ/}}.

=== Syntax and morphology ===
The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-an}}'' which, in Classical Arabic, marked a noun as indefinite [[accusative]] (see [[nunation]]), became an indeclinable [[conjunctive]] particle, as in Ibn Quzmân's expression ''{{transl|xaa|rajul-an 'ashîq}}''.

The unconjugated prepositive negative particle ''{{transl|xaa|lis}}'' developed out of the classical verb ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lays-a}}''.

The [[derivational morphology]] of the verbal system was substantially altered. Whence the initial ''n-'' on verbs in the [[first person singular]], a feature shared by many [[Maghrebi Arabic|Maghrebi dialects]]. Likewise the form V pattern of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafaʻʻal-a}}'' ({{lang|ar|تَفَعَّلَ}}) was altered by [[epenthesis]] to ''{{transl|xaa|atfa``al}}'' ({{lang|xaa|أتْفَعَّل}}).

Andalusian Arabic developed a contingent/subjunctive tense (after a protasis with the conditional particle ''{{transl|ar|ALA|law}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:1px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; consisting of the imperfect (prefix) form of a verb, preceded by either ''{{transl|xaa|kân}}'' or ''{{transl|xaa|kîn}}'' (depending on the register of the speech in question), of which the final ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n}}'' was normally assimilated by preformatives ''{{transl|xaa|y-}}'' and ''{{transl|xaa|t-}}''. An example drawn from Ibn Quzmân will illustrate this:

'''Aboriginal avoidance practices''' refers to those relationships in traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] society where certain people are required to avoid others in their family or clan. These customs are still active in many parts of [[Australia]], to a greater or lesser extent.

Avoidance relationships are a mark of respect. There are also strong protocols around avoiding, or averting, eye contact, as well as around speaking the name of the dead.

==Avoidance of members==

In general, across most language groups, the two most common avoidance relationships are:

===Son/daughter-in-law and mother-in-law===
In what is the strongest kinship avoidance rule, some Australian Aboriginal customs ban a person from talking directly to their mother in law or even seeing her. A mother-in-law also eats apart from her son-in-law or daughter-in-law and their spouse. If the two are present at the same ceremony, they will sit with their backs to each other but they can still communicate via the wife/husband, who remains the main conduit for communication in this relationship. Often there are [[Avoidance speech|language customs]] surrounding these relationships.&lt;ref name="AIJA"&gt;[http://www.aija.org.au/online/ICABenchbook/BenchbookChapter2.pdf Aspects of Traditional Aboriginal Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412224125/http://www.aija.org.au/online/ICABenchbook/BenchbookChapter2.pdf |date=12 April 2013 }} AIJA Aboriginal Cultural Awareness Benchbook for Western Australian Courts&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship extends to avoiding all women of the same [[skin group]] as the mother-in-law, and, for the mother-in-law, men of the same skin group as the son-in-law. The age of marriage is very different for men and women with girls usually marrying at puberty while a man may not marry until his late 20s or even later. As mothers-in-law and sons-in-law are likely to be of approximately the same age the avoidance practice possibly serves to circumvent potential illicit relationships.&lt;ref name="AIJA" /&gt; It has also been suggested that the custom developed to overcome a common cause of friction in families.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | date = | title = Social Organisation| work = aboriginalculture.com| url = http://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/socialorganisation.shtml| accessdate = 11 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100322233231/http://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/socialorganisation.shtml| archivedate = 22 March 2010| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brother–sister===
This usually takes place after initiation. Prior to this, brothers and sisters play together freely.

Both these avoidance relationships have their grounding in the [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]] system, and so are ways of avoiding [[incest]] in small bands of closely related people.

There are many other avoidance relationships, including same-sex relationships, but these are the main two.

===Sexual relationships===
Once children are older, they are viewed as potential marital partners and their sexual behavior becomes one of strict avoidance until married. Permanent relationships are prescribed by traditional law and often arranged before birth.

Same-sex relationships are viewed in the same light as incest or "wrong" marriages (i.e., to a partner of their own choice or wrong skin group) which carry the same penalties as a domestic crime against the community. However, intimate bodily contact between women regardless of marital status is not considered sexually suggestive but affirmation of friendship and a "right to touch". Touch is particularly important when women tell jokes or discuss matters of a sexual nature. In these circumstances behavior such as "nipple tweaking" and "groin grabbing" are seen as signs of friendship.&lt;ref name="AIJA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Transgressive sex: subversion and control in erotic encounters", ''Fertility, Reproduction and Sexuality'', Vol. 13, [[Berghahn Books]], 2009. pp. 214–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoidance of naming the dead==
{{Main|Avoidance language}}
Traditionally, this meant avoiding referring to a deceased individual by name directly after their death as a mark of respect&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119415040/HTMLSTART "Australian findings on Aboriginal cultural practices associated with clothing, hair, possessions and use of name of deceased persons"], Pam McGrath and Emma Phillips, Research paper, ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 14, Issue #1, pp. 57–66&lt;/ref&gt;—and also because it is considered too painful for the grieving family. Today the practice continues in many communities, but has also come to encompass avoiding the publication or dissemination of photography or film footage of the deceased as well. Many Australian television programs and films include a title card warning Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] that "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewers are advised that the following program may contain images and voices of people who have died." (as recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Network&lt;ref name="Australian Broadcasting Corporation"&gt;[https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/abc-indigenous-content/ "ABC Indigenous Content"]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as, "that old lady", or by their generic [[skin name]], but not by first name.&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt; In some Central Australian communities, if for example, an individual named Alice dies, that name must be avoided in all contexts. This can even include the township [[Alice Springs]] being referred to in conversation in a roundabout way (which is usually fine, as the Indigenous name can be defaulted to). Those of the same name as the deceased are referred to by a substitute name during the avoidance period such as ''Kuminjay'', used in the Pintubi-Luritja dialect,&lt;ref&gt; Pintupi Luritja, a Western Desert language, http://www.clc.org.au/articles/info/aboriginal-languages/ &lt;/ref&gt;  or ''Galyardu'', which appears in a mid-western Australia [[Wajarri]] dictionary for this purpose. 

This presents some challenges to indigenous people. In traditional society, people lived together in small bands of extended family, and name duplication was less common. Today, as people have moved into larger communities (with upwards of 300 to 600 people), the logistics of name avoidance have become increasingly difficult. Exotic and rare names have therefore become very common, particularly in Central Australia and desert communities, to deal with this new challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">The '''Bowl of Utu''' also known as the '''Bowl of Udu''', '''Uhub''', '''Utug''', '''U-tug''', '''Utuk''' or '''Utu(k)''' is an ancient [[Sumer]]ian bowl from the early 3rd millennium BC. Fragments of the bowl contain eight lines of an inscription. Controversy has surrounded its translation since the 1920s but it is agreed by scholars the fragments contain the earliest mention of [[Hamazi]].

==The Bowl==

Only two fragments of the bowl are known to exist and were unearthed in [[Nippur]] (Ianna Temple) by the archaeologist [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht]] in 1889. The two fragments are only small in size, but contain an extant [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription of eight lines. Hilprecht glued the fragments together (the total size being 12 x 14. 5 x 1. 7&amp;nbsp;cm) and first translated part of the inscription in his ''Old Babylonian Inscriptions'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;"The Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania". Series A: Cuneiform texts (1893), Vol. 1 pt. 2. Hilprecht, H.V. "Old Babylonian Inscriptions chiefly from Nippur", plate 46, p. 49 (Trans Am. Phil. Soc.' N.S XIIII. 8). More information on the bowl is found in Laurence Waddell's "Makers of Civilization in Race and History" (1929, p. 94 ff).&lt;/ref&gt; A full translation was undertaken by the French [[Assyriologist]] [[François Thureau-Dangin]], the chief curator at the [[Louvre]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;"Les inscript Sumer er d' Akkad", F. Paris 1905, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;The inscription of eight lines reads in full as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Dangin and Hilprecht (Waddell, 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{quote|&lt;center&gt;1.[Ash] Za [ga-ga] (or Sa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;2. ... U-dug (or Udu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;3. Pat[esi] &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;4. Ki[sh] (Kish)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;5. Enu-zu-zu &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;6. Gin-Zi &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;7. Kha-ma-zi-ki (or Khamazi) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;8. Sag-gaba-du &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

&lt;center&gt;The English translation reads:&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Dangin and Hilprecht (Waddell, 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{quote|&lt;center&gt;1.[King] Za (Sa)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;2.U-dug (or Udu)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;3.Priest (or sage)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;4.Kish [city]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;5.(Son of) Enuzuzu&lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;6.(Son of) Gin-Zi&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;7.Hamazi (city)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;8.Choice broken has deposited&lt;/center&gt;}}

The bowl fragments were dated by [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht|Hilprecht]] (1893) to the beginning of the Early Dynastic III (ED IIIa) Period (or Nippur III) c. 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;"Old Babylonian Inscriptions chiefly from Nippur", plate 46, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars however have proposed a slightly earlier date, such as the Early Dynastic II (c. 2750 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Early Dynastic Dedication Inscriptions from Nippur, Albrecht Goetze, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 23, No. 2 , 1970, p. 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Laurence Waddell]] excavated the ancient temple site at [[Nippur]] where the fragments were found and claimed he could date them to c. 3245 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, 1929, pp. 88-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Assyriologists]] however have rejected this date.

The bowl fragments later came into the possession of Waddell who in 1929 published his own alternative translation (see below).

==Meaning of Inscription==

Hilprecht and Dangin who translated the fragments considered the inscription to refer to a "cult at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]]", referring to the reference of a ''Pat[esi]'' (priest) in line three, placed in line four at the city ''Ki[sh]'' ([[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]]). They also acknowledged that it contained the earliest reference to [[Hamazi]]. The reference to King Za (or Sa) they could not identify. The archaeologist C. J. Gadd in 1940 proposed that King Za had conquered Hamazi, but made no attempt to identify him.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments of an Early Sumerian Inscribed Bowl", C. J. Gadd, The British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2, Jun., 1940, pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The bowl also appears mentioned in the literature of [[Theophilus Pinches]], who in 1921 wrote a personal letter to Waddell thanking him of bringing the bowl fragments to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;In a typed letter dated 24 February 1921 with the address 'Sipapra, 10 Oxford Road, Kilburn, London'.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Pinches never personally attempted to crack the meaning of the inscription.

The origin and meaning of the inscription remains unresolved.

==Waddell's Translation==

[[Laurence Waddell|Waddell]]&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, L. (1929). ''Makers of Civilization in Race &amp; History''. London: Luzac. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Makers of Civilization'' (1929) published an alternative translation of the fragments:

{{quote|&lt;center&gt;To King (or Lord) Sagg (or Zagg, Sakh, Dar, In-Dara or Dur, Udu, Gurusha, or Adar)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Udu, the priest-king of Kish City&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;the son of Enuzuzu (or Inzuzu)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;the son of Gin, the established son (of King Sagg)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;the Khamazi City&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;choice broken (Bowl) has deposited.&lt;/center&gt;}}

His translation and work has never been taken serious by Assyriologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell]&lt;/ref&gt; Waddell also identified [[Hamazi]] (fragment line 7) with [[Carchemish]] in [[Syria]], but this location is improbable.

The '''Cathedral of Saint Domnius''' ({{lang-hr|Katedrala Svetog Duje}}), known locally as the ''Sveti Dujam'' or colloquially ''Sveti Duje'', is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in  [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]].  The cathedral is the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Split-Makarska]], headed by [[Archbishop]] Marin Barišić.  The Cathedral of St. Domnius is a complex of a church, formed from an Imperial Roman [[mausoleum]], with a [[bell tower]]; strictly the church is dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], and the bell tower to [[Saint Domnius]]. Together they form the Cathedral of St. Domnius.

The Cathedral of [[Saint Domnius]], consecrated at the turn of the 7th century AD, is regarded as the oldest Catholic cathedral in the world that remains in use in its original structure, without near-complete renovation at a later date (though the bell tower dates from the 12th century). The structure itself, built in AD 305 as the Mausoleum of [[Diocletian]], is the second oldest structure used by any Christian Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glas-koncila.hr/index.php?option=com_php&amp;Itemid=144&amp;news_ID=3629 Papa u Splitu i Solinu – kolijevci hrvatskog kršćanstva i državnosti] {{Hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/79265/Default.aspx Najstarija katedrala na svijetu] {{Hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{location map|Croatia|label=Cathedral of St. Domnius|float=left|lat=43.5081|long=16.4403}}--&gt;

==Name==
The cathedral was named after [[Saint Domnius]]{{citation needed|reason=Oficcial name of cathedral is Cathedral of Ascension of the Blessed Virgin Mary|date=January 2017}} (''Saint Dujam'', or ''Saint Domnius'') [[patron saint]] of Split, who was a 3rd-century [[Bishop of Salona]]. [[Salona]] was a large [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city serving as capital of the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Province of Dalmatia]]. Today it is located near the city of [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in [[Croatia]]. Saint Domnius was martyred with seven other [[Christians]] in the persecutions of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. He was born in [[Antioch]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and beheaded in 304 at Salona.

==Architecture==
[[File:SPLIT-Mausoleum 1912.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Cathedral section.]]
[[Diocletian's Palace]] ({{lang-hr|Dioklecijanova palača}}) is a building in the centre of Split, built for the Emperor Diocletian (a native of Dalmatia) at the turn of the 4th century. On the intersection of two main roads, [[cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]], there is a monumental court [[Peristyle]], from which the only access to Cathedral of St. Domnius is to the east. 

The Cathedral of St. Domnius is composed of three different sections of different ages. The main part is [[Diocletian's Palace|Emperor Diocletian's mausoleum]], which dates from the end of the 3rd century. The mausoleum was built like the rest of the [[palace]] with white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from marble quarries on the island of [[Brač]], with [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river [[Jadro]] beds, and with brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. 

Later, in the 17th century a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] was added to the eastern side of the mausoleum. For that purpose the eastern wall of the mausoleum was torn down in order to unify the two chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9il6P3TPj-AC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=%22+St.+Duje+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6TGJTNa0JsnZ4wa54_XRBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20St.%20Duje%20%22&amp;f=false ''Diocletian and the Roman recovery''], pg. 200, Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. (1996), {{ISBN|0-415-91827-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]] was constructed in the year 1100 AD, in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Extensive rebuilding in 1908 radically changed the Bell Tower, and many of the original [[Romanesque sculpture]]s were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gripe.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=183&amp;Itemid=132 Kampanel St. Domnius] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best examples of [[Romanesque sculpture]] in Croatia, are the wooden doors on Cathedral of St. Domnius. They were made by the [[medieval]] [[Croatia]]n sculptor and painter [[Andrija Buvina]] around 1220. Two wings of the Buvina wooden door contains 14 scenes from the life of [[Jesus Christ]], separated by rich ornaments in wood.

==Treasury==

===''The Book of Matt''===
''[[The Book of Matt]]'' by Stephen Jimenez was published by Steerforth in 2013. It details the life of Matt in the Laramie drug scene, and portrays the murder to be about drugs and money. Because it downplays the homophobic aspect of the crime, the book has been condemned by many gay rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/stephen-jimenez-matthew-shepard_n_3914707.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

===''The Laramie Project'' (2002)===
{{main article|The Laramie Project (film)}}
''The Laramie Project'' is a 2002 drama film written and directed by [[Moisés Kaufman]], and based on his own [[#The Laramie Project|play of the same name]] mentioned below. The film featured an all-star cast. It [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was first broadcast on [[HBO]] on March 9, 2002. The film was praised by ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Matt Roush for its emotional range, its examination of homophobia, and the unique investigation at its center, saying that viewers would be "enlightened" by it.&lt;ref name=Roush&gt;Matt Roush. "The Lost Boy: Revisiting the Shepard Tragedy" ''[[TV Guide]]''; March 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===''The Matthew Shepard Story'' (2002)===
{{Main article|The Matthew Shepard Story}}
''The Matthew Shepard Story'' is a [[television film]] about the trial of the killers of Matthew Shepard. It premiered on [[NBC]] on March 9, 2002, the same night as HBO's ''The Laramie Project''. It starred [[Shane Meier]] as Matthew Shepard, and depicting his parents were [[Sam Waterston]] as [[Dennis Shepard]] and [[Stockard Channing]] as [[Judy Shepard]]. The film won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 2002 in the category of ''Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie'' for [[Stockard Channing]]'s performance as Judy Shepard. The film's cast also includes [[Kristen Thomson]], [[Joseph Ziegler]], [[Makyla Smith]], [[Damien Atkins]], and [[Wendy Crewson]]. The ending featured [[Elton John]]'s song about Shepard, "[[American Triangle]]", from his album ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]''.

The film seeks to illuminate the decisions Judy and Dennis Shepard had to make as to whether the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] should be sought for their son's killer. Throughout the movie there are several flashbacks of Matthew's life. It also shows the experiences and hardships Matthew endured throughout his life from junior high through college, including his first kiss, his first boyfriend and a rape scene.

Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' criticized the film as unoriginal, and NBC for scheduling it on the same night as HBO's ''The Laramie Project'', which Roush felt was the far superior effort. Roush opined that although ''The Matthew Shepard Story'' had some merit, and that some might even be moved by it, its decision to open with a depiction of Shepard's murder was "grotesque", and that overall, it did not possess the depth of ''Project''.&lt;ref name=Roush/&gt;

==Stage plays==

===''The Laramie Project'' (2000)===
{{main article|The Laramie Project}}
''The Laramie Project'' is a play by [[Moisés Kaufman]] and members of the [[Tectonic Theater Project]] about the reaction to the murder of Shepard. The play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members' own journal entries and published news reports ranging from a few months after the attack to a few years after. The play is designed to display the town's reaction to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chapelhillnews.com/news/story/25210.html |title=The Laramie Project |accessdate=2009-02-20 |last=Hart |first=Dave |date=November 12, 2008 |work=The Chapel Hill News |publisher=The News &amp; Observer Publishing Company }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/02/kalamazoo_a_group_has.html |title=Gay-themed high school play draws protest, support |accessdate=2009-02-20 |last=Hugenberg |first=Jenny |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=Kalamazoo Gazette |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930085656/http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/02/kalamazoo_a_group_has.html |archive-date=2008-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It premiered at The Ricketson Theatre by the Denver Center Theatre Company (Denver) (part of the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]]) in February 2000 and was then performed in the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] Theater in New York City before a November 2002 performance in Laramie, Wyoming. The play has also been performed by high schools, colleges, and community theaters across the country, as well as professional playhouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tripatlas.com/The_Laramie_Project |title=The Laramie Project |publisher=Tripatlas.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later'' (2009)===
Almost a decade later, [[Tectonic Theater Project]] created a second play, titled ''The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later'', based on interviews with members of the town, Shepard's mother, and his incarcerated murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2009/10/04/333/ |title=Remembering a Cruel Murder: Laramie Revisited |publisher=Thefastertimes.com |date=2009-10-04 |accessdate=2010-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210233413/http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2009/10/04/333/ |archive-date=2009-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131670-Laramie-Project-Ten-Years-Later-to-Be-Read-Across-US|work=Playbill|date=August 4, 2009|title=Laramie Project: Ten Years Later to Be Read Across U.S.|author=Jones, Kenneth|access-date=2014-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927072320/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131670-Laramie-Project-Ten-Years-Later-to-Be-Read-Across-US|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In the ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' episode "A Private Life", on HBO, a gay man is brutally murdered in a way that mirrors Matthew Shepard's death.

Shepard's manner of death is mentioned in ''[[United States of Tara]]'', when Marshall is cautioned about his relationship with another character.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Matthew Shepard incident and the subsequent introduction of the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] inspired a story arc which spanned several episodes in the first season of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745682/trivia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of Madagascar''' reflects the origins of the [[Malagasy people]] in Southeast Asia and East Africa. The influence of Arabs, Indians, British, French and Chinese settlers is also evident. The most emblematic instrument of [[Madagascar]], the ''[[valiha]]'', is a [[bamboo]] tube [[zither]] carried to the island by early settlers from [[South Kalimantan|southern Borneo]], and is very similar in form to those found in [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and the [[Music of the Philippines|Philippines]] today.&lt;ref name="Blench, R. 1982 pp. 81-93"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blench | first = Roger | title = Evidence for the Indonesian origins of certain elements of African culture | journal = African Music | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–93 | year = 1982 | subscription=yes | jstor = 30249759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[Architecture of Madagascar|houses in Madagascar]] are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor | title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist |series=New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98–113 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis."&gt;Acquier (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;143–175&lt;/ref&gt; The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'', has evolved into a varied and refined art.&lt;ref&gt;Kusimba, Odland &amp; Bronson (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in [[Malagasy cuisine]], in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.&lt;ref name=Antal/&gt; African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland.

==Worldview and religions==
===Traditional worldview===
[[File:Mahafaly tomb painted carved south Madagascar.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Low rectangular tomb carved and painted with geometric shapes |Mahafaly tomb with traditional painted decoration]]
Approximately half of the country's population practice traditional religion,&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). The [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of ancestors]] has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the ''[[famadihana]]'', whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Muhammadan&gt;{{cite news|last=Bearak |first=Barry |title=Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration |newspaper=New York Times |page=A7 |date=5 September 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64fFKK5JL?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the island, many Malagasy make offerings out of respect to the ancestors, such as by pouring the first cap-full of each newly opened bottle of rum into the northeastern corner of the room.&lt;ref&gt;Nativel &amp; Rajaonah (2009), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'', taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.&lt;ref name=Bradtbeliefs&gt;Bradt (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social structure and values===
Each of the many ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize ''fihavanana'' (solidarity), ''vintana'' (destiny), ''tody'' (karma), and ''[[Hasina (Madagascar)|hasina]]'', a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.&lt;ref name="Bradtbeliefs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web| last = Metz | first = Helen Chapin |year = 1994 | title = Library of Congress Country Studies: Madagascar | url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ | accessdate =1 February 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051109090930/http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ | dead-url = no |archivedate = 9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity and roles within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;259–262, 272, 309&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy people traditionally consult ''Mpanandro'' ("Makers of the Days") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or ''famadihana'', according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ''ombiasy'' (from ''olona-be-hasina'', "man of much virtue") of the southeastern [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Ames (2003), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduced religions===
Almost half the Malagasy population practice Christianity, with practitioners of Protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=BGNote&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of African Affairs |title=Background Note: Madagascar |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=3 May 2011 |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Be3ZCkK?url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archivedate=24 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a [[minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]] to consecrate a ''famadihana'' reburial.&lt;ref name="Muhammadan" /&gt; Islam is practiced by around 7% of the population, with practitioners largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of [[Mahajanga]] and [[Antsiranana]]. The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s are [[Sunni]] and are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, [[Demographics of India|Indians]], [[Demography of Pakistan|Pakistanis]] and [[Comoros|Comorians]]. More recently, [[Hinduism]] was introduced to Madagascar through [[Gujarati people]] immigrating from the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[India]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{cite web | title = Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora | publisher = Ministry of External Affairs, India | year = 2004 | url = http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf | accessdate = 22 January 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030629092115/http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf | dead-url = yes | archivedate = 29 June 2003 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrations===
--&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Malagasy language|Languages of Madagascar}}
The Malagasy language is of [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,&lt;ref&gt;Rajaonarimanana (2001), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; can be clustered under one of two sub-groups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo; and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a [[francophone]] country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web| last = Metz | first = Helen Chapin |year = 1994 | title = Library of Congress Country Studies: Madagascar | url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ | accessdate =1 February 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051109090930/http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ | dead-url = no |archivedate = 9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
===Visual arts===
&lt;!--[painting, sculpture, weaving, textiles]--&gt;
Traditional arts are based on the creative use of local and natural materials. The tradition of silk weaving and [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]] production exemplifies this form of art. The weaving of [[Raffia palm|raffia]] and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.&lt;ref name=handicrafts&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashamu |first1=Charlotte |first2=Diego |last2=Gomez-Pickering |first3=Amanda |last3=Luke |last4=Morrison |first4=Paul |first5=Mark |last5=Pedersen |first6=Mara |last6=Symes |first7=Marthe |last7=Weyandt |title=Made in Madagascar: Exporting Handicrafts to the U.S. Market: Final Report |publisher=United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development |year=2005 |url=http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/concentrations/epd/documents/2004-5/MalagasyHandicrafts_Report.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604ZDmy4U?url=http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/concentrations/epd/documents/2004-5/MalagasyHandicrafts_Report.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, ''aloalo'' funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.&lt;ref name=Terrible&gt;Heale &amp; Abdul Latif (2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;108–111&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the [[Zafimaniry]] people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|list of Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodcrafting Knowledge of the Zafimaniry |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=24 August 2012 |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00080 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AA5SHVms?url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00080 |archivedate=24 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Antaimoro]] people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.&lt;ref name=Terrible/&gt; [[Embroidery]] and [[drawn thread work]] are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.&lt;ref name=handicrafts/&gt; A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Des nouveaux talents mis en relief | newspaper = L'Express de Madagascar | publisher = l'expressmada.com | date = 7 August 2009 | url = http://www.lexpressmada.com/4376/hosotra-2009-madagascar/284-des-nouveaux-talents-mis-en-relief.html | accessdate = 24 August 2012 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130509031614/http://www.lexpressmada.com/4376/hosotra-2009-madagascar/284-des-nouveaux-talents-mis-en-relief.html| archivedate = 9 May 2013 | dead-url = yes |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
&lt;!--[dance, drama, oratory, comedy]--&gt;
Theater and dance are strong traditions on the island. A traditional form of theater emerged in the form of the ''[[hiragasy]]'', a day-long spectacle of music, song, dance and oration performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes. The tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince [[Andrianampoinimerina]] first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches. These troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances. The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval.&lt;ref name = Mauro&gt;Mauro (2001), p.&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe Tarika Ramilison Fenoarivo led by [[Ramilison Besigara]] is considered the most popular and influential hira gasy troupe of the last four decades.&lt;ref name = cross&gt;{{cite news | title = Madagascar: Ramilison Besigara - Une vie pour le Hira Gasy | newspaper = L'Express de Madagascar | url = http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200711060390.html | date = 6 November 2007 | accessdate = 18 July 2013 |language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western theater was introduced with [[French Madagascar|French colonization]] in 1896, producing a new form of Malagasy theater that incorporated a series of short musical and dance performances set to songs accompanied by piano or guitar played in the style of traditional valiha culture songs. The compositions of this period by pianist theatrical composers like [[Andrianary Ratianarivo]] (1895–1949) and [[Naka Rabemananatsoa]] (1892–1952) form part of the canon of classical Malagasy music and feature in the repertoire of Malagasy students of piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rubin | first = Don | title = The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theater: Africa | publisher = Taylor and Francis | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TIgS_Eij8SEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Contemporary+Theater+africa+madagascar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yRTmTNeIBJGssAOds5ixCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn =978-0-415-05931-2 |accessdate = November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances accompanying theatrical performances represent only a fraction of the myriad diverse dance styles found across the island. Dance remains a living art and new styles are continually emerging. Many have lent their name to the style of music to which they are danced. In the 19th century royal court, the [[quadrille]] was danced to Malagasy-influenced piano tunes; the last of these Malagasy quadrilles, called the ''{{Proper name|Afindrafindrao}}'', was composed shortly before colonization and accompanies a specific partner dance. The tune and the dance were revived upon national independence as a distinctly Malagasy tradition now commonly performed to commence festivities such as weddings and concerts.

A wide range of performance traditions have developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its [[hainteny|oratory]], as expressed in the forms of ''hainteny'' (poetry), ''kabary'' (public discourse) and ''ohabolana'' (proverbs).&lt;ref&gt;Fox (1990), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madatana"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ravalitera |first=P |title=Origine Confuse des Vazimba du Betsiriry |work=Journal Express |publisher=Madatana.com |url=http://www.madatana.com/article-origine-confuse-des-vazimba-du-betsiriry.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604hJwBma?url=http://www.madatana.com/article-origine-confuse-des-vazimba-du-betsiriry.php |accessdate=11 November 2010 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the ''[[Ibonia]]'', has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibonia: the text in 17 sections |last=Unknown |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=15 November 2010 |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604h5KUmV?url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of oral history and traditional oratory were documented by British and French visitors to the island. The first Malagasy historian was Raombana (1809–1855), one of the first pupils of the [[London Missionary Society]] school at the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], who documented early 19th century Merina history in English and Malagasy. The ''[[Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara]]'', a compilation of the oral history of the Merina sovereigns, forms another major source of knowledge about traditional highland society and was collected and published in the late 19th century by a Catholic priest residing in the highlands. Western literary arts developed in the early 20th century under French colonization.

The first modern African poet, a Merina named [[Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo]] (1901 or 1903–1937), gained celebrity for blending surrealist, romantic and modernist poetic forms with elements of traditional Malagasy oratory, as well as his suicide by cyanide in 1937. Rabearivelo was also among the first to publish historical novels and wrote Madagascar's only Western-style opera.&lt;ref&gt;Rabearivelo (2007), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; This blending of Western and traditional influence in the literary arts was carried on by such artists as [[Elie Rajaonarison]], an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Auzias &amp; Labourdette (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable poets include [[Jacques Rabemananjara]], Pierre Randrianarisoa, Georges Andriamanantena (Rado), [[Dox (poet)|Jean Verdi Salomon Razakandraina (Dox)]] and others. Leading authors include [[Jean-Luc Raharimanana]], [[Michèle Rakotoson]], [[Clarisse Ratsifandrihamanana]], David Jaomanoro, Solofo Randrianja, Emilson Daniel Andriamalala and Celestin Andriamanantena. A number of comic books have also been created by Malagasy authors such as Anselme Razafindrainibe (1956–2011).

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Madagascar}}
[[File:Orchestre Hova1.jpg|thumb|right|Valiha orchestra at the [[Paris Colonial Exposition|Paris World Exposition]] of 1931]]
Madagascar has also developed a rich [[Music of Madagascar|musical heritage]], embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal ''[[salegy]]'' or highland ''[[hiragasy]]'' that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.&lt;ref name="Randrianary"&gt;Randrianary (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;109–137&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy music has been shaped by the musical traditions of [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Arabia]], England, France and the United States as successive waves of settlers have made the island their home.&lt;ref name="Nidel, R. 2005"&gt;Nidel (2005), p.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional instruments reflect these widespread origins: the ''mandoliny'' and ''kabosy'' owe their existence to the introduction of the [[acoustic guitar|guitar]] by early [[Arab]] or [[Europe]]an seafarers, the ubiquitous ''[[djembe]]'' originated in mainland [[Africa]] and the ''[[valiha]]''—the [[bamboo]] tube [[zither]] considered the national instrument of [[Madagascar]]—directly evolved from an earlier form of zither carried with the first [[Austronesian]] settlers on their [[outrigger canoe]]s.&lt;ref name="Blench, R. 1982 pp. 81-93"/&gt;

Malagasy music can be roughly divided into three categories: traditional, contemporary and popular music. Traditional musical styles vary by region and reflect local ethnographic history. For instance, in the [[Imerina|Highlands]], the valiha and more subdued vocal styles are emblematic of the [[Merina]], the predominantly Austronesian ethnic group that has inhabited the area since at least the 15th century, whereas among the southern [[Bara people]], who trace their ancestry back to the African mainland, their ''[[a cappella]]'' vocal traditions bear close resemblance to the [[polyharmony|polyharmonic]] singing style common to [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Anderson, I. 2000 pp. 523"&gt;Anderson (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;523–532&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign instruments such as the [[acoustic guitar]] and [[piano]] have been adapted locally to create uniquely Malagasy forms of music. Contemporary Malagasy musical styles such as the ''salegy'' or ''tsapika'' have evolved from traditional styles modernized by the incorporation of [[electric guitar]], [[Bass (guitar)|bass]], [[drum kit|drums]] and [[synthesizer]]. Many Western styles of popular music, including [[rock music|rock]], [[gospel]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip-hop]] and [[folk rock]], have also gained in popularity in Madagascar over the later half of the 20th century.

Rice (''vary'') is the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called ''laoka'' in the highlands dialect,&lt;ref name="Sibree1915"&gt;Sibree (1915), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; the official version of the [[Malagasy language]]. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking.&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;Bradt (2011), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faublée |first=Jacques |title=L'alimentation des Bara (Sud de Madagascar) |journal=Journal de la Société des Africanistes |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=157–202 |year=1942 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jafr_0037-9166_1942_num_12_1_2534 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yDebJAig?url=http://legacy.persee.fr/showPage.do?urn=jafr_0037-9166_1942_num_12_1_2534 |archivedate=April 25, 2011 |doi=10.3406/jafr.1942.2534 |language=French |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; ''trondro gasy'' (freshwater fish); ''ravitoto'' (shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork; ''henan'omby'' (beef) or ''akoho'' (chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ''ritra''); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Espagne-Ravo (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Savoir Cuisiner'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of local greens such as ''anamamy'' (Morelle greens), ''anamafaitra'' (Martin greens) and particularly ''anamalao'' ([[Acmella oleracea|paracress]])—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside ''anandrano'' ([[watercress]]) and ''anatsonga'' ([[Chinese cabbage|bok choy]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Savoir Cuisiner'' (2004), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the arid south and west, such as among the [[Bara people|Bara]] or [[Antandroy|Tandroy]] peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, [[millet]] and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.&lt;ref&gt;Faublée (1942), pp. 192, 194–196&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ro'' (broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice.&lt;ref&gt;Boissard (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, and salt are the most common ingredients used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or [[turmeric]] may also be used.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazi"&gt;Ashkenazi &amp; Michael (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;128–133&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Tat Chuen (2010), pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; The most common and basic condiment, ''sakay'', is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Tat Chuen (2010), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Indian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as ''[[Indian pickle|achards]]'' or ''lasary''), are a coastal specialty;&lt;ref name=achards&gt;Espagne-Ravo (1997), pp. 79–83&lt;/ref&gt; in the highlands, lasary often refers to a salad of green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a [[vinaigrette]] sauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Tat Chuen (2010), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of Madagascar}}
The architecture of Madagascar is unique in Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the [[Bubungan Tinggi|architecture of southern Borneo]] from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have emigrated.&lt;ref name="Wake, C.

The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved.&lt;ref name="Borneo"&gt;Winzeler (2004), p.&lt;/ref&gt; The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (''andry'') supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (''tandro-trano'').&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt; In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to the gable peak.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt; Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" &gt;Acquier (1997), p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation and sports==
[[File:Moraingy fighting Madagascar sport.jpg|thumb|Moraingy is a traditional martial art of Madagascar.]]
A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. ''[[Moraingy]]'', a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Ratsimbazafy (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–18&lt;/ref&gt; The wrestling of zebu cattle (''tolon-omby'') is also practiced in many regions.&lt;ref name=lambatradition&gt;Kusimba, Odland &amp; Bronson (2004), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is ''[[fanorona]]'', a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King [[Andrianjaka]] after his father [[Ralambo]] was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing ''fanorona'' to the detriment of his other responsibilities.&lt;ref name="iarivo"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries.

There are two cinemas in [[Antananarivo]] and one in [[Mahajanga]], all dating from the colonial era, but none show standard international releases or operate on a regular schedule. These venues instead occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.

The '''Dante Alighieri Society''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Società Dante Alighieri'') is a society that promotes [[Italian culture]] and language around the world. Today this society is present in more than 60 countries.

It was formed in [[Italy]] in July 1889. The society was named after [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321), a pre-[[Renaissance]] poet from [[Florence]] and the author of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Dante is considered the father of the Italian language.

In October 1948 the society was restructured at a meeting in [[Venice]] to give total autonomy to all chapters of the Dante Society so that each could conduct its activities independently, under the direction of its own elected officers, in a manner that best suited local needs, preferences, and capacities while adhering to the Society's basic principles.

== The cultural role of Dante Alighieri ==
The sole purpose of the Dante Alighieri Society is to "promote the study of the Italian language and culture throughout the world...a purpose independent of political ideologies, national or ethnic origins or religious beliefs, and that the Society is the free association of people – not just Italians – but all people everywhere who are united by their love for the Italian languages and culture and the spirit of universal [[humanism]] that these represent."

The society operates throughout the world, with branches from the [[United States]] to [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2011/10/dante_alighieri_society_plans.html |title=Dante Alighieri Society plans Columbus Day parade in Jersey City on Sunday |publisher=NJ.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many societies offer language courses, ranging from tourist and beginner's Italian to advanced literature, in addition to their cultural activities.

In 2005, the Dante Alighieri Society (along with the [[Alliance française]], [[British Council]], [[Goethe-Institut]], [[Instituto Cervantes]], and [[Instituto Camões]]) was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanities]].

==Recognition==
In 2005 Dante Alighieri Society was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] along with the [[Alliance française]], the [[British Council]], the [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Instituto Cervantes]], and the [[Instituto Camões]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">[[Suriname]] has an extensive educational system with free schooling compulsory until age 12. The Government and the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Moravian Church]]es provide education for [[kindergarten]] through [[secondary school]]. As a rule, all instruction is in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The four exceptions to this rule are the [http://www.iasuriname.org International Academy of Suriname], administered by a local Christian foundation, [[Christian Liberty Academy, Suriname|Christian Liberty Academy]], administered by the [[Caribbean Christian Ministries]], and the [[AlphaMax Academy]], a private nonsectarian school administered by the AlphaMax Foundation, and since 2011 Suriname International School, which provides k12 online school for high school students.

The [[adult literacy]] rate is approximately 89.6%. Teacher training institutes, secondary schools, and technical schools provide terminal degrees. Nurses and dental technicians are trained in conjunction with the medical faculty, but standards do not equal those found in more developed countries. The [[Anton de Kom University]] in Paramaribo has faculties of medicine, law, natural resources, and social and technical sciences. However, transfer of individual course credits to and from the U.S. is difficult, if not unlikely. Enrollment is very difficult for non-Dutch speaking persons as well. Many students still attend high schools and universities in the Netherlands. A growing number study in U.S. universities.

or '''egg jarping''' is a [[traditional Easter game]]. In English folk traditions, the game has variously been known as "shackling", "jarping" or "dumping".&lt;ref name=newall/&gt;

The rule of the game is simple. One holds a [[hard-boiled egg]] and taps the egg of another participant with one's own egg intending to break the other's, without breaking one's own. As with any other game, it has been a subject of cheating; eggs with [[cement]], [[alabaster]], and even [[marble]] cores have been reported.&lt;ref name=newall/&gt;

==History==
The egg was a symbol of rebirth, adopted by early [[Christians]] as a symbol of the [[resurrection of Jesus]] at Easter.

During [[medieval|medieval times]], egg tapping was practiced in Europe. For instance, the practice was mentioned to have played an important part in the 14th century in [[Zagreb]] in relation to the Easter festival.&lt;ref name=hic&gt;[http://www.hic.hr/uskrs-hrvata02.htm Hrvatski informativni centar: Uskrs u Hrvata] ''"U starom Zagrebu i njegovoj okolici tucanje jajima upozoravalo je na Uskrs kao prijelomnicu u vremenu pa su tim događajem označavali i vrijeme, bilježeći u dokumentima u 14. stoljeću da se nešto dogodilo "poslije tucanja jaja", tj. poslije Uskrsa."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaje&gt;[http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/hrvatski-uskrsni-obicaji-tucanje-jaja-ukrasavanje-pisanica-i-paljenje-vuzmice/548628.aspx Hrvatski uskrsni obicaji: Tucanje jaja, ukrasavanje pisanica i paljenje vuzmice]: ''U nekim tekstovima se navodi da se "tucanje jajima" spominje još u 14. stoljeću u starom Zagrebu i okolici, no prakticira se gotovo u svim dijelovima Hrvatske.''&lt;/ref&gt; A study of folklore quotes an early 15th-century reference Poland.&lt;ref name=newall&gt;Venetia Newall (1971) ''An Egg at Easter: A Folklore Study'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=C6M9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22egg+tapping+is%22&amp;sig=IIONMC3CdMM6Ze5XBsnYJ4uQqHM p. 344]&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, in colonial New Amsterdam in the 1600s, "cracking of eggs" was invented by Jonathon Day on Easter Monday with the winner keeping both eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Peter of New Amsterdam: A Story of Old New York, by James Otis, Living Books Press (July 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Revolutionary war egg picking was observed by a British prisoner of war, Thomas Anbury, in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick Town]] in [[Maryland]] in 1781 during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The local custom at that time was to dye the eggs with [[Logwood]] or Bloodwood to give them a crimson color which as Anbury observed gave them "great strength".&lt;ref name=Clarkson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarkson|first=Paul S.|title=Egg-picking|journal=Maryland Historical Magazine |date=December 1956|volume=51|issue=4|page=355|url=http://www.mdhs.org|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Anbury was a young British officer who travelled extensively as a prisoner-of-war during the American Revolution. Anbury was near [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick Town]] in [[Maryland]], July 11, 1781, when he noted the egg picking custom which was prevalent at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Anbury|title=Travels through the Interior Parts of America|location=London|year=1789|volume=II|p=500–1}} as quoted in the Maryland Historical Magazine article. Anbury's book was also published in France, see [[Ceinture fléchée#cite ref-3|Ceinture fléchée]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, a Baltimore Maryland newspaper, [[The Baltimore Sun|the Evening Sun]] would devote an editorial column to discussing street cries, ritual, techniques for the game.&lt;ref name=Clarkson/&gt; Clarkson cites the Baltimore [[The Baltimore Sun|Evening Sun]] for 29 March 1933 (editorial page), and in the Sunday Sun for 17 April 1949 (brown section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Annie Weston Whitney and Caroline Canfield Bullock|title=Folklore from Maryland|year=1925|publisher=American Folk-lore Society,|location=New York, NY|page=117|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.agy7782.0001.001;view=plaintext;page=root;size=100;seq=124;num=116}}Cited by Clarkson in their article, see above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century egg cracking is still practiced every Easter by the [[Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York]] at the annual Pass Easter Ball.

==Competition==
In England, the game is played between pairs of competitors who repeatedly knock the pointed ends of their eggs together until one of the eggs cracks; the overall winner is the one whose egg succeeds in breaking the greatest number of other eggs. The world egg-jarping championships have been held each Easter Sunday at Peterlee Cricket And Social Club [[County Durham]], England, since 1983. Proceeds from the event are donated to the [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Jarpers vie for egg-bashing title |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7996823.stm |accessdate=13 April 2009 |date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many places in [[Louisiana]], egg-tapping is a serious competition event. [[Marksville, Louisiana|Marksville]] claims to be the first to make it into an official event in 1956. In the past some cheaters used [[guinea hen]] eggs, which are smaller and have harder shells. Nowadays guinea egg knocking is a separate contest category. Preparation for this contest has turned into a serious science. People now know which breeds of chicken lay harder eggs and at what time. The chickens must be fed with [[calcium]]-rich food and have plenty of exercise. Proper boiling of the contest eggs is also a serious issue. Some rules are well known, such as eggs must be boiled tip down, so that the air pocket is on the butt end. There is also the rule that the champion must break and eat their eggs to prove they are not a fake.&lt;ref&gt;"Egg tapping elevated to a high art in Acadiana" by Judy Stanford, ''Daily Advertiser'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], April 4, 1999 ([http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/METISGEN/2006-04/1145155719 ])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/creole_art_egg_knocking.html "If Your Eggs Are Cracked, Please Step Down: Easter Egg Knocking in Marksville"], by Sheri Lane Dunbar, Ph.D. (anthropology), first published in the 1989 Louisiana Folklife Festival booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other cultures and languages==
In [[Assam]] (a state of [[India]] in which the easternmost indigenous [[Indo-European language]] is spoken) the game is called ''[[Koni-juj]]'' (''Koni'' = Egg; ''Juj'' = Fight). It is held every year on the day of ''Goru Bihu'' (the cattle day) of [[Rongali Bihu]], which falls in mid-April and on the day of [[Bhogali Bihu]], in January.

In [[Croatia]], both coloured eggs and uncoloured Easter eggs are used as everyone picks an egg to tap or have tapped; every egg is used until the last person with the unbroken egg is declared the winner, sometimes winning a money pool.

In the [[Netherlands]] the game is called ''eiertikken''. Children line up with baskets of coloured eggs and try to break those in another person’s basket. But players must only break ones of the same colour as their own.&lt;ref name="polan"&gt;see {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]], visitors strike red eggs against one held by the head of the household and exchange the greetings "Christ has risen!" and "He has risen indeed!" The person who keeps an unbroken egg is said to enjoy the longest life.&lt;ref name="polan" /&gt;

Christians in [[Bulgaria]] have a similar tradition of egg cracking. Adults and children alike each take an egg, then go around tapping each other. The belief is that the winner of the egg tapping contest (whoever's egg doesn't crack) will have the best health that year. Additionally, when dyeing the eggs, the first egg must be red. It is typically preserved until the next year as a token of luck and good health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/obshtestvo/1999/04/10/249793_velikden_-_razchupvaite_kozunaci/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mc.government.bg/reg/images/events/180/smolyan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143341/http://www.mc.government.bg/reg/images/events/180/smolyan.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinar.net/news/vselenata-na-iajtceto_MjYzMjszMQ==.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Central European Catholics of various nationalities call the tradition '''''epper''''', likely from the [[German language|German]] word ''Opfer'', also used to name the practice, which means 'sacrifice' or, literally, offering.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post Gazette
Storytelling: About those knocking Easter eggs

[[Ruthenians]] have a tradition of rolling the eggs in a game called ''čokatisja''. Children roll eggs on the meadows like marbles or tap them by hand. If an egg is cracked, then it belongs to the child whose egg cracked it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wirnowski.com/Carp/Pas_Customs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greeks]] call the practice ''tsougrisma'' (τσούγκρισμα), meaning to clink together.&lt;ref&gt;"The word tsougrisma means "clinking together" or "clashing." In Greek: τσούγκρισμα, pronounced TSOO-grees-mah." http://greekfood.about.com/od/greeklenteaster/f/tsougrisma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish]] culture hard-boiled eggs are part of the [[Passover Seder]] celebration. Toward the end of the traditional readings, hard-boiled eggs are distributed among guests, who may then play the egg-tapping game.

'''''Fever Zine''''' was a quarterly [[zine]] based in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].

Its contents focus mainly on music, art, [[DIY culture]], trends and e-culture, with fashion, music videos and other zines also featuring heavily.

The zine was created, and is edited, by British music and arts journalist Alex Zamora with design by graphic designer Simon Whybray.

According to its [[MySpace]] profile the publication is available at a variety of cultural hotspots in London such as the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], as well as around the United Kingdom.

==Appearance==
Printed in black and white on A4 paper, its front and back covers are pink while the inside pages are white. It uses distinctive hand-drawn typography on its cover and on its article titles.

In an interview with Italian magazine ''Beautiful Freaks'', it was revealed that Issue 1's cover was purposefully left blank, with only the logo present. According to Zamora this was done to establish the zine's logo and identity with readers and maintain curiosity about its content.

The cover of Issue 2 was drawn by acclaimed British illustrator [[Andy Council]] and is based on the [[Spinosaurus]] from the movie ''[[Jurassic Park 3]]''. According to his website, Council has nicknamed it "Feversaurus".

==Content and contributors==

''Fever Zine'' contains original writing, photography and illustration by a variety of contributors, all of whom are listed on its MySpace profile.

According to an article in the November 2007 issue of ''Grafik'' magazine, its contributors are wholly drawn from MySpace and range from art students to creative professionals, from the U.K, Europe and the rest of the world.

Interviews in Issue 1 include [[Hot Club De Paris]] and [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]].

Issue 2 interviews include [[Pop Levi]], [[Ladytron]] and acclaimed music video director [[Nima Nourizadeh]].

Issue 3 features interviews with Sarah McCrory of independent publishing fair [[Publish And Be Damned]], [[RESFest]] founder Jonathan Wells, [[Pancake Mountain]] creator Scott Stuckey and Liverpool band [[To My Boy]].

==Press coverage==
''Fever Zine'' has newspaper, magazine and online coverage, most of which concentrates on the publication's content and especially on its use of social networking.

In an article published on the Media section of ''[[The Guardian]]'' website on 7 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/07/myspace.digitalmedia/ Jemima Kiss, "Online rise of cheemos and rudettes",] ''The Guardian'', 7 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; journalist Jemima Kiss detailed a report highlighting individuals and entities in the creative industries with strong followings on MySpace, singling out ''Fever Zine'' for its unique use of social networking;

"The underground, hand-photocopied magazine Fever Zine coordinates contributors and subscribers through its MySpace page.

Fever Zine has 5,000 friends and a cult following; editor Alex Zamora said MySpace was essential to help find the new talent that he wants to feature in the lo-fi publication."

March 2008 saw the zine further championed by leading German culture and arts magazine [[Lodown magazine|''Lodown'']] in their 60th issue. Picked as the only British publication in their print review section, ''Fever Zine'' was lauded as offering up "healthy brainfood" for its readers.

An online interview with Zamora for ''[[Swindle Magazine]]'' &lt;ref&gt;http://swindlemagazine.com/news/fever-zine-and-the-world-wide-web/&lt;/ref&gt; by editor Anne Keehn, posted on 19 March 2007, revealed MySpace's "seminal" role in the zine's success:

"The Internet, and MySpace in particular, played a seminal role, allowing us to disseminate images, stockist information and of course sell the zine online. Quite simply without it there’d be no Fever Zine."

==Issues==
Issue 1 was first published in early 2007 and, according to the Grafik article, created using [[Microsoft Word]], a scanner, a [[fineliner]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] while Issue 2, designed by Whybray, was created using [[Adobe InDesign]].

Issue 2 was featured in an article by journalist Helen Sumpter in [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] London on the 23rd of July. It was picked as one of the zines to look out for at 2007's Publish And Be Damned independent publishing fair.

Issue 3 debuted at the London Zine Symposium 2008 on 27 April.

Issue 5 is due to be released in 2014.

==Events==
''Fever Zine'' took part in 2008's [[London Zine Symposium]] at East London's Rag Factory venue on 27 April. This followed its participation at the previous year's event which took place on 21 April at the [[Horse Hospital]] in [[Bloomsbury]], London.&lt;ref&gt;http://londonzinesymposium.org.uk/news/confirmed-stalls-for-this-years-symposium/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to independent publishing fair [[Publish And Be Damned]]'s website, the publication took part in the 2007 fair in London on 29 July and is due to return on 3 August for 2008's event.

''Fever Zine'' also took part in the 2008 [[V&amp;A Village Fete]] at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London on 25 and 26 July.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/activ_events/events/friday_evenings/friday_late/events/friday_late_july_08/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geelong Keys''' were a set of five [[Key (lock)|keys]] discovered in 1847 at Limeburners Point, on the southern shore of [[Corio Bay]], near [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. In September of that year, [[Charles La Trobe]], Superintendent of the [[Port Phillip District]] and a keen amateur geologist, was examining marine deposits revealed by excavations associated with [[lime (material)|lime]] production in the area. A worker showed him two of a set of five keys he claimed to have found the day before, in a layer of shells {{convert|15|ft}} down an excavation for a lime kiln, which was about {{convert|40|ft}} from the shoreline. La Trobe was fascinated by the find and believed, from their appearance, that the keys were between 100 and 150 years old (~1700-1750 [[AD]]).

Since the 1802 expedition of [[Matthew Flinders]] is the earliest proven European presence in the vicinity, writer [[Kenneth McIntyre]] has suggested the keys may have originated with some earlier European explorers of the region, possibly the [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=mcintyre&gt;{{cite book|last1=McIntyre|first1=Kenneth Gordon|title=The Secret Discovery of Australia: Portuguese Ventures 200 Years before Captain Cook|date=1977|publisher=Souvenir Press|location=Medindie, South Australia|isbn=0-285-62303-6|pages=249-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntyre has connected the discovery of the Geelong Keys with the presence of the so-called [[Mahogany Ship]], further west on Victoria's [[Shipwreck Coast]], claiming that it could be another possible relic of early Portuguese exploration.

The editor of the [[Geelong Advertiser]] at the time, [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], noted that metal objects were often embedded in new diggings to detect the leaching of payable metal. For instance, a copper oxide coating on the keys would suggest the presence of copper. Ronald Gunn, a friend of La Trobe, told the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] in September 1849 that he had gone to Geelong to investigate the discovery. On questioning the limeburner he found that the keys had not, in fact, been dug out of the shell layer but were found with shells at the bottom of the pit. It was only assumed that they had fallen from the upper layer. In practice they could have fallen from any layer, including the top of the excavation.&lt;ref name=whitehat&gt;{{cite web|title=The White Hat Guide to 7 Mysteries of Victoria |url=http://www.whitehat.com.au/Melbourne/History/7Mysteries.asp |website=White Hat |accessdate=2016-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330034325/http://whitehat.com.au/Melbourne/History/7Mysteries.asp |archivedate=2015-03-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The keys were the subject of two pamphlets published by the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] in the 1870s. The first of these suggested that the depth at which the keys allegedly lay indicated an age closer to 200–300 years. The second pamphlet repudiated this claim and was based on an interview with a limeburner, who said that the keys may have been dropped down a hole to that depth. Research in the 1980s by geologist [[Edmund Dwen Gill|Edmund Gill]], and engineer and historian [[Peter F. B. Alsop|Peter Alsop]], showed the age of the deposit in which the keys were supposedly found was between 2330 and 2800 years. According to Gill and Alsop, La Trobe's error is quite understandable, given that in 1847 most people thought the earth was only 6000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, E. (1987) “On the McKiggan Theory of the Geelong keys” in ''The Mahogany ship. Relic or Legend? Proceedings of the Second Australian Symposium on the Mahogany Ship.'', Potter, B. (ed.), Warrnambool Institute Press, pp.83-86, {{ISBN|0-949759-09-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The keys themselves, and all original drawings of them, have been lost.&lt;ref name=whitehat/&gt; By the time they were shown to La Trobe, one had been lost by the limeburners' children and one had been given to a passer-by. Latrobe gave one to his friend, Ronald Gunn, and the other two went to the [[Melbourne]] [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanic's Institute]], from which they were lost after the institute went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=mcintyre/&gt; 

The keys are referred to in the children's books ''[[The Voyage of the Poppykettle]]'' and ''The Unchosen Land'', by [[Robert Ingpen]]. In the stories, the keys are used as [[sailing ballast|ballast]] in a clay-pot ship sailed by migrant [[Peru]]vian [[gnome]]s. The stories were so popular in Ingpen's hometown, [[Geelong]], that a fountain and an annual [[Poppykettle Festival]] celebrate the mythical landing of the "hairy Peruvians".

'''Indo-Aryanisation''' means to [[language shift|change language from a previous language]] to an [[Indo-Aryan language]].

==Indo-Aryanisation of Indo-Greeks, Indo-Hepthalites, Indo-Scythians==
In the northwestern Indian subcontinent, the stray [[Indo-Greeks]], [[Hephthalites]] and [[Saka]] Scythians, became absorbed into the greater Indo-Aryan population of the subcontinent when losing their own government being replaced by a successive empire. Many Indo-Aryan ethnic groups claim ancestry of these ancient peoples. Such Indo-Aryan ethnic groups being supposedly of such ancestry are most notably, the Punjabis, Sindhis, Rajasthanis and Gujaratis.

==Indo-Aryanisation of Indian Arabs, Indian Africans, Indian Jews and Jewish origin groups==
Three religious groups in Kerala, the [[Mappila]] Muslim community, who trace their origins to the Arab traders, the [[Nasrani (India)|Nasrani]] Christians who trace their roots back to Syrian missionaries, and the [[Cochin Jewish]] communities who trace their origins to Jewish traders at the turn of the millennium in Kerala, underwent a process of Indo-Aryanisation as they were absorbed over time and adopted customs from their surrounding Indian community. The [[Indian African]] Siddi community in Karnataka who were brought to India originally by the Muslim rulers in 12th-13th century as military slaves, eventually worked up their way to the higher ranks in the armies of the Indian rulers and slowly assimilated into the local communities.

==Middle Ages==

===Parsi===
The [[Parsi]] community, concentrated in Gujarat, are descendants of Zoroastrian refugees who fled from Greater Iran migrating into Gujarat, to fled from the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]], since their religion was undergoing marginalization by Islam. These Zoroastrians began to lose their original language, adopting the local Indo-Aryan languages ex.([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), and have adopted many elements of the culture in Gujarat. Parsi is the preserved term for Farsi, since the Arabic phonology changed the P to a F. Thus Parsi directly means, Persian.

===Muslim migration into the Indian Subcontinent===
During the Muslim rule of the Northern and Northwestern Subcontinent, the rulers, who themselves were mostly of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] origin, began to adopt the Indo-Aryan languages as their native tongue. For this reason many of these Turkic and Afghan rulers assimilated into Indo-Aryan speakers, thus many Indian Muslims today claim descent of these ancient peoples.

===Mughals===
The Turco-Mongol [[Mughals]] initially spoke [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], a Turkic language, then adopted [[Persian language|Persian]] before adopting [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (later known as ''Zaaban-i-Ordu'' or "language of the horde" and thereafter simply "Urdu"), an Indo-Aryan language, as their new native tongue.

===Ahoms===

Originally one of the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] tribes, the [[Ahom people]] assimilated to [[Hinduism]] and other elements of Hindu culture after their migration to [[Assam]] and nearby regions. Gradually the [[Ahom language]] spoken by the tribe was replaced by [[Assamese language|Assamese]], an Indo-Aryan language. As a result, the [[Ahom language]] is extinct as a spoken language and only used for ritualistic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Dipima Buragohain. ''Issues of Language Contact and Shift in Tai Ahom''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change of formal language from Persian to Hindustani===
{{Main article|History of Hindustani}}
Hindustani evolved from Turko-Persian rulers attempting to learn the local Sanskrit dialects of the northern and northwestern areas of the subcontinent, giving rise to the [[Hindustani language]] which later also became known by its modern-day variants [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].

=== Early Pashtun (Afghan) settlers in the Indian Subcontinent===
Afghans came from eastern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Afghania]] further into the subcontinent to claim a land called Rohillakand and then got assimilated ultimately adopting Urdu, forgetting Pashto, when being overruled by Mughals. Mughals and Pashtuns had an ancient history of bitterness. Pathan was an Indo-Aryanised version of the name Pashtun. Many Rohilla Pashtuns began inter-marriage with their neighboring Indian Muslims. To this reason, Pashto-Speakers of Afghanistan and Afghania will not consider them as Pashtuns, believing that they have very little Pashtun blood in them. Many Pathans will claim their pure Pashtun, due to the concept in Asia, that someones Paternal Lineage to determines their ethnicity, and even in the Pakhtunwali, ones father has to be Pashtun, when being determined an ethnic Pashtun. When in India, the Rohilla identity is present among Indian Muslims, but when moving into Pakistan, the identity strikingly decreases, as Rohillas consider the "Pakistani" identity instead of Rohilla. 30-35% of Muhajirs in Pakistan are likely Rohilla Pashtuns, but is likely to become absorbed into the central Pakistani culture. When claiming Afghan descent, would ultimately mean Pashtun, since the name in the past was an ethnic term and not a nationality, since the change of the name Afghan from ethnicity to nationality didn't happen until 50 years ago.

==Modern South Asia==
Indo-Aryanisation occurs in South Asia today

===India===

====Dravidians====
During the declaration of Hindi as an official language of India, many criticisms were received from some populations of India. Notably from Tamils. It was proposed that certain people feared to undergo language shift into Hindi. The Munda and Sino-Tibetan speakers also have a risk to become Indo-aryanised.

===Pakistan===
{{See also|Pakistani people}}

==== Underlying issue of Pashtun national decline====
{{Further information|Pashtunistan|Durand Line}}

During the Durand agreement, this concern was apparent from the start. A few Pashtuns are now worried about becoming absorbed into the Pakistani and Tajik(in Afghanistan) culture, as already split by a boundary. Though many Pashtuns in Pakistan now consider themselves Pakistani and support the country, some also have anti-sentiments against the dominance of the Indo-Aryan culture, by sometimes criticizing it as a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] culture, instead of Pakistani, just to still be associated with Pakistan.

==== Indo-Aryanisation of Pashtuns in Pakistan====
A Pattern in Pakistan occurs among Pashtuns, who urbanize or intermarry, often end up having their generation and themselves becoming Indo-Aryans, a similar process occurs in Afghanistan where Pashtuns [[Persianize]].

====Baloch and Brahuis====
The Baloch and Brahui, with Baloch speaking an Iranic language and Brahuis speaking a Dravidian language are at some risk to become Indo-Aryanised, especially the fact, the [[Brahui language]] is at a high risk of being lost.

{{IPA notice}}
This article discusses the [[phonology]] of the [[Inuit languages]]. Unless otherwise noted, statements refer to [[Inuktitut]] dialects of [[Canada]].

Most [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] varieties have fifteen [[consonant]]s and three [[vowel]] qualities (with phonemic [[vowel length|length]] distinctions for each). Although [[Inupiatun]] and [[Qawiaraq language|Qawiaraq]] have [[retroflex consonant]]s, retroflexes have otherwise disappeared in all the Canadian and Greenlandic dialects.

==Vowels==
[[File:West Greenlandic vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a [[vowel chart]]. Adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Fortescue|1990|p=317}}.]]
Almost all [[dialect]]s of Inuktitut have only three basic vowels and make a [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinction between short and long vowels. In ''Inuujingajut'' (the standard alphabet of [[Nunavut]]) long vowels are written as a double vowel.

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
! IPA !! Inuujingajut
|-
| {{IPA|/a/}} || '''a'''
|-
| {{IPA|/aː/}} || '''aa'''
|-
| {{IPA|/i/}} || '''i'''
|-
| {{IPA|/iː/}} || '''ii'''
|-
| {{IPA|/u/}} || '''u'''
|-
| {{IPA|/uː/}} || '''uu'''
|}

In western [[Alaska]], [[Qawiaraq]] and to some degree the Malimiutun variant of [[Inupiatun]] retains an additional vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} which was present in proto-Inuit and is still present in [[Yupik languages|Yupik]], but which has become {{IPA|/i/}} or sometimes {{IPA|/a/}} in all other dialects. Thus, the common Inuktitut word for water – '''imiq''' – is '''emeq''' {{IPA|(/əməq/)}} in Qawiaraq.{{sfnp|Kaplan|1990|p=145}}

Furthermore, many [[diphthong]]s in the Alaskan dialects have merged, suggesting the beginnings of a new more complex vowel scheme with more than three distinct vowels. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in the [[Kobuk, Alaska|Kobuk]] area, where the diphthongs {{IPA|/ua/}} and {{IPA|/au/}} are now both pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. Other diphthongs are also affected.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In contrast to the larger number of vowel contrasts in Alaskan dialects, in the dialect of northwest [[Greenland]] (particularly [[Upernavik]]), the phoneme {{IPA|/u/}} has been replaced by {{IPA|/i/}} in many contexts.

Otherwise, the three-vowel scheme described above holds for all of the Inuktitut dialects.

West Greenlandic vowels have a very wide range of allophones:
* {{IPA|/a/}} varies between {{IPAblink|e̞}}, {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, {{IPAblink|æ}}, {{IPAblink|a|a̠}}, {{IPAblink|ä}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̟}}. The last allophone appears before and especially between uvulars.{{sfnp|Fortescue|2002|p=317}}
* {{IPA|/i/}} varies between {{IPAblink|i}}, {{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̟}}, {{IPAblink|e|e̠}}, {{IPAblink|e̞|e̽}} and {{IPAblink|ə}}. The last allophone appears before and especially between uvulars.{{sfnp|Fortescue|2002|p=317}}
* {{IPA|/u/}} varies between {{IPAblink|u|u̟}}, {{IPAblink|u}}, {{IPAblink|ʊ|ʊ̠}}, {{IPAblink|o}} and {{IPAblink|o̞}}. The last allophone appears before and especially between uvulars.{{sfnp|Fortescue|2002|p=317}}

==Consonants==
The Nunavut dialects of Inuktitut have fifteen distinct consonants, though some have more.

* {{IPA|/ɟ/}} appears only in Natsilingmiutut. Everywhere else it has merged with {{IPA|/j/}}; it is not written with a separate letter.
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is realized as voiced velar fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}} in Siglitun. In other dialects, this realization may also be found between vowels or vowels and approximants.
* {{IPA|/ʁ/}} [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to preceding nasal consonants by being realized as a uvular nasal {{IPAblink|ɴ}}. It is written {{angbr|r}} in ''Inuujingajut'' orthography.

==Stress==
Primary stress is said to fall on the last syllable of each word.{{sfnp|Gordon|2002|p=544}}

==Intonation==
In Inuktitut, [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] is important in distinguishing some words – particularly [[interrogative]]s – but it is not generally marked in writing. There are some [[minimal pair]]s in Inuktitut where only pitch distinguishes between two different words, but they are rare enough that context usually disambiguates them in writing. One common case, however, is ''suva''. A high pitch on the first syllable followed by a falling pitch on the second syllable means "What did you say?" A middle pitch on the first syllable followed by a rising pitch on the second means "What did he do?"

In general, Inuktitut uses intonation to mark questions in much the way English does. When an interrogative pronoun is used, pitch falls at the end of a question. When there is no interrogative pronoun, pitch rises on the last syllable.

Inuktitut speakers tend to lengthen vowels with a rising intonation. So, a rising tone is sometimes indicated indirectly by writing a double vowel:

:
{|
| style="text-align: right;" | ''She can speak Inuktitut''.
| rowspan="2" | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| style="text-align: left;" | '''Inuktitut uqaqtuq.'''
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | ''Does she speak Inuktitut?''
| style="text-align: left;" | '''Inuktitut uqaqt&lt;u&gt;uu&lt;/u&gt;q?'''
|}

==Phonotactics and Sandhi==
An Inuktitut [[syllable]] cannot contain more than one segment in the onset or coda.  Thus [[consonant cluster]]s like {{IPA|/st/}} or {{IPA|/pl/}} that might arise from morphemes being joined together are deleted.  There are also some restrictions on final consonants, where only voiceless stops ({{IPA|/p t k q/}}) can occur unless consonant [[sandhi]] has occurred.

Although two-segment consonant clusters occur when morphemes are joined together, three-segment clusters are consistently simplified.  Additional constraints on two-segment clusters divide consonants into three [[manner of articulation]] groups:

{|
| rowspan="3" | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]]:
| p t k q s ł
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Voiced consonant|Voiced]]:
| v l j g ʁ
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]:
| m n ŋ
|}

Clusters must be of the same manner of articulation so that, e.g. {{IPA|/tp/}}, {{IPA|/vl/}}, and {{IPA|/mŋ/}} are permitted, but {{IPA|*/nt/}}, {{IPA|*/qɡ/}}, and {{IPA|*/lŋ/}} are not. Where the morphology of Inuktitut places such incompatible consonants together, they are either replaced by a [[gemination|geminated consonant]] – in effect, total [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] – or as a single consonant that takes its manner of articulation from one segment, and its [[place of articulation]] from the other. The process of eliminating three-segment clusters is similar with one of them disappearing. As a general rule, assimilation in Inuktitut is regressive – the first consonant takes its manner of articulation from the second consonant. But this varies amongst different dialects; the West Greenland dialect in particular tends to use progressive assimilation – the second consonant takes the manner of articulation from the first.

This limitation on consonant clusters is not quite universal across Inuit areas. One of the distinguishing features of western Alaskan dialects like Qawiaraq and Malimiutun is that nasal consonants can appear after consonants with other manners of articulation (this was a feature of [[Proto-Eskimo language|Proto-Inuit]] as well as modern [[Yupik languages]]). Some examples include the Malimiut word ''qipmiq'' ('dog'; ''qimmiq'' in Inupiatun) and the Qawiaraq word ''iqniq'' ('fire'; ''inniq'' in other Inuktitut dialects).

Otherwise, different dialects have ''more'' phonotactic restrictions. In all forms of Inuktitut, {{IPA|/qk/}} is impossible. In Inupiatun, Siglitun, and Inuinnaqtun (the far western dialects), all other consonant pairs are possible. Moving further east, the general rule is that more and more double consonants become geminated consonants. Determining which double consonants are assimilated depends on the [[place of articulation]] of the first consonant in the pair:

{|
| rowspan="4" | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

| t l n
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | Velar:
| k g ŋ
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | Uvular:
| q ʁ
|}

In the [[Aivilik dialect]], [[North Baffin dialect|North]] and [[South Baffin]], and all dialects spoken further south and east, all double consonants starting with an [[alveolar consonant]] are geminated:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

|-

|}

In the North and South Baffin dialects, as well as the dialects to the south and east of [[Baffin Island]], double consonants starting with a [[labial consonant]] are also geminated.  E.g. North Baffin ''takaga'''kk'''u'' ('because I see her') vs. Aivilingmiutut ''takuga'''pk'''u''

In South Baffin, Nunavik, Greenland and Labrador, double consonants starting with a [[velar consonant]] are also geminated:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: auto;"

|}

In addition, some dialects of Inuktitut pronounce [bl] ([vl] in Inupiatun) in place of the geminated lateral approximant /ll/. The phonological status of this distinction is uncertain – some dialects have both [bl] and [ll]. This feature is generally characteristic of western and central dialects as opposed to eastern ones.

Furthermore, '''o''' in the Kalaallisut alphabet represents the same phoneme as '''u''' in the alphabets used for other varieties of Inuktitut. Contrasts between alphabets are described below.''{{specify|date=March 2012}}

Double consonants where the second consonant is {{IPA|/s/}} undergo more complex changes across dialects. In some cases assimilation is progressive (from the first consonant to the second), in others regressive, and in still others double consonants are neutralised into a single form.

&lt;!-- Need Example --&gt;

==Other systematic dialectical variations==

===Consonant weakening in Qawiaraq===
Many phonemes in the [[Qawiaraq]] dialect have undergone a process of [[Consonant mutation|consonant weakening]], although to what degree varies somewhat between villages.  This process is motivated in part by [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and parallels the consonant weakening processes at work in [[Yupik languages|Yupik]].  As a result, many [[Stop consonant|stops]] have become [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and many fricatives have become [[Semivowel|glides]] or completely disappeared.  For example, the word ''meat'' – '''niqi''' in most dialects – is rendered as '''nigi''' in Qawiaraq – the stop {{IPA|/q/}} has become the fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

Consonant weakening is most noticeable in the area adjacent to the [[Bering Strait]] in the westernmost part of [[Alaska]].

===Palatalization in Inupiatun===
The historical fourth vowel of Inuktitut – the [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} – affected the pronunciation of [[alveolar consonant]]s following it. Where an {{IPA|/i/}} was present in proto-Inuktitut, the following consonant is [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] in modern Inupiatun (except where it has been assibilated – [[#Assibilation|see ''assibilation'' below]]). Thus, for example, {{IPA|/t/}} becomes {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, spelled '''ch''' alone and '''tch''' when geminated, after some '''i'''{{'}}s but not others. For example, the second person singular pronoun '''ilvit''' – ''you'' – in more easterly dialects of Inuktitut becomes '''ilvich''' in Inupiatun. In contrast, '''iqit''' (''fist'', '''iqitii''' in Canadian Inuktitut), which was pronounced {{IPA|[əqət]}} in proto-Inuktitut, retains its stop {{IPA|/t/}}.

Similar processes affect other alveolar consonants:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: auto;"
! [[Alveolar consonant]] !! [[Palatal consonant]] !! Inupiatun spelling !! Example
|-
| {{IPA|/t/}} || {{IPA|/tʃ/}} || '''ch''' ('''tch''' when geminated) || ilvit =&gt; ilvich (''you sg.'')
|-
| {{IPA|/n/}} || {{IPA|/ɲ/}} || '''ñ''' || inuk =&gt; iñuk (''person'')
|-
| {{IPA|/l/}} || {{IPA|/ʎ/}} || '''ḷ''' || silami =&gt; siḷami (''outside'')
|}

In the Malimiut variant of Inupiatun, this process is extended to some [[velar consonant]]s, like {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.

===Assibilation===
In a number of dialects, {{IPA|/t/}} preceded by an {{IPA|/i/}} derived from an *{{IPA|/i/}} in Proto-Inuktitut rather than an *{{IPA|/ə/}} may become an {{IPA|/s/}} (or an {{IPA|/h/}} in [[#Fricative substitution in western Nunavut|dialects that use '''"h"''' in place of '''"s"''']]) when followed by another vowel:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: auto;"
! English
! Inupiatun
! Siglitun
! Natsilingmiutut
! Kivallirmiutut
! North Baffin
! Kalaallisut
|-
| he/she comes in
| isiqtuq
| itiqtuaq
| ihiqtuq
| itiqtuq
| isiqtuq
| iserpoq
|}

This feature varies from dialect to dialect and does not follow a consistent east/west pattern, as [[assibilation]] is present in some words in both Alaskan Inupiatun and Greenlandic [[Kalaallisut]].  The exact conditions in which [[Proto-Inuktitut]] consonants have been assibilated vary from dialect to dialect, often determined by the following vowel and other factors.

===Fricative substitution in western Nunavut===
Many of the western and central dialects of Nunavut – including [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Kivallirmiutut]] and [[Natsilingmiutut]] – realize the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} as {{IPA|[h]}}. Inuinnaqtun also pronounces {{IPA|/ɬ/}} as {{IPA|[h]}}. This leads to an additional constraint on double consonants in Inuinnaqtun: a stop followed by the fricative {{IPA|[h]}} becomes a fricative at the same point of articulation. This feature does not extend west of Inuinnaqtun and is not present in Siglitun or Inupiatun.

===Retroflex consonants in western dialects===
[[Natsilingmiutut]] retains as a phoneme the stop, and often retroflex, palatal consonant {{IPA|/ɟ/}}.  This consonant has merged with {{IPA|/j/}} in all other Nunavut and eastern dialects of Inuktitut.  In Inupiatun, the {{IPA|/ɟ/}} of Natsilingmiutut and the {{IPA|/j/}} in some central Inuktitut words has become {{IPA|[ʐ]}} (written {{angbr|r}}).

In addition to the voiced retroflex fricative {{IPA|/ʐ/}} (represented orthographically as {{angbr|r}}), Inupiatun also has a voiceless retroflex fricative {{IPA|/ʂ/}} represented as {{angbr|sr}}.  This additional manner of articulation is largely distinctive to Inupiatun – it is absent from the more easterly dialects, except for the {{IPA|/ɟ/}} of Natsilingmiutut.

The Qawiaraq dialect of Inupiatun, furthermore, has a third retroflex consonant in addition to the two present in other varieties of Inupiatun: the retroflex approximant {{IPA|/ɻ/}}.

===Double consonant clusters in Nunavimmiutut===
Nunavik Inuktitut, in contrast to other dialects, does not allow two double consonants to appear with only one syllable between them.  Wherever this occurs, the first consonant in the second consonant pair is deleted.

===Glottal stops===
In a number of dialects, uvular consonants and ordinary stops are replaced with [[glottal stop]]s in some contexts.  Which uvular consonants and which contexts varies to some degree across dialects.  Most frequently, a {{IPA|/q/}} or in some cases a {{IPA|/ʁ/}} before another consonant is transformed into a glottal stop.  Thus, the Inuktitut name of the hamlet of [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]] is pronounced ''Qamaniqtuaq'' or ''Qamanittuaq'' by most Inuktitut speakers, but is rendered ''Qamani'tuaq'' in Baker Lake itself.  This phenomenon occurs in a number of dialects, but is particularly noticeable in Nunavimmiutut and in central Nunavut dialects like [[Kivallirmiutut]].

In Natsilingmiutut, the velar nasal consonant {{IPA|/ŋ/}} sometimes becomes a glottal stop when followed by another consonant, but not in all cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2994">'''Io Matua Kore''' is often understood as the supreme being&lt;ref&gt;Maori Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Polynesian narrative]] of the [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0qPBAAAQBAJ|title=The Invention of God in Indigenous Societies|last=Cox|first=James|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317546030|location=|pages=35-66|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Io was first known generally with the publication in 1913 of Hoani Te Whatahoro's book, translated by [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] as ''The Lore of the Whāre-wananga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOQ9sXPJu5IC|title=The Lore of the Whare-wānanga: Or Teachings of the Maori College on Religion, Cosmogony, and History|last=Whatahoro|first=Hoani Te|translator-last=Smith|translator-first=S. Percy|last2=|first2=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781108040099|location=|pages=|language=en|orig-year=1913|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the Io represented a pre-Christian understanding of "God" much like the Christian God would be propagated by Elsdon Best in his ''Maori Religion and Mythology.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZLXAAAAMAAJ|title=Māori Religion and Mythology: Being an Account of the Cosmogony, Anthropogeny, Religious Beliefs and Rites, Magic and Folk Lore of the Māori Folk of New Zealand|last=Best|first=Elsdon|date=|publisher=Te Papa Press|year=2005|isbn=9781877385063|location=|pages=|language=en|orig-year=1924|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Io tradition was initially rejected by scholars including prominent Māori scholar [[Te Rangi Hīroa]] (Peter Buck), who wrote, "The discovery of a supreme God named Io in New Zealand was a surprise to [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pākehā]] alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5G8ZnQEACAAJ|title=The Coming of the Maori|last=Te Rangi Hiroa|first=|date=1949|publisher=Maori Purposes Fund Board|year=|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buck believed that the Io tradition was restricted to the [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] as a response to [[Christianity]]. [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] questions the motives behind the existence of such a book, seeing this as a questionable emphasis of the idea around the Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d65YElEIK3AC|title=Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown|last=Smith|first=Jonathan Z.|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226763606|location=|pages=68-71|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Others such as James Cox argues that this "pre-Christian" understanding of a supreme god may in fact be due to the earlier [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]] activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014 Sesay launched W.E. Can Lead (Women Everywhere Can Lead), an [[Education|educational]], [[humanitarian]] [[501(c)3]], [[non-profit]] organization.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;&lt;ref name=wclfounder&gt;{{cite web|url=https://we-canlead.org/founder-2/|title=''W.E. can lead'' Founder|language=English|accessdate=2018-08-09|date=2018-08-01|work=www.we-canlead.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to support African girls in receiving educational support to become future leaders. In August 2018, the program was mostly working with  [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] girls, but it is open for girls from everywhere in Africa.&lt;ref name=wcl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://we-canlead.org/|title=Isha Sesay's girls educational non-profit program ''W.E. can lead''|language=English|accessdate=2018-08-04|date=2018-08-01|work=www.we-canlead.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.segalfamilyfoundation.org/portfolio-items/w-e-can-lead/|title=W.E.

It is a two-tiered program comprising a base and a specialisation phase. After one year in which the girls learn basic skills like [[financial literacy]], [[critical thinking]] and good health practices as well how to build [[self-esteem]] and [[self-awareness]], they can apply to take part in the Young Leader development program. Those who do not gain a place may attend annual empowerment camps and an inspirational speakers series.&lt;ref name=wclgoals&gt;{{cite web|url=https://we-canlead.org/howwelead/|title=''W.E. can lead'' goals|language=English|accessdate=2018-08-13|work=www.we-canlead.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attendees receive financial support to cover tuition, uniforms and other supplies.&lt;ref name=wclabout /&gt; In August 2018 there were more than 600 girls from ages 12 to 18 participating in the program.&lt;ref name=wws /&gt;

In January 2017 actor [[Idris Elba]] auctioned a date with him to raise money for W.E. Can Lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-charity-valentines/sweetheart-british-actor-idris-elba-auctions-valentines-date-for-charity-idUSKBN14W2GE|title='Sweetheart' British actor Idris Elba auctions Valentine's date for charity|language=English|accessdate=September 15, 2018|work=www.reuters.com|author=Lin Taylor|date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kotiate''' is a type of traditional hand weapon of the [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of [[New Zealand]].

A Kotiate is a short club normally made of wood or whalebone. Kotiate means to cut or divide the liver (koti = cut in two or divide; ate = liver), is probably taken from its shape, which resembles the lobed part of the human liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Description of ME002492; Kotiate | work = Collections Online | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=138014 | accessdate = 2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9335">'''Dhivehi Latin''' or '''Maldivian Latin''', known colloquially as '''Malé Latin''' or '''Nasiri Latin''', is a Latin [[Maldivian alphabet]] briefly mandated in the [[Maldives]] from 1976, but the country reverted to the native [[Tāna]] and Arabic alphabets in 1978. Maldivian Latin is still widely used in non-academic literature for romanizing Maldivian place names.

==History==
Maldivians traditionally used two alphabets simultaneously, the Tāna script for Maldivian and the [[Arabic script]] for Arabic.  All learned Maldivians were well versed in the [[Quran]] and Arabic was the first script they learned in childhood. This was followed by their local script, Tāna, in which there were not many books printed, but that was important for official use. Therefore, the primary knowledge of the letters was called '''Arabitāna'''.

Toward the mid-1970s, during President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s tenure, [[Telegraphy|Telex]] machines were introduced by the Maldivian Government in the local administration. The new telex equipment was viewed as a great progress, however the local [[Tāna]] script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the [[Teleprinter|telex machines]] could only be written in the [[Latin script]].

Following this, a Latin transliteration not done by experts in [[linguistics]] was swiftly approved by the Maldive government in 1976 and was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all atoll and island offices, as well as schools and merchant liners.

This official Latin script has been criticized by several scholars because the transliteration of vowels did not follow the consistency of the Thaana alphabet and was more difficult to master for Maldivian learners.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Romero-Frias, ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt; In the Maldivian alphabet there is one single diacritical sign (fili) for 'a' 'e' 'i' and 'u', and this single sign is repeated when the sound is lengthened. In the new romanization only one of the short vowels is consistent with the way of the traditional script "'''aa'''", but most long vowels "'''oo'''", "'''ee'''", "'''ey'''" and "'''oa'''" are pronounced as in English.&lt;ref&gt;Gair, James W. &amp; Cain, Bruce D. (1996), "Divehi Writing" in Peter T. Daniels &amp; William Bright, ed., The World's Writing Systems&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a very small group of Maldivians belonging to the elite were familiar with written English in 1977. 
 
Anthropologist [[Clarence Maloney]] notes that the use of ''th'' and ''dh'' to represent unaspirated [[dental consonant]]s but ''lh'' for retroflex ''l'' is confusing and misleading, as in [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]], the most common transcription method for Indic languages, the first two would be read as [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants and the latter, which is instead a retroflex, as an aspirated "l".&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Maloney; ''People of the Maldive Islands'', p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new romanization also used aberrant combinations of letters and apostrophes for some Arabic sounds, effectively ignoring the Arabic transliterations accepted in academic circles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Haywood J.A. &amp; Nahmad H.M. ''A New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language''&lt;/ref&gt; Maldivian officials were used to read Arabic since childhood, as the religious education had precedence over the secular one. In documents which contained only one script, it became harder to identify religious Arabic quotations, a fact which was important because they had to be read in a different tone.

The Tāna script was reinstated by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] shortly after he took power in 1978.

Being able to master and combine both Arabic and Tāna was a prerequisite to be a Katiibu, Mudiimu or Atoll chief. The weekly [[Khutuba]] or Friday prayer sermon, was sent by the government to every inhabited island, and it was written in both scripts, because it contained texts both in Arabic and in the Maldivian language.

Even other documents of the time, like private letters, astrological writings or storybooks contained texts, in which both scripts were present, because not only quotations from the Muslim religious texts, but also certain words of Arabic origin (for example the local words for "special", "rule", "important", "declaration",  and "service" among others) were written in the Arabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/scripts.html Maldives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822075208/http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/scripts.html |date=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the romanization every island's officials were required to use only one script and they became illiterate overnight. From their point of view it was a traumatic period and these old government officers were indeed relieved when the romanization was revoked.

'''''Minority Report''''' is a 2002 American [[neo-noir]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and loosely based on the short story "[[The Minority Report]]" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. It is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where [[Precrime|PreCrime]], a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on [[wikt:foreknowledge|foreknowledge]] provided by three psychics called "[[Precognition|precogs]]". The cast includes [[Tom Cruise]] as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton, [[Colin Farrell]] as [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] agent Danny Witwer, [[Samantha Morton]] as the senior precog Agatha, and [[Max von Sydow]] as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. 

The film combines elements of [[tech noir]], [[whodunit]], [[Thriller film|thriller]] and [[science fiction]] genres, as well as a traditional chase film, as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive.&lt;ref name="whodunit"&gt;Buckland. pp. 193–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg has characterized the story as "fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot".&lt;ref name="Ko13" /&gt; The film's central theme is the question of [[free will]] versus [[determinism]]. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry, the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of broken families.

The film was first [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] in 1992, as a sequel to another Dick adaptation, ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', and started its development in 1997, after a script by Jon Cohen reached Spielberg and Cruise. Production suffered many delays due to Cruise's ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' and Spielberg's ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]]'' running over schedule, eventually starting in March 2001. During pre-production, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films, and some of the technology designs in the film have proven prescient. ''Minority Report'' has a unique visual style. It uses high contrast to create dark colors and shadows, much like a [[film noir]] picture. The film's overlit shots feature desaturated colors which were achieved by [[Bleach bypass|bleach-bypassing]] the film's negative in post-production.

''Minority Report'' was one of the best-reviewed films of 2002 and was nominated for several awards. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and eleven [[Saturn Award]] nominations, including [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Music]], winning [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. The film earned over $358 million worldwide against an overall budget of $142 million (including advertising). Over four million DVDs were sold in its first few months of home release.

==Plot==
In April 2054, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]'s PreCrime police stops murderers before they act, reducing the murder rate to zero. Murders are predicted using three mutated humans, called "Precogs", who "previsualize" crimes by receiving [[precognition|visions of the future]]. Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality. The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program.

Since the disappearance of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has both separated from his wife Lara and become a drug addict. While [[United States Department of Justice]] agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, implying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the Precogs, usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a "minority report" of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.

Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the citywide [[Retinal scan|optical recognition system]]. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]]. Anderton takes Agatha to a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.

Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's hotel room as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had [[Sobriety|sobered up]] and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.

Witwer, studying Crow's death, suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the Precogs still offline, the murder is not detected.

Lara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her, and Anderton is captured, accused of both murders, and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep. As his body is deposited into the prison, the warden tells him, "that all your dreams come true".

Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.

After Burgess's death, the PreCrime system is shut down. All the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, although they are kept under occasional surveillance. Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together. The Precogs are sent to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace.

===Development===
Dick's story was first [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by producer and writer [[Gary Goldman]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axmaker|first=Sean|title=Philip K.

Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script; however, he was allowed to decide whether the picture's screenplay was ready to be filmed. When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision, he called Cruise and said, "Yeah, I'll do ''this'' version of the script."&lt;ref name="Bu197" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko10"&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In that version, Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him. When Anderton sees the clip, his belief in the infallibility of the precogs' visions convinces him it is true, therefore the precogs have a vision of him killing Witwer. At the end, Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off, because Witwer had slain his twin.&lt;ref name="BU198"&gt;Buckland. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and a movie set 50 years in the future, it allowed him to do "a blending of genres" which intrigued him.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=William|title=Spielberg and Cruise dream team might make 'Minority Report' a winner|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/73591_cruise07.shtml|accessdate=December 10, 2010|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=June 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the pair joined ''Minority Report'' and announced the production as a joint venture of Spielberg's [[DreamWorks]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]], [[20th Century Fox]], Cruise's Cruise/Wagner Productions, and De Bont's production company, Blue Tulip.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/d-works-fox-do-spielberg-cruise-report-1117489352/|title=D'Works, Fox do Spielberg-Cruise 'Report'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 1998|accessdate=March 24, 2007| first1=Andrew | last1=Hindes | first2=Chris | last2=Petrikin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg however stated that despite being credited, De Bont never became involved with the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3579578/Spielberg-why-I-went-back-to-college.html|title=Spielberg: why I went back to college|last=Hiscock|first=John|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 9, 2009|date=October 6, 2002 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise and Spielberg, at the latter's insistence,&lt;ref name="nzh" /&gt; reportedly agreed to each take 15% of the gross instead of any money up front to try to keep the film's budget under $100 million.&lt;ref name="gro"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glover|first=Ron|title=Box-Office Boom, Profit Gloom|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2002/nf20020614_7543.htm|accessdate=December 12, 2010|date=June 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg said he had done the same with name actors in the past to great success: "[[Tom Hanks]] took no cash for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' but he made a lot of money on his profit participation."&lt;ref name="nzh" /&gt; He made this agreement a prerequisite:&lt;ref name="nzh" /&gt;

{{quote|I haven't worked with many movie stars—80 per cent of my films don't have movie stars—and I've told them if they want to work with me I want them to gamble along with me. I haven't taken a salary in 18 years for a movie, so if my film makes no money I get no money. They should be prepared to do the same.}}

Production was delayed for several years; the original plan was to begin filming after Cruise's ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' was finished.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; However, that film ran over schedule, which also allowed Spielberg time to bring in screenwriter [[Scott Frank]] to rework Cohen's screenplay.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=15 |title=Chat with Scott Frank |publisher=Screenwriters Utopia |date=December 6, 2001 |accessdate=March 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324224414/http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=15 |archivedate=March 24, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John August]] did an uncredited draft to polish the script,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/29/business/media-triumph-of-the-producing-class.html|title=Media; Triumph of the Producing Class|last=Cieply|first=Michael|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 29, 2002|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank Darabont]] was also invited to rewrite, but was by then busy with ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/darabont-indy-4-scripting-minority-report-flap_article_34947.html |title=Darabont on ''Indy 4'' scripting, ''Minority Report'' flap |first=Christopher |last=Allan Smith |work=Cinescape |date=June 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621091213/http://www.mania.com/darabont-indy-4-scripting-minority-report-flap_article_34947.html |archivedate=June 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film closely follows Frank's final script (written May 16, 2001), and contains much of Cohen's third draft (May 24, 1997).&lt;ref name="Bu197" /&gt; Frank removed the character of Senator Malcolm from Cohen's screenplay, and inserted Burgess, who became the "bad guy". He also rewrote Witwer from a villain to a "good guy", as he was in the short story.&lt;ref name="BU198" /&gt; In contrast to Spielberg's next science fiction picture, ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', which he called "100 percent character" driven, Spielberg said the story for ''Minority Report'' became "fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot."&lt;ref name="Ko13"&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to film scholar Warren Buckland, "It appears that...Cohen and...Frank did not see" the "Goldman and Schusett screenplay; instead; they worked on their own adaptation."&lt;ref name="Bu2101" /&gt; Goldman and Schusett however claimed the pair used a lot of material from their script, so the issue went through the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writer's Guild]] arbitration process. They won a partial victory; they were not given writing credits, but were listed as executive producers.&lt;ref name="Bu2101" /&gt; The film was delayed again so Spielberg could finish ''[[A.I.

He offered the role of Witwer to [[Matt Damon]], Iris Hineman to [[Meryl Streep]], Burgess to [[Ian McKellen]], Agatha to [[Cate Blanchett]], and Lara to [[Jenna Elfman]].&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111234515/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/preview/1808405153|archivedate=January 11, 2007|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/preview/1808405153|title=Greg's Preview: Minority Report (2002)|publisher=[[Yahoo!]] Movies|accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Streep declined the role,&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt; Damon opted out,&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt; and the other roles were recast due to the delays.

Spielberg described his ideas for the film's technology to [[Roger Ebert]] before the movie's release:

The Internet is watching us now. If they want to. They can see what sites you visit. In the future, television will be watching us, and customizing itself to what it knows about us. The thrilling thing is, that will make us feel we're part of the medium. The scary thing is, we'll lose our right to privacy. An ad will appear in the air around us, talking directly to us.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger |title=Spielberg &amp; Cruise &amp; the movies|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020616/PEOPLE/66010302/1023|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=December 10, 2010|date=June 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Filming===
''Minority Report'' was the first film to have an entirely digital production design.&lt;ref name="Greg" /&gt; Termed "previz", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film's narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3-D animation programs ([[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] and [[Autodesk Softimage|XSI]]) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previs system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said "[i]t became pretty clear that [he] wouldn't read an illustration as a finished piece, but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it."&lt;ref name="Greg" /&gt; Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001,&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt; in Washington, D.C., [[Virginia]], and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="film locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minority Report film locations|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/m/minority.html|publisher=movie-locations.com|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film locations included the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center|Ronald Reagan Building]] (as PreCrime headquarters) and [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name="film locations" /&gt; The skyline of [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn, Virginia]] is visible when Anderton flies across the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title = Minority Report&lt;!-- |format=NTSC --&gt;|medium = Blu-Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt; During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spielberg visits the Minority Report Bagel Cam|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KVbEydFXgk|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Tom Cruise; together they conferred publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam on the set of "A Beautiful Mind" in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set Showdown: Cruise, Spielberg vs. Howard, Crowe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7hDZRgHjtk|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the small, uncharted island in the last shot of the film is Butter Island off [[North Haven, Maine]] in the [[Penobscot Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legendarytrips.com/2015/02/minority-report-log-cabin-mystery-filming-location/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it takes place in an imagined future world of advanced technology, ''Minority Report'' attempts to embody a more "realistic" depiction of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dromm, Keith. essay in Kowalski. pp. 192, 199, 208&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg decided that to be more credible, the setting had to keep both elements of the present and ones which specialists expected would be forthcoming. Thus Washington, D.C. as depicted in the movie keeps well-known buildings such as the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and the [[Washington Monument]], as well as a section of modern buildings on the other side of the Potomac River. Production designer Alex McDowell was hired based on his work in ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' and his storyboards for a film version of ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' which would have starred [[Mel Gibson]]. McDowell studied modern architecture, and his sets contain many curves, circular shapes, and reflective materials. Costume designer Deborah L. Scott decided to make the clothes worn by the characters as simple as possible, so as not to make the depiction of the future seem dated.&lt;ref name="deconstructing"&gt;"Deconstructing Minority Report", ''Minority Report'' Special Edition DVD, Disc 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The stunt crew was the same one used in Cruise's ''Mission: Impossible 2'', and was responsible for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot.&lt;ref&gt;"The Stunts of Minority Report", ''Minority Report'' Special Edition DVD, Disc 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] did most of the special effects, and DreamWorks-owned [[Pacific Data Images|PDI]] was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]]. The [[Holography|holographic projections]] and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the [[Maglev]] vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;"IL&amp;M and Minority Report", ''Minority Report'' Special Edition DVD, Disc 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storyline differences===
{{quote|The Philip K. Dick story only gives you a springboard that really doesn't have a second or third act. Most of the movie is not in the Philip K. Dick story – to the chagrin of the Philip K. Dick fans, I'm sure.|Steven Spielberg, June 2002&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;}}

Like most film adaptations of Dick's works,&lt;ref name="sea" /&gt; many aspects of his story were changed in their transition to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from [[New York City]] to Washington, D.C., [[Baltimore]], and [[Northern Virginia]]. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes.&lt;ref name="Isthmus" /&gt; The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, and that of the three pre-cogs.&lt;ref&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively.&lt;ref&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. pp. 11–2&lt;/ref&gt; The precogs were [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Arms, Gary, &amp; Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mu163"&gt;Mulhall. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings about the end of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski. p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1069/is_4_38/ai_91140241|title=Future shock: Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is in.

The score was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and orchestrated by John Neufeld, with vocals by Deborah Dietrich. Williams normally enters Spielberg productions at an early stage, well before the movie starts shooting. For ''Minority Report'' however, his entry was delayed due to his work on ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', and he joined the film when it was nearly completed, leaving him scant production time. The soundtrack takes inspiration from [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s work.&lt;ref name="shul" /&gt; Williams decided not to focus on the science fiction elements, and made a score suitable for film noir. He included traditional noir elements such as a female singer in the Anne Lively scenes, but the "sentimental scenes", which Williams considered unusual for that genre, led to soothing themes for Anderton's ex-wife Lara and son Sean.&lt;ref name="deconstructing" /&gt; The track "Sean's Theme" is described as the only one "instantly recognizable as one of Williams'" by music critic Andrew Granade.&lt;ref name="sound"&gt;{{cite web|last=Granade|first=Andrew |title=Minority Report|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3053|publisher=soundtrack.net|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg typified it as "a black and white score" and said, "I think Johnny Williams does a really nice bit of homage to Benny Herrmann."&lt;ref name="App"&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelo|first=Time|title=Keepers of the flame|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/16/PK61909.DTL&amp;type=movies|accessdate=December 12, 2010|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview which appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Williams said that the choices for many of the pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 8]] (commonly known as the ''Unfinished Symphony''), which features prominently in the film,&lt;ref name="track"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/minority_report.html|title=Minority Report soundtrack review|publisher=Filmtracks.net|accessdate=March 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of "[[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]" by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that "[t]hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Williams did choose the [[minuet]] from a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] string quartet ([[String Quartets, Op. 64 (Haydn)|Op. 64]], No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because "[i]t seemed to me to be the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; [[James R. Oestreich]] in ''The New York Times'' characterized the score as "evocative" and said it was "thoroughly modern" while also being "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks", including the "lopsided waltz" from the second [[Movement (music)|movement]] of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6]], known as the ''Pathétique''.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oestreich|first=James R.|authorlink=James R.

==Ending==
The most commonly criticized element of the film is its ending. The film has a more traditional "happy ending" which contradicts the tone of the rest of the picture.&lt;ref name="edel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris. pp. 326–7; {{cite web|last=Hays|first=Loron|title=Minority Report – Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/reviews/2010/minorityreportbd.htm|publisher=reelreviews.com|accessdate=December 9, 2010|date=May 8, 2010}}; Vest. pp. 134–5; {{cite news|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|title=It Was a Very Good Year|url=http://nypress.com/it-was-a-very-good-year/|accessdate=December 12, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Press]]|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to speculation that this ending is the product of John's imagination, caused by hallucinations from his forced coma after he is incarcerated. As one observer mused, "The conclusion of ''Minority Report'' strikes me as a joke Spielberg played on his detractors—an act of perfectly measured deviltry."&lt;ref name="flakmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weitner|first=Sean|title=The Spielberg Ending: Minority Report|url=http://www.flakmag.com/film/spielberg/minority.html|publisher=flakmag.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228204301/http://www.flakmag.com/film/spielberg/minority.html|archivedate=February 28, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic theorized, "...[r]ather than end this ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''-ian sci-fi dystopia with the equivalent of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, just to see if the audience is paying attention."&lt;ref name="flakmag.com" /&gt; Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, "It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true."&lt;ref&gt;Morris. p. 328; Vest. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.&lt;ref&gt;Vest. pp. 135–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckland expressed disappointment in the ending, but blamed Frank. He felt that given the water theme, and closely tied together tragic parent-child theme, Anderton should have ended the film by taking Agatha in his care if Spielberg wanted a happy ending. Especially since "Anderton kidnaps Agatha from the precog pool just as his son was kidnapped from a swimming pool" and because Anderton could act as a "substitute parent for Agatha, and Agatha...a substitute child for Anderton."&lt;ref name="Bu207"&gt;Buckland. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; This opportunity is missed however, when the precogs are sent to the remote island, and Anderton reunites with his wife; an ending which Buckland finds more "forced" than the "more authentic" path he feels he noticed.&lt;ref name="Bu207" /&gt;

==Style==
[[Image:Minority Report bleached.jpg|thumb|''Minority Report'''s unique visual style: It was overlit, and the negatives were [[Bleach bypass|bleach-bypassed]] in post-production to desaturate the colors in the film.|alt=Two men, one of whom is wearing futuristic armor and helmet.

''Minority Report'' is a futuristic film which portrays elements of a both [[dystopia]]n and [[utopia]]n future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zipp|first=Yvonne|title=What happened to live long &amp; prosper?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0621/p13s01-almo.html|accessdate=December 17, 2010|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=June 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story.&lt;ref&gt;"Minority Report: From Story to Screen"; ''Minority Report'' Special Edition DVD, Disc 2&lt;/ref&gt; From a stylistic standpoint, ''Minority Report'' resembles Spielberg's previous film ''A.I.'',&lt;ref name="Isthmus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=3844 |title=Minority Report| publisher=thedailypage.com|date=May 31, 2002|accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. ''[[The Asphalt Jungle|Asphalt Jungle]]''. ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]''. ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''."&lt;ref name="box" /&gt; The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production.&lt;ref name="Colin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jocobson, Colen|url= http://www.dvdmg.com/minorityreport.shtml|title=Minority Report review |publisher=dvdmg.com| date=December 11, 2002|accessdate=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool is the only one shot in "normal" color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, to the point that it nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture.&lt;ref name="Colin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vest. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The color was reduced by "about 40%" to achieve the "washed-out" appearance.&lt;ref name="Bu201"&gt;Buckland. p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Mitchell]], formerly of ''[[The New York Times]]'', commented that "[t]he picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car."&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mitchell, Elvis|url= http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9E02EEDA113BF932A15755C0A9649C8B63 |title=Halting Crime In Advance Has Its Perils|work=The New York Times |date=June 21, 2002|accessdate=March 12, 2007|authorlink= Elvis Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinematographer [[Janusz Kamiński]] shot the movie with high-speed film in Super 35 format to increase the overall grain,&lt;ref name="Bu201" /&gt; which Spielberg preferred to the then-emerging digital video format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joe|first=Williams|title=The Digital Debate|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=June 21, 2002|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie's camera work is very mobile, alternating between handheld and Steadicam shots, which are "exaggerated by the use of wide angle lenses and the occasional low camera angle" to increase the perception of movement according to film scholar Warren Buckland.&lt;ref name="Bu201" /&gt; Kamiński said that he never used a lens longer than 27mm, and alternated between 17, 21, and 27mm lenses, as Spielberg liked to "keep the actors as close to the camera as possible". He also said, "We staged a lot of scenes in wide shots that have a lot of things happening with the frame."&lt;ref name="Bu201" /&gt; The duo also used several long takes to focus on the emotions of the actors, rather than employing numerous cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland. pp. 201–2&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg eschewed the typical "[[shot reverse shot]]" cinematography technique used when filming characters' interactions in favor of the long takes, which were shot by a mobile, probing camera.&lt;ref name="Bu202"&gt;Buckland. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell relied on colorless chrome and glass objects of curved and circular shapes in his set designs, which, aided by the "low-key contrastive lighting", populated the film with shadows, creating a "futuristic film noir atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Bu201" /&gt;

Buckland describes the film's 14 minute opening sequence as the "most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film."&lt;ref name="BU198" /&gt; The first scene is a distorted precog vision of a murder, presented out of context. The speed of the film is sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie "jumps about in time and space" by intercutting the images in no discernible order.&lt;ref name="Bu1989" /&gt; When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha's eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her.&lt;ref name="Bu1989"&gt;Buckland. pp. 198–9&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a "trailer", because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of "tone, generic expectations, and enigmas" that will be used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Morris. p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a "squishy lens" device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them.&lt;ref&gt;Cornea. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the "layered, dreamlike imagery" based on some comments from [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] the pair consulted.&lt;ref name="Ko243"&gt;Kowalski. p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening's next scene, Anderton is "scrubbing the images", by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha's vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a prevision. The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs' images, before alternating between the three.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland. pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt; The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland. pp. 200–01&lt;/ref&gt; It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening's five-second average is attained despite "very fast cutting" in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of "heavily diffused backlighting" for much in the interior shots.&lt;ref name="Bu201" /&gt;

==Release==
Spielberg typically keeps the plot points of his films closely guarded before their release, and ''Minority Report'' was no different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=Sequels? Sure. But Godard, Too|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00715F63A550C718DDDAC0894DA404482|accessdate=December 13, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he had to remove some scenes, and a few "F-words" to get the film's PG-13 rating.&lt;ref name="box" /&gt; Following the disappointing box office results of Spielberg's ''A.I.'', the marketing campaign for ''Minority Report'' downplayed his role in the movie and sold the film as a Cruise action thriller.&lt;ref&gt;Morris. p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Rothman]], chairman of the film's co-financier [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox Filmed Entertainment]], described the film's marketing strategy thus: "How are we marketing it? It's Cruise and Spielberg. What else do we need to do?"&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite news|last=Svetkey|first=Benjamin|title=Tom Cruise Reboots|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,260287,00.html|accessdate=December 13, 2010|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise's resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues.&lt;ref name="box" /&gt; With their combined 30% take of the film's box office though, sources such as [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek|''BusinessWeek'']]'s Ron Grover predicted the studios would have a hard time making the money needed to break even.&lt;ref name="gro" /&gt; Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. ''Entertainment Weekly'' projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karger|first=Dave|title=Tom Tom Club|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,264359,00.html|accessdate=December 13, 2010|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a "commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run."&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;

DreamWorks spent several million dollars marketing the film's DVD and VHS releases.

''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''-award-winning DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau, who would become a frequent Spielberg DVD collaborator, shot hundreds of hours of the film's production in the then-new [[high-definition video]] format.

==Reception==
On the [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Minority Report'' received 91% positive reviews based on 246 critics and an average rating of 8.1/10.

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said it's "Spielberg's sharpest, brawniest, most bustling entertainment since ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/0701/cruise/review.html|title=No artificial intelligence; just smart fun|author=Corliss, Richard|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=March 5, 2009|authorlink=Richard Corliss|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207003943/http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/0701/cruise/review.html|archivedate=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Clark of ''[[USA Today]]'' felt it succeeded due to a "breathless 140-minute pace with a no-flab script packed with all kinds of surprises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-06-21-minority-review.htm|title=The verdict is in: 'Minority' rules|last=Clark|first=Mike|work=USA Today|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film's visuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,264477,00.html|title=Movie Review: Minority Report (2002)|first=Lisa|last=Schwarzbaum|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 28, 2002|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' complimented the cast's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917989.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Minority Report|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=Variety|accessdate=March 9, 2009|date=June 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film scholar Warren Buckland recommended the film, but felt that the comedic elements—aside from Stormare's lines—detracted from the plot and undermined the film's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland. p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics used their reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie signified in his development as a filmmaker. Andrew O'Hehir of the online magazine ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. "Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now...into of all things a superior film artist...It's too early to know whether ''Minority Report'', on the heels of ''A.I.'', marks a brief detour in Spielberg's career or a permanent change of course, but either way it's a dark and dazzling spectacle."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |title=Meet Steven Spielberg, hardboiled cynic |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2002/06/21/minority_report |work=Salon |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |date=June 21, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118025344/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2002/06/21/minority_report |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

[[Andrew Sarris]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' gave the film a negative review in which he described the script as full of plot holes, the car chases as silly, and criticized the mixture of futuristic environments with "defiantly retro costuming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/46234|title=Minority Report Sinks Too Low|author=Sarris, Andrew|work=[[New York Observer]]|date=July 14, 2002|accessdate=March 9, 2009|authorlink=Andrew Sarris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of the storyline was also a source of criticism for [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who considered the plot "too intricate and difficult to follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=A Walk in the Dark|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Groen of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' criticized Tom Cruise's performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Groen|first=Rick|title=Is Steven Spielberg afraid of the dark?|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=June 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though Hoberman liked the movie, he described the film as "miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-06-25/film/private-eyes/1|title=Private Eyes|author=Hoberman, Jim| work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=June 25, 2002|accessdate=March 5, 2009|authorlink=J.

The '''''Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence''''' (also known as '''''The Adoration''''')  is a painting traditionally believed to have been created in 1609 by the Italian Baroque master [[Caravaggio]]. Recent discoveries link the painting to that commissioned by Fabio Nuti in April 1600, and thus sent from Rome to Palermo.

It was stolen on October 18, 1969 from the [[Oratorio di San Lorenzo]] in [[Palermo]], Sicily.

The painting, which hung above the altar, was large, measuring almost six square metres (actual size 268&amp;nbsp;cm x 197&amp;nbsp;cm). Probably because of its size, it was removed from its frame by two thieves&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt; before being taken out of the church. After it was stolen, the Oratory was pillaged of other art, along with choir stalls of carved and gilded wood and benches inlaid with [[precious wood]]s and mother of pearl. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The local [[Sicilian Mafia]] are generally considered to be the prime culprits in the theft although nobody actually knows who committed the crime. The whereabouts of the work remain unknown to this day. Rumours of its destruction during the theft, or subsequently in the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]], have circulated from time to time as has the notion that the masterpiece is now hidden abroad. In 1996, [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], an informant and former member of the Sicilian Mafia, claimed he had stolen the painting as a young man on the orders of a high-ranking mobster, but other sources say it was stolen by amateurs and then sold on to various Mafiosi; at one point it is said to have ended up in the hands of [[Rosario Riccobono]], who was killed in 1982, after which it passed on to [[Gerlando Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/02/05/bacara105.xml Will we ever see it again?], The Daily Telegraph, February 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a former Mafia figure turned police informer, claimed that he was told in 1999 that the painting was stolen for a private collector but had been destroyed by rats and pigs while hidden in a farm outbuilding and the remains burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6950256.ece Lost Caravaggio painting 'was burnt by Mafia'] Times Online, December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/28/arts.italy Mafia informer asked to solve mystery of stolen Caravaggio], The Guardian, November 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nativity'' is one of the most famous unrecovered stolen works of art; its theft is on the [[FBI]]'s top ten list of art crimes.&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theft of Caravaggio’s Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco |url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value, if the work was ever sold, is estimated to be $20 million&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;; though resale value on the black market, especially for an infamous work of art, is nowhere near the actual value.  On the black market, stolen art fetches perhaps a tenth of its estimated value if it can even be sold at all.&lt;ref name="Beast"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dickey|first1=Christopher |last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=Hot Potatoes |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116210003/https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=19 May 2010|archive-date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a reproduction of the painting was commissioned by [[Sky plc|Sky]] and produced by [[Factum Arte]]. The replica was then permanently installed in the chapel, in the place of the original, with an official ceremony in the presence of the President of the Republic, [[Sergio Mattarella]]. In the same year, Sky produced the international documentary "[[Mystery of the Lost Caravaggio]]" by [[Sky Arts Production Hub]], which tells the story of the Nativity and the life of the artist. Through interviews and archive material, the documentary tells the story of the theft of the work in 1969, the process of reproduction and the technologies used to recreate the Nativity. The documentary debuted on January 27, 2017 on [[Sky Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Caravaggio Masterpiece Stolen in Notorious Mafia Heist Replaced with Replica|journal=Artnet News|date=December 11, 2015|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-caravaggio-replaced-replica-391166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title='Restitution of a lost beauty': Caravaggio Nativity replica brought to Palermo|journal=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/10/restitution-lost-beauty-stolen-caravaggio-nativity-replica-brought-palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=The Telegraph|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12044479/How-a-long-lost-Caravaggio-masterpiece-was-recreated-nearly-50-years-after-it-was-stolen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vivarelli|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=Variety|date=December 18, 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/murdoch-owned-sky-paybox-mixes-philanthropy-and-production-with-operation-caravaggio-1201662897/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Daniel|last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=The Factory of Fakes|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 28, 2016|pages=75, 77|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-factory-of-fakes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepal Bhasa movement''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: नेपालभाषा आन्दोलन) refers to the struggle for [[linguistic rights]] by its speakers in [[Nepal]] in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbors. The campaign aims to increase the use of Nepal Bhasa in the home, education, government and business. Despite a high level of development, Newar culture and language are both under threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= Between the market and Comrade Mao: Newar cultural activism and ethnic/political movements (Nepal) |last= Grandin |first= Ingemar |date= |website= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newar]]s have been fighting to save their language from the time of the repressive [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime till today, and activists have been jailed, exiled and tortured.&lt;ref name="Hoek, Bert van den and Shrestha, Balgopal"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Education in the Mother Tongue: The Case of Nepal Bhasa (Newari)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_22_01_06.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1995}} Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sthavir| first =Dharmalok| url = http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/regmi/pdf/regmi_09.doc| title =A Journey to Great China| work = Regmi Research Series| publisher = Regmi Research| date=1 December 1977| accessdate = 11 October 2012}} Pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have even petitioned the Supreme Court to have its use barred.

The movement arose against the suppression of the language by the state that began with the rise of the [[Shah dynasty]] in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846-1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system (1960-1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Phatte Bahadur|title=Nepali Biharya Aitihasik Pristabhumi ("Historical Background of Nepali Bihar") |url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Jaa|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Pala, Tri-Chandra Campus|date=September 1979}} Page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbors grew following mass migration into the [[Kathmandu Valley]], leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority in their homeland. During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Nepal Bhasa dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-occupation-of-the-kathmandu..pdf |title=The Occupation of the Kathmandu Valley and its Fallout |last=Malla |first=Kamal P. |date= |website= |page=3 |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been listed as being "definitely endangered" by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap&amp;lid=1117 |title = UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |date = |accessdate= 27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language movement can be divided into the following eras.

*Shah/Rana era
*First democratic era
*Panchayat era
*Second democratic era
*Loktantra era

==Shah/Rana era==

''Jheegu Sahitya'' ("Our Literature"). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, development of the language and literature was stifled.

During the period 1909 to 1941 known as the Renaissance era, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers [[Nisthananda Bajracharya]], [[Siddhidas Mahaju]], [[Jagat Sundar Malla]] and [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]] are honored as the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]]. [[Shukraraj Shastri]] and [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]] were also at the forefront of the movement.

In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled ''Nepal Bhasa Vyakarana'' which was published from [[Kolkata]], [[India]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name "Nepal Bhasa" in place of the [[Khas]] imposed term "Newari".

===Writers jailed===

In 1940, the government mounted a crackdown against democracy activists and writers in which Shukraraj Shastri was hanged. A large number of authors were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. Dharmacharya was jailed for three months. [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] was sentenced to six years, [[Siddhicharan Shrestha]] was sentenced to 18 years, [[Phatte Bahadur Singh]] was sentenced to life imprisonment and [[Dharma Ratna Yami]] was sentenced to 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Siddhi Charan|title=97 Sal Parva|url= |accessdate= |newspaper=Inap Vol. 1, No. 3|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released in 1945 after serving five years. In prison, Hridaya produced his greatest work [[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html|title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=24 January 2012|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an epic poem on the life of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Lienhard, Siegfried 1992 Page 4"/&gt; Shrestha wrote a collection of poems entitled ''Seeswan'' ("Wax Flower", published in 1948) among other works.

===Monks expelled===

[[Theravada Buddhist]] monks stood up to the Rana regime and published books on Buddhism from India and brought them into Nepal. This led to the [[Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal]]. In 1944, eight monks were expelled for refusing to stop teaching Theravada Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. In 1946, the ban on writing was lifted, and the monks were allowed to return to Nepal following international pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their writings and public activities in Nepal Bhasa had a profound impact on the development of the language.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

===Working abroad===

Nepal Bhasa lovers took the movement to [[India]] and [[Tibet]] where they formed associations to organize writers and bring out publications to escape government suppression in Nepal. Newar merchants based in [[Kolkata]], [[Kalimpong]] and [[Lhasa]] were major patrons of the language movement.

''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'', the first ever magazine in Nepal Bhasa, was published from Kolkata in 1925 by [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]]. He also established a literary organization named Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal (Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Pages 27-28.

In 1944, the Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal went to [[Sarnath]] and formed an organization named Dharmodaya Sabha. In 1947, it launched ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine from [[Kalimpong]] funded by trader Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar. Monk [[Aniruddha Mahathera]] was the first editor.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.''

Newar traders based in Lhasa promoted ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' magazine which launched in Kathmandu in 1951. It was the first Nepal Bhasa magazine to be published from Nepal, and the first editor was a former merchant [[Purna Kaji Tamrakar]].

In 1950, a literary society named Chwasa Pasa (Pen Friend) was formed in [[Kolkata]] by [[Prem Bahadur Kansakar]] and another writer Madan Lochan Singh to bring together writers living in exile. The society moved to Nepal in 1951 after the advent of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First democratic era==

Following the fall of the Ranas and advent of democracy in 1951, there was greater linguistic freedom, and Nepal Bhasa struggled to catch up. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper ''[[Nepal Bhasa Patrika]]'' began publication in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://npi10month.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-nepali-journalism.html| title =History of Nepali Journalism| work = | publisher =Nepal Press Institute| date=15 February 2010| accessdate = 25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio===

State-owned [[Radio Nepal]] began broadcasting the news in Nepal Bhasa once a day in 1951. In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Nepal Bhasa in addition to the Nepali language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools and colleges===

Nepal Bhasa entered a vibrant phase in the educational system. It was included in the curriculum, and Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognized it as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it. In 1953, the government recognized Nepal Bhasa as a spoken language and an oriental language subject. The Nepal Educational Council adopted it as an optional subject.

Following lobbying by language lovers, Nepal Bhasa was included in the course of study at the high school level in 1954, at the intermediate level in 1960 and bachelor level in 1962. And for two decades, Nepal Bhasa was widely taught in schools and colleges in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other parts of Nepal with thousands of students studying it as an optional subject.&lt;ref name="Hoek, Bert van den and Shrestha, Balgopal"/&gt;

==Panchayat era==

In 1960, parliament was abolished, political parties were forbidden and the [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was established. Under this autocratic system, the government followed a one-language policy, and Nepal Bhasa suffered another period of suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawoti| first = Mahendra | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Lsjb4lexL1cJ:homepages.wmich.edu/~mlawoti/documents/PDF%2520Docs/ContentiousPolitics%26democratization.Lawoti.CPDN.Sage.pdf+buddhist+monks+expelled+from+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiqCfNrBWEOZ6J7vIgrqxMtVaKmvuuZHn4vr7DvQWUfsAbu8t6d0JVPUEiJs029IqiE17jUa-PlWyW-P_7yhRQJGCY3TPLi0k8qeFHj3pN33Exmpapqt-C9tohC7csDBREWViLL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTqR7b-EKriitUP0R55RhzLmEtMLA|title = Contentious Politics in Democratizing Nepal | work = | publisher = | date=| accessdate = 3 June 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was gradually pushed out of the media and the educational institutions, triggering protest movements.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictive policy of Panchayat encouraged the formation of literary associations to provide a forum for writers to present their works. In 1962, Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust) was formed in [[Bhaktapur]]. It organized annual literary meets which continue till today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Bhasha literary meet concludes |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8143&amp;cat_id=4|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jah'' magazine===

In 1960, Nepal Bhasa students at Tri-Chandra College in Kathmandu launched an annual magazine named ''Jah'' (ज:) (meaning "light" in Nepal Bhasa) after the college magazine ''Light'' refused to include Nepal Bhasa articles in it. The magazine led to the organization of students interested in Nepal Bhasa in the college. That same year, they started the annual Inter-College Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference and also produced a weekly radio program in Nepal Bhasa on Radio Nepal named ''Jeevan Dabu'' ("Life's stage"). In the successive years, ''Jah'' served as a breeding ground for new writers and language activists.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-56-00-X}}. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement of 1965===

In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality's decision to recognize Nepal Bhasa was revoked. In 1965, the language was banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timalsina|first=Ramji |title=Language and Political Discourse in Nepal|url=http://koshistjames.edu.np/journal/CET_Journal_Vol3_No1.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=CET Journal|publisher=Itahari: Itahari Research Centre, Circle of English Teachers (CET)|date=Spring 2011}} Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gurung |first=Kishor |date=Nov–Dec 1993 |title=What is Nepali Music? |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/himal/pdf/Himal_6_6.pdf |journal=Himal |location=Kathmandu |page=11 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of Nepal Bhasa from the country's only radio station sparked a protest movement which became known as the Movement of 1965 ("Bais Salya Andolan"). The protest took the form of literary meets as other types of demonstrations were prohibited. Literary programs were held weekly in market squares and courtyards where participants recited poems and sang songs containing critical messages.

The government cracked down by putting a number of activists in jail including writers Mangal Man Shakya, Pushpa Gopal Shrestha and Shree Krishna Anu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhist]] monk Bhikshu [[Sudarshan Mahasthavir]] was jailed for six months and six days.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Ishwari Maiya (2010).

Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent campaigners like [[Durga Lal Shrestha]], Hitkar Bir Singh Kansakar and Mangal Man Shakya (of Om Bahal) were forced to go underground. The movement was made leaderless, and it came to a stop after a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maharjan | first = Basanta | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:u07wVOvD30YJ:www.socialinclusion.org.np/download.php%3Fp%3DresearchReport%26f%3D7996_Finalreport.doc+nepal+bhasa+radio+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi9256j5vkAtxFmzLXi31AD1N_do6qcAL7_ULYcy41D7GeijuqJfwFf6QOzNSGbBVqAtC19vXNAftsB0vo841MGc1Igbje0xHXvmIkJtrPZcGLYjePEFO3Vvf1DUbefX-eLE5sX&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzWjezYJYvu6s-gHS7nSKs5N3RFw

The ban on Nepal Bhasa remained, but the 1965 Movement succeeded in raising awareness about linguistic rights and arousing public opinion against the Panchayat regime. Its most important achievement was creating a new generation of writers and campaigners who would take over from the activists who fought for the language during the Rana regime and lead the movement in the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

Page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala]], founded in 1979, is one of the organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights.

===Out of school===

The New Education System Plan brought out in 1971 disrupted the popular study of Nepal Bhasa in educational institutions. Under the plan, vernacular subjects were removed from the curriculum, and students were forced to choose between the mother tongue and technical subjects, leading to Nepal Bhasa being pushed into the background. Student enrolment in the course dropped, resulting in the subject being pulled out of many schools and a further decline in students.

From 1977, students could study Nepal Bhasa at the Master's level; but the university degree was not counted for promotion by the government, and so there were few takers for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hangen| first =Susan| url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/ps034.pdf| title =Creating a "New Nepal": The Ethnic Dimension| work = | publisher =Washington: East-West Center| year=2007| accessdate = 19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thlib.org"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Education in the Mother Tongue: The Case of Nepal Bhasa (Newari) |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_22_01_06.pdf |accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1995}} Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign radio===

In addition to government suppression, Nepal Bhasa has faced opposition from hostile critics. After [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] began broadcasting a weekly half-hour program in Nepal Bhasa on 6 November 1983, opponents in Nepal pressured the radio station to shut it down. Similar opposition led to [[All India Radio]] - Kurseong stopping broadcasting Nepal Bhasa songs during its Nepali service in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dakalay Nhapan|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Bhintuna-Pau|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala |year=1993}} Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Inap|publisher= |date=22 February 1984}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second democratic era==

Arbitrary actions increased resentment towards Panchayat. In 1988, police arrested participants in a procession marking the birth anniversary of Nepal Bhasa poet [[Siddhidas Mahaju]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the [[1990 People's Movement]] that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eagle|first=Sonia|title=The Language Situation in Nepal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/57090514/19/Newari-language-and-revitalisation|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|publisher=Scribd|year=1999}} Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; However, efforts to get Nepal Bhasa reincluded as an optional subject after a gap of two decades were unsuccessful due to lack of funding.

The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multi-ethnic and multilingual country. It also said that each community shall have the right to operate schools up to the primary level in its own mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepaldemocracy.org/documents/national_laws/constitution1990.htm#1|title=Constitution of Nepal 1990|publisher=Nepal Democracy|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government's responsibility was not stated and communities had to open such schools on their own. In 1991, Jagat Sundar Bwane Kuthi, the first Nepal Bhasa-medium school, opened in Kathmandu with the efforts of volunteers and the support of domestic and foreign donors.&lt;ref name="thlib.org"/&gt;

Meanwhile, years of efforts to gain official recognition for the standard name Nepal Bhasa finally succeeded. On 8 September 1995, the government decided that the name Nepal Bhasa should be used instead of Newari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Nepal Bhasa|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=9 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Central Bureau of Statistics has not been doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| title =Major highlights| work =| publisher =Central Bureau of Statistics| year =2013| accessdate =24 May 2013| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| archivedate =17 July 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics file suit===

On 25 July 1997, [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]] declared that its policy to recognize Nepal Bhasa, which had been passed on 18 April 1958 and cancelled by the Panchayat regime in 1963, would be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced in quick succession that they too would officially recognize Nepal Bhasa -- [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] Sub-Metropolitan City on 14 July, [[Bhaktapur]] Municipality on 23 July, [[Madhyapur Thimi]] Municipality on 10 September, and [[Kirtipur]] Municipality on 15 September 1997.

While Newars hailed the move, its detractors went to court. A group consisting of Lal Bahadur Thapa, Yagyanidhi Dahal, Hari Prasad Pokhrel, Achyut Raman Adhikari and Dhruba Raj Thebe filed a joint petition at the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] against their decision. And on 18 March 1998, the Supreme Court issued a stay order preventing Kathmandu Metropolitan City from using Nepal Bhasa pending a final verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Use Nepali, directs SC|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stay order to KMC to stop using Newari|url=|accessdate= |newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=20 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, on 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nepal&gt;{{cite news|last=Limbu|first=Ramyata|title=Attempt to Limit Official Language to Nepali Resented|url=http://ipsnews.net/print.asp?idnews=79142|publisher=IPS|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=|date=21 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was announced, demonstrators marched through Kathmandu in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenepaldigest.org/archive/the-nepal-digest-june%2016-1999.html |title= SC quashes decisions on local languages | newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |date=2 June 1999 |website=|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Day===

Newars have been observing June 1 as Black Day with protest meets and public demonstrations recalling the day when the Supreme Court barred Nepal Bhasa from being used in local bodies. On some occasions, the protests have been marked by vandalism and arrest of protestors by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kathmandu's sons go on warpath|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-01/south-asia/28196200_1_kathmandu-nepali-congress-girija-prasad-koirala|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loktantra era==

A second People's Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution stated that the use of one's mother tongue in a local body or office shall not be barred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063 (2007)|publisher=UNDP Nepal|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219220657/http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}} Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, subtle discrimination persists. Organizations with names in Nepal Bhasa are not registered, and municipality officials refuse to accept applications written in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= State affairs

'''Old Occitan''' ([[Occitan language|Modern Occitan]]: ''{{lang|oc|occitan ancian}}'', {{lang-ca|occità antic}}), also called '''Old Provençal''', was the earliest form of the [[Occitano-Romance languages]], as attested in writings dating from the eighth through the fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Posner]], ''The Romance Languages'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-28139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Chambers, ''An Introduction to Old Provençal Versification''. Diane, 1985 {{ISBN|0-87169-167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;"The Early Occitan period is generally considered to extend from {{circa|800}} to 1000, Old Occitan from 1000 to 1350, and Middle Occitan from 1350 to 1550" in William W. Kibler, ''Medieval France: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8240-4444-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the term ''{{lang|la|occitanus}}'' appeared around the year 1300,&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Bergin, ''Old Provençal Primer'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Old Occitan is referred to as "Romance" (Occitan: ''{{lang|pro|romans}}'') or "Provençal" (Occitan: ''{{lang|pro|proensals}}'') in medieval texts.

==History==
Among the earliest records of Occitan are the ''[[Tomida femina]]'', the ''[[Boecis]]'', and the ''[[Cançó de Santa Fe]]''. Old Occitan, the language used by the [[troubadours]], was the first [[Romance language]] with a literary corpus and had an enormous influence on the development of [[lyric poetry]] in other European languages. The [[interpunct]] was a feature of its orthography, and survives today in Catalan and [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

The [[Old Catalan language]] and Old Occitan diverged from each other between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martín de Riquer|Riquer, Martí de]], ''Història de la Literatura Catalana'', vol. 1. Barcelona: Edicions Ariel, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Early texts in the Catalan dialect are the ''[[Homilies d'Organyà]]'', ''[[Cançó de Santa Fe]]'' and the ''[[Greuges de Guitard Isarn]]''. Catalan never underwent the shift from {{IPA|/u/}} to {{IPA|/y/}} or the shift from {{IPA|/o/}} to {{IPA|/u/}} (except in unstressed syllables in some dialects) so it had diverged phonologically before those changes affected Old Occitan.

==Phonology==
Old Occitan changed and evolved somewhat during its history, but the basic sound system can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The charts are based on phonologies given in Paden, William D., ''An Introduction to Old Occitan'', New York 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*Written {{angbr|ch}} is believed to have represented the affricate {{IPA|[tʃ]}}; but, since the spelling often alternates with {{angbr|c}}, it may also have represented [k].
*Word-final {{angbr|g}} may sometimes represent {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, as in ''[[wikt:gaug#Old Provençal|gaug]]'' "joy" (also spelled ''gauch'').
*Intervocalic {{angbr|z}} could represent either {{IPA|[z]}} or {{IPA|[dz]}}.
*Written {{angbr|j}} could represent either {{IPA|[dʒ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}.

[[File:Old Occitan vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|This vowel chart gives a general idea of the vowel space of Old Occitan. It is not meant to be a precise mapping of the tongue positions, which would be impossible to do anyway since there are no native speakers of Old Occitan.]]

Notes:
* {{IPA|[o]}} apparently raised to {{IPA|[u]}} during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; but the spelling was unaffected, hence ''[[wikt:flor#Old Provençal|flor]]'' {{IPA|/fluɾ/}} "flower".&lt;ref&gt;See Paden 1998, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
* The open-mid vowels {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} appear as allophones of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} respectively under certain circumstances in stressed syllables.

==Morphology==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}

Some notable characteristics of Old Occitan:
* The language had a two-case system (nominative and oblique), as in [[Old French]], with the oblique derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[accusative case]]. The declensional categories were also similar to those of Old French; for example, the Latin third-declension nouns with stress shift between the nominative and accusative were continued in Old Occitan only in nouns referring to people.
* There were two distinct conditional tenses, a "first conditional" that was similar to the conditional tense in other Romance languages and a "second conditional" derived from the Latin pluperfect indicative tense. The second conditional is cognate with the literary pluperfect in Portuguese, the ''-ra'' imperfect subjunctive in Spanish, the second preterite of very early Old French ([[Sequence of Saint Eulalia]]), and probably the future perfect in modern [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

==Extracts==
* From [[Bertran de Born]]'s ''{{lang|pro|Ab joi mou lo vers e·l comens}}'' ({{circa|1200}}, translated by James H. Donalson):
{{Verse translation |lang=pro
|
Bela Domna·l vostre cors gens
E·lh vostre bel olh m'an conquis,
E·l doutz esgartz e lo clars vis,
E·l vostre bels essenhamens,
Que, can be m'en pren esmansa,
De beutat no·us trob egansa:
La genser etz c'om posc'e·l mon chauzir,
O no·i vei clar dels olhs ab que·us remir.
|
O pretty lady, all your grace
and eyes of beauty conquered me,
sweet glance and brightness of your face
and all your nature has to tell
so if I make an appraisal
I find no one like in beauty:
most pleasing to be found in all the world
or else the eyes I see you with have dimmed.

As an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] the study of '''politics in education''' has two main roots.  The first root is based on theories from [[political science]] while the second root is footed in [[Organizational studies|organizational theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scribner|first=J. D.|author2=Aleman, E. |author3=Maxcy, B. |title=Emergence of the Politics of Education Field: Making Sense of the Messy Center|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|date=February 1, 2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–40|doi=10.1177/0013161X02239759}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Political science attempts to explain how societies and [[social organization]]s use [[Political power|power]] to establish regulations and allocate resources.  Organizational theory uses [[scientific theories]] of management to develop deeper understandings regarding the function of organizations.

Researchers have drawn a distinction between two types of politics in [[school]]s.  The term ''micropolitics'' refers to the use of formal and informal power by individuals and groups to achieve their goals in organizations. Cooperative and conflictive processes are integral components of micropolitics. ''Macropolitics'' refers to how power is used and decision making is conducted at district, state, and federal levels.  Macropolitics is generally considered to exist outside the school, but researchers have noted that micro- and macropolitics may exist at any level of school systems depending on circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blasé |first=J. |author2=Blase, J.|title=The Micropolitics of Instructional Supervision: A Call for Research |journal=Educational Administration Quarterly |date=February 1, 2002|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–44|doi=10.1177/0013161X02381002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist significant difference between "Politics of Education" and "Politics in Education". More debates on the preavailing differences are solicited from academia of the world to define politics educationally.

'''Saman''' (or the dance of a thousand hands) is one of the most popular dances in [[Indonesia]]. Its origin is from the [[Gayo people|Gayo]] ethnic group from [[Gayo Lues]], [[Aceh]] province, [[Sumatra]], and is normally performed to celebrate important occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saman Dance | url=http://papanidea.com/2010/05/saman-dance/ | accessdate =2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is characterized by its fast-paced rhythm and common harmony between dancers. These two elements are key figures of Saman, and are among the reasons Saman are widely known and practiced in Indonesia, besides being relatively easy to learn. 

On November 24, 2011, [[UNESCO]] officially recognized Aceh's traditional Saman dance as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]], which needs UNESCO's urgent protection.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title="Saman dance", Inscribed in 2011 (6.COM) on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;USL=00509 |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/24/unesco-officially-recognizes-saman-dance-part-world-heritage.html |title=UNESCO officially recognizes Saman Dance as part of world heritage |date=November 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127150702/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/24/unesco-officially-recognizes-saman-dance-part-world-heritage.html |archivedate=November 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ASEAN]] Tourism Association (ASEANTA) named the Saman dance as the best ASEAN cultural preservation effort at the 25th ASEANTA Awards for Excellence 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/13/saman-dance-named-best-asean-cultural-preservation-effort.html |title=Saman dance named best ASEAN cultural preservation effort |date=January 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115080039/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/13/saman-dance-named-best-asean-cultural-preservation-effort.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Het_zogenaamde_Main_Thaman_te_Lokep_TMnr_10004908.jpg|thumb|300px|Saman dance in Lokop, [[East Aceh Regency]] during Dutch colonial period]]

The dance is done by a group of people without musical instruments. Originally, the group was exclusively male. In performing this dance, the player sings some songs while doing some attractive movements. A short song (which leads to a short dance) can last for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

==Performance==
A typical Saman performance is usually constituted of the following elements: The dancers enter the stage and immediately form a single line while sitting in a form equivalent to the Japanese [[seiza]]. The singer then begins to sing, with the lyrics at the beginning commonly telling the general attributes of [[Gayo people|Gayo]] culture at medium pace. The dancers then begin to move their hands in a rhythmic manner, following the movements. As the dance progresses, the movements are also performed with arms, head, and the upper body. The pace becomes faster, and the seat positions may change. The key element is that every dancer must move at the same time, creating a homogeneous, continuous, line of movement that is often described as the defining feature of Saman dance. One thing that makes this dance quite unique is that the original Saman dance which comes from Gayo Lues is not accompanied by any musical instruments.

The '''Sarajevo Marathon''' [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), created in 2007, organizes a half marathon annually, usually at the end of September, in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The organisation hopes to run the race as a full marathon in the near future. NGO  Sarajevo Marathon aims to raise awareness about running culture and the benefits of a dynamic and healthy lifestyle.

==History==
NGO Sarajevo Marathon was created in 2007 to organize a marathon in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The goal of the marathon is to improve people's physical and mental health and to promote the country.  The NGO has successfully contributed to improving image of the country as well as of Sarajevo and is raising awareness about running as part of a healthy lifestyle.

Most of the members of NGO Sarajevo Marathon are from Bosnia and Herzegovina and are experienced athletes who run more than {{convert|3500|km}} each per year.

NGO Sarajevo Marathon organizes three races per year, which are intended as a tool to progressively create the first marathon in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They also have the more general aims of  improving the well-being of society as a whole through promoting a healthy and dynamic lifestyle, volunteering, and raising ecological awareness. In 2009, about 300 people from three youth structures worked for the half marathon. The races help improve the tourism sector; in 2009, 300 hotel nights were booked in Sarajevo.

==Activities==
The running culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still fairly small. Since 2009, the NGO has been organizing three races every year: Run to Europe, Run to the Hills, and The Sarajevo Half Marathon (which includes a 3&amp;nbsp;km fun run). By offering a range of events, the group attempts to reach a large part of the population by enabling people to run in at least one of the races, or more according to their physical abilities. Each race offers an opportunity to discover a beautiful part of Sarajevo and its surroundings.

The Sarajevo half marathon was one of the most important international sport events in the city in 2009. It was a successful experience by all indicators, according to comments and opinions of runners, other race managers, sponsors and partners. The association's core team has been widened since 2010 with permanent representatives in Rome and in Stockholm.

===The Sarajevo Half Marathon===

The Sarajevo Half Marathon is a {{convert|21.6|km}} fast and flat street race, going through the most beautiful part of the city. It starts in front of the [[Olympic Hall Zetra]]. There are refreshment stations every 4&amp;nbsp;km and medical service are provided. The organizers offer T-shirts, medals, and a new route each year in order to create interest and to ensure good participation. Nearly 900 runners from 30 countries took part in the 2010 event.

===Run to Europe===
Run to Europe is a {{convert|4|km}} fast and flat street race, taking place in Sarajevo. It starts and finishes in front of the buildings of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) institutions. The event is organized in cooperation with both The Delegation of the EU Union in BiH and The Directorate for European Integration of BiH to mark Europe day (BiH is a potential candidate country for EU accession). More than 400 runners took part in the 2010 event.

===Run to the Hills===
Run to the Hills is a {{convert|10|km}} trail race organized on Mont Igman, one of Sarajevo's Olympic sites. The hilly and challenging route combined with beautiful green scenery make the race unforgettable. The race mark the annual World Environment Day. More than 150 runners took part in the 2010 event and most European countries were represented.

'''Sloyd''' ('''''Slöjd'''''), also known as '''Educational sloyd''', is a system of handicraft-based education started by [[Uno Cygnaeus]] in [[Finland]] in 1865. The system was further refined and promoted worldwide, and was taught in the [[United States]] until the early 20th Century. It is still taught as a compulsory subject in Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian schools.

[[Image:Sloejdsal 1931.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Woodwork room for teaching sloyd in Denmark, 1931]]

== Historical overview ==

=== Background ===
The word "sloyd" is derived from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word ''Slöjd'', which translates as [[crafts]], handicraft, or handiwork. It refers primarily to [[woodwork]] but also paper-folding and [[sewing]], [[embroidery]], [[knitting]] and [[crochet]].

[[Otto Salomon]], with the financial support of his uncle, started a school for teachers in [[Nääs]] (now a part of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] municipality of Lerum) in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=621&amp;letter=A Jewish Encyclopedia: Abrahamson, August], Retrieved August 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The school attracted students from throughout the world and was active until around 1960.

Educational sloyd's purpose was [[Formative assessment|formative]] in that it was thought that the benefits of handicrafts in [[Secondary education|general education]] built the character of the child, encouraging moral behavior, greater intelligence, and industriousness. Sloyd had a noted impact on the early development of manual training, manual arts, industrial education and technical education.

=== Sloyd in Sweden ===
Sloyd (''Slöjd'') has been a Swedish school subject since the 1870s and compulsory since 1955. In the present national curriculum for Swedish elementary schools, students have classes in ''Slöjd'' every semester, normally between the ages of nine and fifteen.

In most schools, the course is still divided traditionally in two parts: soft materials (textiles) and hard materials (woodwork and metalwork). Each semester, students switch between the two different classrooms. Differences in what kind of tasks are selected, and how the subject-specific content is handled, depend on the teacher's training.

The present aims of the ''Slöjd'' curriculum in Sweden are:
*developing the ability to create and design self-made products in different materials
*managing handtools and materials
*expressing cultural and aesthetic values.

Sloyd also aims to develop the student's practical knowledge, and their ability to solve practical problems through knowledge of different working processes, as well as how to evaluate the results of their own work during the production process by trying out different ways to handle specific tools or materials or by choosing alternative tools and materials.

=== Sloyd in America ===
[[File:Meri Toppelius (1894).png|thumb|Meri Toppelius]]
Born in Finland, [[Meri Toppelius]] was the first to introduce the sloyd system in the United States.{{sfn|Harper|1891|p=153}}

The major points of sloyd introduction in the United States were Gustaf Larsson's Sloyd Teacher Training School, which was housed on the fourth floor of the North Bennet Street Industrial School (now the [https://www.nbss.edu/ North Bennet Street School]) in Boston, and at the Baron de Hirsch Trade School in NYC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Of the sloyd system, North Bennet Street Industrial School's annual report from the school year 1908-1909 had the following to say:

{{quote|The North Bennet Street Industrial School came into being in 1880 as an answer to the question thus stated in the first annual report: 'Might we not train these unskilled masses, and thus create a demand for them and their labor?' Throughout its history, the school has had a single aim—social betterment by means of such education as shall increase efficiency and respect for labor.... Indeed, it is largely due to the work started here and developed through the Sloyd Training School that manual training has become the inheritance of children over our entire country.}}

That same annual report goes on to say that "The Sloyd Training School, for many years occupying the fourth floor, was given a new building on Harcourt Street, the growth and demands upon the school having increased to such an extent as made the old quarters entirely inadequate. The implication is that the teachings were further absorbed into the Boston educational system.

Gustaf Larsson wrote a number of books about sloyd and sloyd education, and B.B. Hoffmann, principal of the Baron De Hirsch Trade School, also published an important text.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Ednah Anne Rich, a graduate of Gustaf Larsson's school in Boston and of the Sloyd Training School at Nääs started Sloyd teacher training in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. In a few years, sloyd was being taught in hundreds of schools throughout the US.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

== Principles ==
[[File:SalomonOtto.jpg|thumb|Otto Salomon]]
=== Developmental goal ===
In “Educational sloyd,” as devised by [[Otto Salomon]] in the 1870s, woodworking projects were designed to build incrementally on the child’s growing skill. This was accomplished by making the projects grow in degree of difficulty over a period of time, through the introduction of complexity of shape and procedures and through the gradual introduction of more difficult woodworking tools. Salomon believed that the teacher should carefully study and know each child.  It was said that from the student’s perspective, no project should be any more difficult than the immediately preceding project. Sloyd was taught through the use of series of models, growing in difficulty and complexity that the students were supposed to accurately reproduce without interference from the teacher. Salomon developed "exercises" in the use of various tools leading to proficiency in the making of models. The exercises in the use of various tools were developed through careful study by Salomon, but he also encouraged that model series be adapted and made relevant to the various cultures in which sloyd was taught. The objects in the model series were designed to be useful to the child and his family, thereby building a relationship of good will and mutual support in the child's education.

"Paper sloyd," in particular, was intended as a preparation for woodworking and sewing, which were considered more difficult work appropriate for older students. The book "Paper Sloyd for Primary Grades" suggests that the craft's benefits for the student included the following: "Observation is quickened; eyes are trained to see right lines and distances, thus aiding in free-hand drawing and writing; while the hand and wrist muscles, being used for a definite purpose, unconsciously become obedient assistants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rich  | first = Edna A.  | title = Paper Sloyd: A Handbook for Primary Grades  | publisher = Ginn &amp; Company  | year = 1905  | location = Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper sloyd consisted of paper folding which resembles the Japanese art of [[origami]], but involves more cutting and gluing. Projects might include folding a case for a comb or whiskbroom, a box for candies or pencils, pinwheels, a "match scratcher," a blotting pad, or a penwiper.

=== Unique characteristics ===

[[File:Basicbench.jpg|thumb]]Sloyd differed from other forms of manual training in its adherence to a set of distinct [[pedagogical]] principles.  These were: that instruction should move from the known to the unknown, from the easy to the more difficult, from the simple to the more complex, from the concrete to the abstract and the products made in sloyd should be practical in nature and build the relationship between home and school. Sloyd, unlike its major rival, [[Education in Russia|"the Russian system"]] promoted by [[Victor Della-Vos]], was designed for general rather than vocational education.

Educational sloyd as practiced in Sweden started with the use of the knife. The knife was controversial when sloyd was first introduced in the [[UK]]. Educators in [[London]] and the other cities of the UK could hardly imagine putting knives in the hands of the juveniles. They developed a rationale for the use of chisels instead. Salomon's purpose in the use of the knife was that it illustrates a fundamental premise. During the time of sloyd’s invention and introduction in rural Sweden, nearly every boy growing up on a farm was already experienced in the use of the knife and knew how to use it without endangering himself or others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Starting with the known and moving toward the unknown was a crucial element of Salomon’s theory. He also believed that beauty of form was more readily available through the use of the knife.

Salomon believed that of all the basic crafts, woodworking best fit general educational purposes. Because most schools would not be able to afford to introduce a wide variety of crafts to their students, the overall needs of education would be best served through woodworking sloyd. He adhered rigidly to this plan, and it wasn’t until his death that textile and metal sloyd were added to the teacher training at Nääs. It was also clear to Salomon, that mastery of a single craft was more important than a cursory exploration of several crafts that did not offer the student the opportunity of reaching a point of mastery.

Unlike woodworking education of the later years in the US, woodworking sloyd was introduced in the primary grades for the greatest benefit to the child’s growing intellect. This was in contrast to the Russian system devised by Victor Della Vos, which was intended as a vocational system to help prepare students for employment in industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The distinctions between the two systems were greater than perceived by many. Both used series of models, but the Russian system used only parts of things rather than finished objects. Salomon's system was based firmly on his study of a long line of educational philosophers like [[Rousseau]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Commenius]] and others. Teacher training at Nääs involved extensive lectures in the fundamental theory of education.  Salomon believed that teaching was an art in itself, and that woodworking skills were of secondary importance in the teaching of sloyd. Of various educational theorists, sloyd is most closely associated with Fröbel. "Hand &amp; Eye," an educational journal published in England from about 1890-1902, was dedicated to joint discussion of the principles of "Freobelian education" and Educational sloyd.

=== Relationship to physical education ===
As Salomon was a great believer in physical education, training teachers in games was part of the basic curriculum. In fact, the school at Nääs was the point of introduction of basketball to Europe,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} with the game being brought to the school by students from the US. Salomon also believed that woodworking was a means for physical development. He drew a distinction between the posture of the carpenter, and the proper posture for use in sloyd.

== Legacy ==
Salomon kept up regular correspondence with former students all over the world, spoke in several languages, and delivered his lectures on alternate days in Swedish, English, and German. He was not as good in English – but he practiced in his lessons and conversations during the summer courses. “My English is always better in the autumn”, he said as a joke.

Thousands of teachers from all over the world attended classes at Nääs. Some of the countries, in which sloyd was successfully introduced were the UK, the US, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, the Scandinavian Countries and many more.

== Today ==
Currently, sloyd is still part of the compulsory school curriculum in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. In Sweden, students take part in both wood and metal, and textile sloyd (but only given one grade that covers both areas), in Denmark all three materials are compulsory as individual subjects, and in Norway they are united into one subject called ''forming''.

While sloyd disappeared from the American educational landscape in the early 1900s, articles have been published by Doug Stowe in Woodwork Magazine, August 2004 and again in August 2005, and by Joe Barry in the Journal of the American Period Furniture Makers, September 2004, Volume IV.

Roy Underhill gives a 30-minute presentation from "The Book of Sloyd"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/woodwrightsshop/watch-on-line/watch-season-episodes/2017-2018-episodes/ The Woodwright's Shop, Season 37, Episode 1]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[The Woodwright's Shop]] on PBS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9637">A '''spiritual successor''', sometimes called a '''spiritual sequel''', is a successor to a work of fiction which does not build upon the storyline established by a previous work as do most traditional [[prequel]]s or [[sequel]]s, yet features many of the same elements, themes, and styles as its source material, thereby resulting in it being related or similar "in spirit" to its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Dan | last = Carreker | title =  The Game Developer's Dictionary:: A Multidisciplinary Lexicon for Professionals and Students | isbn = 1435460820 | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2012 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lee et al"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Relationships among video games: Existing standards and new definitions | author = Jin Ha Lee |first2=Rachel Ivy |last2=Clarke |first3=Simone |last3=Sacchi |first4=Jacob |last4=Jett | journal = Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | year = 2014 | pages = 1–11 | doi = 10.1002/meet.2014.14505101035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' was not originally scripted with any connection to ''[[Cloverfield]]''. When the film was acquired by [[Bad Robot Productions]], producer [[J. J. Abrams]] recognized a common element of a giant monster attack between the two films, and chose to market ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' as a spiritual successor to ''Cloverfield'' to help bring interest to the newer film, and allowing him to establish a franchise he could build upon in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hot-new-movie-catchphrase-call-875626 | title = Hot New Movie Catchphrase: Call It a "Spiritual Successor," Not a Sequel | first1 = Pamela | last1 = McClintock | first2= Borys |last2= Kit | date = March 17, 2016 | accessdate = May 4, 2017 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games ==
One example of a spiritual sequel resulting from legal issues is ''[[Dark Souls]]'' by [[From Software]], inspired by ''[[Demon's Souls]]'' by the same studio. The rights for ''Demon's Souls'', an exclusive title for the [[PlayStation 3]], was held by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], preventing From Software from making a successor on other platforms, leading them to create a new property with similar gameplay mechanics for the [[Xbox 360]] and other platforms.&lt;ref name="lee et al"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/02/10/shuhei-yoshida-interview.aspx | title = Sony Talks The Last Guardian, Demon's Souls, And The Vita Launch | first = Jim | last = Reilly | date = February 10, 2012 | accessdate = May 3, 2017 | work = [[Game Informer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] as a spiritual sequel to their licensed title ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]''. Rare had planned to develop a sequel to ''GoldenEye'' but lost the license as they were outbid by [[Electronic Arts]]. The developers still wanted to complete another spy-based title and developed ''Perfect Dark'' with a new story but with similar mechanics to ''GoldenEye''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=28 December 2015 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/learn-how-perfect-dark-came-to-be-in-this-behind-t/1100-6433378/ |title=Learn How Perfect Dark Came to Be in this Behind-the-Scenes Video |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |author=Eddie Makuch |date=December 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6e7WEzauc?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/learn-how-perfect-dark-came-to-be-in-this-behind-t/1100-6433378/ |archivedate=December 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2011 |url=http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/068/068109p1.html |title=Perfect Dark Interview |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 14, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316142941/http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/068/068109p1.html |archivedate=March 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE EXAMPLES! --&gt; 
All [[Final Fantasy]] games in the original series are spiritual successors of the original game rather than being sequels. The first proper story sequel was [[Final Fantasy X-2]].

''[[BioShock]]'' is one such example as a spiritual successor to ''[[System Shock 2]]''. ''System Shock 2'' was the first title developed by [[Irrational Games]], a studio founded by [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], and while the game was met with critical acclaim, it was considered a commercial failure. Levine attempted to pitch a sequel to ''System Shock 2'' but their publisher [[Electronic Arts]] declined due to poor sales of ''System Shock 2''. After several years and other projects at Irrational, as well as being acquired by a new publisher [[2K Games]], Levine wanted to develop a game with the free-form narrative of ''System Shock 2'', which ultimately became the game ''BioShock''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-17-the-true-story-of-bioshock | title = Rapture leaked: The true story behind the making of BioShock | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = April 17, 2014 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | first = Simon | last = Parkin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edge history"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | title = The Making Of: BioShock | date = July 23, 2012 | accessdate = November 1, 2016 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531030452/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'' was considered a spiritual successor to ''[[Ico]]'' by the lead director of both games [[Fumito Ueda]]; Ueda did not want to necessarily make the connection between the games one of a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative, but that both had similar narrative themes and elements that he wanted players to interpret on their own.&lt;ref name="colossalcreation"&gt;{{cite web |author1=McNamara, Andy  |author2=Berghammer, Billy  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2006 | title=Colossal Creation: The Kenji Kaido and Fumito Ueda Interview | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm | work=Game Informer | accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903065641/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm |archivedate = September 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of a video game spiritual successor is the 2017 game ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]'', which is considered a spiritual successor to the [[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|''Banjo-Kazooie'' series]]. ''Yooka-Laylee'' was developed by [[Playtonic Games]], which consists of former employees of [[Rare (company)|Rare]]; the company that developed the games in the ''Banjo-Kazooie'' series. Another recent example of a video game spiritual successor is [[Two Point Hospital]] by [[Two Point Studios]], which is a spiritual successor to [[Theme Hospital]] by [[Bullfrog Productions]].

A '''sponge''' is a [[tool]] or cleaning aid made of soft, porous material. Typically used for cleaning [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious]] surfaces, sponges are especially good at [[Capillary action|absorbing]] water and water-based solutions.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word σπόγγος (''spongos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*s111%3Aentry+group%3D61%3Aentry%3Dspo%2Fggos|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first references of sponges used for hygiene dates from the [[Ancient Greece]]. Competitors of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] bathed themselves with [[sea sponges]] soaked in olive oil or perfume before competing. In the book ''[[Odyssey]]'' by the Greek poet [[Homer]], the god [[Hephaestus]] cleans his hands, face, and chest with a sea sponge, and the servants in the [[Odysseus]] palace also used sea sponges to clean the tables after the meals the [[suitors of Penelope]] had there. The Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] also mentioned sea sponges in both scientific and historic contexts in their works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaspongecompany.com/pages/sea-sponge-history|title=The History of the Sea Sponge|last=Inc.|first=The Sea Sponge Company™|website=The Sea Sponge Company™ Inc.|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalymnos-shop.gr/en/blog/natural-sponges/natural-sea-sponges-and-sponge-diving-history|title=Natural Sea Sponges and sponge diving history|website=www.kalymnos-shop.gr|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greeks also used sea sponges tied to sticks as toilet paper, and washed them with sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/historia/como-era-feita-a-higiene-bucal-antes-da-pasta-de-dente/|title=Como era feita a higiene bucal antes da pasta de dente?|work=Mundo Estranho|access-date=2018-04-14|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] also used sea sponges extensively for hygiene and other uses. The belief that sponges had therapeutic properties led to its usage in medicine for cleaning wounds and treating disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sea sponges were used as [[tampons]] by females throughout history and are still used as a cheaper and more eco-friendly alternative to fibre ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://menstrualcupreviews.net/sea-sponge-menstrual-soft-tampons-product-reviews/|title=2017's Top 5 Sea Sponge Menstrual (Soft) Tampons {{!}} Reviews|website=menstrualcupreviews.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researchers do not recommend using sea sponges as tampons, as they may contain dirt and microorganisms, especially if poorly sanitized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm123803.htm|title=Compliance Policy Guides - CPG Sec. 345.300 Menstrual Sponges|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/20/why-you-shouldnt-use-sea-sponges-as-a-natural-alternative-to-tampons-5894193/|title=Why you shouldn't use sea sponges as a natural alternative to tampons|date=2016-05-20|work=Metro|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], a Roman soldier offers [[Jesus Christ]] a sponge soaked in vinegar on the tip of his spear (some versions say staff) for Jesus to drink during his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], as an act of mockery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27:48&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 27:48 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/living/religion/article438813/Was-the-act-by-the-Roman-soldier-of-placing-a-sponge-on-the-tip-of-his-spear-dipping-it-in-gall-and-offering-it-to-Jesus-on-the-cross-an-act-of-mercy-or-mockery.html|title=Was the act by the Roman soldier of placing a sponge on the tip of his spear, dipping it in gall and offering it to Jesus on the cross an act of mercy or mockery?|work=kansascity|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic sponges were made possible to be manufactured only after the invention of [[polyester]] in 1941 and the commercial production of [[polyurethane foam]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vortex-power.com/eng/home2.html|title=Polyurethane Foam Kitchen Sponge.

==Material==
Synthetic sponges can be made of polyester, polyurethane, or vegetal cellulose. Polyurethane is used in polyester sponges for their [[Scouring pad|abrasive side]]. Polyester sponges are more common for dish washing and are usually soft and yellow.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corazzi.com/pulizia-domestic/dom-converters/sponge-scourers/polyester-sponge-and-cellulose-sponge/|title=Polyester sponge and Cellulose sponge|last=S.r.l.|first=Corazzi Fibre|website=www.corazzi.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.par-group.co.uk/rubber-and-polyurethane/polyurethane-engineering/polyurethane-sponge-dynathane/|title=Polyurethane Sponge - Dynathane {{!}} PAR Group|website=www.par-group.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetal cellulose sponges made of [[wood fiber]] are more used for bathing and skin cleaning, and are usually tougher and more expensive than polyester sponges. They are considered more eco-friendly than polyester sponges as they are [[biodegradable]] and made of natural materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/your-home/at-home/questions/whats-the-difference-between-cellulose-sponges-and-those-other-kitchen-s|title=What's the difference between cellulose sponges and those other kitchen sponges?|last=Hickman|first=Matt|date=2017-08-21|website=Mother Nature Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harboring bacteria==
[[image:20100404_205709_BacteriaFromKitchenSponge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bacteria]] from a kitchen sponge]]
Because it is primarily made of wood fiber, a cellulose sponge can be a medium for the growth of harmful [[bacteria]] or [[fungus|fungi]], especially when it is allowed to remain wet between uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://search.proquest.com/openview/8508f6cdd54d5692d03ff82c87ed844f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar | volume=62 | title=Reducing bacteria in household sponges | journal=Journal of Environmental Health | pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
Several methods have been used to clean sponges. Studies have investigated the use of the [[microwave oven|microwave]] to clean non-metallic domestic sponges that have been thoroughly moistened. A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for two minutes (at 1000 watt power) killed 99% of [[coliform]]s, ''[[E. coli]]'', and [[MS2 phage]]s, but ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' spores required four minutes.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713513003745 | doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.026 | volume=35 | title=Hygiene in the home kitchen: Changes in behaviour and impact of key microbiological hazard control measures | journal=Food Control | pages=392–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some fires were caused by people trying to replicate the results at home, the study's author urged people to make sure their sponges were wet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6293735.stm "Microwave 'sterilisers' warning"]. 24 January 2007. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study showed that the microwave and the [[dishwasher]] were both effective ways to clean domestic sponges.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

== In economy ==
[[Caribbean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] developing countries are the largest sponge exporters, whereas the largest importers are developed [[Europe]]an and [[North-America]]n countries. [[Tunisia]] is the world's main sponge exporter, exporting 90% of its sponge production. [[France]] is the main importer, being supplied by Tunisia, but France's sponge demand has fallen in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AC286E/AC286E04.htm|title=SPONGES: WORLD PRODUCTION AND MARKETS|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Archko Volume''''' or '''''Archko Library''''' &lt;ref&gt;E.J. Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1931), 58&lt;/ref&gt; is a 19th-century volume containing what purports to be a series of reports from Jewish and pagan sources contemporary with [[Jesus]] that relate to the biblical texts describing his life. The work went through a number of versions and has remained in print ever since. The texts are otherwise unknown, and the author was convicted by an ecclesiastical court of falsehood and plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1956), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of publication==
In 1879, the Rev. [[William Dennes Mahan]], a [[Cumberland Presbyterian]] minister of [[Boonville, Missouri]], published a pamphlet of thirty-two pages entitled ''A Correct Transcript of Pilate's Court''. It purported to be an official report of the [[Trial of Jesus|trial and death of Jesus]] made directly to the [[Tiberius|Roman Emperor Tiberius]] by [[Pilate]] as governor of [[Judaea]]. Mahan claimed the text was supplied to him in 1856 by a German scholar, Henry C. Whydaman, from Father Peter Freelinhusen, "the chief guardian of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]," who sent the Latin text to Whydaman’s brother-in-law, C.C. Vantberger of New York, for English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 42; ''Modern Apocrypha'', 1956, 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Whydaman, Freelinhusen, and Vantberger are otherwise unknown, and the documentation of the exchange contains inconsistencies and errors, including Freelinhusen’s request for a fee payable in "[[daric]]s" (ancient Persian coins).&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was subsequently shown to have been copied almost verbatim from "Ponce Pilate à Vienne," a short story by [[Joseph Méry]] published in ''[[Revue de Paris]]'' in 1837. Méry said he had been inspired by an old [[Manuscript|Latin manuscript]], and an 1842 English translation of the story made the claim that it was in fact taken from an old Latin manuscript. Mahan’s contribution was evidently to create correspondence showing him to be the discoverer of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Per Beskow, ''Strange Tales about Jesus'' (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1983) 53–54: "As Goodspeed has shown, Mahan unabashedly plagiarized an existing story, and I am happy to have identified the original author: it was the French dramatician Joseph Mery (1798–1867), who wrote a number of short stories in his youth. The original story, ''Ponce Pilate à Vienne'', was published in the ''Revue de Paris'' in 1837; a comparison with Mahan's "manuscript" reveals a literal agreement in every detail, except where the text has been distorted by mistranslations or misreadings."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
In 1884 Mahan published the first version of the Archko Volume, entitled ''The Archaeological Writings of the Sanhedrin and Talmuds of the Jews, Taken from the Ancient Parchments and Scrolls at Constantinople and the Vatican at Rome, Being the Record Made by the Enemies of Jesus of Nazareth in His Day: The Most Interesting History Ever Read by Man''. This included an expanded version of "Pilate's Court" plus a series of other texts that he claimed to have obtained himself in a visit to Rome and Constantinople and translated with the aid of Dr. M. McIntosh of Scotland and Dr. Twyman of England, also otherwise unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts include interviews with the shepherds, Gamaliel's interview with [[Joseph (father of Jesus)|Joseph]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Caiaphas]]'s reports to the [[Sanhedrin]], Eli's story of the [[Magi]], [[Herod the Great|Herod Antipater]]'s defense before the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] for the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], and [[Herod Antipas]]'s defense before the Senate&amp;mdash;all with the claim that they were copied from ancient manuscripts and translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 1931, 49–50; Archko Volume, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts are otherwise unknown to scholarship, and the volume contains various inconsistencies. It quotes an unknown Greek philosopher, "Meeleesen," and includes references to [[Josephus]] that do not exist. It mistakenly asserts that [[Philo]] spoke often of Jesus and that "the scribes of those days were most all [[Rabbis]]." There are inaccurate descriptions of the library of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople, the making of [[papyrus]], and an inaccurate chronology for both Philo and [[Tacitus]]. Contemporaries raised the question of whether Mahan could have possibly made the trip to Rome and Constantinople in less than two months. Most tellingly, large portions of "Eli and the Story of the Magi" were copied verbatim from the 1880 novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]''. At one point, a strange word reveals that a single line of the printed text of ''Ben-Hur'' has accidentally been omitted during copying.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Mahan was summoned before church authorities in September 1885 on charges of falsehood and plagiarism. [[Lew Wallace]], author of ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' and [[US Ambassador to Turkey|American minister to Turkey]], testified that there was no record of Mahan’s visit to Turkey or to the library of the Hagia Sophia, and that the primary sources he cited were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, ''Modern Apocrypha'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahan was convicted and suspended from the ministry for one year. He promised to withdraw the book from publication.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; But the book was reprinted many times from 1887 onward by various publishers, since U.S. copyright laws were lax during this period. The title ''Archko Volume'' appeared during this period, as did the note "Second edition". This second edition omits "Eli and the Story of the Magi" and also creates a preface using material from the introductions to the texts. No new original material is included, which suggests that this version was produced by a publisher's clerk. The omission of the Eli text suggests that the court verdict was known to the reviser.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#5 Strange New Gospels], 1931, 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, modern reprints of the book were still being offered for sale on Amazon.com and other sites.

The circumstances of composition, the letters to the ''Boonville Advertiser'', and the proceedings of the church court were all investigated by [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]] and published in his books ''Strange New Gospels'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Apocrypha]]'' (1956); more recently [[Per Beskow]] (1983) has identified Mahan's original sources and reported on subsequent editions of the ''Archko Volume''.

'''''Thor: The Dark World''''' is a 2013 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It is the sequel to 2011's ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the eighth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]], with a screenplay by [[Christopher Yost]] and the writing team of [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]].&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt; It stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Thor, alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]], [[Zachary Levi]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], [[Jaimie Alexander]], and [[Rene Russo]]. In ''Thor: The Dark World'', Thor teams up with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to save the Nine Realms from the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elves]] led by the vengeful [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]], who intends to plunge the universe into darkness.

Development of ''Thor: The Dark World'' began in April 2011, when producer [[Kevin Feige]] announced plans for a sequel to follow the crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. In July 2011, [[Kenneth Branagh]], the director of ''Thor'', withdrew from the project. [[Brian Kirk]] and [[Patty Jenkins]] were considered to direct the film before Taylor was hired in January 2012. The supporting cast filled out in August 2012, with the hiring of Eccleston, Dennings, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Principal photography began in September 2012 in [[Surrey]], England with filming continuing in [[Iceland]] and London, before wrapping up in December 2012. ''Thor: The Dark World'' was converted to [[3D film|3D]] in post-production.
	
''Thor: The Dark World'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on October 22, 2013, and was released on November 8, 2013, in the United States. Many critics praised it for its visual effects and performances (particularly Hemsworth and Hiddleston), but criticized its story, villain, and pacing; many critics declare it the weakest of the MCU films.&lt;ref name="IWMixed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSMixed" /&gt; The film was a commercial success, grossing over $644&amp;nbsp;million worldwide and making it the [[2013 in film|10th highest-grossing film of 2013]]. A third film, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', was released on November 3, 2017.

--&gt;
Eons ago, [[Bor (comics)|Bor]], father of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], clashes with the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]], who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of [[Svartálfar|Svartalfheim]], Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unknown to Bor, Malekith as well as his lieutenant [[Kurse|Algrim]] and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.

In present-day [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth.{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|As depicted in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. The events of ''Thor: The Dark World'' are set a year after the events of ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;}} Meanwhile, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], alongside warriors [[Fandral]], [[Volstagg]], and [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], repel marauders on [[Vanaheim]], home of their comrade [[Hogun]]; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Nine Realms]] following the reconstruction of the [[Bifröst]], the "Rainbow Bridge" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier.{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}} The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.

In London, astrophysicist Dr. [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.

Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thor's mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] is killed protecting Foster, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Foster. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.

There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterward, Thor and Foster discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Lewis and Foster's mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]]—who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in [[Greenwich]]. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.

Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin's form transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin.

In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that with the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Tesseract]] already in Asgard, having two [[Infinity Stones]] so close together would be unwise. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a [[post-credits scene]], Foster and Thor reunite on Earth, while somewhere in London, a frost monster from [[Jötunheimr|Jotunheim]]—accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle—continues to run amok.

* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]: {{Cast list break|The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]].&lt;ref name="Hemsworth" /&gt; Hemsworth stated that the film addresses unresolved issues regarding Thor's relationships from previous films, "For Thor and Jane, there are some unanswered questions now, since obviously he didn't stop in and catch up with her in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. Thor might have some explaining to do in this one. And with Loki, we get down to the major bones of our conflict with everything that's come from ''Thor'' to ''Avengers'' to now."&lt;ref name="Hemsworth2" /&gt; Hemsworth added, "Thor's journey I think picks more so up from where we left the first one—About to take on the throne... and now coming to the realization of what responsibility comes with that. Also, Alan [Taylor] keeps talking about the dark side of that responsibility, and the secrets of being king or becoming sort of very political about what people need to know and what they want to know."&lt;ref name="Hemsworth3" /&gt; Hemsworth especially enjoyed the role of Thor in this film as he was able to, "... break him down and find his human qualities and his vulnerable side."&lt;ref name="TheMovieNetwork"/&gt;}}
* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: {{Cast list break|An [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and Thor's love interest,&lt;ref name="Portman" /&gt; who is brought from Earth to Asgard by Thor after she is infected with a mysterious energy.&lt;ref name="Portman2" /&gt; Producer [[Kevin Feige]] said, "[W]hile Thor was a fish out of water on Earth in the first two films (''Thor'' and ''The Avengers''), this time Jane is very much a fish out of water in Asgard."&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; Portman added, "It was a whole different adventure this time. Because Jane is the fish out of water. I didn't want to make it like ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure|Bill &amp; Ted]]'', or like a [[valley girl]] dumped into Shakespeareland."&lt;ref name="Portman3" /&gt; Portman also said the film finds Jane at a different place in her life, "Jane has moved, so she's now in London, not in Santa Fe anymore. Obviously she has gone through missing Thor and also being upset at him because he didn't come knock on her door when he was on her planet. She's definitely been getting over that and trying to move on."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; Hemsworth's wife [[Elsa Pataky]] stood in for Portman during the post-credits kissing scene due to a scheduling conflict.&lt;ref name="USWeekly" /&gt;}}
* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]: {{Cast list break|Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]], who forms an uneasy alliance with Thor against the Dark Elves.&lt;ref name="Hiddleston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes5" /&gt; On where he wished to take the character in the film, Hiddleston said, "I'd like to take [Loki] to his absolute rock bottom. I'd like to see him yield, essentially, to his darkest instincts. Then, having hit rock bottom, maybe come back up. I think the fascination for me about playing Loki is that, in the history of the mythology and the comic books and the Scandinavian myths, is he's constantly dancing on this fault line of the dark side and redemption."&lt;ref name="Hiddleston2" /&gt; Hiddleston recalled, "When I met Alan [Taylor], he asked me how I thought I could do Loki again without repeating myself and I remembered talking with Kevin Feige when we were on the ''Avengers'' promotional tour. I said, 'OK, you've seen Thor and Loki be antagonistic for two films now. It would be amazing to see them fight side by side. I've been the bad guy now twice, so I can't be again, or otherwise I shouldn't be in the film. So we have to find a new role for me to play."&lt;ref name="TotalFilm" /&gt;}}
* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]: {{Cast list break|The king of Asgard, father of Thor, and adoptive father of Loki, based on the deity of the [[Odin|same name]],&lt;ref name="Hopkins" /&gt; who disapproves of Jane Foster being in Asgard.&lt;ref name="Portman2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; Regarding Thor's relationship with his father, Hemsworth said, "[T]he conflict between Thor and Odin was so great in the first one... so, certainly they disagree as I think they always will at times but there's a far greater respect from each other. So it becomes, I guess, a more mature conversation, but there's more at stake this time, too. It's not sort of just their individual egos, the whole universe is at stake."&lt;ref name="Hemsworth3" /&gt; As to his approach Hopkins said, "I just play Odin like a human being, with maybe a little more dimension. I grow a beard, look hopefully impressive and keep it as real as possible."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt;}}
* [[Stellan Skarsgård]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: {{Cast list break|Foster's mentor and colleague.&lt;ref name="Skarsgård" /&gt; Skarsgård said, the film finds Selvig in a "disrupted mode" explaining, "Having a god in your head for a while creates some psychological problems", referring to the character's ordeal following ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Empire2" /&gt;}}
* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]: {{Cast list break|The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifröst|Bifröst Bridge]], based on the mythological deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]].&lt;ref name="Elba" /&gt; Elba said he has a larger role in the sequel, "In the new film we're going to get to know Heimdall the Asgardian a bit better, and we're going to get to know Asgard a bit better. I can't say too much, but the expansion of Thor in his world is going to be huge. My part was very small and functional in the first film".&lt;ref name="Elba2" /&gt;}}
* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]]: {{Cast list break|The ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] of [[Svartálfar|Svartalfheim]].&lt;ref name="Eccleston" /&gt; About Malekith's motivation, Eccleston said, "There is a kind of tragic quality to his quest. Because he's lost his wife, he's lost his children. He's lost everything. And he returns for revenge. And the agent for his revenge is the Aether. If he gets hold of that, he is omnipotent."&lt;ref name="Empire3" /&gt; Eccleston continued, "What I thought about a great deal was revenge—there's huge amounts of revenge. One quote is: 'When you seek revenge, be sure to dig two graves.' I did a film called ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]'' where I played a guy called Vindici—from the word 'vindictive'—and he is the distillation of revenge. So, in a way, that was what I had to think of: how revenge can make you absolutely monomaniacal—though you're still trying to make it recognizably motive-led. It's just the personification of movie evil."&lt;ref name="TotalFilm" /&gt; However Taylor stated that a lot of scenes involving Malekith's backstory had to be cut from the film to make it more efficient.&lt;ref name="CraveOnline" /&gt; Eccleston revealed that he speaks an invented language for the film explaining, "The Elvish language is definitely based on European languages. I think there’s probably some [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in there. It does have its logic and its rhythms. It also has many syllables and it's very difficult to do while remaining naturalistic. It's been a particular challenge for us but hopefully it gives the film some complexity and variety."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; Eccleston also said the role required six hours of make-up and 45 minutes in wardrobe.&lt;ref name="Empire3" /&gt;}}
* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as [[Kurse|Algrim / Kurse]]: {{Cast list break|A Dark Elf, and Malekith's trusted and loyal lieutenant, who is transformed into a monstrous creature in order to destroy Thor.&lt;ref name="Akinnuoye-Agbaje1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom2" /&gt; Akinnuoye-Agbaje described Kurse as "an amalgamation of a bull and a lava-like creature. He has very animalistic tendencies but with this insatiable and unstoppable power. As an actor, that's one of the hardest things to embody. You have to realize you are probably the most powerful thing you could imagine. And you have to be that. You can't pretend, so that when you face Thor, it's real."&lt;ref name="Akinnuoye-Agbaje2" /&gt; Akinnuoye-Agbaje stated the role required three hours of make-up a day and had to put on heavy duty prosthetics explaining, "The outfit weighed about 40 pounds. I'm sure there will be a certain amount of CGI but a good 80% was me in that suit."&lt;ref name="Akinnuoye-Agbaje2" /&gt; About the character Akinnuoye-Agbaje said, "I suppose Algrim and Kurse would be the quintessential baddies, but in reality they are what I perceive as the scorn and the victims of the story. They are the elves who have basically lost their planet and their race to another race, the Asgardians. Here is a man/alien who places a noble objective beyond his own life and I think there is something extremely inspiring about that because he looks at the bigger picture and sees himself as a means to that end." Akinnuoye-Agbaje added, "I worked with director Alan Taylor in trying to maintain Algrim's humanity all the way throughout Kurse's transformation, so that even when you see Kurse the beast, you can still relate to him as being Algrim inside. And symbolically we did that by keeping the same piercing blue eyes throughout."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt;}}
* [[Kat Dennings]] as Darcy Lewis: {{Cast list break|A [[political science]] major who is [[internship|interning]] for Foster.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennings3" /&gt; Her role in the film was expanded from the [[comic relief]] sidekick role she played in the first ''Thor'' film.&lt;ref name="Dennings" /&gt; Dennings said her character is "really bad at real science in this first movie. In the second movie, she's more interested, but she still doesn't know anything about it. She loves Jane, she really wants Jane and Thor to be together. It's almost like her own little soap opera that she watches."&lt;ref name="Dennings3" /&gt;}}
* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg]]: {{Cast list break|A member of the [[Warriors Three]]; a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.&lt;ref name="Stevenson" /&gt; About the character Stevenson said, "He's got a heart the size of a planet that he wears on his sleeve, so he's like a big kid."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; Regarding Volstagg's role in this film, Stevenson said, "Volstagg is struggling, he has a brood, they [the Warriors Three] are fighting for hearth and home as much as for the idea of Asgard itself. That's where he has trouble." Explaining, "He's all too aware of how potentially threatening this new enemy is on both the home front and the battlefield."&lt;ref name="Stevenson2" /&gt;}}
* [[Zachary Levi]] as [[Fandral]]: {{Cast list break|A member of the Warriors Three, characterized as an irrepressible [[swashbuckler]] and romantic.&lt;ref name="Levi2" /&gt; Levi replaced [[Josh Dallas|Joshua Dallas]] in the role due to Dallas's commitment on ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. Levi had been up for the role in the first film, but bowed out due to his commitment on ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''.&lt;ref name="Levi" /&gt; Levi compared the character to Flynn Rider, the character he played in the animated feature, ''[[Tangled]]'', "Fandral is a little similar to Rider in some ways... He's like this [[Lothario]]. He's like [[Errol Flynn]]. He loves ladies, as do I".&lt;ref name="Levi3" /&gt; Regarding the dynamic of the Warriors Three, Levi said, "The Warriors Three are here to support Thor. We are his confidants, his best friends. We've all grown up together in a lot of ways and fought many a battle together, escaped death. To me it's the way best friends ought to be—they're there when you need to talk and they're there if you don't want to talk, and they're there if you need to escape from your father's place in a flying skiff!"&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt;}}
* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun]]: A member of the Warriors Three, a native of [[Vanaheim]],&lt;ref name="Empire2" /&gt; primarily identified by his grim demeanor.&lt;ref name="LATimes2" /&gt;
* [[Jaimie Alexander]] as [[Sif (comics)|Sif]]: {{Cast list break|An Asgardian warrior, Thor's childhood friend and Jane Foster's romantic rival, based on the deity of the [[Sif|same name]].&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; Alexander said there is more character development for Sif and the film explores the Sif-Thor relationship.&lt;ref name="Alexander3" /&gt; Alexander elaborated, "I really tried to bring a little bit more vulnerability in this film. Sif is very much in love with Thor and very much cares about his well-being. So she kicks a lot of butt in this movie but she also opens her heart a lot."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; Alexander suffered a severe back injury while on the set. About the injury, she said, "It was raining, it was dark outside, it was like 5 in the morning—and I went down a metal staircase and slipped and slipped a [[Intervertebral disc|disc]] in my [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic spine]] and chipped 11 of my vertebrae. I knocked my left shoulder out of place and tore my [[Rhomboid muscles|rhomboid]] on my right side... It took me out of filming for a month".&lt;ref name="Alexander2" /&gt;}}
* [[Rene Russo]] as [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]]: {{Cast list break|The wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, mother of Thor and adoptive mother of Loki, based on the mythological deity of the [[Frigg|same name]].&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt; Russo said that her role was expanded and explores Frigga's relationship with Loki, "You know, they cut me [down] in the first film. [[Kenneth Branagh]] sent me a nice note, because he understood, he's an actor. You move on, what are you going to do? But I think they're going to need a good mom in the next film. Loki needs his mom. I have a lot of compassion for [Loki]. But we might have to have a conversation about what he just did".&lt;ref name="Russo2" /&gt;}}

Additionally, [[Alice Krige]] portrays [[Eir]], an Asgardian physician.&lt;ref name="Krige" /&gt; [[Chris O'Dowd]] was cast as Richard,&lt;ref name="ODowd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ODowd2" /&gt; a suitor of Jane Foster's. [[Benicio del Toro]], who plays the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] in Marvel Studios' ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', appears in a mid-credits scene with [[Ophelia Lovibond]], who plays his aide Carina.&lt;ref name="DelToro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DelToro2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovibond" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovibond2" /&gt; [[Jonathan Howard (actor)|Jonathan Howard]] plays Ian Boothby,&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt; Darcy's intern. [[Tony Curran]] plays [[Bor (comics)|Bor]], Odin's father, based on the deity of the [[Borr|same name]].&lt;ref name="Curran1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curran2" /&gt; [[Clive Russell]] plays [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]], based on the deity of the [[Týr|same name]].&lt;ref name="RussellBrake" /&gt; [[Richard Brake]] portrays a captain in the [[Einherjar]].&lt;ref name="RussellBrake" /&gt; [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] makes an uncredited [[cameo appearance]]&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; as Loki masquerading as [[Captain America]], while Thor co-creator [[Stan Lee]] makes a cameo appearance&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; as a patient in a mental ward.

{{quote box|width=33%|quote="In both cases, it's using the conceit of a fantastical, alien world to make fresh what is really a domestic drama. In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', seeing [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] battle with his sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], seeing the relationships between children and their fathers... It's all the stuff we're interested in at a psychological level because we're living it all the time. But it takes place in this otherwise fantastical, foreign realm. I think the same thing is true in ''Thor''. The brilliant thing [[Kenneth Branagh|Ken Branagh]] did in launching it was making it very much a story about two brothers, a story about brothers competing for the love of their father. So it's small, confined and human at the same time it's this blown-out, intergalactic world."|source=—Alan Taylor, director of ''Thor: The Dark World'' and several episodes of ''Game of Thrones''&lt;ref name="IGN3" /&gt;}}
In April 2011 before the release of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] stated that following ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), "Thor will go off into a new adventure."&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[Kenneth Branagh]], director of ''Thor'', responded to his comments, saying, "It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [among] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that ''Thor 2'' will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true".&lt;ref name="movieline" /&gt; Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well ''Thor'' did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, "[[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]] is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [Branagh] to discuss coming back, but right now the focus is on the first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".&lt;ref name="movieline2" /&gt;

In June 2011, [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] set a July 26, 2013, release date for the ''Thor'' sequel with [[Chris Hemsworth]] reprising his role as the title hero. It was also reported that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity.&lt;ref name="Hemsworth" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; Branagh noted, "It was a long time [making the first film] and they were way too quick for me to get straight back into another, [but] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of."&lt;ref name="Branagh" /&gt; The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel.&lt;ref name="deadline" /&gt; In August, [[Brian Kirk]] entered early negotiations to direct the ''Thor'' sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and the [[BBC]], including ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;

In September 2011, [[Tom Hiddleston]] confirmed he would return in the sequel, speculating that in the film, "[Loki will] have to take responsibility for what he's done".&lt;ref name="Hiddleston" /&gt; [[Patty Jenkins]], the director of ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' and the pilot episode of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]'', entered early negotiations with Marvel Studios and Disney to direct the film, after Kirk had passed due to contractual sticking points that arose during negotiations.&lt;ref name="variety2" /&gt; Later in the month, Feige stated the sequel would "take Thor literally to other worlds" and would "primarily be the journey of that character, of he and [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] and how the new dynamic with his father is working out, as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds".&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt; On October 13, 2011, Marvel confirmed that Jenkins would direct the sequel and [[Natalie Portman]] would return to star.&lt;ref name="Portman" /&gt; Disney also moved the release date for the film to November 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote="The main difference I have [from Branagh's approach] is really to do with look and tone. Things look really dirty. The first Thor was quite shiny and it was a very conscious, smart choice. When I came in, I wanted to get more of a sense of the Norse mythology: the Viking quality, the texture and weight of the history. He’s a superhero, but he’s been around for thousands of years. His dad is god!"|source=—Alan Taylor&lt;ref name="TotalFilm" /&gt;}}
In December 2011, Jenkins exited the project, citing "creative differences".&lt;ref name="deadline2" /&gt; She stated, "I have had a great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again."&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter2" /&gt; Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film "out of ''Thor 2'' because I wasn't the right director... I could have made a great ''Thor'' if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don't think I was the right person to make a great ''Thor'' out of the story they wanted to do." Jenkins had intended to create a film based on the premise of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] was "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him."&lt;ref name="JenkinsFilmPremise" /&gt;

Three days later, it was reported that Marvel was looking at [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] and [[Daniel Minahan]] as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of [[John Collee]], [[Robert Rodat]], and [[Roger Avary]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter3" /&gt; At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series ''Game of Thrones'', was chosen to direct the sequel.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter4" /&gt; Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and ''Game of Thrones'' as reasons for his hiring, saying "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm."&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in [[London]] in the summer of 2012.&lt;ref name="deadline3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August.&lt;ref name="slashfilm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="collider" /&gt; Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more [[Viking]]-influenced feel, elaborating "I think the science fiction element to ''Thor''&amp;nbsp;… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the [[Norse mythology]] kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard is going to make it all the more special and that's what Alan [Taylor] wants to bring to it."&lt;ref name="slashfilm" /&gt; Feige said "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [after the events of the movie ''The Avengers''] and has progressed, a lot of ''Thor 2'' is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." Feige also said that while Loki has a part, "there will be a different villain, another big villain".&lt;ref name="collider" /&gt;

In May 2012, [[Mads Mikkelsen]] began talks to play one of the villains in the film and [[Anthony Hopkins]], who played Odin in the first film, committed to returning in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Hopkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikkelsen" /&gt; At the end of the month, Disney moved up the release date for the film a week ahead of the previous date to November 8, 2013.&lt;ref name="variety3" /&gt; By June 2012, much of the first film's supporting cast was confirmed to return, including [[Idris Elba]],&lt;ref name="Elba" /&gt; [[Jaimie Alexander]],&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]&lt;ref name="Stevenson" /&gt; and [[Stellan Skarsgård]].&lt;ref name="Skarsgård" /&gt; Also in June, [[Joshua Dallas]] announced that he would not be reprising the role of [[Fandral]].&lt;ref name="EW2" /&gt; Dallas had initially intended to return,&lt;ref name="Dallas" /&gt; but had to bow out due to his commitment on the television show, ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'',&lt;ref name="EW2" /&gt; and [[Zachary Levi]] was cast in his place.&lt;ref name="Levi2" /&gt; Levi was originally up for the role in the first film but scheduling conflicts with ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' forced him to drop out.&lt;ref name="Levi" /&gt;

In July 2012, Mikkelsen stated he would not be appearing in the sequel due to prior commitments, "That's not happening unfortunately. I had a meeting with [the filmmakers], but it was a bit too late and then ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'' came in...It's just not happening".&lt;ref name="Mikkelsen2" /&gt; At the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], it was announced that the film would be titled ''Thor: The Dark World''.&lt;ref name="IGN2" /&gt; At the end of the month, residents near [[Bourne Wood]] in [[Surrey|Surrey, England]] were notified that a film going by the [[working title]], ''Thursday Mourning'' would be filming in the area.&lt;ref name="ThursdayMourning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBR" /&gt; In August of that year, [[Christopher Eccleston]] entered final negotiations to play Malekith,&lt;ref name="Eccleston" /&gt; and the film was scheduled to shoot in [[Iceland]], where Taylor shot parts of ''Game of Thrones''.&lt;ref name="svarthofdi" /&gt; By August 22, [[Kat Dennings]] was hired to reprise her role as Darcy Lewis and [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] was cast as [[Kurse|Algrim]].&lt;ref name="Akinnuoye-Agbaje1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennings" /&gt; At the end of the month, film crews for ''Thursday Mourning'' began set construction at [[Stonehenge]] near [[Amesbury]], England.&lt;ref name="salisburyjournal"/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Bourne Wood Thor 2 film set crop.jpg|thumb|right|Film set for ''Thor: The Dark World'' at [[Bourne Wood]], [[Surrey]], England.]]
[[Principal photography]] began on September 10, 2012, in Bourne Wood, Surrey, England,&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt; under the working title ''Thursday Mourning''.&lt;ref name="ThursdayMourning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBR" /&gt; A few weeks later, [[Clive Russell]] was cast as [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]], and [[Richard Brake]] was cast as an [[Einherjar]] captain.&lt;ref name="RussellBrake" /&gt; At the end of the month, Jaimie Alexander was injured on the London film set, after she slipped while walking in the rain.&lt;ref name="Yahoo!" /&gt; On October 12, 2012, production moved to Iceland with filming taking place in Dómadalur, [[Skógafoss]], [[Fjaðrárgljúfur]] and [[Skeiðarársandur]]. ''[[Iceland Review]]'' described the shoot as being among the most extensive film projects to have ever taken place in Iceland.&lt;ref name="IcelandReview" /&gt; Three days later, Disney announced that the film would be released in [[3-D film|3D]].&lt;ref name="Collider" /&gt; In late October, filming commenced at the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]], London.&lt;ref name="Greenwich" /&gt; Filming also took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] and [[Longcross Studios]] in Surrey between October and December 2012.&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Longcross" /&gt; Other filming locations included [[Wembley]], [[Borough Market]], [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]] and Stonehenge.&lt;ref name="production notes" /&gt; Alexander [[Twitter|tweeted]] that principal photography wrapped on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref name="Wrap" /&gt; In a 2013 report on film production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $170 million, with a UK tax offset of $17.3 million for ''Thor: The Dark World''.&lt;ref name="FilmLA" /&gt; In 2016 Disney company accounts stated the budget spend was $237.6&amp;nbsp;million on ''Thor: The Dark World'' but $37 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority.&lt;ref name="ActualBudget" /&gt; 

Kramer Morgenthau, who worked with Taylor on ''Game of Thrones'', was brought in as the [[director of photography]]. Morgenthau said, "We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on ''Game of Thrones''. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, while at the same time respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme." ''Thor: The Dark World'' was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the [[Arri Alexa|Arri Alexa Plus]], although he tested with the [[Sony F65]] but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, [[Red Epic]] and [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] cameras were used for [[second unit]] filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses. Morgenthau said, "The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look." Morgenthau also stated that ''Thor: The Dark World'' was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, "It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You do a lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show."&lt;ref name="HDVideoPro" /&gt;

===Post-production===
In July 2013, Dennings told reporters that the film was about to head into reshoots.&lt;ref name="Dennings2" /&gt; In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston and was about to shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor explained that it was all a part of the "Marvel process" saying, "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [involving Loki] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So it was that kind of thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff."&lt;ref name="Collider2" /&gt; Also in August, [[IMAX Corporation]] and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the [[IMAX 3D]] format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.&lt;ref name="Deadline4" /&gt;

Taylor said ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] rewrote several scenes in the film explaining, "Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times. We had a major scene that was not working on the page at all in London, and he basically got airlifted in, like a SWAT team or something. He came down, rewrote the scene, and before he got back to his plane I sort of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems."&lt;ref name="SFX" /&gt; In October 2013, [[Tony Curran]] tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, [[Bor (comics)|Bor]], in a flashback sequence.&lt;ref name="Curran1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curran2" /&gt; In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the "Loki trilogy", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout ''Thor'', ''The Avengers'' and this film.&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2013" /&gt; The film's [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] was directed by [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]], the director of Marvel Studios' ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.&lt;ref name="DelToro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VulturePostCredit" /&gt;

The film's visual effects were completed by seven special effects studios, including [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] and [[Luma Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Cinefex" /&gt; Blur Studio was the lead studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years before the start of the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of [[Svartalfheim]]. The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

Taylor wanted Asgard in this film to have a more natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, capturing six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, "The benefit of that is that you have some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings."&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

For the shot of the levitating truck, which was used in the film to demonstrate the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

The film's climatic battle sequence takes place through the nine worlds by the use of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do was to make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on."&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Thor: The Dark World (soundtrack)}}
In August 2012, [[Patrick Doyle]] said that he had discussions with the director about potentially returning to [[Film score|score]] the film.&lt;ref name="AICN" /&gt; By April 2013, [[Carter Burwell]] had been hired to compose the score,&lt;ref name="Burwell" /&gt; but by the following month he left the film over creative differences.&lt;ref name="Burwell2" /&gt; In June 2013, Marvel hired [[Brian Tyler]], who scored ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', to replace Burwell.&lt;ref name="Tyler" /&gt; Tyler said the previous film had an "attitude and [was] grounded in limitations" whereas the Thor film allowed for "all-out regal themes that could be as epic as I could make them." The composer described ''The Dark World'' as "science fiction meeting classic medieval war", leading to a score that drew from works of both genres such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref name="TylerBMI" /&gt; [[Azam Ali]] is a featured vocalist on the score.&lt;ref name="AzamAli" /&gt; The soundtrack was released digitally on October 28, 2013.&lt;ref name="FilmMusicReporter" /&gt;

==Marketing==
[[File:Tom Hiddleston by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston as Loki at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] to promote the film.]]
In March 2013, Marvel announced the release of a two-issue comic book prelude by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] and artist [[Scot Eaton]] in June 2013.&lt;ref name="CBR2" /&gt; In April 2013, Marvel released the first trailer for ''Thor: The Dark World''. ''[[Forbes]]'' said, "This trailer fits nicely into that larger marketing push for Marvel's brand. It puts all of the recognizable characters from the first film front and center, presents the action as a team event reminiscent of the Avengers, and once again Loki—who was quite popular with audiences—makes an appearance."&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "Evident throughout the trailer is director Alan Taylor's influence; the ''Game of Thrones'' director's hand can be seen in the battle sequences, and Asgard—a bright and shiny kingdom under ''Thor'' director Kenneth Branagh—seems grittier in the sequel."&lt;ref name="LATimes3" /&gt; In July at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Hiddleston introduced footage from the film to audiences in character as Loki.&lt;ref name="LATimes4" /&gt; Also in July, [[Gameloft]] announced that a mobile video game titled, ''Thor the Dark World: The Official Game'', would be released in conjunction with the release of the film in November.&lt;ref name="Game" /&gt;

The theatrical poster for the film was released in early August 2013. Kirsten Acuna of ''[[Business Insider]]'' criticized the poster for its lack of originality, noting its similarities to one of the posters of ''Iron Man 3'', both of which included the female lead clinging to the male lead, with both looking in opposite directions, antagonists prominently displayed in the background and supporting characters featured "on the side".&lt;ref name="BIPoster" /&gt; Additionally, Marvel released a second trailer for the film as part of [[YouTube]]'s Geek Week.&lt;ref name="GeekWeek" /&gt; ''Forbes'' said, "this 150-second trailer is basically just an extended version of last April's 106-second teaser" and that "this trailer fails to showcase what's new this time around... making audiences question if they really don't have much else to offer."&lt;ref name="Forbes2" /&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' said, that the trailer suggests "an ominous, epic scale for the sequel" and that "the collaboration between Thor and Loki promises to be especially interesting."&lt;ref name="LATimes5" /&gt; Later in the month, producer Kevin Feige and cast members Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins presented additional footage at Disney's [[Disney D23|D23]] Expo.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter5" /&gt;

Also in August 2013, Disney announced plans to promote the film with an attraction at [[Disneyland]].&lt;ref name="variety4" /&gt; The attraction called ''Thor: Treasures of Asgard'', located next to the Stark Industries exhibit inside [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]] in [[Tomorrowland]], opened on November 1, 2013 and features displays of Asgardian relics and transports guests to Odin's throne room, where they are greeted by Thor.&lt;ref name="comingsoon" /&gt; The eighth episode of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', titled "[[The Well (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Well]]", takes place in the aftermath of the events of ''Thor: The Dark World''. It first aired on November 19, 2013.&lt;ref name="SHIELD" /&gt; Jaimie Alexander reprised her role as Sif in the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' episode "Yes Men", which aired on March 11, 2014.''&lt;ref name="Sif_SHIELD" /&gt;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The [[Film premiere|world premiere]] of ''Thor: The Dark World'' took place on October 22, 2013, at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London.&lt;ref name="premiere" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premiere2" /&gt; The film was released theatrically in the UK eight days later, on October 30.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt; The film held its North American premiere at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], and was released into U.S. theaters on November 7, 2013.&lt;ref name="US-premiere" /&gt;

===Critical response===
[[File:Alan Taylor 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Taylor at the world premiere of ''Thor: The Dark World'' in London.]]
&lt;!-- WHEN UPDATING THE REVIEW AGGREGATE SCORES, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU UPDATE EVERY FIELD IN THE CITATION PARAMETER, INCLUDING THE ACCESS DATE. --&gt;
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 66% approval rating with an average rating of 6.2/10 based on 259 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "It may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but ''Thor: The Dark World'' still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thor: The Dark World (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thor_the_dark_world/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 54 out of 100 based on 44 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an "A-" average, based on a grading scale ranging from A+ to F.&lt;ref name="Weekend-Report" /&gt;

Ben Child of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, ''Thor: The Dark World'' is far from a franchise killer."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements."&lt;ref name="Chang_Variety"/&gt; Alonso Duralde of ''[[The Wrap]]'' said, "''Thor: The Dark World'' delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor".&lt;ref name="TheWrap"/&gt; Simon Abrams, writing for [[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] said, "There's just enough tension and humor in ''Thor: The Dark World'' to make the film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just."&lt;ref name="Abrams_Ebert" /&gt; Echoing other critics' sentiments, [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' wrote, "Is it wrong that the best relationship in ''Thor: The Dark World'' is between the titular Norse-god superhero and his adoptive brother Loki? To take nothing away from Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, ... it's the complicated love-hate between Thor and the trickster god Loki that you can't turn your eyes from."&lt;ref name=fji /&gt;

Conversely, Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said, "It feels entirely made by committee—the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of [[Yggdrasil]] are a drag, like filler episodes of ''Game of Thrones'' but without the narrative complexity, mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness."&lt;ref name="Felperin_THR" /&gt; Michael Phillips of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described ''Thor: The Dark World'' as having the "same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fairly entertaining fish-out-of-water jokes".&lt;ref name="Phillips_LATimes" /&gt; Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story".&lt;ref name="Catsoulis_NYTimes" /&gt;

===Accolades===
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] placed ''Thor: The Dark World'' on its shortlist of potential nominees for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] but ultimately did not nominate it.&lt;ref name="Oscar_Shortlist" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22663">'''[[Tobacco]]''' usage in '''[[sport]]''' is a well documented and publicised occurrence. [[Tobacco advertising]] has connected itself to sports both for the connotations of health that sports provide, as well as the marketing potential of famous athletes.  Additionally, tobacco has played a role in the sport of [[baseball]] specifically and has affected both the rules affecting players and fan alike.  Agencies such as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] have used sports as platforms for tobacco prevention programs, specifically targeted at younger people.

==Advertising==
[[File:White Borders baseball card reverse.JPG|thumb|Back of an old baseball card]]
For many years, [[Tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] have played a monumental role in advertising within the sports industry.  Major tobacco companies have employed the strategies of athletic endorsements, sponsorships of major athletic events, and creating powerful associations of tobacco and active lifestyles in order to advertise their products. The connection between sports and tobacco can be traced back to the origins of professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faverodental.com/2015/02/smokeless-tobacco-and-baseball/|title=Favero Family Dental {{!}}   Smokeless Tobacco and Baseball|website=www.faverodental.com|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the [[National League|National Baseball League]]'s inception in 1876, [[Baseball card|trading cards]] with player's images emerged within cigarette packages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full#xref-ref-2-1 Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the oldest brands of [[chewing tobacco]], [[W. T. Blackwell and Company Tobacco Factory|Bull Durham]], advertised on outfield fences in [[baseball park]]s in the United States South.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Despite this long-standing history, there have been many recent developments and changes in tobacco's relation to athletics.  Currently, trends have shifted as athletes today are more likely to endorse tobacco prevention efforts as opposed to tobacco products.

===Endorsements===
From the 1920s to 1940s baseball furthered its relation with tobacco.  Every major league team had a cigarette sponsor and baseball's greatest athletes such as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Ted Williams]], all appeared in cigarette advertisements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Lou Gehrig]] endorsed [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]’ [[Camel (cigarette)|Camels]], saying he could smoke as many as he pleased and creating the slogan that Camels “don’t get your wind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

As tensions mounted in the 1950s, with smoking's correlation to [[lung cancer]], the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]] prohibited players from wearing their uniforms in cigarette advertisements.  While baseball cracked down on endorsements, the [[National Football League]] not only permitted players to appear in tobacco advertisements but also signed [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]’ [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] as its major television sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Of these players, one of the most prominent was [[Frank Gifford]].  Gifford played for the [[New York Giants]] in the 1950s and 1960s and later became a famous sportscaster.  In his prime, Gifford endorsed a wide range of products, including The [[American Tobacco Company]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=tobacco-advertising-1960s |title=tobacco advertising 1960s |publisher=The Pop History Dig |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the tobacco industry began to anticipate increased federal regulation and voluntarily adopted the Cigarette Advertising Code, stating it would not “depict as a smoker any person well known as being, or having been, an athlete…[or] any person participating in, or obviously having just participated in, physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation”. Under this code, athletes and celebrities were no longer allowed to give testimonials, but nonetheless the industry blatantly disregarded its own guidelines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In October 2009, Baisha, [[China]]’s largest cigarette company, signed [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]], an Olympic gold medalist hurdler, to endorse its cigarettes in both print advertisements and televised commercials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Sponsorships===
Traditionally, cigarette companies have had a strong relationship with [[Tobacco advertising#NASCAR auto racing|NASCAR events]].  After tobacco companies were forced to pull out of advertising in [[NASCAR]], [[Nicorette]] has entered the NASCAR arena and signed a three-year contract as part of an extension by GlaxoSmithKline, then the owner of Goody's Headache Powders, a long-time NASCAR sponsor.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-01-26-nascar-usat_x.htm |title=Nicorette, NASCAR sign sponsorship deal |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-01-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASCAR's deal with Nicorette was only for one year. Winston stepped down after 33 years as title sponsor of NASCAR's championship series and was replaced by Nextel.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Nicorette sees a great market as NASCAR fans are 28% more likely to smoke than other adults. The firm also reported that they smoke 18% more cigarettes than other adults.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Since Nicorette has signed on as a sponsor, there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of NASCAR employees who smoke.  Nicorette began its quit smoking program in 2004, providing NASCAR members with training sessions and one-on-one counseling.  Additionally, Nicorette has counseled about 250,000 race fans on how to quit smoking since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/10/31 ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarette companies have explored the sponsorship of rodeo since the early 1970s. From 1986 to 2009 the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] was sponsored by the [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]] as well as the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]] (NIRA) since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=Pamela M.|last2=Haber|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Wedl|first3=Stefani|title=Branding the Rodeo: A Case Study of Tobacco Sports Sponsorship|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2008.144097|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=100|issue=1|pages=32–41|doi=10.2105/ajph.2008.144097|pmid=19910357|pmc=2791245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association severed its ties with the tobacco industry in 2009, allowing [[rodeo]] culture to return to its status before tobacco's involvement in 1986.  “Cowboy Ted” Hallisey, a prominent print and broadcast journalist for rodeo events stated “Without [[big tobacco]], rodeos will move into mainstream sports because they will be more comfortable for children and families to attend”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobacco-facts.net/2009/12/professional-rodeo-cowboys-association-ends-tobacco-sponsorship |title=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Ends Tobacco Sponsorship &amp;#124; Tobacco Facts |publisher=Tobacco Facts. |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising strategies===
In the early 1900s the tobacco industry sought to pair smoking with active and healthy lifestyles.  Through its advertisements, the tobacco industry created associations between smoking and recreational and athletic activities like tennis, golf, swimming, football, track and field, skiing, and ice skating.  These activities were often depicted in cigarette advertising as activities demanding a cigarette for enhanced performance and even good health.  American Tobacco's Lucky Strikes ran a successful advertising campaign that urged men and women “To keep a slender figure, reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.”

=== Advertising and Sponsorship in Australia ===
One of the first countries to ever legislate the end of tobacco advertising and sponsorship at sporting events was Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quit Victoria in Australia, stated that the three major sponsors for sport in 1980 were the largest tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/fandi/fandi/c15s5.htm|title=15.5 Sponsorship|website=www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the tobacco industry put a whopping 34 million dollars into [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]]. Although advertisement of tobacco products on television had been banned in 1976, on ground advertising and naming rights to oppositions and events was tactically used by tobacco companies; for example, the [[Benson &amp; Hedges|Benson and Hedges]] logo would appear for approximately 90 minutes in a day’s play of [[test cricket]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/knowledge_base/organised_sport/sport_integrity/tobacco_sponsorship_and_advertising_in_sport|title=Clearinghouse for Sport|last=|first=|date=|website=Tobacco Sponsorship and Advertising in Sport|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco advertising [[Prohibition Act|prohibition act]] 1992, prohibited nearly all of tobaccos advertising and sponsorships in sporting events. However, under section 18 of the Act, there was power to allow an exception to the general ban on tobacco advertising in Australia for sporting events of international significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00440|title=Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, there was an amendment to remove this act and Australian sport became totally tobacco sponsorship and advertisement free in October 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Smokeless tobacco ==
[[Smokeless tobacco]]: [[chewing tobacco]], [[Dipping tobacco|spit tobacco]], [[Snuff (tobacco)|dry snuff]], [[snus]], or ‘tabac à chiquer’ in France, is very common in some sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is little data on the number of athletes that use smokeless tobacco, but a study showed that approximately 45 percent of major league baseball players have been reported to use smokeless tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiamulera|first=Cristiano|last2=Leone|first2=Roberto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Guido|date=2007-12-01|title=Smokeless tobacco use in sports: ‘legal doping’?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x/abstract|journal=Addiction|language=en|volume=102|issue=12|pages=1847–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x|issn=1360-0443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes apparently used smokeless tobacco to enhance their performance because nicotine improved certain aspects of physiology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chagué|first=Frédéric|last2=Guenancia|first2=Charles|last3=Gudjoncik|first3=Aurélie|last4=Moreau|first4=Daniel|last5=Cottin|first5=Yves|last6=Zeller|first6=Marianne|title=Smokeless tobacco, sport and the heart|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1875213614002678|journal=Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases|volume=108|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2014.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been found that smokeless tobacco can cause many harmful health effects such as [[cancer]], mouth and tooth problems, [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/smokeless-tobacco|title=Health Risks of Smokeless Tobacco|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball and tobacco==
Between 1920 until 1940, when baseball was Americas most popular sport, every team had a tobacco sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; It is common perception that many baseball players use tobacco.  According to the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] however this practice is changing and declining.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mychael Urban&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080630&amp;content_id=3037249&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Tobacco use in baseball on the decline &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One source states that a reason chewing tobacco usage increased among baseball players was the misconception that it improved concentration, overall performance and was less harmful than smoking a cigarette. Contrary to this, chewing tobacco does not have an established connection to the performance of baseball players.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/Tobacco/Chewing/Sports.htm |title=Chewing Tobacco - Sports |publisher=Publichealthgreybruce.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more information about [[Health effects of tobacco#Particular forms of tobacco use|the dangers of chewing tobacco]] has come to light it has become stigmatized within baseball itself with players, staff and managers often having to "sneak" off to partake.  These individuals understand that children will easily copy their actions and try to hide them now, as they are negative role models for youth.  Most players have made attempts to quit, but the majority struggle in breaking their addiction.&lt;ref name="costkids1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |title=Smokeless Tobacco |publisher=Costkids.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628060817/http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lenny Dykstra]], the former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] center-fielder, started [[Dipping tobacco|dipping]] at a young age, unaware of how difficult quitting would be. He tells young children, "They call me "Nails" because they say I'm as tough as nails. But I'm not tough enough to beat the spit-tobacco habit. Copy my hustle, copy my determination. But don't copy my spit-tobacco habit."&lt;ref name="costkids1"/&gt;  In addition Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players.  This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered.  In the major leagues tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses for the players, with a ban effective December 5, 2016, in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement that prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco.  (Players who had experience in MLB prior to the day are grandfathered.)  &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Baseball stadiums have stricter tobacco policies for patrons as well though the level of strictness varies per stadium.&lt;ref name="no-smoke1"&gt;[http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/majorleaguebaseballstadiumpoliices.pdf Smoking Policies at Major League Baseball Stadiums], May 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco prevention and sports==
The majority of tobacco smokers start smoking before they graduate high school.  The CDC has identified youth sports as an area where tobacco education and prevention will help limit the number of first time smokers and has begun a Tobacco Free Sports Movement to encourage non smoking practices in athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/youth/sports/index.htm |title=Smoking and Tobacco Use :: Youth Tobacco Prevention :: Tobacco-Free Sports Initiatives :: Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) :: CDC |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CDC has paired with many large organizations to achieve this goal. These include public health agencies such as the [[National Cancer Institute]], and sport regulatory bodies such as [[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] to further the efforts of tobacco elimination in sports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] banned not only tobacco usage, but advertising, sponsorship, promotion and sale of tobacco products in Olympic venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |title=WHO China-Tobacco-free Olympics |publisher=Wpro.who.int |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713060044/http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Olympics with a tobacco company as a sponsor were in 1984, and control has gotten stricter since then (as can be seen from the Beijing regulations).&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  On a smaller scale there are regional efforts to create tobacco free sports initiatives such as the Tobacco-Free Athletes of Maine.  This organization seeks to have coaches educate their young athletes about the effects of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofreemaine.org/channels/educators/tobacco_free_athletes.php |title=Tobacco-Free Athletes - Tobacco Prevention for Youth in Sports &amp; Community Programs - Partnership For A Tobacco-Free Maine |publisher=Tobaccofreemaine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many athletes have become spokespersons for [[Tobacco control movement|anti-tobacco]] and tobacco prevention efforts.  Early in the 20th century Hall of Fame baseball player [[Honus Wagner]] would not allow a cigarette company to use his picture on a tobacco trading card.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;  Since then famous athletes like skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and baseball player [[Sammy Sosa]] have supported tobacco prevention.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"/&gt;  Events such as the [[American Cancer Society]]'s [[Great American Smokeout]] also make use of athletes to support their anti-tobacco efforts.  In 2000, the American Cancer Society had [[Alonzo Mourning]] of the [[Miami Heat]] (with other athletes) speak to children about the dangers of smoking.&lt;ref name="cancer1"&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025103726/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] celebrated their gold medal victory on the ice with both cigars and tobacco.  As the Vancouver Olympics were a tobacco free event, the International Olympic Committee decided to look into the celebration since it was a breach of anti-tobacco rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/story/12978672/ioc-to-look-into-drinking-celebrations-on-ice-by-women-hockey-team |title=IOC to look into drinking celebrations on ice by women's hockey team - Olympics |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Toopy and Binoo''''' is a 2005 [[Canada|Canadian]] children's animation television series broadcast by [[Treehouse TV]], [[Télé Québec]] and [[Radio Canada]] produced by Spectra Animation which has since become Echo Media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echomedia.tv/index.php?option=com_vidcat&amp;task=moreinfo&amp;video=302&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; It was based upon the children's book '''''Toupie et Binou'''''. Another television series was produced as a live action spin-off show titled '''''Toopy and Binoo Vroom Vroom Zoom'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfe |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.awn.com/news/treehouse-launches-new-toopy-and-binoo-series |title=Treehouse Launches New 'Toopy And Binoo' Series |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2014-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasons 1 and 2 have been licensed to broadcasters around the world, airing in over 175 countries and dubbed into 30 languages. Over 1 million DVDs of the show have been sold worldwide &amp; the YouTube videos have reached nearly 200 million views.

==Creation==
''Toupie et Binou'' was the original title of the children books collection written by Dominique Jolin; the books also appeared in English translation as ''Washington and Deecee''. Binoo then appeared in a small series of his own. Echo Media then brought them to television, both in English and French version, dubbing their English names to "Toopy and Binoo."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toupieetbinou.com/?page=home&amp;c_lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transitus''' is the name given to a year in a number of [[independent schools]] in [[Scotland]]. As the name would suggest, this year is offered as a bridge between '[[primary school|primary]]' and '[[secondary school|secondary]]' education.

Transitus replaces the final year of primary education used in [[state schools]], often referred to as Primary 7 (P7). In [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory schools]], it may also share the 'P7' designation, although in this case it is instead the abbreviation of 'Prep'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglasgowacademy.org.uk/ntga/prep/p57.html Prep School - Prep 5-7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121145027/http://www.theglasgowacademy.org.uk/ntga/prep/p57.html |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balkans 6th century.svg|thumb|right|360px|The northern Balkans, including the ''Via Militaris'', in [[Late Antiquity]].]]
'''Via Militaris''' or '''Via Diagonalis''' was an ancient [[Roman road]], starting from [[Singidunum]] (today the [[Serbia]]n capital [[Belgrade]]), passing by Danube coast to [[Viminacium]] (mod. [[Požarevac]]), through Naissus (mod. [[Niš]]), Serdica (mod. [[Sofia]]), [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] (mod. [[Plovdiv]]), Adrianopolis (mod. [[Edirne]] in [[Turkish Thrace]]), and reaching [[Constantinople]] (mod. [[Istanbul]]). This road was connected with [[Via Egnatia]] by other roads - the road along river Axios (or [[Vardar]]), the [[Serdica]]–[[Thessalonica]] road along river Strymon (or [[Struma (river)|Struma]]), and the road Philippopolis–[[Philippi]].

It was built in the 1st century AD. The length from Singidunum to Constantinople was 924 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC |page=12 |title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first European conquests of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] ''orta kol'' (lit. ''middle arm'') was following the Via Militaris. &lt;ref&gt;Kılıç, Ayşegül; ''Bir Osmanlı Akın Beyi Gazi Evrenos Bey'' İthaki Yay. İstanbul 2014, {{ISBN|978-605-375-345-2}} p. 16. (in Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, while work was done on the [[Pan-European Corridor X]] in [[Serbia]], well-preserved remains of the road were excavated in [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia]]. The eight-metre wide road was constructed from large blocks of stone and had two lanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=13100D04HFJE{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Writing systems worldwide}}
{{writing systems sidebar}}
A '''writing system''' is any conventional method of visually representing verbal [[communication]].  While both [[writing]] and [[spoken language|speech]] are useful in conveying [[message]]s, writing differs in also being a reliable form of [[information]] storage and [[information transfer|transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/definition.htm | title=Definitions of writing systems | publisher=www.omniglot.com | work=Omniglot: The Online Encyclopedia of Writing Systems and Languages | accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of [[code|encoding and decoding]] writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and [[reading (process)|readers]] of the meaning behind the sets of [[character (symbol)|characters]] that make up a script.  Writing is usually recorded onto a [[Storage medium#Recording medium|durable medium]], such as paper or [[data storage device|electronic storage]], although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer [[display device|display]], on a blackboard, in sand, or by [[skywriting]].

The general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as [[alphabet]]s, [[syllabary|syllabaries]], or [[logogram|logographies]]. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbol]]s or [[grapheme]]s) of [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent [[phoneme|speech sounds]]. In a syllabary, each symbol correlates to a [[syllable]] or [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]. In a logography, each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or other semantic units. Other categories include [[abjad]]s, which differ from alphabets in that vowels are not indicated, and [[abugida]]s or alphasyllabaries, with each character representing a consonant–vowel pairing. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language{{Citation needed|reason=Even the basic Roman alphabet has more symbols — after all “A” and “a” are clearly different symbols, though maybe not letters.|date=February 2018}}, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100{{Citation needed|reason=So how come 710 Canadian syllabics are encoded in Unicode?|date=February 2018}}, and logographies can have several hundreds of symbols.{{Citation needed|reason=To read a Chinese newspaper or book you need to know several thousand Chinese characters.|date=February 2018}}

Most systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like [[word]]s or [[acronym]]s (generally [[lexeme]]s), giving rise to many more possibilities ([[permutation]]s) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the [[concatenation|stringing together]] of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full expression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished purely in the mind as an internal process, or [[reading aloud|expressed orally]].  A special set of symbols known as [[punctuation]] is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing systems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's meaning that are communicated verbally by cues in [[rhythm|timing]], [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[pitch accent|accent]], [[inflection]] or [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].  A writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded messages that follows the spoken version's rules like its [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] so that the [[receiver (information theory)|reader]] will have the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the intended message accurately preserved.

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], which used [[pictogram]]s, [[ideogram]]s and other [[mnemonic]] symbols. Proto-writing lacked the ability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic Era]] of the late [[4th millennium BC]], enabled the accurate durable recording of [[human history]] in a manner that was not prone to the same [[telephone (game)|types of error]] to which [[oral tradition|oral history]] is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided [[postal system|a reliable form]] of long distance communication. With the advent of [[publishing]], it provided the [[media (communication)|medium]] for an early form of [[mass communication]].

The creation of a new alphabetic writing system for a language with an existing logographic writing system is called alphabetization, as when the [[People's Republic of China]] studied the prospect of alphabetizing the [[Chinese language]]s with [[Latin script]], [[Cyrillic script]], [[Arabic script]], and even numbers,&lt;ref name="isbn_9780060826581"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hessler |first=Peter |year=2006 |title=Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Present |publisher=Harper Collins |chapter=Artifact K: The Lost Alphabets |pages=401–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvmZjIDiOwcC |isbn=9780060826581 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most common instance of it, converting to Latin script, is usually called [[romanization]].

== General properties ==
[[File:Kuozhai.jpg|thumb|Chinese characters (漢字) are morpho-syllabic. Each one represents a syllable with a distinct meaning, but some characters may have multiple meanings or pronunciations]]

Writing systems are distinguished from other possible [[symbolic communication]] systems in that a writing system is always associated with at least one [[spoken language]]. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as contour lines, are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols for male and female, are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[ampersand]], are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.

Every human community possesses language, which many regard as an innate and defining condition of humanity. However, the development of writing systems, and the process by which they have supplanted traditional [[orality|oral]] systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven and slow. Once established, writing systems generally change more slowly than their spoken counterparts. Thus they often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. One of the great benefits of writing systems is that they can preserve a permanent record of information expressed in a language.

All writing systems require:

* at least one set of defined base elements or [[symbol]]s, individually termed ''signs'' and collectively called a ''script'';&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 2003. ''Writing systems. An introduction''. Cambridge University Press. pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* at least one set of rules and conventions ([[orthography]]) understood and shared by a community, which assigns [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] to the base elements ([[grapheme]]s), their ordering and relations to one another;
* at least one language (generally [[spoken language|spoken]]) whose constructions are represented and can be recalled by the interpretation of these elements and rules;
* some physical means of distinctly representing the symbols by application to a permanent or semi-permanent [[medium (communication)|medium]], so they may be interpreted (usually visually, but tactile systems have also been devised).

== Basic terminology ==
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|''A Specimen'' of typefaces and styles, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

In the examination of individual scripts, the study of writing systems has developed along partially independent lines. Thus, the terminology employed differs somewhat from field to field.

=== Text, writing, reading and orthography ===
The generic term ''text''&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal (2008), [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405152966.html ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'', 6th Edition], p.481, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an instance of written or spoken material with the latter having been transcribed in some way. The act of composing and recording a text may be referred to as ''[[writing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.1294, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; and the act of viewing and interpreting the text as ''[[Reading (activity)|reading]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.979, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orthography]]'' refers to the method and rules of observed writing structure (literal meaning, "correct writing"), and particularly for [[alphabet]]ic systems, includes the concept of ''[[spelling]]''.

=== Grapheme and phoneme ===
{{main|grapheme|phoneme}}
A ''[[grapheme]]'' is a specific base unit of a writing system. Graphemes are the ''minimally significant'' elements which taken together comprise the set of "building blocks" out of which texts made up of one or more writing systems may be constructed, along with rules of correspondence and use. The concept is similar to that of the [[phoneme]] used in the study of spoken languages. For example, in the [[Latin]]-based writing system of standard contemporary English, examples of graphemes include the [[majuscule]] and [[Lower case|minuscule]] forms of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet (corresponding to various phonemes), marks of [[punctuation]] (mostly non-phonemic), and a few other symbols such as those for [[Arabic numeral|numerals]] (logograms for numbers).

An individual grapheme may be represented in a wide variety of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the "same" grapheme. These individual variations are known as ''[[allograph]]s'' of a grapheme (compare with the term [[allophone]] used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter ''a'' has different allographs when written as a [[cursive]], [[capital letters|block]], or [[typeface|typed]] letter. The choice of a particular allograph may be influenced by the medium used, the [[Writing implement|writing instrument]], the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's [[handwriting]].

=== Glyph, sign and character ===
The terms ''[[glyph]]'', ''[[sign (linguistics)|sign]]'' and ''character'' are sometimes used to refer to a grapheme. Common usage varies from discipline to discipline; compare [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform sign]], [[Maya script|Maya glyph]], [[Chinese character]]. The glyphs of most writing systems are made up of lines (or strokes) and are therefore called [[Linear writing|linear]], but there are glyphs in [[Non-linear writing|non-linear writing systems]] made up of other types of marks, such as Cuneiform and [[Braille]].

=== Complete and partial writing systems ===
Writing systems may be regarded as ''complete'' according to the extent to which they are able to represent all that may be expressed in the spoken language, while a ''partial'' writing system is limited in what it can convey.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer (2012), [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=EYcJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 ''The Anthropology of Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology'', p.194], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems, languages and conceptual systems ===
Writing systems can be independent from languages, one can have multiple writing systems for a language, e.g., [[Hindi–Urdu controversy|Hindi and Urdu]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/27680/is-it-plausible-to-have-two-written-forms-of-one-spoken-language-that-are-so-dif StackExchange: Is it plausible to have two written forms of one spoken language that are so different as to be indecipherable?]&lt;/ref&gt; and one can also have one writing system for multiple languages, e.g., the [[Arabic script]]. Chinese characters were also borrowed by variant countries as their early writing systems, e.g., the [[Vietnamese language#Writing systems|early writing systems]] of [[Vietnamese language]] until the beginning of the 20th century.

To represent a [[conceptual system]], one uses one or more languages, e.g., mathematics is a conceptual system&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=1_IkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 Metaphor and Analogy in the Sciences, p.126], Springer Science &amp; Business Media (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and one may use [[first-order logic]] and a [[natural language]] together in representation.

== History ==
{{main article|History of writing}}
[[File:Sanskrit Brhama English alphabets.jpg|thumb|Table of scripts in the introduction to ''[[Sanskrit]]-English Dictionary'' by [[Monier Monier-Williams]]]]

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], systems of [[ideogram|ideographic]] and/or early [[mnemonic]] symbols. The best known examples are:

* [[Jiahu symbols]], carved on [[tortoise]] [[Animal shell|shells]] in [[Jiahu]], c. 6600 BC
* [[Vinča symbols]] ([[Tărtăria tablets]]), {{circa}}5300 BC
* Early [[Indus script]], c. 3500 BC.
* [[Nsibidi]] script, c. before 500 AD

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]]{{dubious|Bronze Age is what follows after Neolithic, by definition. Or is there some deeper meaning hidden here?|date=May 2015}} of the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400 to 3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]].

A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. [[Chinese script]] are probably an independent invention, because there is no evidence of contact between China and the literate civilizations of the Near East,&lt;ref&gt;David N. Keightley, Noel Barnard. The Origins of Chinese civilization. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC&amp;pg=PA415 Page 415-416]&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the distinct differences between the Mesopotamian and Chinese approaches to [[logogram|logography]] and phonetic representation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_and_Eroticism_in_Mesopotamian_Litera.html?id=Fn67_Rid51EC Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature]. By Dr Gwendolyn Leick. Pg 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.

A [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|hieroglyphic writing system]] used by pre-colonial [[Mi'kmaq]], that was observed by missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, is thought to have developed independently. Although, there is some debate over whether or not this was a fully formed system or just a series of mnemonic pictographs.

It is thought that the first [[consonantal alphabet]]ic writing appeared before 2000 BC, as a representation of language developed by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] tribes in the Sinai-peninsula (see [[History of the alphabet]]). Most other alphabets in the world today either descended from this one innovation, many via the [[Phoenician alphabet]], or were directly inspired by its design.

The first true alphabet is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]] which consistently represents [[vowel]]s since 800 BC.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True alphabet"&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]], a direct descendant, is by far the most common writing system in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several approaches have been taken to classify writing systems, the most common and basic one is a broad division into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'', and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely. The term ''complex system'' is sometimes used to describe those where the admixture makes classification problematic. Modern linguists regard such approaches, including Diringer's&lt;ref&gt;David Diringer (1962): ''Writing''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* pictographic script
* ideographic script
* analytic transitional script
* [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic script]]
* alphabetic script
as too simplistic, often considering the categories to be incomparable.
Hill&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hill (1967): ''The typology of Writing systems''. In: William A. Austin (ed.), Papers in Linguistics in Honor of Leon Dostert. The Hague, 92–99.&lt;/ref&gt; split ''writing'' into three major categories of linguistic analysis, one of which covers discourses and is not usually considered writing proper:
* ''discourse system''
** ''iconic discourse system'', e.g. [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]]
** ''conventional discourse system'', e.g. [[Quipu]]
* ''morphemic writing system'', e.g. [[Hieroglyph|Egyptian]], [[Cuneiform|Sumerian]], [[Maya writing|Maya]], [[Chinese character|Chinese]]
* ''phonemic writing system''
** ''partial phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Demotic script|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]]
** ''poly-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Linear B]], [[Kana]], [[Cherokee script|Cherokee]]
** ''mono-phonemic writing system''
*** ''phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Ancient Greek]], [[English writing system|Old English]]
*** ''morpho-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[German writing system|German]], [[English writing system|Modern English]]
Sampson draws a distinction between ''[[semasiography]]'' and ''glottography''
* semasiography, relating visible marks to meaning directly without reference to any specific spoken language
* glottography, using visible marks to represent forms of a spoken language
** logography, representing a spoken language by assigning distinctive visible marks to linguistic elements of André Martinet's "first articulation" (Martinet 1949), i.e. morphemes or words
** phonography, achieving the same goal by assigning marks to elements of the "second articulation", e.g. phonemes, syllables

* ''logographic'', e.g. [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Hieroglyph|Ancient Egyptian]]
* ''phonographic''
** ''syllabically linear''
*** ''syllabically coded'', e.g. [[Kana]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]

=== Logographic systems ===
{{main article|Logogram}}
[[File:日-oracle.svg|thumb|Early [[Chinese character]] for [[sun]] (''ri''), 1200 B.C]]
[[File:Character Ri4 Trad.svg|thumb|Modern Chinese character (''ri'') [[Radical 72|meaning "day" or "Sun"]]]]

A ''logogram'' is a single written character which represents a complete grammatical word. Most traditional [[Chinese character]]s are classified as logograms.

As each character represents a single word (or, more precisely, a [[morpheme]]), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, the ability to communicate across languages only works for the closely related [[varieties of Chinese]], as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses [[kanji|Chinese logograms]] extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic [[Chinese grammar]], though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.

While most languages do not use wholly logographic writing systems, many languages use some logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]: everyone who uses those symbols understands what ''1'' means whether they call it ''one'', ''eins'', ''uno'', ''yi'', ''ichi'', ''ehad'', ''ena'', or ''jedan''. Other western logograms include the [[ampersand]] ''&amp;'', used for ''and'', the [[at sign]] ''@'', used in many contexts for ''at'', the [[percent sign]] ''%'' and the many signs representing units of currency ([[dollar sign|$]], [[Cent (currency)#Symbol|¢]], [[Euro sign|€]], [[Pound sign|£]], [[¥]] and so on.)

Logograms are sometimes called [[ideogram]]s, a word that refers to symbols which graphically represent abstract ideas, but linguists avoid this use, as Chinese characters are often [[semantics|semantic]]–[[phonetic]] compounds, symbols which include an element that represents the meaning and a [[phonetic complement]] element that represents the pronunciation. Some nonlinguists distinguish between [[lexigraphy]] and ideography, where symbols in lexigraphies represent words and symbols in ideographies represent words or morphemes.

The most important (and, to a degree, the only surviving) modern logographic writing system is the Chinese one, whose characters have been used with varying degrees of modification in [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and other [[east Asian languages]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian hieroglyphs and the Mayan writing system are also systems with certain logographic features, although they have marked phonetic features as well and are no longer in current use. Vietnamese speakers switched to the [[Vietnamese alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in the 20th century and the [[Hanja|use of Chinese characters in Korean]] is increasingly rare. The [[Japanese writing system]] includes several distinct forms of writing including logography.

=== Syllabic systems: syllabary ===
{{main article|Syllabary}}
[[File:Cherokee stop sign.png|thumb|[[Bilingual]] stop sign in English and the [[Cherokee syllabary]], [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]]]

''Another type of writing system with systematic syllabic linear symbols, the [[abugida]]s, is discussed below as well.

As logographic writing systems use a single symbol for an entire word, a ''syllabary'' is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s, which make up [[word]]s. A symbol in a syllabary typically represents a [[consonant]] sound followed by a [[vowel]] sound, or just a vowel alone.

In a "true syllabary", there is no systematic graphic similarity between phonetically related characters (though some do have graphic similarity for the vowels). That is, the characters for {{IPA|/ke/}}, {{IPA|/ka/}} and {{IPA|/ko/}} have no similarity to indicate their common "k" sound (voiceless velar plosive). More recent creations such as the [[Cree syllabary]] embody a system of varying signs, which can best be seen when arranging the syllabogram set in an [[Syllable onset|onset]]–[[Syllable coda|coda]] or onset–[[Syllable rime|rime]] table.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. The [[English language]], on the other hand, allows complex syllable structures, with a relatively large inventory of [[vowel]]s and complex [[consonant cluster]]s, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. To write English using a syllabary, every possible syllable in English would have to have a separate symbol, and whereas the number of possible syllables in Japanese is around 100, in English there are approximately 15,000 to 16,000.

However, syllabaries with much larger inventories do exist. The [[Yi script]], for example, contains 756 different symbols (or 1,164, if symbols with a particular tone diacritic are counted as separate syllables, as in [[Unicode]]). The [[Chinese script]], when used to write [[Middle Chinese]] and the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], also represents syllables, and includes separate glyphs for nearly all of the many thousands of syllables in [[Middle Chinese]]; however, because it primarily represents [[morpheme]]s and includes different characters to represent homophonous morphemes with different meanings, it is normally considered a logographic script rather than a syllabary.

Other languages that use true syllabaries include [[Mycenae]]an [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[Linear B]]) and [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] such as [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]. Several languages of the [[Ancient Near East]] used forms of [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]], which is a syllabary with some non-syllabic elements.

=== Segmental systems: Alphabets ===
{{main article|Alphabet}}

An ''alphabet'' is a small set of ''letters'' (basic written symbols), each of which roughly represents or represented historically a [[phoneme]] of a spoken [[language]]. The word ''alphabet'' is derived from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] and [[beta (letter)|beta]], the first two symbols of the [[Greek alphabet]].

The first type of alphabet that was developed was the [[abjad]]. An abjad is an alphabetic writing system where there is one symbol per consonant. Abjads differ from other alphabets in that they have characters only for [[consonant]]al sounds. Vowels are not usually marked in abjads.

All known abjads (except maybe [[Tifinagh]]) belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Northern Linear Abjad]]. The reason for this is that [[Semitic languages]] and the related [[Berber languages]] have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphemic structure]] which makes the denotation of [[vowel]]s redundant in most cases.

Some abjads, like Arabic and Hebrew, have markings for vowels as well. However, they use them only in special contexts, such as for teaching. Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full alphabets. Of these, the most famous example is the derivation of the [[Greek alphabet]] from the Phoenician abjad. This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language.

The term ''abjad'' takes its name from the old order of the [[Arabic alphabet]]'s [[consonant]]s 'alif, bā', jīm, dāl, though the word may have earlier roots in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] or [[Ugaritic]]. "Abjad" is still the word for alphabet in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Malay and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

[[File:Bible printed with Balinese script.jpg|thumb|A Bible printed with [[Balinese script]]]]
An [[abugida]] is an alphabetic writing system whose basic signs denote consonants with an [[inherent vowel]] and where consistent modifications of the basic sign indicate other following vowels than the inherent one.

Thus, in an abugida there may or may not be a sign for "k" with no vowel, but also one for "ka" (if "a" is the inherent vowel), and "ke" is written by modifying the "ka" sign in a way that is consistent with how one would modify "la" to get "le". In many abugidas the modification is the addition of a vowel sign, but other possibilities are imaginable (and used), such as rotation of the basic sign, addition of [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] and so on.

The contrast with "true [[syllabary|syllabaries]]" is that the latter have one distinct symbol per possible syllable, and the signs for each syllable have no systematic graphic similarity. The graphic similarity of most abugidas comes from the fact that they are derived from abjads, and the consonants make up the symbols with the inherent vowel and the new vowel symbols are markings added on to the base symbol.

In the [[Ge'ez script]], for which the linguistic term ''abugida'' was named, the vowel modifications do not always appear systematic, although they originally were more so. [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] can be considered abugidas, although they are rarely thought of in those terms. The largest single group of abugidas is the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, however, which includes nearly all the scripts used in [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The name ''abugida'' is derived from the first four characters of an order of the Ge'ez script used in some contexts. It was borrowed from Ethiopian languages as a linguistic term by [[Peter T. Daniels]].

=== Featural systems ===
{{main article|Featural writing system}}
A ''featural'' script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] or its [[place of articulation]]. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is [[Korean language|Korean]] [[hangul]]. In hangul, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.

Many scholars, e.g. [[John DeFrancis]], reject this class or at least labeling hangul as such.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a "sophisticated [[grammatogeny]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These include [[stenography|stenographies]] and [[constructed script]]s of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as [[Tengwar]]), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character "features".&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |first=Beatrice |last=Primus |title=A featural analysis of the Modern Roman Alphabet |journal=Written Language and Literacy |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=235–274 |url=http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IDSLI/dozentenseiten/artikel_primus/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambiguous systems ===

Most writing systems are not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, includes numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &amp;, and the [[written language]] often does not match well with the spoken one. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along the lines of a syllabary, such as Chinese ("logo-syllabic"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian ("logo-consonantal").

Some scripts, however, are truly ambiguous. The [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabaries]] of ancient Spain were syllabic for [[plosive consonant|plosives]] such as ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', but alphabetic for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an alphabetic orthography. [[Old Persian cuneiform]] was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely alphabetic, and for the other three, there was one letter for /C''u''/ and another for both /C''a''/ and /C''i''/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /C''a''/ letter was used for a bare consonant.

The [[zhuyin]] phonetic glossing script for Chinese divides syllables in two or three, but into [[syllable onset|onset]], [[Syllable medial|medial]], and [[syllable rime|rime]] rather than consonant and vowel. [[Pahawh Hmong]] is similar, but can be considered to divide syllables into either onset-rime or consonant-vowel (all consonant clusters and diphthongs are written with single letters); as the latter, it is equivalent to an abugida but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Other scripts are intermediate between the categories of alphabet, abjad and abugida, so there may be disagreement on how they should be classified.

== Graphic classification ==

Perhaps the primary graphic distinction made in classifications is that of ''linearity''. Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Chinese character]]s. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in [[bas-relief]]. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian script]] of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its [[cuneiform]] descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as [[braille]], are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.

[[Cuneiform]] was probably the earliest non-linear writing. Its glyphs were formed by pressing the end of a reed stylus into moist clay, not by tracing lines in the clay with the stylus as had been done previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cuneiform.neocities.org/CWT/CWT.html|title=Cuneiform Writing Techniques|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|website=cuneiform.neocities.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|date=2014|title=The Cuneiform Stylus|url=https://www.academia.edu/12047738/The_Cuneiform_Stylus|journal=Mesopotamia|language=en|volume=XLIX|pages=53-90|via=https://osf.io/dfng4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a radical transformation of the appearance of the script.

Braille is a non-linear adaptation of the Latin alphabet that completely abandoned the Latin forms. The letters are composed of raised bumps on the writing [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]], which can be leather ([[Louis Braille]]'s original material), stiff paper, plastic or metal.

There are also transient non-linear adaptations of the Latin alphabet, including [[Morse code]], the [[manual alphabet]]s of various [[sign language]]s, and semaphore, in which [[Flag semaphore|flags]] or [[Semaphore line|bars]] are positioned at prescribed angles. However, if "writing" is defined as a potentially permanent means of recording information, then these systems do not qualify as writing at all, since the symbols disappear as soon as they are used. (Instead, these transient systems serve as [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signals]].)

== Directionality ==
[[File:Writing directions of the world.svg|thumb|Overview of the writing directions used in the world]]
{{see also|Right-to-left|Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|Bi-directional text|Mirror writing}}

Scripts are also graphically characterized by the direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs turned to face the beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Threatte, Leslie |title=The grammar of Attic inscriptions |publisher=W. de Gruyter |year=1980 |pages=54–55 |isbn=3-11-007344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written [[boustrophedon]]ically: starting in one (horizontal) direction, then turning at the end of the line and reversing direction.

The [[Greek alphabet]] and its successors settled on a left-to-right pattern, from the top to the bottom of the page. Other scripts, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate [[Chinese characters]] have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to [[Western culture|Western]] influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the [[Latin script]], and technical limitations in popular [[electronic document]] formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counter-clockwise]] to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], such as [[Hanunó'o script|Hanunó'o]], are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right; however, [[Kulitan script|Kulitan]], another Philippine script, is written top to bottom and right to left. [[Ogham]] is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.

== On computers ==

In computers and telecommunication systems, writing systems are generally not codified as such,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by "[[character (computing)|characters]]" that typically manifest in [[character encoding|encoded]] form. There are many [[:Category:Character encoding|character encoding standards and related technologies]], such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] (a character repertoire and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), [[CJK characters|CJK]] (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and [[bi-directional text]]. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 10646 "[[Universal Character Set]]", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, ''The Unicode Standard''. Both are generally encompassed by the term [[Unicode]]. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a unique identification number, known as its ''code point''. Computer [[operating system]]s use code points to look up characters in the [[Typeface|font]] file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.

A [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] is the device most commonly used for writing via computer. Each key is associated with a standard code which the keyboard sends to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with [[modifier key]]s such as [[Control key|Ctrl]], [[Alt key|Alt]], [[Shift key|Shift]] and [[AltGr key|AltGr]],&lt;!-- this is not meant to be an exhaustive list! --&gt; various character codes are generated and sent to the [[CPU]]. The [[operating system]] intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the [[keyboard layout]] and [[Input method editor|input method]], and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running [[application software]], which in turn looks up the appropriate [[glyph]] in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the [[Computer display|screen]].

'''Xate''' (pronounce: shatay&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17343037 Global flower trade threatens rare palm], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;) are the leaves from 3 ''[[Chamaedorea]]'' species of palm tree (''[[Chamaedorea ernesti-augusti]]'', ''[[Chamaedorea elegans]]'', and ''[[Chamaedorea oblongata]]'').

The fronds are popular in the floral industry for flower arrangements, [[Palm Sunday]] services and funeral decoration, as they can last up to 40 days after being cut. Estimates calculated an amount of 400 million stems exported from Guatemala and Belize to North America and Europe per year.

As there are virtually no xate-plantation to this day (March 2012), all xate on the international market is harvested by '''xateros''' from palms in the forests of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]]. ''Xateros'' rely on the harvest of palm leaves. Unfortunately this has affected the population of palms in the wild. 

''Xate'', and particularly ''[[Chamaedorea ernesti-augusti]]'' has been overcollected in the forests of [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]].  Now ''xateros'' from [[Guatemala]] cross the [[Belize]]an border to cut the leaf.

In 2004 Axel Köhler and [[Tim Trench (anthropologist)|Tim Trench]] produced a documentary film called '''''Xateros''''' about these commercial palm leaf collectors in [[Chiapas]]' [[Lacandon Jungle]] for the ''Proyecto Videoastas Indigenas de la Frontera Sur''.[http://sureste.ciesas.edu.mx/Proyectos/PVIFS/ingles/pvifs1.html]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 0

'''''Young Sherlock Holmes: Black Ice''''' is the third novel in the [[Young Sherlock Holmes (books)|Young Sherlock Holmes series]] that depicts [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] as a teenager in the 1860s. It was written by [[Andy Lane|Andrew Lane]] and released in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2011&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0330512005 Amazon Page for Young Sherlock Holmes: Black Ice]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Macmillan Books]]. It follows on from ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes: Red Leech]]'' and is followed by ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes: Fire Storm]]''

==Plot summary==
Mycroft Holmes invites Sherlock and his tutor, Amyus Crowe, to London for a visit. When they arrive at the Diogenes Club they find Mycroft holding a dagger over a dead body. The police arrive soon and arrest Mycroft, leaving Sherlock and Amyus to prove his innocence. They find some clues at the murder scene; a business card, a small bottle with a clear liquid in it, and a small wooden case. They determine that the business card is freshly printed and look for printers around London who might have created it.

The pair split up and Sherlock locates the right Gooder which leads him to a bouncer in a local tavern. Sherlock tails the bouncer, but the bouncer manages to turn the tables on him, and chases Sherlock into the sewers inhabited by London's abandoned and feral children. Sherlock has to run for his life to escape them, and ends up at the [[London Necropolis Railway]].

Sherlock and Amyus meet up again and have dangerous encounter with a [[falcon]] in an animal museum. From there it becomes evident that events occurring in Russia may be linked to Mycroft frame-up. Due to the mysterious disappearance of Mycroft's agent Robert Wormersley who was located in Moscow, Sherlock and Mycroft accompanied by Rufus Stone will have to go to Moscow. Sherlock, as  a part of their disguise, joins a travelling theatre troupe to Russia to uncover the truth.

In Russia they find Wormesley's house in a state of chaos, it is then apparent that someone was searching for several objects. On their way back to the hotel, Sherlock is framed up for pick-pocketing. Sherlock then runs as the police is on his trail, he soon finds himself in a dead end, and the only way to escape was via a manhole.

While he descends, he can hear the people who set him state that the manhole led to a tributary  
of the Moscow river, the Neglinnaya, Sherlock then goes downstream in order to make it to the river. He is chased by the people who set him up. While navigating through the river he meets a pack of dogs that have adapted to survive in dark tunnels. Sherlock sees that they have ears larger than ordinary and speculates that their sense of hearing is greater than those of the normal dogs, Knowing this Sherlock does not make a noise, but due to the twitching of his finger the dogs get ready to pounce on him, at this moment Sherlock's pursuer has his hand over Sherlock's neck, his hand is bitten by a dog and he loosens his grip allowing Sherlock to escape.

Sherlock soon finds his way in the Moscow river and climbs on its banks, only to see Mycroft being arrested by Russia's secret police-the Third Section. He is then met by Robert Wormesley who was watching Mycroft's arrest and tells him that they both will have to plan the next move in order to save Mycroft's life.

Both of them chat in a cafe, where Sherlock deduced that Mycroft was being taken to be framed for the murder of Count Shuvalov's murder and that Wormesley is against him. Rufus Stone sets fire to the cafe to help Sherlock escape from Wormesley. Sherlock and Stone reach the building where Mycroft and Count Shuvalov are located. Once there, they lure away the falcon trained to kill Shuvalov.

==Characters==

===Sherlock Holmes===

Sherlock Holmes has grown since the events of his previous two adventures, and he is not afraid to do things on his own initiative. When he realizes that Amyus will not be accompanying him to Russia he is initially disappointed and worried how he will perform without his mentor, but soon grows in confidence. His relationship with Rufus Stone becomes more complex when Mycroft reveals a secret about Stone. His admiration for his older brother Mycroft continues to increase.

===Mycroft Holmes===

Sherlock's older brother, who works in espionage, invites Sherlock and Amyus to visit him in London, and is quickly framed for murder.

'''Youth culture''' is the way [[adolescence|adolescents]] live, and the [[Norm (social)|norms]], values, and practices they share.&lt;ref&gt;"the sum of the ways of living of adolescents; it refers to the body of norms, values, and practices recognized and shared by members of the adolescent society as appropriate guides to actions". Rice, F. (1996). ''The adolescent: Development, relationships and culture'' (7th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is the shared symbolic systems, and processes of maintaining and transforming those systems. Youth culture differs from the culture of older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Youth_culture.aspx|title=Youth culture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of youth culture include beliefs, behaviors, styles, and interests. An emphasis on clothes, popular music, sports, vocabulary, and dating set adolescents apart from other age groups, giving them what many believe is a distinct culture of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Fasick, Frank A. (1984). Parents, Peers, Youth Culture and Autonomy in Adolescence., ''Adolescence, 19(73)'' p.143-157&lt;/ref&gt; Within youth culture, there are many distinct and constantly changing [[youth subculture]]s. These subcultures' norms, values, behaviors, and styles vary widely, and may differ from the general youth culture. Understanding what adolescents think and do is fundamental to understanding the relationship between structure and agency, social patterns and individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930|journal = Journal of Youth Studies|date = 2015-01-01|doi = 10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930|first = Darcie|last = Vandegrift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence==

There is a debate about whether or not youth culture exists. Some researchers argue that youth's values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents, which means that youth culture is not a separate culture. Just because people see the presence of what seems to be a youth culture today does not mean that this phenomenon extends to all generations of young people. Additionally, peer influence varies greatly between contexts and by sex, age, and social status, making a single "youth culture" difficult, if not impossible, to define.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that there are definite elements of youth society that constitute culture, and that these elements differ from those of their parents' culture. Janssen et al. have used the [[terror management theory]] (TMT) to argue for the existence of youth culture.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, J., Dechesne, M, &amp; Van Knippenberg, A. (1999). The Psychological Importance of Youth Culture: A Terror Management Approach. ''Youth &amp; Society, 31(2)'', 152-167.&lt;/ref&gt; TMT is a psychological concept that hypothesizes that culture originates from an attempt to cope with the knowledge of mortality. Society does this by adopting a worldview and developing self-esteem. Researchers test TMT by exposing people to reminders of their mortality. TMT is supported if being reminded of death causes people to cling more strongly to their worldview. Janssen et al. tested the following hypothesis: "If youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness, then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practices and beliefs of the youth." Their results supported their hypothesis and the results of previous studies, suggesting that youth culture is, in fact, a culture.

Schwartz and Merten used the language of adolescents to argue for the presence of youth culture as distinct from the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Schwart &amp; Merten"&gt;Schwartz, G. &amp; Merten. D. (1967). The Language of Adolescence: An Anthropological Approach to the Youth Culture. ''The American Journal of Sociology, 72(5)'', 453-468.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz argued that high school students used their vocabulary to create meanings that are distinct to adolescents. Specifically, the adolescent status terminology (the words that adolescents use to describe hierarchical social statuses) contains qualities and attributes that are not present in adult status judgments. According to Schwartz, this reflects a difference in social structures and the way that adults and teens experience social reality. This difference indicates cultural differences between adolescents and adults, which supports the presence of a separate youth culture.&lt;ref name="Schwart &amp; Merten"/&gt;

==Movements==

Throughout the 20th century, youths had a strong influence on both lifestyle and culture. The [[flapper]]s and the [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] are two great examples of the impact of youth culture on society. The flappers were young women, confident about a prosperous future after World War I, and they became the symbol of effervescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Ronald Allen|title=America in the Twenties|date=2003|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=New York|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liveliness was seen in her new attitude in life in which she openly drank, smoked, and many socialized with gangster type men. The fashionable dress at the time also reflected the flapper's new lifestyle. Hems were raised, waists dropped, and hair was cut into bobs. This not only created a look that was dramatically different from the corseted, structured dresses of previous generations, but it also created a new freedom that allowed the wearer to move in ways one was unable to before. This break from older values was also apparent in a new posture embraced by the flappers. Instead of an upright, corseted posture, they preferred "a 'lop-sided' stance characterized by 'sunken chests and round shoulders,' [which] suggested fatigue rather than beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latham|first=Angela|title=Posing A Threat: Flappers, Chorus Girls, and Other Brazen Performers oft the American 1920's|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flappers exemplified how youth culture was influential in fashion and lifestyle.

Mods also are a great example of a youth culture movement inspiring a popular lifestyle. Similar to the flappers, they also emerged during a time of war and political and social troubles. They were a group of kids that stemmed from a group called the modernists. The Mods were young men and women who came from all classes, and they believed that their fashion choices "gave them entrée everywhere," and their fashion choices empowered them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Christine|title="We Are The Mods:" A Transnational History of a Youth Subculture|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location=New York|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's fashions were short and reflected an ideal, youthful body unforgiving to women with curves. They also cut their hair short, possibly a "homage to the flappers of the 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Christine|title="We Are The Mods:" A Transnational History of a Youth Subculture|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location=New York|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mod style and embrace of modern technology spread from the UK overseas to America as well as other countries, proving it to be an extremely influential youth culture movement.

==Theories==

The presence of youth culture is a relatively recent historical phenomenon. There are several dominant theories about the emergence of youth culture in the 20th century. These include theories about the historical, economic, and psychological influences on the presence of youth culture. One historical theory credits the emergence of youth culture to the beginning of [[compulsory education|compulsory schooling]]. James Coleman argues that age segregation is the root of a separate youth culture.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, J. (1961). ''The adolescent society''. Glencoe, IL: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Before compulsory schooling, many children and adolescents interacted primarily with adults. In contrast, modern children associate extensively with others their own age. These interactions allow adolescents to develop shared experiences and meanings, which are the root of youth culture.

Another theory posits that some types of cultures facilitate the development of youth culture, while others do not. The basis of this distinction is the presence of universalistic or particularistic norms. Particularistic norms are guidelines for behavior that vary from one individual to another. In contrast, universalistic norms apply to all members of a society.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt; Universalistic norms are more likely to be found in industrialized societies. Modernization in the last century or so has encouraged universalistic norms, since interaction in modern societies makes it necessary for everyone to learn the same set of norms. Modernization and universalistic norms have encouraged the growth of youth culture. The need for universalistic norms has made it impractical for young people's socialization to come primarily from immediate family members, which would lead to significant variation in the norms that are communicated. Therefore, many societies use age grouping, such as in schools, to educate their children on societies' norms and prepare them for adulthood. Youth culture is a byproduct of this tactic. Because children spend so much time together and learn the same things as the rest of their age group, they develop their own culture.

Psychological theorists have noted the role of youth culture in identity development. Youth culture may be a means of achieving identity during a time when one's role in life is not always clear. [[Erik Erikson]] theorized that the major psychological conflict of adolescence is [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|identity versus role confusion]]. The goal of this stage of life is to answer the question, "Who am I?" This can be difficult in many societies in which adolescents are simultaneously expected to behave like children and take on adult roles. Some psychologists have theorized that the formation of youth culture is an attempt to adopt an identity that reconciles these two conflicting expectations.

For example, Parsons (1951) posited that adolescence is a time when young people are transitioning from reliance on parents to autonomy. In this transitory state, dependence on the peer group serves as a stand-in for parents.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, T. ''The Social System''. Glencoe, Ill: Free Press, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Burlingame restated this hypothesis in 1970. He wrote that adolescents replace parents with the peer group, and that this reliance on the peer group diminishes as youth enter adulthood and take on adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Burlingame, W.V. The youth culture. In E.D. Evans (Ed.), ''Adolescents: Readings in behavior and development''. Hinsdale, Ill: Dryden Press, 1970, pp. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasick relates youth culture as a method of identity development to the simultaneous elongation of childhood and need for independence that occurs in adolescence. According to Fasick, adolescents face contradictory pulls from society. On one hand, compulsory schooling keeps them socially and economically dependent on their parents. On the other hand, young people need to achieve some sort of independence in order to participate in the market economy of modern society. As a means of coping with these contrasting aspects of adolescence, youth create independence through behavior—specifically, through the leisure-oriented activities that are done with peers.&lt;ref name="Fasick, F. 1984"&gt;Fasick, F. (1984). Parents, Peers, Youth Culture and Autonomy in Adolescence. ''Adolescence, 19(73)'', 143-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on adolescents==
[[File:Emo Chic.jpg|thumb|Example of a participant of [[emo]] [[youth subculture]]]]

For decades, adults have worried that youth subcultures were the root of moral degradation and changing values in younger generations.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt; Researchers have characterized youth culture as embodying values that are "in conflict with those of the adult world".&lt;ref&gt;Sugarman, Barry. Involvement in Youth Culture, Academic Achievement and Conformity in School: An Empirical Study of London Schoolboys. 1967. ''The British Journal of Sociology, 18''. 151-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Common concerns about youth culture include a perceived lack of interest in education, involvement in risky behaviors like substance use and sexual activity, and engaging extensively in leisure activities.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, T. (1954). Age and Sex in the Social Structure of the United States. In ''Essays in Sociological Theory'', 89-103. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions have led many adults to believe that adolescents hold different values than older generations and to perceive youth culture as an attack on the morals of current society.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt; These worries have prompted the creation of parenting websites such as theyouthculturereport.com and the Center for Parent Youth Understanding (cpyu.org), whose goal is to preserve the values of older generations in young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpyu.org/page.aspx?id%3D76589 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209001706/http://www.cpyu.org/page.aspx?id=76589 |archivedate=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the attitudes of many adults, there is not a consensus among researchers about whether youth subcultures hold different beliefs than adults do. Some researchers have noted the simultaneous rise in age segregation and adolescent adjustment problems such as suicide, delinquency, and premarital pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1974). The origins of alienation. ''[[Scientific American]], 231'', 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the increased prevalence of age segregation contributed to the problems of modern youth, and these problems represent a difference in values. However, most evidence suggests that these youth problems are not a reflection of different morals held by younger generations. Multiple studies have found that most adolescents hold views that are similar to their parents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fasick, F. (1984). Parents, Peers, Youth Culture and Autonomy in Adolescence., ''Adolescence, 19(73)'', 143-157.&lt;/ref&gt; One study challenged the theory that adolescent cohorts have distanced themselves from their parents by finding that between 1976 and 1982, a time when rates of adolescent problems increased, adolescents became less peer-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;Sebald, H. (1986). Adolescents' shifting orientation toward parents and peers: A curvilinear trend over recent decades. ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]], 48'', 5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A second study's finding that adolescents' values were more similar to their parents' in the 1980s than they were in the 1960s and '70s echoes Sebald's findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gecas, V., &amp; Seff, M. (1990). Families and adolescents: A review of the 1980s. ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]], 52'', 941-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study did find differences between adolescents' and parents' attitudes, but found that the differences were in the degree of belief, not in the attitude itself.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, A., &amp; Lerner, R.M. (1972). Attitudes of late adolescents and their parents toward contemporary issues. ''Psychological Reports, 30'', 239-244.&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be [[pluralistic ignorance]] on the part of youth regarding how their attitudes compare to peers and parents. A study by Lerner et al. asked college students to compare their attitudes on a number of issues to the attitudes of their peers and parents. Most students rated their attitudes as falling somewhere between their parents' more conservative attitudes and their peers' more liberal attitudes. The authors suggested that the reason for this is that the students perceived their friends as more liberal than they really were.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, R.M., Meisels, M., &amp; Knapp, J.R. (1975). Actual and perceived attitudes of late adolescents and their parents: The phenomenon of the generation gaps. ''Journal of Genetic Psychology, 126,'' 195-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

If adolescents' values are similar to their parents', this raises the question of why adults insist that adolescents inhabit a separate world with different values. One reason may be that the similarities between adolescent and adult values are relatively invisible compared to the differences between these two groups. The way young people dress, the music they listen to, and their language are often more apparent than the values they hold. This may lead adults to overemphasize the differences between youth and other age groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Adults may also falsely believe that youth's assertion of independence in exterior aspects of their life represents a manifestation of a different value system. In reality, sports, language, music, clothing and dating tend to be superficial ways of expressing autonomy—they can be adopted without compromising one's beliefs or values.&lt;ref name="Fasick, F. 1984"/&gt; Of course, there are some areas in which adolescents' assertion of autonomy can cause long-term consequences. These include behaviors involving substance use and sexual activity.

The impact of youth culture on deviance and sexual behavior is debatable. Drinking alcohol is normative for adolescents in the United States, with more than 70% of high school students reporting ever having had a drink.&lt;ref name="apps.nccd.cdc.gov"&gt;[http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline/App/Results.aspx?TT=&amp;OUT=&amp;SID=HS&amp;QID=H39&amp;LID=&amp;YID=&amp;LID2=&amp;YID2=&amp;COL=&amp;ROW1=&amp;ROW2=&amp;HT=&amp;LCT=&amp;FS=&amp;FR=&amp;FG=&amp;FSL=&amp;FRL=&amp;FGL=&amp;PV=&amp;TST=&amp;C1=&amp;C2=&amp;QP=G&amp;DP=&amp;VA=CI&amp;CS=Y&amp;SYID=&amp;EYID=&amp;SC=&amp;SO apps.nccd.cdc.gov]={{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, about 2/3 of teenagers have engaged in sexual intercourse by the time they leave high school.&lt;ref name="apps.nccd.cdc.gov"/&gt; As drinking and having sex may be common in adolescence, many researchers include them as aspects of youth culture.&lt;ref name="Fasick, F. 1984"/&gt; While engaging in these activities can have harmful consequences, the majority of adolescents who engage in these risky behaviors do not suffer long-term consequences. The possibilities of addiction, pregnancy, incarceration, and other negative outcomes are some potentially negative effects of participation in youth culture. Research demonstrates that many factors may influence youth to engage in high-risk behaviors, including "a lack of stable role models, heightened family stresses, lowered levels of family investment, weakened emotional bonds between parents and their children, lowered levels of social capital and social control, and a lack of hope in ones future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shanahan|first1=Michael J.|title=Pathways to Adulthood in Changing Societis: Variability and MechanismsIn Life Course Perspective|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2000|volume=26|pages=667–692|ref=Youth transition into adulthood|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, teen culture may also have benefits for the adolescent. Peer influence can have a positive effect on adolescents' well-being. For example, most teens report that their friends pressure them ''not'' to use drugs or engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt;

==Impact on society in general==

[[File:Student Vietnam War protesters.JPG|thumb|Student Vietnam War protesters]]

Young people can be a powerful force in precipitating change in society. Youth-led revolutions in the 20th and 21st centuries attest to this fact. Organizations of young people, which were often based on a student identity, were crucial to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. These include organizations such as the [[Southern Student Organizing Committee]], [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], whose role in sit-ins, protests, and other activities of the Civil Rights Movement were crucial to its success. The [[Freedom Summer]] relied heavily on college students; hundreds of students engaged in registering African Americans to vote, teaching in "Freedom Schools", and organizing the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement -- Mississippi Movement &amp; MFDP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|American protests]] in the [[Vietnam War]] were also student-driven. Many college campuses were buzzing during the war with protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations. Organizations such as the Young Americans for Freedom, the Student Libertarian Movement, and the Student Peace Union were based on youth status and contributed to participation in anti-war activities. Some scholars have claimed that the activism of youth during the Vietnam War was symbolic of a youth culture whose values were against those of mainstream American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Benjamin T. (2000)'Roots of the Anti-Vietnam War Movement,' in Hixson, Walter (ed) the Vietnam Antiwar Movement. New York: Garland Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, David S. 2007. The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the [[Arab Spring]] has drawn attention because of the role young people have played in demonstrations and protests. The activities of the movement have been initiated primarily by young people, often college students who are unsatisfied with the opportunities afforded to them in the current political climate. The participation of young people has been so crucial that it led TIME magazine to include several youth members of the movement in its 2011 list of 100 most influential people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/blog/entry/Youth-of-the-Arab-Spring-Among-TIMEs-100-Most-Influential/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424132356/http://www.aaiusa.org/blog/entry/Youth-of-the-Arab-Spring-Among-TIMEs-100-Most-Influential/ |archivedate=April 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the movement has relied heavily on social media (which can be considered an aspect of youth culture) to schedule, coordinate, and publicize events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301052550/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |archivedate=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have studied the trends that accompany social unrest, and have suggested ties between youth and revolt. Most notable is [[Gunnar Heinsohn]]'s theory of the [[Population pyramid#Youth bulge|youth bulge]]. According to this theory, an especially large population of young people, especially males, is associated with social unrest, war, and terrorism. The rationale that Heinsohn gives is that these population trends leave many people unable to find prestigious places in society, so they turn their attention to creating change in society.
