[[File:BarcoAuro 3D, Devised.svg|thumb|300x180px|right|Auro 11.1 logo]]
'''Auro 11.1''' is one of the cinematic speaker layouts of the [[Auro-3D]] format, invented in 2005 by Wilfried Van Baelen (CEO Auro Technologies, CEO Galaxy Studios). The Auro 11.1 cinema audio format is supported by [[Barco NV|Barco]], a global visualization technology and digital cinema projection company.

==Working==
[[File:Auro 11.1 soundfield diagram.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of 5.1 (left) and Auro 11.1 (right)]]
The Auro 11.1 cinema sound format is an extension of the existing [[5.1 surround sound]] format by incorporating height and overhead channels to allow for placement and panning of sound in the horizontal and vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-1? |title=Auro 11.1 explained |publisher=Barco |accessdate=28 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903080102/http://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-1 |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auro 11.1 is a channel-based system and thus differs in capability compared to competing formats such as [[Dolby Atmos]] and [[DTS:X]]. The height layer allows for placement of background reflections and reverberations observed in nature as well as allowing for smooth panning from the base layer to the ceiling. However, the lack of a surround back-channel restricts panning due to lack of differentiation between the side and rear sector. Similarly, the use of arrays for surround and overhead channel also disallows pinpoint localization of sound along the walls as well as within the theater space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auro 11.1 versus object-based sound in 3D|url=http://www.barco.com/secureddownloads/cd/MarketingKits/3d-sound/White%20papers/Auro%2011.1_versus_objectbased_sound_in_3D.pdf|publisher=Barco|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Auromax format extends the capabilities of Auro 11.1 to approach Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.

The system uses Auro-3D Octopus codec, which allows the 12 channels to be compressed into 6 channels by utilizing the least significant bits for the additional channels and its metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auro 3D Interview Continued|url=http://www.audioholics.com/audio-technologies/auro-3d-interview/2|website=Audioholics|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Auro 11.1 to be played as 5.1 in the absence of a decoder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-2? |title=Auro 11.1 products |publisher=Barco |accessdate=28 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903080057/http://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-2 |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Auro 11.1 system was installed in May 2010 in Galaxy Studios and the format was launched at the spatial audio conference (AES) in October 2010 in Tokyo. By December 2014, 550 installations were committed and installed in theaters worldwide.

The first movie mixed in Auro 11.1 was [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Red Tails]]'', released in January 2012. On 1 November 2012, [[DreamWorks Animation]] announced that it would release 15 of its upcoming movies in the Auro 11.1 format.

==Products==
The Auro 11.1 technological suite contains the Auro-Codec encoding - decoding plugins, Auro-Matic upmixer plugin and the Auro-Panner plugin.

===The Auro 11.1 decoder===
The Auro 11.1 decoder is a firmware based solution compatible with Doremi cinema servers, that activates once the metadata in an Auro 11.1 stream is detected. Once decoded, the media block routes the channels to the AP24&lt;sup&gt;3D&lt;/sup&gt; audio processor.

===AP24&lt;sup&gt;3D&lt;/sup&gt; audio processor===
The AP24&lt;sup&gt;3D&lt;/sup&gt; audio processor renders the streams received from the decoder and allows switching between 6 and 12 channel playback automatically or upmixing to Auro 11.1 layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Cinema audio processor - AP24-3D|url=https://www.barco.com/en/Products/3D-sound/Cinema-sound/Digital-Cinema-audio-processor.aspx#!|website=Barco|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''batwing''' or '''super turnstile antenna''' is a type of broadcasting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] used at [[very high frequency|VHF]] and [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies, named for its distinctive shape which resembles a [[bat wing]] or [[bow tie]]. [[Collinear antenna array|Stacked arrays]] of batwing antennas are used as [[television broadcasting]] antennas due to their [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="NABhandbook"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Batwing antennas  generate a horizontally [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] signal.  The advantage of the "batwing" design for television broadcasting is that it has a wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].  It was the first widely used television broadcasting antenna.&lt;ref name="NABhandbook" /&gt;

==Design and characteristics==
Batwing antennas are a specialized type of crossed [[dipole antenna]], a variant of the [[turnstile antenna]].&lt;ref name="NABhandbook" /&gt; Two pairs of identical vertical batwing-shaped elements are mounted at right angles around a common mast. Element “wings” on opposite sides are fed as a dipole. To generate an omnidirectional pattern, the two dipoles are fed 90° [[out of phase]].  The antenna radiates [[horizontal polarization|horizontally polarized]] radiation in the horizontal plane. Each group of four elements at a single level is referred to as a ''bay''.  The [[radiation pattern]] is close to omnidirectional but has four small lobes (maxima) in the directions of the four elements.

To reduce power radiated in the unwanted axial directions, in broadcast applications multiple bays fed in phase are stacked vertically with a spacing of approximately one [[wavelength]], to create a collinear array. This generates an omnidirectional radiation pattern with increased horizontal [[antenna gain|gain]] (more of the energy radiated in horizontal directions and less into the sky or down at the earth), suitable for terrestrial broadcasting.

The "batwing" shape of the elements is used because it gives the antenna a wide [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of approximately 20% of operating frequency at a [[VSWR]] of 1.1:1.&lt;ref name="NABhandbook" /&gt; This makes the antenna design suitable for broadcasters who wish to use a single antenna to transmit multiple television signals and thus made the batwing the preferred antenna for lowband TV stations (channels 2-6)  in the early days of broadcast television.

'''Bhungroo''' (meaning "straw" in Gujarati) is an innovative [[water harvesting]] technique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/bhungroo-technology-a-do-it-yourself-well-for-dry-farmlands/articleshow/28256319.cms?intenttarget=no|title=Bhungroo technology: A do-it-yourself well for dry farmlands|first=Vishal|last=Dutta|date=30 December 2017|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; for irrigation introduced by Indian women farmers. It frees excess water from flood prone and waterlogged farmland by drawing all the excess water underground and making land accessible for farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujarats-Bhungroo-gets-global-recognition/articleshow/45768141.cms|title=Gujarat's 'Bhungroo' gets global recognition - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The water stored during rainy season in unsaturated layers of soils can be pumped for farming in dry season, hence farmers can have dual season farming.

'''Burst phase''' is the first ten [[Frequency spectrum|cycles]] of [[colorburst]] in the "porch" of the synchronising [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] in the [[PAL]] (Phase Alternation Line) [[broadcast television systems]] format.  The frequency of this burst is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz; it is precise to .5&amp;nbsp;Hz, and is used as the reference frequency to synchronise the [[local oscillator]]s of the colour decoder in a PAL [[television set]].

This colorburst is sometimes called a "swinging burst", since it swings plus or minus 45 degrees line by line (hence the expression "phase alternating line"). This swing is used to set the centre frequency of the colour reference oscillator in the decoder. The swing of the burst phase distinguishes PAL from non-PAL lines, and produces the IDENT signal.

[[File:The oist (1894) (14748583141).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Advertisement for a carpet stretcher, dated 1894&lt;ref name="Oist"/&gt;]]

A '''carpet stretcher''' is a specialized tool used to install [[wall-to-wall carpet]]. The tool grips the carpet with a set of [[Tine (structural)|tines]] on the head. A force applied to the tool then [[tension (physics)|tension]]s the carpet and pulls it closer to the wall, where it can be fixed to a [[tack strip]].

There are two main types of carpet stretchers: "'''power stretchers'''" and "'''knee kickers'''". Power stretchers apply tension with a lever, and use a pole, typically collapsible, to extend the tensioning force across the room. Power stretchers create more tension than knee kickers, and are used to tension carpeting in large rooms.&lt;ref name="SWC"/&gt;

Knee kickers apply tension using a [[kick]] of the [[knee]] to the back of the tool. They are used to tension carpet in smaller spaces, such as closets, staircases, and rooms up to {{convert|10|ft|m}} square.&lt;ref name="SWC"/&gt; Failure to properly stretch carpet during installation can lead to the formation of wrinkles over time.&lt;ref name="SWC"/&gt;

The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' is an Egyptian wooden [[chair]] dated to the [[15th century BC|15th century B.C]]. The chair, currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], belonged to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[scribe]] [[Renyseneb|Reniseneb]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/547687|title=Chair of Reniseneb|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Ayman Mohamed|date=2014-01-28|title=Furniture industry through the real models and scenes in the ancient Egyptian art: Chairs, stools models |url=https://www.unioviedo.es/reunido/index.php/RM/article/view/10128|journal=Res Mobilis|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=146–166|doi=10.17811/rm.3.2014.146-166|issn=2255-2057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' was crafted circa [[1450s BC|1450 B.C]] during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], sixth [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]. Inscriptions on the chair indicate it belonged to the scribe Reniseneb (also referred to as Reni-seneb or Renyseneb). The chair is made from ebony and carved ivory. It is believed that the chair was originally less detailed then it currently is, and that additional inscriptions were added to the chair when Reniseneb died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The chair is notably the oldest (excluding royal chairs) surviving chair of its style from Egypt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The seat of the chair is a reproduction made from [[Caning (furniture)|woven reeds]], as the original seat has long since decayed. An image of Reniseneb seated in a similar chair is carved into the backrest of the chair, and its feet take the form of carved [[Lion|lion claws]]. [[Lotus flowers]] are also depicted on the chair's carved ivory, possibly due to Egyptian's association of lotus flowers with rebirth and healing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For safety-critical applications, it is anticipated that cars will also be connected using [[dedicated short-range communications]] (DSRC) radios, operating in the FCC-granted 5.9&amp;nbsp;GHz band with very low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

== History of connected cars, 1996–present ==

[[General Motors]] was the first automaker to bring the first connected car features to market with [[OnStar]] in 1996 in Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado. OnStar was created by GM working with [[Motorola]] Automotive (that was later bought by Continental). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a [[Call centre|call center]] where the agent sent help.&lt;ref name="autoaproprose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/definition-of-connected-car-what-is-the-connected-car-defined/ |deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; |title=Definition of Connected Car – What is the connected car? Defined |website=AUTO Connected Car |publisher=Aproprose |accessdate=22 July 2014 |location=South Pasadena, California, United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over.

[[Remote diagnostics]] were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, [[Turn-by-turn navigation|turn-by-turn directions]] and a network access device. Data-only [[telematics]] were first offered in 2007.

In the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] Wi-Fi [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors.

By 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2015/07/onstar-celebrates-1-billion-requeste-with-free-premium-service-for-loyal-users/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the breakdown association 'The AA' introduced the first piece of connected car technology, in Car Genie that connects directly to a breakdown service, not only warning of issues with car health, but intervening directly with a phone call to customers to help them prevent a breakdown.&lt;https://www.theaa.com/breakdown-cover/connected-car&gt;

== Types of connectivity ==
There are 5 ways a vehicle can be connected to its surroundings and communicate with them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autocaat.org/Technologies/Automated_and_Connected_Vehicles/|title=Automated and Connected Vehicles|last=Staff|first=CAAT|website=autocaat.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# V2I "''Vehicle to Infrastructure''": The technology captures data generated by the vehicle and provides information about the infrastructure to the driver. The V2I technology communicates information about safety, mobility or environment-related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.dot.gov/v2i/|title=Intelligent Transportation Systems - Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) Deployment Guidance and Resources|website=www.its.dot.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# V2V "''Vehicle to Vehicle''": The technology communicates information about speed and position of surrounding vehicles through a wireless exchange of information. The goal is to avoid accidents, ease traffic congestions and have a positive impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/vehicle-vehicle-communication|title=Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication|last=jean.yoder.ctr@dot.gov|date=2016-10-26|website=NHTSA|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# V2C "''Vehicle to Cloud''": The technology exchanges information about and for applications of the vehicle with a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] system. This allows the vehicle to use information from other, though the cloud connected industries like energy, transportation and smart homes and make use of [[Internet of things|IoT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1022093-connected-vehicle-cloud-platforms/|title=Connected Vehicle Cloud Platforms {{!}} ABI Research|website=www.abiresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# V2P "''Vehicle to Pedestrian''":  The technology senses information about its environment and communicates it to other vehicles, infrastructure and personal mobile devices. This enables the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and is intended to improve safety and mobility on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.dot.gov/research_archives/safety/v2p_comm_safety.htm|title=Intelligent Transportation Systems - Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) Communications for Safety|website=www.its.dot.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# V2X "''Vehicle to Everything''": The technology interconnects all types of vehicles and infrastructure systems with another. This connectivity includes cars, highways, ships, trains and airplanes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobility.siemens.com/mobility/global/SiteCollectionDocuments/en/road-solutions/urban/trends/siemens-vehicle-to-x-communication-technology-infographic.pdf|title=Future of Infrastructure: Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication technology|last=|first=|date=|website=Siemens|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories of applications ==

Applications can be separated into two categories: 1.) single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice.  2.) cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation.

Examples include, amongst others: 
1.) single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or [[Filling station|gas stations]].&lt;ref name="AUTO Connected Car News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2016/03/bmw-connected-na-available-for-iphone-apple-watch-calculates-departure-time-texts-friends-finds-gasparking/|title=BMW Connected NA available for iPhone / Apple Watch – calculates departure time, texts friends &amp; finds gas/parking|date=31 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[eCall]] would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref&gt;EU eCall (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

2.) cooperative safety-of-life and cooperative efficiency: [[Collision avoidance system|forward collision warning]], [[Lane departure warning system|lane change warning/blind spot warning]], emergency brake light warning, intersection movement assist, emergency vehicle approaching, road works warning, automatic notification of crashes, notification of speeding and safety alerts.&lt;ref name="Connected Vehicles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freight-online.co.uk/sectors/road/opinions/how-will-connected-vehicles-affect-us | title=How will connected vehicles affect us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eutruckplatooning.com/About/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The connected car segment can be further classified into 8 categories.&lt;ref&gt;PwC Strategy&amp; 2014. " In the fast lane. The bright future of connected cars". https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Strategyand_In-the-Fast-Lane.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Connected car Mobility management|Mobility management]]: functions that allow the driver to reach a destination quickly, safely, and in a cost-efficient manner (e.g.: Current traffic information, Parking lot or garage assistance, Optimised fuel consumption)
* [[Connected car commerce|Commerce]]: functions enabling users to purchase good or services while on-the-go (e.g.: Fuel, food &amp; beverage, parking, tolls)
* Vehicle management: functions that aid the driver in reducing operating costs and improving ease of use (e.g.: Vehicle condition and service reminders, Remote operation, Transfer of usage data)
* Breakdown prevention: connected to a breakdown service, with a back end algorithm predicting breakdowns and an outbound service intervening via phone, SMS or push notification
* Safety: functions that warn the driver of external hazards and internal responses of the vehicle to hazards  (e.g.: Vehicle condition and service reminders, Remote operation, Transfer of usage data)
* Entertainment: functions involving the entertainment of the driver and passengers (e.g.: Smartphone interface, WLAN hot spot, Music, video, Internet, social media, Mobile office)
* Driver assistance: functions involving partially or fully automatic driving (e.g.: Operational assistance or autopilot in heavy traffic, in parking, or on highways)
* Well being: functions involving the driver’s comfort and ability and fitness to drive (e.g.: Fatigue detection, Automatic environment adjustments to keep drivers alert, Medical assistance)

== Single-vehicle applications ==

Current automobiles entail embedded navigation systems, smartphone integration and multimedia packages.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, [[in car entertainment]] unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis.&lt;ref name="autoaproprose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/definition-of-connected-car-what-is-the-connected-car-defined/ |deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; |title=Definition of Connected Car – What is the connected car? Defined |website=AUTO Connected Car |publisher=Aproprose |accessdate=22 July 2014 |location=South Pasadena, California, United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the [[Open Automotive Alliance]] (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia.&lt;ref name="oaamem"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openautoalliance.net/#members | title=Open Automotive Alliance | publisher=[[Open Automotive Alliance]] | accessdate=22 July 2014 | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called [[CarPlay]].

[[Android Auto]] was announced on June 25, 2014 to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems.

Increasingly, Connected Cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system.

Innovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car's windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver's perspective.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.&lt;ref name="everisReport"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everis.com/global/WCRepositoryFiles/everis%20connected%20car%20report.pdf | title=everis Connected Car Report | publisher=[[everis]] | accessdate=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperative safety-of-life and efficiency==

These services relate to [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)]], that depend on the sensory input of more than one vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Seunghyuk|last2=Thalmayr|first2=Florian|last3=Wee|first3=Dominik|last4=Weig|first4=Florian|title=Advanced driver-assistance systems: Challenges and opportunities ahead|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/advanced-driver-assistance-systems-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)]] for that reason has argued for regulation in its [https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/us-department-transportation-issues-advance-notice-proposed-rulemaking-begin Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication]&lt;ref&gt;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, Docket No. NHTSA–2014–0022 (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/V2V-ANPRM_081514.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and argued the case in US Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Hearing in US Congress (https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes/hearings/vehicle-vehicle-communications-and-connected-roadways-future)&lt;/ref&gt; NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles.[https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/safercar/v2v/] Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the "basic safety message" (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/mar/0309-v2v.html|title=V2V Safety Technology Now Standard on Cadillac CTS Sedans|work=media.gm.com|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US also has appropriate standards – [[IEEE 802.11p]] - and frequency rules&lt;ref&gt;Federal Communication Commission -Amendment of Parts 2 and 90 of the Commission's Rules to Allocate the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band to the Mobile Service for Dedicated Short Range Communications of Intelligent Transportation Services ET Docket No. 98-95 (https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-99-305A1.doc)&lt;/ref&gt; in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety&lt;ref&gt;Commission Decision 2008/671/EC „on the harmonised use of radio spectrum in the 5 875-5 905 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)“ (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008D0671)&lt;/ref&gt; and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5,&lt;ref&gt;First version ETSI EN 302 571: Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Radiocommunications equipment operating in the 5 855 MHz to 5 925 MHz frequency band; Harmonized EN covering the essential requirements of article 3.2 of the R&amp;TTE Directive (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302500_302599/302571/01.01.01_60/en_302571v010101p.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;C-ITS Deployment Platform – Final Report, January 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologically speaking cooperative applications can be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;NHTSA: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/Readiness-of-V2V-Technology-for-Application-812014.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Here the regulatory framework is the main obstacle to implementation, questions like privacy and security need to be addressed. British weekly "The Economist" even argues that the matter is regulatory driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706258-worlds-most-valuable-startup-leading-race-transform-future|title=Uberworld|last=|first=|date=3 September 2016|work=Economist|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==
The necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary internet connection via a [[GSM]] module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator [[AT&amp;T]] with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo,&lt;ref name="attpr2014"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://about.att.com/story/volvo_cars_and_att_enter_multi_year_agreement_to_connect_future_models_in_us_and_canada.html | title=Volvo Cars and AT&amp;T Enter Multi-Year Agreement to Connect Future Models in U.S. and Canada | publisher=[[AT&amp;T Corporation]] | date=16 April 2014 | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes [[Verizon Enterprise Solutions|Verizon Wireless Enterprise]], a non-GSM CDMA operator.&lt;ref name="walford2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/01/hyuandai-blue-link-goes-red-verizon-wireless-use-it-google-glass-pandora-or-soundhound/ | title=Hyundai Blue Link Goes Red (Verizon Wireless) Using Google Glass, Pandora or SoundHound | publisher=Aproprose | work=AUTO Connected Car | date=21 January 2014 | accessdate=22 July 2014 | author=Walford, Lynn | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD ([[On-board diagnostics]]) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection:
* Hardware relies on customers smartphone for the internet connection or
* Hardware establishes proprietary internet connection via GSM module.

All forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. [[eCall]]). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://obd2.autoscout24.com/en/studie-ueber-connected-car-geschaeftsmodelle-sowie-herausforderungen-und-chancen-des-marktes/ | title=Connected Car Business Models – State of the Art and Practical Opportunities | publisher=Scout24 | work=AutoScout24 | accessdate=22 July 2014 | location=Munich, Germany | deadurl=no&lt;!--not present in archive.org; could not be added--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insurance ==

The data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers' doing-of-business.&lt;ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKinsey &amp; Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShiftingGears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance-service hybrids.&lt;ref name=ShiftingGears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based-insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an [[Onboard diagnostics|onboard diagnostics device]] allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments.&lt;ref name=ShiftingGears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards [[telematics]] devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through [[Wide area network|wide-area networks]] and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation.&lt;ref name=ShiftingGears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Future services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advise to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.&lt;ref name=ShiftingGears&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==

The following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions.

Technological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's driving the connecter car?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|publisher=McKinsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obstacles for Connecter Cars|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkk45ihlk/10-obstacles-for-connected-cars/#117b562612b8|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further there are initiatives to use the [[ethernet]] technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the ethernet network speed inside the vehicle can move from one [[Megabyte|megabit]] to [[gigabit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/02/the-top-five-trends-for-the-connected-car-in-2016/|title=The Top Five Trends For The Connected Car In 2016|last=Alam|first=Mahbubul|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, It uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/from-your-dorm-room-to-your-car-ethernet-is-back/|title=From your dorm room to your car: ethernet is back|last=Hall-Geisler|first=Kristen|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/how-carmakers-can-compete-for-the-connected-consumer|title=How carmakers can compete for the connected consumer|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet of Things]] will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Eun-Kyu|last2=Gerla|first2=Mario|last3=Pau|first3=Giovanni|last4=Lee|first4=Uichin|last5=Lim|first5=Jae-Han|title=Internet of Vehicles: From intelligent grid to autonomous cars and vehicular fogs|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|date=6 September 2016|volume=12|issue=9|pages=155014771666550|doi=10.1177/1550147716665500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Drawbacks and Challenges ===
Although the connected car offers lots of benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges;
* A major issue with the connected cars is hackability. The more it is connected to the internet and to the system, it becomes more exposed to being penetrated from the outside. If the service and help can be provided from distance by [[Automotive industry|car-makers]], through that channel, [[hacker]]s can access and control the car as well. In [[Germany]] and [[Brazil]], 59% of car drivers are afraid to be hacked into their car if it is connected to the Internet. In the [[United States|U.S]] there are 43% and in [[China]] 53% whereas the average lies at 54%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|title=What’s driving the connected car|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] is also a major concern. Cars, [[sensor]], and network hardware will malfunction.  The system has to deal with incorrect data, as well as faulty communications, such as denial of service attacks.
* Privacy is another dimension, both with hacking and with other uses. Sensitive data gathered from the car such as the location, driver's daily route, apps that are used, etc... are all susceptible to be hacked and used for unauthorised purposes.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tomsguide.com/us/car-hacking-markey-report,news-20424.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being used by businesses and government. In Germany for example 51% of car drivers do not want to use car-related connected services because they want to keep their privacy. In the U.S it is 45%, in Brazil 37% and in China 21% of the car drivers that think so. The average lies at 37%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A simple failure in the system, whether in the connected car, or elsewhere in the network, while on the [[Autonomous car|autonomous drive]] can cause fatal consequences.

=== Fighting the challenges  ===
* Changing the [[design]] of products: the way that the product is developed and the "maintenance-respond-architecture" play a crucial role. Companies have to focus on long term solutions in terms of design security because quick changes are costly and easy to circumvent. Integrating this sphere at the earliest stage possible when developing the product can be the right approach for the companies. 
* Internal cooperation between departments of the company: product-security teams and corporate IT-security teams will have to work closely together in order to prevent the hackability of their devices. To do so, companies may create guidelines that minimize probabilities of bugs, and security gaps (software). Making modifying and patching systems easier can be another effect driven from that.
* Over-the-air updates: As short term solutions are also easy to solve problems a technology called OTA (over-the-air) becomes more and more important to OEMs. These OTA updates allow companies to quickly detect problems/attacks and prevent the malefactors to become active and attack the system. However, this is a very costly approach and companies have to know the architecture of their systems in detail to directly attack the issue not to lose money on inefficiency.
* [[Value chain]] security: As companies are the final integrators of security systems they also have to control security all along the value chain. Also suppliers have to make sure that security plays the most important role for the mobile device. Taking the example of the procurement department, it has to make sure that the cybersecurity features of the final product are negotiated and available. The whole security issue starts at the beginning of the value chain. This approach can be used to actually define and shape future security standards in the industry and make sure that every player in the industry has the same understanding of the importance of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shifting-gears-in-cybersecurity-for-connected-cars|title=Shifting gears in cybersecurity for connected cars|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital fuel injection''' refers to a [[fuel injection]] system that uses a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] from an onboard [[electronic control unit]] (ECU) to admit [[gasoline|fuel]] into a [[carburetor]] style [[intake]]. While similar to that of [[Fuel injection#Single-point injection|throttle body injection]], the system uses no [[sensor]]s to help regulate the fuel flow.
Instead, it uses a signal from the ECU previously programmed by the [[Car tuning|tuner]].

Digital systems work to keep complexity to a minimum. Without the need for sensors, the [[engine]] bay is kept free of wires, and the engine of extra sensors that may cause malfunctions.

'''DocBook''' is a [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] [[markup language]] for technical [[documentation]]. It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docbook.org/whatis What is DocBook?]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a semantic language, DocBook enables its users to create [[separation of presentation and content|document content in a presentation-neutral form]] that captures the logical structure of the content; that content can then be published in a variety of formats, including [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], [[EPUB]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Manual page (Unix)|man pages]], [[Web help]]&lt;ref name="webhelp-1.76.1"&gt;[http://blog.kasunbg.org/2010/08/docbook-webhelp-project.html DocBook WebHelp Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|HTML Help]], without requiring users to make any changes to the source. In other words, when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats. It solves the problem of reformatting by writing it once using XML tags.

== Design ==

DocBook is an [[XML]] language. In its current version (5.x), DocBook's language is formally defined by a [[RELAX NG]] [[XML schema|schema]] with integrated [[Schematron]] rules. (There are also [[W3C XML Schema]]+Schematron and [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) versions of the schema available, but these are considered non-standard.)

As a semantic language, DocBook documents do not describe what their contents "look like", but rather the ''meaning'' of those contents. For example, rather than explaining how the [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] for an article might be visually formatted, DocBook simply says that a particular section ''is'' an abstract. It is up to an external processing tool or application to decide where on a page the abstract should go and what it should look like or whether or not it should be included in the final output at all.

DocBook provides a vast number of semantic element tags. They are divided into three broad categories: structural, block-level, and inline.

''Structural'' tags specify broad characteristics of their contents. The &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; element, for example, specifies that its child elements represent the parts of a book. This includes a title, chapters, glossaries, appendices, and so on. DocBook's structural tags include, but are not limited to:

* ''&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt;s, can be nested with other sets
* ''&lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;s, and/or &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;s, with optional glossaries, appendices, etc.
* ''&lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s—can be nested with other parts, and may have special introductory text
* ''&lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, unnumbered collection of block-level elements
* ''&lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, numbered collection of block-level elements—chapters don't require explicit numbers, a chapter number is the number of previous chapter elements in the XML document plus 1
* ''&lt;code&gt;appendix&lt;/code&gt;:'' Contains text that represents an [[Addendum|appendix]]
* ''&lt;code&gt;dedication&lt;/code&gt;:'' Text represents the dedication of the contained structural element

Structural elements can contain other structural elements. Structural elements are the only permitted top-level elements in a DocBook document.

''Block-level'' tags are elements like paragraph, lists, etc. Not all these elements can directly contain text. Sequential block-level elements render one "after" another. After, in this case, can differ depending on the language. In most Western languages, "after" means below: text paragraphs are printed down the page. Other languages' [[Writing system#Directionality|writing systems can have different directionality]]; for example, in Japanese, paragraphs are often printed in downward columns, with the columns running from right to left, so "after" in that case would be to the left. DocBook semantics are entirely neutral to these kinds of language-based concepts.

''Inline-level'' tags are elements like emphasis, hyperlinks, etc. They wrap text within a block-level element. These elements do not cause the text to break when rendered in a paragraph format, but typically they cause the document processor to apply some kind of distinct typographical treatment to the enclosed text, by changing the font, size, or similar attributes. (The DocBook specification ''does'' say that it expects different typographical treatment, but it does not offer specific requirements as to what this treatment may be.) That is, a DocBook processor doesn't have to transform an &lt;code&gt;emphasis&lt;/code&gt; tag into ''italics''. A reader-based DocBook processor could increase the size of the words, or, a text-based processor could use bold instead of italics.

=== Sample document ===

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 &lt;book xml:id="simple_book" xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0"&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Very simple book&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;chapter xml:id="chapter_1"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;Hello world!&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;I hope that your day is proceeding &lt;emphasis&gt;splendidly&lt;/emphasis&gt;!&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/chapter&gt;
   &lt;chapter xml:id="chapter_2"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;Hello again, world!&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/chapter&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Semantically, this document is a "book", with a "title", that contains two "chapters" each with their own "titles". Those "chapters" contain "paragraphs" that have text in them. The markup is fairly readable in English.

In more detail, the root element of the document is &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;. All DocBook elements are in an [[XML Namespace]], so the root element has an ''xmlns'' attribute to set the current namespace. Also, the root element of a DocBook document must have a ''version'' that specifies the version of the format that the document is built on.

(XML documents can include elements from multiple namespaces at once. For simplicity, the example does not illustrate this.)

A &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; element must contain a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; element containing a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;. This must be before any child structural elements. Following the title are the structural children, in this case, two &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt; elements. Each of these must have a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;. They contain &lt;code&gt;para&lt;/code&gt; block elements, which can contain free text and other inline elements like the &lt;code&gt;emphasis&lt;/code&gt; in the second paragraph of the first chapter.

=== Schemas and validation ===

Rules are formally defined in the DocBook [[XML schema]]. Appropriate programming tools can validate an XML document (DocBook or otherwise), against its corresponding schema, to determine if (and where) the document fails to conform to that schema. XML editing tools can also use schema information to avoid creating non-conforming documents in the first place.

== Authoring and processing ==

Because DocBook is XML, documents can be created and edited with any text editor. A dedicated [[XML editor]] is likewise a functional DocBook editor. DocBook provides [[XML schema|schema files]] for popular XML schema languages, so any XML editor that can provide content completion based on a schema can do so for DocBook. Many [[XML editor#Graphical editors|graphical]] or [[WYSIWYG]] [[XML editor#WYSIWYG editors|XML editors]] come with the ability to edit DocBook like a [[word processor]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Because DocBook conforms to a well-defined XML schema, documents can be validated and processed using any tool or programming language that includes XML support.

== History ==

DocBook began in 1991 in discussion groups on [[Usenet]] and eventually became a joint project of [[HAL Computer Systems]] and [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly &amp; Associates]] and eventually spawned its own maintenance organization (the Davenport Group) before moving in 1998 to the ''SGML Open'' consortium, which subsequently became [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]. DocBook is currently maintained by the ''DocBook Technical Committee'' at OASIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/ch01.html Getting Started with DocBook]&lt;/ref&gt;

DocBook is available in both [[SGML]] and [[XML]] forms, as a [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]. [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C XML Schema]] forms of the XML version are available. Starting with DocBook 5, the RELAX NG version is the "normative" form from which the other formats are generated.

DocBook originally started out as an SGML application, but an equivalent XML application was developed and has now replaced the [[SGML]] one for most uses. (Starting with version 4 of the SGML DTD, the XML DTD continued with this version numbering scheme.) Initially, a key group of software companies used DocBook since their representatives were involved in its initial design. Eventually, however, DocBook was adopted by the open source community where it has become a standard for creating documentation for many projects, including [[FreeBSD]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]] desktop documentation, the [[GTK+]] [[Application programming interface|API]] references, the [[Linux kernel]] documentation, and the work of the [[Linux Documentation Project]].

=== Pre DocBook v5.0 ===

Until DocBook 5, DocBook was defined normatively by a Document Type Definition (DTD). Because DocBook was built originally as an application of [[SGML]], the DTD was the only available schema language. DocBook 4.x formats can be SGML or XML, but the XML version does not have its own namespace.

DocBook 4.x formats had to live within the restrictions of being defined by a DTD. The most significant restriction was that an element name uniquely defines its possible contents. That is, an element named &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; must contain the same information no matter where it is in the DocBook file. As such, there are many kinds of info elements in DocBook 4.x: &lt;code&gt;bookinfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chapterinfo&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Each has a slightly different content model, but they do share some of their content model. Additionally, they repeat context information. The book's &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; element is that, because it is a direct child of the book; it does not need to be named specially for a human reader. However, because the format was defined by a DTD, it did have to be named as such. The root element does not have or need a ''version'', as the version is built into the DTD declaration at the top of a pre-DocBook 5 document.

DocBook 4.x documents are not compatible with DocBook 5, but can be converted into DocBook 5 documents via an XSLT stylesheet. One (&lt;code&gt;db4-upgrade.xsl&lt;/code&gt;) is provided as part of the distribution of the DocBook 5 schema and specification package.&lt;ref&gt;Jirka Kosek, Norman Walsh, Dick Hamilton, and Michael Smith, ''DocBook V5.0: The Transition Guide'', 16 June 2009, [http://docbook.org/docs/howto/#convert4to5 Converting DocBook V4.x documents to DocBook V5.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Output formats ==

DocBook files are used to prepare output files in a wide variety of formats. Nearly always, this is accomplished using [[DocBook XSL]] stylesheets. These are [[XSLT]] stylesheets that transform DocBook documents into a number of formats ([[HTML]], [[XSL-FO]] for later conversion into [[PDF]], etc.). These stylesheets can be sophisticated enough to generate tables of contents, glossaries, and indexes. They can oversee the selection of particular designated portions of a master document to produce different versions of the same document (such as a "tutorial" or a "quick-reference guide", where each of these consist of a subset of the material). Users can write their own customized stylesheets or even a full-fledged program to process the DocBook into an appropriate output format as their needs dictate.

Norman Walsh and the DocBook Project development team maintain the key application for producing output from DocBook source documents: A set of [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]] stylesheets (as well as a legacy set of [[DSSSL]] stylesheets) that can generate high-quality [[HTML]] and print ([[XSL Formatting Objects|FO]]/[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) output, as well as output in other formats, including [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[man page]]s and HTML Help.

[[Web help]]&lt;ref name=webhelp-1.76.1 /&gt; is a chunked HTML output format in the [[DocBook XSL]] stylesheets that was introduced in version 1.76.1. The documentation for web help&lt;ref&gt;[http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/webhelp/docs/index.html Web help documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; also provides an example of web help and is part of the DocBook XSL distribution.

The major features are its fully CSS-based page layout, search of the help content, and a table of contents in collapsible-tree form. Search has [[stemming]], match highlighting, explicit page-scoring, and the standard multilingual [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenizer]]. The search and TOC are in a pane that appears as a [[Frameset (HTML)|frameset]], but is actually implemented with [[div and span|div tags]] and cookies (so that it is progressive).

This web help format was originally implemented by Kasun Gajasinghe as part of the Google Summer of Code 2010 program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.docbook.org/WebHelp Web help DocBook wiki page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplified DocBook ==

DocBook offers a large number of features that may be overwhelming to a new user. For those who want the convenience of DocBook without a steep learning curve, ''Simplified DocBook'' was designed. It is a small subset of DocBook designed for single documents such as articles or white papers (i.e., "books" are not supported). The Simplified DocBook DTD is currently at version 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docbook.org/schemas/sdocbook/ Simplified DocBook]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eddy break-up model''' ('''EBU''') is used in [[combustion]] engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Combustion | work = CFD Online website | publisher = CFD Online | url = http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Combustion#Eddy_Break-Up_model | accessdate = 23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Combustion modeling has a wide range of applications. In most of the combustion systems fuel and oxygen (or air) are separately supplied in the combustion chamber. Due to this chemical reaction and combustion occurs simultaneously in the [[combustion chamber]]. However, the rate of the chemical reaction is faster than the rate of mixing fuel and oxygen. Therefore, that rate of combustion is controlled by rate of mixing. Such cases, where formation of pre-mixture is difficult, are called [[diffusion combustion]] or [[diffusion flame]]s.

==Diffusion flames==
[[Diffusion]] flames can be [[laminar flow|laminar]] diffusion flames (e.g. candles and matches burning in the air etc.) or [[turbulent diffusion]] flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and [[internal combustion engine]]s) depending on the nature of mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging [[velocity]] of fuel and air. [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|Eddies]] inside the air flow plays an important role in deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as "break-up point". Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.

==Problems==
Combustion plays a vital role in many applications and a proper understanding of its effect on the system can be very helpful in designing the newer technologies and improving the existing ones. Nowadays, numerical modeling is a most effective tool for understanding and studying such problems. But a number of problems are associated with it such as:
* The control equations associated are very complicated.
* Large number of control equation need to be studied which include knowledge of both fluid dynamics and chemistry of chemical reactions during combustion.
* Involvement of huge number of components in the chemical reactions.
* There are serious time-scale problems because of mismatch in chemical reaction rate and fluid transport rate.
* Effect of several other processes like heat transfer, radiation, convection and diffusion.

==Combustion models==
Many combustion models have been proposed. There is a long list of such models in literature but due to simplicity the eddy break-up model originally proposed by Spalding and later modified by Magnussen and Hjertager ([[eddy dissipation model]] (EDM)) became popular models. It is based on the assumption that the reaction rate is controlled by turbulent mixing because of the dependence of reaction rate on the mixing of the turbulent eddies. It is well documented that there are strong interactions between the turbulent flow and reactions. The heat released during the reaction affects the density and hence turbulence. While the turbulent flow induces changes concentration and temperature pulsations which enhance the mixing and heat transfer and affect the reaction rate. Turbulence also results in deformations in burning flame surface due to which folding occurs and the surface is also broken into pieces of different sizes. This enhances the total surface area of the flame and thus increases the combustible mixed gases burnt per unit time. Due to this, turbulent flames grow at a much faster rate than that of laminar flames.

==Formula==
Spalding (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, D. B., "Mixing and chemical reaction in steady confined turbulent flames", Thirteenth symposium (international) on combustion, The combustion institute, pp. 649–657, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; defined rate of fuel consumption as a function of local flow properties of fuel and oxidant. This model is based on a single step global infinitely fast stoichiometric chemical reaction.

1&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel + s kg of oxidant→(1+s) kg of products

For ''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' as mass fraction and ''M&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' as molecular weight of species ''j''; local density of mixture ''(ρ)'' is dependent on concentration of reactant and products and temperature of mixture. It can be mathematically calculated as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\rho = \frac{P}{RT\sum_{\text{for all j}}{\frac{m_j}{M_j}}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
 
It is used to express the turbulent dissipation rate of fuel ''(R&lt;sub&gt;fu&lt;/sub&gt;)'', oxygen ''(R&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and products ''(R&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;)'' following the proposal from Magnussen and Hjertager as:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{fu}=-C_R\rho m_{fu}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{ox}=-C_R\rho \frac{m_{ox}}{s}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{pr}=-C_R^{'}\rho \frac{m_{pr}}{(1+s)}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
Where ''k'' is the turbulent kinetic energy, is the rate of dissipation of ''k'', and are model constants (value varies from 0.35 to 4). The reaction rate of fuel is considered to be smallest among all and is given by:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{S_{fu}=-\rho\frac{\varepsilon}{k}min\biggl[C_Rm_{fu}, C_R\frac{m_{ox}}{s}, C_R^{'}\frac{m_{pr}}{1+s}\biggr]}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|5}}}}
The model also leads to determination of mass fraction of product and oxygen using transport equation of mixture fraction ''(f)''
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{ f=\frac{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]-{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_0}{{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_1-{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_0}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
For solving we need to first find the stociometric mixture fraction ''(f&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;)'' when there is no fuel and oxygen is present in products, which is defined as 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{f_{st}=\frac{m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{If} f &lt; f_{st}, f=\frac{-m_{ox}+m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{If} f &gt; f_{st}, f=\frac{-{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
Above equations (7-9) not only shows linear relation of mixture fraction with mass fraction of oxygen and products but also helps in predicting their values. Magnussen and Hjertager (1976)&lt;ref&gt;Magnussen, B. F.; Hjertager, B. H., "On the mathematical modeling of turbulent combustion with special emphasis on shoot formation and combustion", Sixth symposium (International) on combustion, The combustion institute, pp. 719–729, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; utilize this model and conformity of experimental results with predictions supports this model. Several other researchers also justified the beauty of this model for fairly good predictions which are quite close to experimental results. Hence, this model is a topic of top priority due to its simplicity, steady convergence, and implementation in [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) procedures.

The '''exploding-bridgewire detonator''' ('''EBW''', also known as '''exploding wire detonator''') is a type of [[detonator]] used to initiate the [[detonation]] reaction in [[explosives|explosive materials]], similar to a [[blasting cap]] because it is fired using an electric current.  EBWs use a different physical mechanism than blasting caps, using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied, by the process of [[Exploding wire method|exploding wire method]].  This has led to their common use in [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;

The [[slapper detonator]] is a more recent development along similar lines.

== History ==
The EBW was invented by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Lawrence H. Johnston|Lawrence Johnston]] for the [[Fat Man]]–type bombs of the [[Manhattan Project]], during their work in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].  The Fat Man Model 1773 EBW detonators used an unusual, high reliability detonator system with two EBW "horns" attached to a single booster charge, which then fired each of the 32 explosive lens units.&lt;ref name="Coster-Mullen"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

EBWs were developed as a means of detonating multiple explosive charges simultaneously, mainly for use in [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|plutonium-based nuclear weapons]] in which a plutonium core (called a ''[[plutonium pit|pit]]'') is compressed very rapidly.  This is achieved via conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit.  The implosion must be highly symmetrical or the plutonium would simply be ejected at the low-pressure points. Consequently, the detonators must have very precise timing.

An EBW has two main parts: a piece of fine wire which contacts the explosive, and a [[high-voltage]] high-current low-impedance [[electricity]] source; it must reliably and consistently supply a rapid starting pulse. When the wire is connected across this voltage, the resulting high [[current (electricity)|current]] melts and then vaporizes the wire in a few microseconds. The resulting shock and heat initiate the [[high explosive]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

}}

This accounts for the heavy cables seen in photos of the [[Trinity site|Trinity]] "[[The gadget|Gadget]]"; high voltage cable requires good insulation and they had to deliver a large current with little voltage drop, lest the EBW not achieve the phase transition quickly enough.

The precise timing of EBWs is achieved by the detonator using direct physical effects of the vaporized bridgewire to initiate detonation in the detonator's booster charge.  Given a sufficiently high and well known amount of electric current and voltage, the timing of the bridgewire vaporization is both extremely short (a few microseconds) and extremely precise and predictable (standard deviation of time to detonate as low as a few tens of nanoseconds).

Conventional [[blasting cap]]s use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the primary explosive to detonate.  Imprecise contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well.  The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the primary explosive.  This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.

=== Use in nuclear weapons ===

Since explosives detonate at typically 7–8 kilometers per second, or 7–8 meters per millisecond, a 1 millisecond delay in detonation from one side of a nuclear weapon to the other would be longer than the time the detonation would take to cross the weapon.  The time precision and consistency of EBWs (0.1 microsecond or less) are roughly enough time for the detonation to move 1 millimeter at most, and for the most precise commercial EBWs this is 0.025 microsecond and about 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm variation in the detonation wave.  This is sufficiently precise for very low tolerance applications such as nuclear weapon [[explosive lens]]es.&lt;!-- cite to Nuclear Weapons FAQ --&gt;

In the US, due to their common use in nuclear weapons, these devices are subject to the nuclear control authorities in every state, according to the Guidelines for the Export of Nuclear Material, Equipment and Technology.  EBWs are on the US State Department Munitions Control List, and exports are highly regulated.&lt;ref name="RISI-Export"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civilian use ===

EBWs have found uses outside nuclear weapons, such as the [[Titan IV]],&lt;ref&gt;
 [http://neyersoftware.com/Papers/AIAA96/HVD.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; safety conscious applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries.&lt;ref name="RISI-Models"&gt;
 [http://www.teledynerisi.com/products/0products_1ebw_page10.asp Teledyne RISI - Selecting the Right EBW Detonator], accessed Dec 26, 2008
&lt;/ref&gt; EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as [[lead azide]] are very sensitive to static electricity, radio frequency, shock, etc.

== Mechanism of operation ==

The bridgewire is usually made of [[gold]], but [[platinum]] or gold/platinum alloys can also be used. The most common commercial wire size is 0.038&amp;nbsp;mm (1.5 [[thousandth of an inch|mils]]) in diameter and 1&amp;nbsp;mm (40 mils) in length, but lengths ranging from 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm to 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm (10 mils to 100 mils) can be encountered. From the available explosives, only [[PETN]] at low densities can be initiated by sufficiently low shock to make its use practical in commercial systems as a part of the EBW initiator. It can be chained with another [[explosive booster]], often a pellet of [[tetryl]], [[RDX]] or some [[polymer-bonded explosive|PBX]] (e.g., PBX 9407). Detonators without such booster are called ''initial pressing detonators'' (IP detonators).&lt;!-- Paul Cooper: Introduction to the Technology of Explosives, chapter 4.5 --&gt;

During initiation, the wire heats with the passing current until melting point is reached. The heating rate is high enough that the liquid metal has no time to flow away, and heats further until it vaporizes. During this phase the electrical resistance of the bridgewire assembly rises. Then an [[electric arc]] forms in the metal vapor, leading to drop of electrical resistance and sharp growth of the current, quick further heating of the ionized metal vapor, and formation of a [[shock wave]]. To achieve the melting and subsequent vaporizing of the wire in time sufficiently short to create a shock wave, a current rise rate of at least 100 amperes per microsecond is required.

If the current rise rate is lower, the bridge may burn, perhaps causing deflagration of the PETN pellet, but it will not cause detonation. PETN-containing EBWs are also relatively insensitive to a static electricity discharge. Their use is limited by the thermal stability range of PETN. (cf. [[slapper detonator]]s, which can use high density [[hexanitrostilbene]], allowing their use in temperatures up to almost 300&amp;nbsp;°C and at both vacuum and at high pressures.)&lt;!-- Paul Cooper: Introduction to the Technology of Explosives, chapter 4.5 --&gt;

==Firing system==
&lt;!-- See the NWFAQ link below, raw data taken mostly from there. --&gt;
The EBW and the slapper detonator are the safest known types of detonators, as only a very high-current fast-rise pulse can successfully trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-[[inductance]], high-capacitance, high-voltage [[capacitor]] (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch ([[spark gap]], [[thyratron]], [[krytron]], etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is  a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; The high voltage may be generated using a [[Marx generator]]. Low-[[electrical impedance|impedance]] capacitors and low-impedance [[coaxial cable]]s are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate.

The [[flux compression generator]] is one alternative to capacitors. When fired, it creates a strong [[electromagnetic pulse]], which is inductively coupled into one or more secondary coils connected to the bridge wires or slapper foils. A low energy density capacitor equivalent to a compression generator would be roughly the size of a soda can. The energy in such a capacitor would be {{frac|1|2}}·C·V{{sup|2}}, which for the above-mentioned capacitor is 12.5&amp;nbsp;J. (By comparison, a defibrillator delivers ~200&amp;nbsp;J from 2&amp;nbsp;kV and perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;µF.&lt;ref&gt;http://class.phys.psu.edu/251Recitations/02_Electric_Potential/Capacitance/Capacitance-Defibrillator.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The flash-strobe in a disposable camera is typically 3&amp;nbsp;J from a 300&amp;nbsp;V capacitor of 100&amp;nbsp;µF.)

In a fission bomb, the same or similar circuit is used for powering the [[modulated neutron initiator|neutron trigger]], the initial source of [[nuclear fission|fission neutron]]s.

The '''Furuta pendulum''', or rotational inverted pendulum, consists of a driven arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a [[pendulum]] attached to that arm which is free to rotate in the vertical plane.  It was invented in 1992 at [http://www.titech.ac.jp/ Tokyo Institute of Technology] by Katsuhisa Furuta&lt;ref&gt;Furuta, K., Yamakita, M. and Kobayashi, S. (1992) “Swing-up control of inverted pendulum using pseudo-state feedback”, Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 206(6), 263-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuetal2001"&gt;Xu, Y., Iwase, M. and Furuta, K.

It is an example of a complex nonlinear oscillator of interest in [[Control Systems Engineering|control system theory]].  The pendulum is [[Underactuation|underactuated]] and extremely [[Nonlinear|non-linear]] due to the gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] forces.

==Equations of motion==
Despite the great deal of attention the system has received, very few publications successfully derive (or use) the full dynamics.  Many authors&lt;ref name="Furutaetal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fantoni"/&gt; have only considered the rotational inertia of the pendulum for a single principal axis (or neglected it altogether&lt;ref name="Egeland"/&gt;).  In other words, the inertia tensor only has a single non-zero element (or none), and the remaining two diagonal terms are zero. It is possible to find a pendulum system where the moment of inertia in one of the three principal axes is approximately zero, but not two.

===Definitions===

[[Image:Furuta pendulum.jpg|thumb|450px| Fig. 1: Schematic of the single rotary inverted pendulum system.]]

Consider the rotational inverted pendulum mounted to a DC motor as shown in Fig. 1.  The DC motor is used to apply a torque &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; to Arm 1.  The link between Arm 1 and Arm 2 is not actuated but free to rotate.  The two arms have lengths  &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The arms have masses  &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; which are located at &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;  respectively, which are the lengths from the point of rotation of the arm to its center of mass.  The arms have inertia tensors  &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2&lt;/math&gt; (about the centre of mass of the arm).  Each rotational joint is viscously damped with damping coefficients  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; is the damping provided by the motor bearings and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is the damping arising from the pin coupling between Arm 1 and Arm 2.

A right hand coordinate system has been used to define the inputs, states and the Cartesian coordinate systems 1 and 2.  The coordinate axes of Arm 1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.

The angular rotation of Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the horizontal plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above) is positive.  The angular rotation of Arm 2, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the vertical plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.  When the Arm is hanging down in the stable equilibrium position &lt;math&gt;\theta_2=0&lt;/math&gt; .

The torque the servo-motor applies to Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt;, is positive in a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above).  A disturbance torque,  &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, is experienced by Arm 2, where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.

===Assumptions===
Before deriving the dynamics of the system a number of assumptions must be made.  These are:
*The motor shaft and Arm 1 are assumed to be rigidly coupled and infinitely stiff.
*Arm 2 is assumed to be infinitely stiff.
*The coordinate axes of Arm1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.
*The motor rotor inertia is assumed to be negligible.  However, this term may be easily added to the moment of inertia of Arm 1.
*Only viscous damping is considered.  All other forms of damping (such as Coulomb) have been neglected, however it is a simple exercise to add this to the final governing DE.

===Non-linear Equations of Motion===
The non-linear equations of motion are given by&lt;ref name="Cazzolatoetal2011"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 \left(J_{1zz} + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 L_1^2 + (J_{2yy} + m_2 l_2^2)\sin^2(\theta_2) +
J_{2xx}\cos^2(\theta_2) \right) 
+ \ddot{\theta}_2 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2) 
- m_2 L_1 l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \dot{\theta}_2^2 
+\dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \sin(2 \theta_2) (m_2 l_2^2 + J_{2yy} - J_{2xx}) 
+b_1 \dot{\theta}_1
= \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
+\ddot{\theta}_2 (m_2 l_2^2 + J_{2zz})
+ 1/2 \dot{\theta}_1^2 \sin(2 \theta_2) ( -m_2 l_2^2 - J_{2yy} + J_{2xx} )
+b_2 \dot{\theta}_2
+g m_2 l_2 \sin(\theta_2)
= \tau_2&lt;/math&gt;

===Simplifications===
Most Furuta pendulums tend to have long slender arms, such that the moment of
inertia along the axis of the arms is negligible. In addition, most arms have
rotational symmetry such that the moments of inertia in two of the principal axes
are equal. Thus, the inertia tensors may be approximated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1 = diag[J_{1xx},J_{1yy},J_{1zz}] = diag[0,J_{1},J_{1}]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2 = diag[J_{2xx},J_{2yy},J_{2zz}] = diag[0,J_{2},J_{2}]&lt;/math&gt;

Further simplifications are obtained by making the following substitutions. The
total moment of inertia of Arm 1 about the pivot point (using the parallel axis
theorem) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_1} = J_1 +m_1l_1^2&lt;/math&gt;. The total moment of inertia of Arm 2 about its pivot
point is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_2} = J_2 +m_2l_2^2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, define the total moment of inertia the motor
rotor experiences when the pendulum (Arm 2) is in its equilibrium position
(hanging vertically down), &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_0} = \hat{J}_1 +m_2L_1^2 =  J_1 +m_1l_1^2 + m_2L_1^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the previous definitions into the governing DEs gives the more
compact form

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 \left(\hat{J_0} + \hat{J_2}\sin^2(\theta_2) \right) 
+ \ddot{\theta}_2 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2) 
- m_2 L_1 l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \dot{\theta}_2^2 
+\dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \sin(2 \theta_2)\hat{J_2} 
+b_1 \dot{\theta}_1
= \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
+\ddot{\theta}_2 \hat{J_2}
- 1/2 \dot{\theta}_1^2 \sin(2 \theta_2) \hat{J_2} 
+b_2 \dot{\theta}_2
+g m_2 l_2 \sin(\theta_2)
= \tau_2&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

The company (under the original name Go2Arena) was established in 2010 by Bartosz Skwarczek and Dawid Rożek in [[Rzeszów]], [[Poland]] as an online game retailer. G2A.COM's main demographic was young gamers with a lack of disposable income, so its objective became to sell video games at the lowest possible price. Skwarczek said that he had approached many large game developers at various events such as [[Gamescom]], [[E3]] and [[G-Star]] to secure partnership deals in order to become an official seller of their games. Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as variations in market trends, the company’s business model changed from retailer to marketplace.&lt;ref name="g2a-history"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=8 January 2016|date=3 January 2016|title=The Early History of G2A|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-early-history-of-g2a-563085251.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==

Starting in 2015, G2A began to focus on other projects and products outside of its digital gaming marketplace. In January 2015, G2A introduced its online payment gateway G2A PAY – a checkout solution for businesses which currently integrates over 200 global payment methods.&lt;ref name="g2a-pay2"&gt;{{cite web|title=G2A Pay|url=https://www.g2a.co/g2a-pay#items-row|publisher=[[G2A.COM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, G2A created its first virtual reality application G2A Land, a VR amusement park.

Until early 2018, the platform allowed 3D print designers to create their personal store, where they could sell their designs or offer them for free.&lt;ref name="g2a-3d2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott J Grunewald|access-date=3 November 2016|date=10 February 2016|title=The G2A 3D+ Project Brings 3D Printing and Video Games Together|url=https://3dprint.com/119181/g2a-3d-project-video-games/|website=3DPrint.com|publisher=3DPrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, G2A launched G2A Direct, a partnership program for video game developers and publishers.&lt;ref name="g2a-direct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://direct.g2a.com/|title=G2A Direct|publisher=[[G2A.COM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, G2A introduced two new projects – G2A Gear and Blunt Force. G2A Gear is an online shop which sells G2A branded clothing, as well as clothing and accessories with images and slogans from games, movies, TV shows, and comics. The company claims it will soon add items designed in partnership with gaming streamers and YouTubers to the store.&lt;ref name="g2a-gear"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gear.g2a.com/|title=G2A Gear|publisher=[[G2A.COM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 numbers show the platform has processed 22 million transactions throughout the entire G2A ecosystem, which is valued at $313 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.hbrp.pl/a/zachowalismy-energie-start-upu-w-duzej-firmie/D10Kntp71M | title = Zachowaliśmy energię start-upu w dużej firmie | first = Dawid | last = Rożek | date = August 2017 |publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with [[MWU 3D MODELS]] project, led by Assoc. Prof. Marcin Wiechec of the [[Jagiellonian University]], G2A is devising new methods in order to teach doctors how to better detect congenital heart issues among infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.g2a.co/newsroom/using-vr-to-save-lives-g2a-dev-studio-and-mwu-3d | title = Using VR to Save Lives| accessdate = September 15, 2017 | publisher=[[G2A.COM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

G2A began a partnership with Microsoft in 2017 that would utilize Azure cloud technology to help minimize the risk of potential fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.windowscentral.com/digital-marketplace-g2a-partners-microsoft-recommendation-and-fraud-protection-systems| title = Game marketplace G2A partners with Microsoft for recommendation and fraud protection systems| first = Asher | last = Madan | date = February 12, 2018 | work = [[Windows Central]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, G2A Dev Studio, a department responsible for VR projects, became an independent video game studio, Monad Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/02/g2a-com-forms-monad-rock-videogame-studio/|title=G2A.com Forms Monad Rock Videogame Studio|work=VRFocus|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/summer-funland/g2a-dev-studio-independent-monad-rock|title=G2A’s dev studio are going independent, and launching their first game|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2018/02/g2a-dev-studio-goes-independent-as-monad-rock/|title=G2A Dev Studio goes independent as Monad Rock|work=Capsule Computers|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.xtremegaminerd.com/g2a-dev-studio-goes-solo-for-the-first-time-launches-its-first-game/|title=G2A dev Studio goes solo for the first time, Launches its first Game|date=2018-02-20|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-02-19-g2a-developer-studio-spins-out-as-monrad-rock|title=G2A developer studio spins out as Monrad Rock|work=GamesIndustry.biz|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, a new product category was introduced to G2A Marketplace – electronics and merchandise tailored to gamers. In August 2018, the category was made available in seven European countries: Poland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Romania, the UK and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/g2a-electronics|title=G2A now provides electronics, hoping to become a “one-stop shop” for gaming|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://es.ign.com/g2a/137065/feature/el-futuro-de-g2a-es-la-inteligencia-artificial|title=El futuro de G2A es la inteligencia artificial|date=2018-08-01|work=IGN España|access-date=2018-09-04|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing activities ==

Throughout 2014 and 2015, G2A established partnerships with numerous eSports teams such as Cloud9, Natus Vincere, and Virtus Pro &lt;ref name="esport-sponsorship" /&gt; and has invested over 10 million USD in the industry to date.&lt;ref name="company-press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.g2a.co/press|title=G2A Approved Fact Sheet|access-date=5 November 2016|publisher=[[G2A.COM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, G2A partnered with Sporting Clube de Portugal, who had previously signed Portuguese FIFA player, Francisco Cruz.&lt;ref name="g2a-sporting"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Stubbs|access-date=2 December 2016|date=21 July 2016|title=Sporting Lisbon enters eSports with top Portuguese FIFA player|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/sporting-lisbon-enters-esports-with-top-portuguese-fifa-player/0170036|website=MCVUK.com|publisher=[[MCVUK]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220184505/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/sporting-lisbon-enters-esports-with-top-portuguese-fifa-player/0170036|archive-date=2016-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, G2A.COM became the title sponsor of the biggest Exhibition &amp; Congress Center in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland. The center, located next to Rzeszow International Airport, has been renamed G2A Arena&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rzeszow.wyborcza.pl/rzeszow/1,34962,21073079,centrum-wystawienniczo-kongresowe-ma-nowa-nazwe-to-teraz-g2a.html|title=Wyborcza.pl|website=rzeszow.wyborcza.pl|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gry.interia.pl/newsy/news-g2a-arena-nowoczesne-centrum-wystawiennicze-zyskalo-nowa-naz,nId,2317755|title=G2A Arena – nowoczesne centrum wystawiennicze zyskało nową nazwę|last=INTERIA.PL|access-date=2018-04-16|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

G2A, partnered with [[Bachir Boumaaza|Bachir "Athene" Boumaaza]], the creator of Gaming for Good, and created the Humanitarian Emergency All-Out Response Team (HEART).&lt;ref name="g2a-gaming-4-good"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medianet.com.au/releases/release-details/?id=851866|title=G2A, Together With Gaming for Good and Save the Children, Activate Gaming Community Avengers for Humanitarian Emergency All-Out Response Team (HEART) in Ethiopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both projects were designed to help and support children, charities and aid in disaster relief. G2A states that it has been working with Gaming for Good since 2013 and had previously partnered with Boumaaza in projects like Gamers got Hearts.

Between 2014–2015, G2A says that it raised over 500,000 USD for SaveTheChildren which was then amplified to five million USD.&lt;ref name="g2a-save-children"&gt;{{cite web|date=3 January 2016|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/g2acom-and-gaming-for-good-announcehumanitarian-emergency-all-out-response-teamheart-564066611.html|title=G2A.COM and Gaming for Good Announce: 'Humanitarian Emergency All-Out Response Team' (HEART)|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2015, multiple [[Twitch.tv]] streamers, [[YouTubers]], websites and gamers participated in a program dubbed #GamingTuesday&lt;ref name="g2a-gaming-tuesday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.9348217/k.8F18/Gaming_Tuesday.htm?msource=wekfrgty1115|title=Gaming Tuesdays|publisher=[[Save the Children]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to raise funds for the charity Save the Children.&lt;ref name="g2a-save-the-children"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=8rKLIXMGIpI4E&amp;b=9241341&amp;ct=14800493&amp;notoc=1|title=Gamers, Streamers and Vloggers Gear Up for Giving Tuesday to Give Back to Save the Children|publisher=[[Save the Children]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, G2A states that it participated in the Polish charity auction event, [[Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity|The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity Foundation]], and bought a {{convert|2.5|m|feet}} tall statue of the character [[Geralt of Rivia]] from the game ''The Witcher''.&lt;ref name="g2a-geralt-statue"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/witcher-home-g2a-com-office-221200380.html|title=The Witcher is at Home in the G2A.COM Office|publisher=[[Yahoo!

== Awards ==
In the first half of 2016, G2A won seven international awards in multiple categories including Customer Service, New Product and Virtual Reality.

In 2016, G2A was recognized at the Stevie Awards For Sales &amp; Customer Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://stevieawards.com/sales/2016-stevie%C2%AE-award-winners | title = 2016 Stevie Award Winners | date = March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, G2A received awards for Outstanding Fast-Growth Business, Outstanding Customer Service Team, Outstanding New Product / Service at the [[Global Business Excellence Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.gbeawards.com/previous-winners/ | title = Global Business Excellence Awards 2016 | date = November 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, G2A was presented with an award for Innovation in Customer Experience at the [[UK Financial Services Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/g2a-wins-uk-financial-services-award-2016-in-london-innovation-in-customer-experience-588194882.html | title = G2A Wins UK Financial Services Award 2016 in London | date = July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[eBay]] HK (Hong Kong) awarded G2A the Best Deal of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.g2a.co/newsroom/g2acom-wins-best-deal-of-the-year-award-from-ebay | title = G2A Presented Best Deal Award | accessdate = October 19, 2017 | |publisher=[[G2A.COM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
G2A has been subject to a number of controversies regarding the validity of the sources for its keys. Publishers and journalists consider G2A to be a [[grey market]]place for redemption keys, often allowing the reselling of keys purchased in one regional market at a much lower price into another region where the same game is priced much higher, a legal route but one that denies publishers some profit in the latter region. They also claim that as basically G2A acts as an intermediary for individuals selling their keys, keys bought with stolen credit cards are sold, ensuring cheap prices for these keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=[[Kotaku]]
| quote=It's cheaper because individuals are selling the keys, not Blizzard. But it also means you don't know where the keys came from. Did someone simply have an extra key, or did they use stolen credit cards to defraud a game developer? There’s no way to know, and unlike other prominent marketplaces, G2A doesn’t automatically provide consumers with insurance for their purchases}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

G2A had countered those claims, stating that their critics do not understand their business model, and have implemented programs like G2A Direct and G2A Shield to assure publishers still get a proper share of key resales and customers are protected from fake keys, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-04-20-g2a-were-not-a-grey-marketplace-people-just-dont-understand-our-business | title = G2A: "We're not a grey marketplace, people just don't understand our business" | first = Christopher | last = Dring | date = 20 April 2017 | accessdate = 20 April 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some game developers involved in the G2A Direct program claim that they only did so because they "couldn’t get G2A to take down the keys for (their) games that were already on sale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/20/15369924/g2a-heckled-reboot-developers-conference-croatia

| publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]
| quote=Polygon reached out to many of those developers involved in the G2A Direct program. It's a partnership that allows developers to, among other things, keep a 10 percent portion of every game sold on the G2A marketplace regardless of its provenance. Most of those who answered our questions were lukewarm about the program, with one stating that the only reason he joined up was because he couldn’t get G2A to take down the keys for his games that were already on sale.
| accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, to further provide transparency in their business model in response to complaints, G2A started requiring all key resellers to disclose their identity and address, and require all purchasers to confirm their geolocation as to apply proper [[VAT]] taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/28/15886136/g2a-reselling-game-keys-again-anonymous-reseller-vat-fraud | title = G2A is back in the business of reselling game keys, announces changes to its marketplace | first=  Charlie | last = Hall | date = 28 June 2017 | accessdate = 29 June 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergei Klimov, the owner of the Lithuania studio behind ''[[Gremlins, Inc.]]'', Charlie Oscar, said that G2A itself is not a problem but instead the mismanagement of indie owners with their keys when they participate in game bundles or other programs that require them to generate a large number of keys, alongside the nature of economics between Eastern European companies and those in Western Europe and North America. Klimov said that just as retail boxes could sit in shelves, unsold, keys provided in bundles could remain unsold or unused, and that a site like G2A is inevitable to offload and resell those keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/g2a-mismanaging-keys | title="G2A is not evil," it's a symptom of indie devs mismanaging their keys | first = Kirk | last = McKEand | date = 22 January 2018 | accessdate = 22 January 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riot Games sponsorship ban ===
[[Riot Games]], developer of [[League of Legends]], banned G2A from sponsoring teams during the [[2015 League of Legends World Championship]]. Riot believed the keys sold on G2A were illegally obtained and made further claims that G2A was selling fully leveled accounts, which breached Riot's terms of service.&lt;ref name="g2a-riot-ban"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Pulliam-Moore|date=7 October 2015|url=http://fusion.net/story/210610/riot-games-bans-g2a-from-leage-of-legends-championship/|title=Riot Games has banned G2A from sponsoring teams in the 2015 League of Legends World Championships|publisher=[[Fusion.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G2A replied that it had tried hard to find a "win-win" situation in order to resolve the issues with Riot Games and had banned accounts selling Elo-boosted League of Legends accounts, which was a key factor behind the ban. G2A claimed that Riot did not cooperate with it in its attempts to fix the issue and Riot instead made further demands such as banning the sale of [[strategy guide|game guides]] on G2A’s marketplace.&lt;ref name="g2a-riot-ban2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Chalk|date=9 October 2015|access-date=8 January 2016|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/g2a-calls-league-of-legends-sponsorship-ban-an-aggressive-attack/|title=G2A calls League of Legends sponsorship ban "an aggressive attack"|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INTZ’s Tockers Gabriel 'Tockers' Claumann, was later fined over 1,000 USD at Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLoL) 2016, for wearing a shirt with the G2A website logo on the shoulder. Midway through the game, he was asked to apply masking tape over the logo and later told he would be fined.&lt;ref name="g2a-riot-ban3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Kent|date=19 February 2016|url=http://www.dexerto.com/news/2016/02/19/brazilian-lol-player-fined-for-g2a-logo/|title=Brazilian LoL Player Fined For G2A Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; G2A paid this fine, stating that "no e-sports organization should be punished so severely for wearing a G2A branded T shirt."&lt;ref name="g2a-riot-ban4"&gt;{{cite web|date=15 February 2016|url=https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/g2a-pays-young-gamers-fine-074300280.html|title=G2A Pays Young Gamer's Fine for Banned Logo at e-sports Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLoL) 2016"|publisher=[[Yahoo!

=== tinyBuild allegation ===

In June 2016, CEO of [[tinyBuild]], Alex Nichiporchik, accused G2A of allowing key resellers to resell fraudulently-obtained game keys, costing the company 450,000 USD. G2A responded to tinyBuild's claims, stating that it offered to help to identify which keys had been fraudulently purchased as to determine which resellers had committed illegal chargebacks and remove them from G2A. G2A also questioned the 450,000 USD figure arrived at by tinyBuild, noting that its games had either been discounted several times on other sites or given away for free&lt;ref name="g2a-tinyBuild"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/tinyBuildGames/photos/a.282185895169276.73160.157128584341675/870117526376107/?type=3&amp;theater|title=The tinyBuild Summer Madness Giveaway|publisher=[[tinyBuild]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently felt the figure was inflated. tinyBuild added that in communication with G2A, the company felt it was being pressured to participate in G2A's payment platform, which would take some of the sales revenue back to G2A, in exchange for rooting out fraud on its platform.&lt;ref name="g2a-tinyBuild2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Hall|access-date=22 June 2016|date=22 June 2016|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/6/22/12002444/g2a-tinybuild-fraud-allegations-igda-update|title=As war of words between indie dev and reseller intensifies, IGDA distances itself|publisher=[[Polygon (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official G2A statement went on to say that it "gives full support to developers with prompt communication channels, uses advanced tools (exchanging blacklists, identifying suspicious merchants and auctions and 'KYC'-Know Your Customers procedures), and offers award-winning protection solutions with G2A Shield."&lt;ref name="g2a-tinyBuild3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.g2a.co/tinyBuild-fraud-allegation-g2a-statement|title=G2A.COM/tinyBuild STATEMENT|publisher=[[G2A.COM]]|access-date=2016-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119005046/https://www.g2a.co/tinyBuild-fraud-allegation-g2a-statement|archive-date=2017-01-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this debate, G2A announced strengthened front-end verification steps for its marketplace security which included social media profile and phone number verification, with further verification required after 10 or more products have been sold through one account&lt;ref name="g2a-direct3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole|date=8 July 2016|access-date=8 July 2016|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-08-game-key-reseller-g2a-moves-to-legitimise-its-business|title=Game key reseller G2A moves to legitimise its business|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while introducing its and publisher partnership program G2A Direct.&lt;ref name="g2a-direct4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole|access-date=28 June 2016|date=28 June 2016|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-28-g2a-to-give-developers-royalties-on-third-party-auctions|title=G2A to give developers royalties on third-party auctions|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gearbox partnership ===
On 3 April 2017, [[Gearbox Publishing]] announced a partnership with G2A.COM for exclusive collector’s editions of ''[[Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition]]'', to be created and sold by G2A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/295151/Gearbox_Publishing_and_G2ACOM_team_up_on_a_collectorrsquosedition_of_Bulletstorm_Full_Clip_Edition.php | title = 	Gearbox Publishing and G2A.COM team up on a collector’s edition of Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 3 April 2017 | accessdate = 6 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube game critic [[John 'TotalBiscuit' Bain|John "TotalBiscuit" Bain]]  was critical of this move, citing G2A’s negative press coverage as well as accusations made against the company, and threatened to withhold covering ''Bulletstorm'', or any other Gearbox game, unless Gearbox cancelled the deal.  On 6 April 2017, one day before ''Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition'' was due for release, Gearbox published a list of ultimatums made together with Bain for G2A to accept, or else it would back out of the deal. The ultimatums focused on G2A’s Shield service, an open API for game developers, and G2A’s payment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/295594/Gearbox_partners_with_G2A_then_vows_to_back_out_unless_G2A_takes_steps_to_fight_fraud.php | title =Gearbox partners with G2A, then vows to back out unless G2A takes steps to fight fraud | first= Alex | last = Wawro | date = 6 April 2017 | accessdate = 6 April 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Gearbox Publishing publicly announced that it is ending its cooperation with G2A, due to a lack of response from the company concerning the ultimatums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15223622/g2a-gearbox-bulletstorm-ultimatum-collectors-edition | title = G2A's relationship with Gearbox ends with the launch of Bulletstorm remake | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = April 7, 2017 | accessdate = April 7, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; G2A responded to the assertions on 10 April 2017 stating, "All of the requests made of G2A.COM in the ultimatum have in fact long been part of our marketplace", and ascribed the problems to the unfamiliarities that Bain and Gearbox have in regards to how G2A operates its marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-10-g2a-responds-to-gearboxs-withdrawal-and-totalbiscuits-demands | title = G2A responds to Gearbox's withdrawal and TotalBiscuit's demands | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef |  date = April 10, 2017 | accessdate = April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grasshopper''' is a [[visual programming language]] and environment developed by David Rutten at Robert McNeel &amp; Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Tedeschi | first = Arturo | title = Intervista a David Rutten | newspaper = MixExperience Tools1 | location =  Naples, Italy | pages = 28–29 | language = Italian, English | publisher = MixExperience | date = January 2011 | url = http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1qies/mixexperiencetoolsnu/resources/28.htm | accessdate = February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that runs within the [[Rhinoceros 3D]] [[computer-aided design|computer-aided design (CAD)]] application. Programs are created by dragging components onto a canvas.  The outputs to these components are then connected to the inputs of subsequent components.

Grasshopper is primarily used to build generative algorithms, such as for [[generative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Loomis  | first = Mark  | authorlink = | title = About Generative Design platforms by Mark Loomis   | publisher = Designplaygrounds | date = Dec 23, 2010  | url = http://designplaygrounds.com/deviants/about-generative-design-platforms-by-mark-loomis/ | format = Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Loomis | first = Mark | authorlink = | title = Rhino Grasshopper VS Generative Components  | publisher = Designplaygrounds  | date = Jan 10, 2011  | url = http://designplaygrounds.com/deviants/rhino-grasshopper-vs-generative-components/  | format = Blog  | accessdate = Feb 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Grasshopper's components create 3D geometry.&lt;ref group=ex name=ex01&gt;{{cite book |title=A sample of grasshopper generated forms  |last=Akos  |first=Gil  |last2=Parsons  |first2=Ronnie | publisher = StudioMode Beta   | url = http://studiomode.nu/  | format = Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs may also contain other types of algorithms including numeric, textual,&lt;ref group=ex name=ex02&gt;A list of functions to link to datastreams containing numbers and text information {{Cite web  | last = Fraguada  | first = Luis | authorlink = | title =  LaN co-director  | url = http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ghowl  }}&lt;/ref&gt; audio-visual&lt;ref group=ex name=ex03&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = Kudless | last = Andrew  | booktitle = Biodynamic Structures Workshop |title=Biodigital Architecture Master |pages =[https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/biodynamicstructures/ photos] |publisher = AA San Francisco Visiting School  | date = July 2011  | location = California College of the Arts, San Francisco  | url = http://sanfrancisco.aaschool.ac.uk/  | accessdate = Feb 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and haptic applications.&lt;ref group=ex name=ex04&gt;{{Citation  | last = Payne  | first=Andrew |title=Using a WII Nunchuck to Control Grasshopper |url = http://www.liftarchitects.com/journal/2009/9/8/using-a-wii-nunchuck-to-control-grasshopper.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User Interface==
[[File:Grasshopper FindGUI.png|thumb|200px|The Find Dialog displaying metaball outlines around search results]]
Grasshopper features an advanced [[user interface]]. The main window consist mainly of the component 'palettes' and the 'canvas'. Since Grasshopper is a plug-in to [[Rhinoceros 3D]], the layout of the main window is kept minimal.

GUI elements include:
*'''[[Palette window|Component Palettes]]''' - All installed commands appear within component palettes, with each group of commands in one tab. Additional component palettes may be installed with various grasshopper add-ons. Commands are dragged out of these palettes onto the canvas.
*'''[[Node (computer science)|Node Based Editor]]''' - Programs are edited in grasshopper using a node-based interface. Components are dragged out of palettes, and placed onto the canvas. Each component node represents a certain function, with input and output pins. Pins can be interconnected to form programs.
*'''[[Zooming User Interface]]''' - Some objects drawn on the canvas adjust their display based on the zoom-level. This results in a less detailed view when zoomed out and additional information when zoomed in.
*'''[[Search algorithm|Find Dialog]]''' - The search function lists both exact and similar matches. The Find dialog provides both textual and spatial feedback regarding the search hits. Objects are highlighted on the canvas by a Metaball outline and arrows on the dialog point towards the location of the search results.
*'''[[color picker|Color Picker]]''' - The in-built color picker supports and displays color values and transparency values.
*'''Command Prediction''' - A [[Markov chain]] database is maintained of all the add actions of the user. This enables Grasshopper to predict with a reasonable level of accuracy which command(s) will be called upon next.
*'''[[Multiple document interface|Multi Document Interface]]''' - The multiple document interface menu contains small preview images of the documents currently open
*'''Recently Used Documents''' - The MRU menu maintains not just a large collection of previously used documents, but also checks each file for availability. Files which are no longer present on the system are shown greyed out. In addition, the history of the MRU is categorized into distinct period such as "Just Now", "Today", "Thursday" and "Last Week".

==Node based editor==
The main interface for algorithm design in Grasshopper is the node-based editor. Data is passed from component to component via connecting wires which always connect an output grip with an input grip. Data can either be defined locally as a constant, or it can be imported from the Rhino document or a file on the computer. Data is always stored in parameters, which can either be free-floating or attached to a component as input and outputs objects.

[[File:Grasshopper NodeBasedSubtraction.png]]

In the image above we see three free-floating parameters that are hooked up to a subtraction component. The two yellow boxes on the left both define a set of numeric constants. The top-most panel contains four integers (6, 7, 8 and 12) while the bottom-most panel contains only a single value. These floating parameters supply the subtraction component with input data, which results in four output values (6-5=1, 7-5=2, 8-5=3 and 12-5=7). The same result can be achieved using textual expressions and an evaluator component. In this fashion Grasshopper allows users to combine both visual and textual programming within the same environment.

'''GreenZap''' was an online buying and spending account service that claimed to compete with [[PayPal]]. GreenZap launched on April 2, 2005 and allowed members to send and receive money online, through their email address. The ultimate beneficial owner of GreenZap was reported to be Damon Westmoreland, who was reportedly associated with ThePayline.com,&lt;ref name="platinax"&gt;Platinax, [http://www.internetbusiness.co.uk/14022007/greenzap-claims-its-not-a-scam/ Greenzap claims it's not a scam], Feb 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a widespread Internet financial pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;security.itworld.com, [http://security.itworld.com/4337/IWD010402oplivingston/page_1.html Postal authorities seize ThePayLine.com cash flow], April 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Another report stated that the ownership of GreenZap was unclear because the company was not registered to do business in [[California]], where its mailing address was located in a postal box within a grocery store, and because the company's official phone number was a [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The '''H-Prize program''' is a series of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] intended to encourage research into the use of [[hydrogen]] as an [[energy carrier]] in a [[hydrogen economy]]. The program is sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and administered by the Hydrogen Education Foundation. In 2014, an H-Prize competition was launched to develop a small-scale hydrogen generation and refueling station for hydrogen [[fuel cell electric vehicle]]s. The prize, named the H2 Refuel H-Prize and worth $1 million, was awarded in January 2017, to the consortium "SimpleFuel". 

==Creation==
Legislation for the prize, introduced by Rep. [[Bob Inglis]], passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] in May 2006 as {{USBill|109|H.R.|5143}},&lt;ref&gt;[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060602094041/http://www.house.gov/science/press/109/109-257.htm "House Overwhelmingly Passes Inglis H-Prize Bill"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not receive a vote in the [[United States Senate]]. After being reintroduced by Rep. [[Dan Lipinski]] at the beginning of a new term in January 2007, it was eventually folded into the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was then signed into law in December 2007.

The bill [[authorization bill|authorized]] $50 million in prize money, for the period from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. However, in order to be spent, these funds must also be included in Congress's annual [[appropriation bill]]s. The law provides for three categories of prizes:

*Four prizes of up to $1 million, awarded every two years for advances in hydrogen production, storage, distribution and utilization;
*One prize of up to $4 million, awarded two years to working prototypes of hydrogen vehicles which meet ambitious performance goals; and
*A $10 million grand prize, awarded only once during the program for a major technological breakthrough.

In October 2008, the [[Hydrogen Education Foundation]] of Washington, D.C. was selected to administer the H-Prize along with [[South Carolina Research Authority|SCRA]], a South Carolina research foundation.

== Prizes ==
In August 2009, the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] (EERE) of the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1 million prize for innovative [[hydrogen storage]] materials which would be awarded in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2009/08/26/E9-20552/initial-h-prize-competition-for-breakthrough-advances-in-materials-for-hydrogen-storage|title=Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 164 / Wednesday, August 26, 2009 / Notices|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prize was never awarded as no competitor met the competition requirements.

In March 2014, EERE announced plans for a $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, and the Prize competition was launched in October 2014. The competition focused on developing small hydrogen refueling stations that can generate hydrogen from electricity or natural gas and dispense it to vehicles at least 1 kg at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/eere/articles/interested-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-help-shape-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Interested in Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies?

SimpleFuel was a consortium of three companies, PDC Machines, Ivys, Inc, and McPhy Energy North America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/energy-department-announces-simplefuel-winner-1-million-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Energy Department Announces SimpleFuel Winner of the $1 Million H2 Refuel H-Prize | publisher=[[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] | date=19 January 2017 | accessdate=23 January 2018 | author=Sunita Satyapal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists''' is the international professional association of people and institutions who are professionally involved in creating, capturing, accessing, or disseminating information and knowledge concerning agriculture and rural development. See list of [[List of library associations|similar professional associations]].

IAALD acts as a community of practice, linking and connecting information professionals worldwide. It convenes conferences and meetings, publishes a peer-reviewed journal, sponsors professional training and education, facilities e-discussions, and publishes a web site, blog, etc. It works through a network of country and regional chapters; cooperating with independent 'sister' regional and specialist associations such as [http://www.aibda.com/portal/ AIBDA], [http://jaald.ac.affrc.go.jp JAALD], and [http://usain.org/ USAIN].

IAALD collaborates with organizations like the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), the [[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU]] (CTA), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[United States National Agricultural Library]] (NAL) and other leading agricultural research and knowledge institutes.

Over the years IAALD has held twelve world congresses and thirty-three regional conferences on six of the seven continents. The most recent was in [http://afita.ac.affrc.go.jp/wcca2008/index.htm Japan] in 2008; the next will be in [http://iaald2010.agropolis.fr/ France] in 2010. The [http://www.iaald-africa.org/ IAALD Africa Chapter] held its second regional conference in Ghana in July 2009.

IAALD publications include A Primer for Agricultural Libraries (2 editions), Current Agricultural Serials, World Directory of Agricultural Libraries and Documentation Centres, Agricultural Resource Centers: A World Directory (3 editions), as well as newsletters and training aids. 

IAALD was established in 1955 as the International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists - hence the acronym.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1320">An '''ion drift meter''' is a device used to measure the velocity of individual [[ions]] in the area of a [[spacecraft]]. This information can then be used to calculate the ion drift in the space surrounding the instrument as well as the strength of any electric field present, provided that the magnetic field strength has been determined using a [[magnetometer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://utd500.utdallas.edu/DE2_DATA.html DYNAMICS EXPLORER 2, Retarding Potential Analyzer and Ion Drift Meter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amptek.com/didm.html Digital Ion Drift Meter (DIDM)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The device itself works by allowing ions to pass through an opening at the front of the instrument and measuring the currents produced by the impacts of ions in different locations on a grid at the back. The trajectories of the ions can then be determined. 

Ion drift meters have been used on several spacecraft including [[Dynamics Explorer]] and [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]], and will be on board the forthcoming [[Ionospheric Connection Explorer]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUSMSM41C..12C The Digital Ion Drift-Meter on CHAMP; Status, Calibration, and Data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kansei engineering''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 感性工学 ''kansei kougaku'', emotional or affective engineering) aims at the development or improvement of products and services by translating the customer's [[Sensibility|psychological feelings and needs]] into the domain of product design (i.e. parameters). It was founded by [[Mitsuo Nagamachi]], Professor Emeritus of [[Hiroshima University]] (also former Dean of [[Hiroshima International University]] and CEO of [[International Kansei Design Institute]]).  Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.

It has now been adopted as one of the topics for [[professional development]] by the [[Royal Statistical Society]].

==Introduction==
{{essay-like|date=January 2018}}
Product design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened [[product lifecycle]], development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as [[brand image]], reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers has started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.

This demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as "[[emotional design]]" or "affective engineering".

== History ==

Nowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.

Methods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of [[ergonomics]] (human factor engineering ){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.

In the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. [[Charles E. Osgood]] developed his [[semantic differential]] method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and [[Yoji Akao]] developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called [[quality function deployment]] (QFD). Another method, the [[Kano model]], was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]], of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is [[Conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]]. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.

Although all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.

==Procedure ==

As mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.

According to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:
# How to accurately understand consumer Kansei
# How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design
# How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design

== A model on methodology ==

In Japanese publications{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Schütte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.

; Choice of Domain
''Domain'' in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Schütte in detail in a couple of publications.

; Span the Semantic Space
The expression ''Semantic Space'' was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called "Kansei words" or "Kansei Engineering words".

; Span the Space of Properties
The next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.
The collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.
Synthesis
In the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.

; Synthesis
The research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :

* Category Identification
* Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I
* Rough Sets Theory
* Genetic Algorithm
* Fuzzy Sets Theory

; Model building and Test of Validity
After doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.
The process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.

==Software tools==
Kansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.
In order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.
User consoles

== Software ==

As described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Linköping University in Sweden ([http://www.kanseiengineering.net www.kanseiengineering.net]). The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data

Another software package (Kn6) was developed at the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] in Spain.

Both software packages improve the collection and evalutation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.

== Biography ==
Richards was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and grew up in [[Orono, Maine]]. He received his bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Maine]] (1968). While serving as a pilot in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], he earned master's degrees in [[Aeronautics|aeronautical systems]] from the [[University of West Florida]] (1970) and [[Master of Business Administration|business administration]] from [[Mississippi State University]] (1974). He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[operations research]] from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1980). Notable accomplishments included: Founding Chair of the Department of Engineering Management at [[Old Dominion University]] (1984–97);&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iue.edu/mediarelations/iu-east-interim-leader-richards-makes-career-of-mixing-scholarship-with-administrative-assignments/|title=IU East interim leader Richards makes career of mixing scholarship with administrative assignments {{!}} Media Relations|website=www.iue.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; founding Executive Director of the Center for Commercial Space Infrastructure (1992–95), which subsequently morphed into the [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport|Virginia Space Flight Center]] and commercial spaceport on [[Wallops Island]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/col-dept/eng/docs/odu-engineering-50.pdf|title=Built From the Ground Up: The First 50 Years of Engineering at Old Dominion University|last=O' Hallarn|first=Brendan|date=|website=|page=68|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/w/wallopsisland.html|title=Wallops Island|website=www.astronautix.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the School of [[Management]] and [[Aviation|Aviation Science]] (1997-2004) at [[Bridgewater State University]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=Fall 1997|title=Bridgewater State College|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=br_mag|journal=Bridgewater Magazine|volume=8:1|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; inaugural Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (2004–15) and Interim [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] (2012–13) at [[Indiana University East]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news-archive/22410.html|title=Larry Richards named interim chancellor at IU East|last=|first=|date=|website=newsinfo.iu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iue.edu/people/bio/bio.php?bio=laudrich|title=Faculty Profiles - Faculty &amp; Staff - Indiana University East|website=www.iue.edu|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, Interim Vice Chancellor &amp; Dean for the [[Indiana University – Purdue University Columbus]] campus (2015–16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iue.edu/chancellor/previous_chancellors.php|title=Previous Chancellors - Office of the Chancellor - Indiana University East|website=www.iue.edu|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iupuc.edu/communications-marketing/News/Item/425/|title=Laurence D.

== Work ==
Richards' contributions can be sorted into three areas: (1) his development of constraint theory as an approach to the formulation of [[policy]] and technology [[Strategic thinking|strategy]]; (2) his advancement of the concepts associated with cybernetics as representing a new and powerful way of thinking; and (3) his application of cybernetic ideas to the design of a [[Participatory democracy|participative-dialogic society]].

=== Constraint theory ===
In his book, ''Constraint Theory'', Richards proposed that, in addressing problems and issues in complex systems involving many participants, desires be treated as constraints rather than as [[goal]]s or objectives (as they are in traditional operations research problem formulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780819135131/Constraint-Theory-An-Approach-to-Policy-Level-Modelling|title=Constraint-Theory-An-Approach-to-Policy-Level-Modelling}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research for [[NASA]], he applied constraint theory to the development of an approach for formulating policy on the selection of new [[Spaceflight|space transportation systems]], given the extreme uncertainty in the technologies that will be available by the time a new system becomes operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Laurence D.|date=1996-12-01|title=Analysis of Robustness in the Formulation of Technology Strategy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1996.11414915|journal=Engineering Management Journal|volume=8|issue=4|pages=21–32|doi=10.1080/10429247.1996.11414915|issn=1042-9247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cybernetics ===
Richards recognized a unique potential in the cybernetic version of [[systems thinking]] for addressing complex behavioral and social phenomena. He focused on the ideas of [[hierarchy]], purpose and belief to highlight differences between the process-oriented thinking of cybernetics and, for example, [[Holism|whole systems]] thinking, [[Teleology|teleological or purposeful systems]] thinking, and [[Ideology|ideological systems]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larry|first=Richards,|title=Idea avoidance: reflections on a conference and its language|url=https://www.academia.edu/3708782/Idea_Avoidance_Reflections_on_a_Conference_and_Its_Language|journal=Kybernetes|language=en|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that: (1) cybernetics be treated as a way of thinking about ways of thinking (of which it – cybernetics – is one), making the way of thinking a choice; and, (2) the [[Cyberneticist|cybernetician]] be treated as a craftsperson in and with time, merging art, science and design.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Designing (a) society ===
Since its inception in 1992, Richards was a guest at the School for Designing a Society in [[Urbana, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designingasociety.org/about/organizers/|title=School for Designing a Society :: Organizers and Presenters|website=www.designingasociety.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A premise of the school was that social change can be realized in a transformation from the current to a new society (a change of system), not only in improvements to the current society (changes in a system). Richards saw in the cybernetic concept of [[Conversation theory|conversation]] a particular dialogic with special relevance to processes of design and participation; from this, he created an idea for a participative-dialogic society, a society without violence or at least one where violence is the alternative of last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Larry|title=Beyond Planning: Technological Support for a Desirable Society|url=https://www.academia.edu/3708880/Beyond_Planning_Technological_Support_for_a_Desirable_Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, he argued, would require a change of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Larry|title=Difference-making from a Cybernetic Perspective: The Role of Listening and Its Circularities|url=https://www.academia.edu/3708693/Difference-making_from_a_Cybernetic_Perspective_The_Role_of_Listening_and_Its_Circularities|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
In 2002, Richards was elected a Fellow of the American Society for Engineering Management (#33) and was awarded the Norbert Wiener Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/organization/awards/Richards.pdf|title=The Wiener Gold Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics|last=|first=|date=|website=American Society for Cybernetics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be included, the outage must conform to these criteria:
#The shortage must not be planned by the service provider.
#The shortage must affect at least 1,000 people ''and'' last at least one hour.
#There must be at least 1,000,000 person*customer hours of disruption.

In other words:
* 1,000 people affected for 1,000 hours (42 days) minimum, but if fewer than 1,000 people, event would not be included (regardless of duration)
* One million people affected for a minimum of one hour, but if duration is less than one hour, event would not be included (regardless of number of people)
* For example, 10,000 people affected for 100 hours ''or'' 100,000 for 10 hours would be included

The '''Ministry of Information''' is the ministry in charge of [[Mass media|media]] and [[information]] in [[Egypt]]. 

==History and profile==
The ministry was established in 1982 and it is the successor of the ministry of national guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toby Mendel|title=Political and Media Transitions in Egypt|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/Egypt/Internews_Egypt_MediaLawReview_Aug11.pdf|work=Internews|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its foundation the ministry of culture and information also dealt with the duties later held by it.&lt;ref name=man1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9244">'''Model-based enterprise''' (MBE) is a term used in manufacturing, to describe a strategy where an annotated digital three-dimensional (3D) [[3D modeling#Models|model]] of a product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in that [[Product lifecycle|product's lifecycle]].&lt;ref name=NIST1753&gt;[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1753.pdf "Model Based Enterprise / Technical Data Package Summit Report"]. NIST Technical Note 1753. Retrieved 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Isha|title=3D Product &amp; Manufacturing Information Implications for Design for Manufacturing|url=https://www.pddnet.com/article/2016/03/3d-product-manufacturing-information-implications-design-manufacturing|website=Product Design and Development|publisher=Advantage Business Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage of MBE is that it replaces 2D drawings. In MBE, a single 3D model contains all the information typically found on in an entire set of engineering drawings, including geometry, topology, dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, and weld call-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Chad|title=The Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Study|url=http://www.lifecycleinsights.com/study/the-model-based-enterprise-mbe-study/|website=Lifecycle Insights|publisher=Lifecycle Insights|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBE was originally championed by the aerospace and defense industries, with the automotive industry following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Scott|title=Model Based Enterprise|url=http://www.aiag.org/quality/model-based-enterprise/model-based-enterprise|website=aiag|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adopted by many manufacturers around the world, in a wide range of industries. Significant benefits for manufacturers include reduced time to market and savings in production costs from improved tool design and fabrication, fewer overall assembly hours, less rework, streamlined development and better collaboration on engineering changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Model-based enterprise|url=http://searchmanufacturingerp.techtarget.com/definition/model-based-enterprise|website=TechTarget|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two prerequisites to implementing MBE: The first is the creation of annotated 3D models, known as a [[Model-based definition|Model-based definitions (MBD)]]. This requires the use of a [[Computer aided design|CAD]] system capable of creating precise [[Solid modeling|solid models]], with [[Product and manufacturing information|product and manufacturing information (PMI)]], a form of 3D annotation which may include dimensions, [[Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing|GD&amp;T]], notes, surface finish, and material specifications. (The mechanical CAD systems used in aerospace, defense, and automotive industries generally have these capabilities.) The second prerequisite is transforming MBDs into a form where they can be used in downstream lifecycle activities. As a rule, CAD models are stored in proprietary data formats, so they must be translated to a suitable MBD-compatible standard format, such as 3D [[PDF]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dpdfconsortium.org/ 3D PDF Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; [[JT (visualization format)|JT]], [[ISO 10303|STEP AP 242]], or [[ANSI]] QIF&lt;ref&gt;[http://qifstandards.org "Quality Information Framework"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The core MBE tenet is that models are used to drive all aspects of the product lifecycle and that data is created once and reused by all downstream data consumers. Data reusability requires [[Machine-Readable Documents|computer interpretability]], where an MBD can be processed directly by downstream applications, and associativity of PMI to specific model features within the MBD.&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt;

==History==

Historically, engineering and manufacturing activities have relied on hardcopy and/or digital documents (including 2D [[Engineering drawing|drawings]]) to convey engineering data and drive manufacturing processes. These documents required interpretation by skilled practitioners, often leading to ambiguities and errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ambiguity in drawing| url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/sota/tracey/journal/ambi/images/Willats.pdf|author=John Willats|publisher=TRACEY the online journal of contemporary drawing research |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tandler|first1=Bill|title=GD&amp;T Workshop: A Top Down View|url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/88676-gd-t-workshop-a-top-down-view|website=Quality Magazine|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, improvements in 3D [[solid modeling]] made it possible for CAD systems to precisely represent the shape of most manufactured goods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weisberg, David|title=The Engineering Design Revolution|url=http://www.cadhistory.net/16%20Parametric%20Technology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—however, even enthusiastic adopters of solid modeling technology continued to rely upon 2D drawings (often CAD generated) as the authority (or master) product representation. 3D models, even if geometrically accurate, lacked a method to represent dimensions, tolerances, and other annotative information required to drive manufacturing processes.

In the early-to-middle 2000s, the [[ASME Y14.41-2003| ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16792:2006 Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/31065.html|publisher=ISO TC 10 Technical product documentation |accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; standards were released, providing support for PMI annotations in 3D CAD models, and introducing the concept of MBD (or, alternatively, digital product definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Quality Assurance Standard For Digital Product Definition At Boeing Suppliers |url= http://www.boeingsuppliers.com/supplier/D6-51991.pdf|publisher=Boeing D6-51991|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model-based enterprise concept first appeared about 2005. Initially it was construed broadly, referring to the pervasive use of modeling and simulation technologies (of almost any type) throughout an enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Richard, [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2005/systems/wednesday/neal.pdf "Next Generation Manufacturing Technology Initiative and the Model-Based Enterprise"], NDIA Systems Engineering Conference, San Diego, California October 26, 2005. Retrieved on 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s, An active community advocating development of MBE grew, based on the collaborative efforts of the Office of the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Army Research Laboratory]], [[ARDEC|Armament Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC)]], [http://www.armymantech.com/ Army ManTech], [[BAE Systems]], [[NIST]], and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leonarf|first1=Scott|title=Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Strategic Baseline|url=https://www.dodmantech.com/JDMTP/Files/AME_Strategic_Baseline_03_Nov_11.pdf|website=DoD ManTech|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "MBE Team" included industry participants such as [[General Dynamics]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] [[Rocketdyne]], Elysium, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], EOS, ITI TranscenData, Vistagy, [[PTC (software company)|PTC]], [[Dassault Systemes]] Delmia, [[Boeing]], and [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref name=osd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittenburg|first1=Mitzi|title=Model Based Enterprise and its Impact on Small Businesses|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/councils/marc/resources/201103-model-based-enterprise.pdf|website=osd.mil|publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, based on community feedback, MBE became more narrowly construed, referring to the use of MBD data to drive product lifecycle activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frechette|first1=S|title=Model Based Enterprise for Manufacturing|url=http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=908343|website=NIST|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt; In 2011, the MBE Team published these definitions:

* MBD: A 3D annotated model and its associated data elements that fully define the product definition in a manner that can be used effectively by all downstream customers in place of a traditional drawing.
* MBE: A fully integrated and collaborative environment founded on 3D product definition detail and shared across the enterprise; to enable rapid, seamless, and affordable deployment of products from concept to disposal&lt;ref name=osd /&gt;

By 2015, with improvements to ASME Y14.41 and ISO 16792, and the development of open [[CAD data exchange]] standards capable of adequately representing PMI, MBE started to become more widely adopted by manufacturers.

'''Oliver Garfield Haywood, Jr.,''' (29 November 1911 – 25 May 2002) was a [[United States Army]] officer during [[World War II]] who served with the [[Manhattan Project]]. He transferred to the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947. After retiring from active duty in 1953, he became President and chief executive officer, and later chairman, of Huyck Corporation.

==Early life and career==
Oliver Garfield Haywood, Jr., was born in [[Highland Mills, New York]] on 29 November 1911. He entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] on 1 July 1932, and graduated top of the class of 1936 on 12 June 1936. His class included [[Bruce Palmer, Jr.]], who graduated sixth. Haywood was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], and was posted to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], as executive officer of the [[Waterways Experiment Station]]. In June 1937, went to [[Conchas Dam]] in New Mexico as assistant to the District Engineer,&lt;ref name="Cullum 1940"&gt;{{cite book

On 25 September 1938, Haywood entered [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as a student officer. While there he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on 12 June 1939. On 25 September 1939, he also became a graduate student at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|Graduate School of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Cullum 1940"/&gt; He received his [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree from Harvard on 20 June 1940, and his [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc) degree from MIT on 15 August. He was promoted to captain on 15 September.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt;

==World War II==
Haywood assumed command of Company C, [[27th Engineer Battalion (United States)|27th Engineer Battalion]] in [[Puerto Rico]] on 13 September 1940. He then commanded the 130th Engineer Battalion there from 16 April 1941 until 31 December 1941. On 1 January 1942, he became executive officer of the 78th Engineers there. He was promoted to major in the wartime [[Army of the United States]] on 1 February 1942. He attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], from November 1942 to February 1943, before returning to Puerto Rico for duty on the staff of the Antilles Department. He was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] on 14 February 1943.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"&gt;{{cite book

In October 1943, Haywood was assigned to the G-1 (Personnel) Division of the [[War Department General Staff]] in Washington, D.C. For his services in this role, he was promoted to [[colonel]] on 28 September 1944, and was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. On 5 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-1) at headquarters, [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO). For his services during the [[demobilization]], he was awarded a second Legion of Merit.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt;

==After the war==
[[File:Los Alamos colloquium.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Haywood (left) at a 1946 [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] colloquium on the [[Hydrogen bomb]]]]
Haywood was transferred to the headquarters of the [[Manhattan Project]] on 12 April 1946.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt; He was one of a number West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes who were transferred to the Manhattan Project at this time by the [[Secretary of War]], [[Robert P. Patterson]], at the request of the Manhattan Project's commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], and over the objection of senior Army leaders. Their job was to replace reservists who had worked for the Project during the war and now were eligible for separation from the Army.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=373–376}} Haywood participated in [[Operation Crossroads|Operation ''Crossroads'']], observing the [[nuclear test]]s at [[Bikini Atoll]].&lt;ref name="MPVA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/MPVA_16.htm#haywood |publisher=Manhattan Project veterans archives |title=Haywood, Oliver G. |accessdate=27 July 2013 |dead-url=usurped |archive-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501174940/http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/MPVA_16.htm#haywood |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves hoped that a new, permanent agency would soon be created to take over the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project, but passage of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=389–391}} The act that was finally signed by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=394–395}} At this point, Haywood was seconded to the AEC's Directorate of Research.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt;

Although he had been a colonel in the Army of the United States, Haywood only held the substantive rank of captain in the Army Corps of Engineers. His Army of the United States rank was terminated on 30 June 1947, and he returned to duty with the War Department General Staff as a captain on 1 July 1947. Haywood elected to transfer to the newly created [[United States Air Force]] on 10 December 1947. He became a lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1948, and was assigned to the Air Plans Division on 29 August 1948,.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt; where he was involved in drawing up nuclear war plans.&lt;ref name="MPVA"/&gt; From July 1949 to May 1950 he attended the [[Air War College]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], Alabama.&lt;ref name="Cullum 1950"/&gt;

Haywood was seconded to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico from February 1950 to October 1951, at a time when the first [[thermonuclear weapon]]s were being developed. [[Edward Teller]] once remarked that "Colonel Haywood is the only military man I would work for."&lt;ref name="MPVA2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/More/16-04_haywood.htm |publisher=Manhattan Project veterans archives |title=Haywood, Oliver G. – More Info |accessdate=27 July 2013 |dead-url=usurped |archive-date=2013-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521004655/http://www.mphpa.org/classic/VET_ARCHIVES/More/16-04_haywood.htm |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood then served at the chief of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research,&lt;ref name="MPVA"/&gt; and was vice commander of the [[Atlantic Missile Range]] until his retirement from active duty in 1953. He remained with the [[Air Force Reserve]], retiring with the rank of [[brigadier general]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="West Point"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westpointaog.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=1226 |title=Brigadier General Oliver Garfield Haywood Class of 1936 |publisher=West Point Alumni Association |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After leaving the Air Force, Haywood became the President and chief executive officer, and later the chairman of the board of Huyck Corporation in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. He was also chairman and acting president of the [[Hudson Institute]] in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Harvard magazine |date=September–October 2002 |url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=388550142&amp;page_url=//www.harvard-magazine.com/on-line/0902177.html&amp;page_last_updated=2003-02-01T12:00:19&amp;firstName=O.G.&amp;lastName=Haywood |title=Obituaries |issn=0095-2427 |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haywood died in [[Vero Beach, Florida]], on 25 May 2002.&lt;ref name="West Point"/&gt; He was survived by his daughters, Barbara and Betty, and sons, Richard and Robert. His wife, Helen, had predeceased him.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

In the book, Cravens, a skeptic about nuclear energy who actively protested the plan to open [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant]] on [[Long Island]], [[New_York_(state)|New York]], has a conversation about nuclear power while visiting friends in [[Albuquerque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reiss|first1=Spencer|title=Green With (Nuclear) Energy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119551341776798449|website=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]]|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, Dr. Richard (Rip) Anderson, a scientist at [[Sandia National Laboratories]], listens to her beliefs about how deadly nuclear plants are and gently suggests that she is not quite correct by describing how nuclear power actually works. After more discussions, Anderson suggests that accompanies him and his wife on a tour of the [[United States]] visiting power plants, [[United_States_Department_of_Energy_national_laboratories|national laboratories]] and the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Stephen J. Dubner|Dubner, Stephen J.]]|title=Do Not Read This If You Are Anti-Nuclear Energy|url=http://freakonomics.com/2007/11/21/do-not-read-this-if-you-are-anti-nuclear-energy/|website=Freakonomics®|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cravens, after interviewing leading [[researchers]], [[engineers]], and experts in the fields of [[nuclear fission]] and [[radiation]], [[public health]], [[counterterrorism]], and [[risk assessment]], concludes that nuclear power is clean and safe. Exploration of the issues from multiple points of view and her own observations reveal to her that nuclear fission as a power source is being economically and cleanly harnessed in the U.S. She finds that in countries like [[France]] and [[Sweden]], which both derive considerable energy from nuclear plants, the environment is far safer and cleaner than in those nations that continue to get most of their [[electricity ]]from burning fossil fuels. She learns that in the worldwide energy industry - including [[wind power|wind]] and [[solar energy|solar]] - nuclear power has by far the fewest deaths per [[terawatt-hour]] generated. She concludes that if we are to care for subsequent generations, embracing nuclear energy is an [[ethical]] imperative.

In [[industrial design]], '''preferred numbers''' (also called '''preferred values''' or '''preferred series''') are standard guidelines for choosing exact product dimensions within a given set of constraints. 
Product developers must choose numerous lengths, distances, diameters, volumes, and other characteristic [[quantities]]. While all of these choices are constrained by considerations of functionality, usability, compatibility, safety or cost, there usually remains considerable leeway in the ''exact'' choice for many dimensions.

Preferred numbers serve two purposes:
# Using them increases the probability of compatibility between objects designed at different times by different people. In other words, it is one tactic among many in [[standardization]], whether within a company or within an industry, and it is usually desirable in industrial contexts (unless the goal is [[vendor lock-in]] or [[planned obsolescence]])
# They are chosen such that when a product is manufactured in many different sizes, these will end up roughly equally spaced on a [[logarithmic scale]]. They therefore help to minimize the number of different sizes that need to be manufactured or kept in stock.

Preferred numbers represent preferences of simple numbers (such as 1, 2, and 5) multiplied by the powers of a convenient basis, usually 10.&lt;ref name="GOVPUB-C13"/&gt;

==Renard numbers==
{{Main|Renard series}}

In 1870 [[Charles Renard]] proposed a set of preferred numbers.&lt;ref name="Sizes_2014"/&gt; His system was adopted in 1952 as international standard [[ISO 3]].&lt;ref name="ISO_3_1973"/&gt; Renard's system divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps, leading to the R5, R10, R20 and R40 scales, respectively. The factor between two consecutive numbers in a [[Renard series]] is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a [[geometric sequence]]. This way, the maximum [[relative error]] is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10.

=={{anchor|1-2-5 series}} 1–2–5 series==
In applications for which the R5 series provides a too fine graduation, the 1–2–5 series
is sometimes used as a cruder alternative. It is effectively an R3 series rounded to one significant digit:

:… 0.1 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 …

This series covers a [[decade (log scale)|decade]] (1:10 ratio) in three steps. Adjacent values differ by factors 2 or 2.5. Unlike the Renard series, the 1–2–5 series has not been formally adopted as an [[international standard]]. However, the Renard series R10 can be used to extend the 1–2–5 series to a finer graduation.

This series is used to define the scales for graphs and for instruments that display in a two-dimensional form with a graticule, such as [[oscilloscope#Graticule|oscilloscopes]].

The [[denomination (currency)|denominations]] of most modern [[Currency|currencies]], notably the [[euro]] and [[British pound]], follow a 1–2–5 series. The United States and Canada follow the approximate 1–2–5 series 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 (cents), $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100. The {{1/4}}–{{1/2}}–1 series (… 0.1 0.25 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 …) is also used by currencies derived from the former [[Dutch gulden]] ([[Aruban florin]], [[Netherlands Antillean gulden]], [[Surinamese dollar]]), some Middle Eastern currencies ([[Iraqi dinar|Iraqi]] and [[Jordanian dinar|Jordanian]] dinars, [[Lebanese pound]], [[Syrian pound]]), and the [[Seychellois rupee]]. However, newer notes introduced in Lebanon and Syria due to inflation follow the standard 1–2–5 series instead.

==Convenient numbers==
{{Main|Convenient numbers}}

In the 1970s the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS) defined a set of convenient numbers to ease [[metrication in the United States]]. This system of metric values was described as [[#1–2–5 series|1–2–5 series]] in reverse, with assigned preferences for those numbers which are multiples of 5, 2, and 1 (plus their powers of 10), excluding linear dimensions above 100&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="GOVPUB-C13"/&gt;

==E-series==
{{Main|E-series of preferred numbers}}
The E-series is another system of preferred numbers. It consists of the [[E3 series (preferred numbers)|E3]], [[E6 series (preferred numbers)|E6]], [[E12 series (preferred numbers)|E12]], [[E24 series (preferred numbers)|E24]], [[E48 series (preferred numbers)|E48]], [[E96 series (preferred numbers)|E96]] and [[E192 series (preferred numbers)|E192]] series. Based on some of the existing manufacturing conventions, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) began work on a new international standard in 1948.&lt;ref name="IEC_60063_1952"/&gt; The first version of this [[IEC&amp;nbsp;63]] (renamed into [[IEC&amp;nbsp;60063]] in 2007) was released in 1952.&lt;ref name="IEC_60063_1952"/&gt;

It works similarly to the Renard series, except that it subdivides the interval from 1 to 10 into 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 or 192 steps. These subdivisions ensure that when some arbitrary value is replaced with the nearest preferred number, the maximum relative error will be on the order of 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, etc.

Use of the E-series is mostly restricted to [[electronics|electronic parts]] like resistors, capacitors, inductors and Zener diodes. Commonly produced dimensions for other types of electrical components are either chosen from the Renard series instead or are defined in relevant product standards (for example [[IEC 60228|wires]]).

== Audio frequencies ==
ISO 266, Acoustics—Preferred frequencies, defines two different series of audio frequencies for use in acoustical measurements. Both series are referred to the standard reference frequency of 1000 Hz, and use the R10 [[Renard series]] from ISO 3, with one using powers of 10, and the other related to the definition of the octave as the frequency ratio 1:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webshop.ds.dk/Files/Files/Products/18315_attachPV.pdf|title=ISO 266: Acoustics—Preferred frequencies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a set of nominal center frequencies for use in audio tests and audio test equipment is:

== Computer engineering ==
When dimensioning computer components, the powers of two are frequently used as preferred numbers:

  1    2    4    8   16   32   64  128  256  512  1024 …

Where a finer grading is needed, additional preferred numbers are obtained by multiplying a power of two with a small odd integer:

      1  2   4   8    16    32    64    128     256     512     1024       …

In [[computer graphics]], widths and heights of [[Raster graphics|raster images]] are preferred to be multiples of 16, as many compression algorithms ([[JPEG]], [[MPEG]]) divide ''color'' images into square blocks of that size. Black-and-white JPEG images are divided into 8×8 blocks. Screen resolutions often follow the same principle. 
Preferred [[aspect ratio]]s have also an important influence here, e.g., 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3, 

== Paper documents, envelopes, and drawing pens ==
{{Main|Paper size}}
Standard metric paper sizes use the [[square root]] of two ({{sqrt|2}}) as factors between neighbouring dimensions rounded to the nearest mm ([[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] series, [[ISO 216]]). An A4 sheet for example has an aspect ratio very close to {{sqrt|2}} and an area very close to 1/16 square metre. An A5 is almost exactly half an A4, and has the same aspect ratio. The {{sqrt|2}} factor also appears between the standard pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00&amp;nbsp;mm). This way, the right pen size is available to continue a drawing that has been magnified to a different standard paper size.

== Photography ==
In photography, aperture, exposure, and film speed generally follow powers of 2:

The aperture size controls how much light enters the camera. It is measured in [[F-number|f-stop]]s: {{f/|1.4}}, {{f/|2}}, {{f/|2.8}}, {{f/|4}}, etc. Full f-stops are a [[square root of 2]] apart. Digital cameras often subdivide these into thirds, so each f-stop is a sixth root of 2, rounded to two significant digits: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 4.0, etc.

The [[film speed]] is a measure of the film's sensitivity to light. It is expressed as ISO values such as "ISO 100". Measured film speeds are rounded to the nearest preferred number from a modified Renard series including 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 320, 400, 500, 640, 800… This is the same as the R10′ rounded [[Renard series]], except for the use of 6.4 instead of 6.3, and for having more aggressive rounding below ISO 16. Film marketed to amateurs, however, uses a restricted series including only powers of two multiples of ISO 100: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. Some low-end cameras can only reliably read these values from [[DX encoding|DX encoded]] film cartridges because they lack the extra electrical contacts that would be needed to read the complete series. Some digital cameras extend this binary series to values like 12800, 25600, etc. instead of the modified Renard values 12500, 25000, etc.

The [[shutter speed]] controls how long the camera records light. These are expressed as fractions of a second, roughly but not exactly based on powers of 2: 1 second, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|15}}, {{frac|1|30}}, {{frac|1|60}}, {{frac|1|125}}, {{frac|1|250}}, {{frac|1|500}}, {{frac|1|1000}} of a second.

5:4, 8:5, 16:9.

==Retail packaging==
In some countries, consumer-protection laws restrict the number of different prepackaged sizes in which certain products can be sold, in order to make it easier for consumers to compare prices.

An example of such a regulation is the European Union directive on the volume of certain prepackaged liquids (75/106/EEC&lt;ref name="EEC_106"/&gt;). It restricts the list of allowed wine-bottle sizes to 0.1, 0.25 ({{frac|1|4}}), 0.375 ({{frac|3|8}}), 0.5 ({{frac|1|2}}), 0.75 ({{frac|3|4}}), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres. Similar lists exist for several other types of products. They vary and often deviate significantly from any geometric series in order to accommodate traditional sizes when feasible. Adjacent package sizes in these lists differ typically by factors {{frac|2|3}} or {{frac|3|4}}, in some cases even {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|4|5}}, or some other ratio of two small integers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">A '''quiver tip''' is a flexible extension to a [[fishing rod]] which is designed to move, or quiver, when a fish takes the bait. The main characteristic of its design is its sensitivity.  It is a popular and very effective method of bite indication both on still and running water.  It is not used in game fishing (i.e. salmon, trout and sea trout) and is seldom, if ever, used when fishing for very large coarse fish (e.g. carp or pike).  In essence, the angler watches the tip of the fishing rod to detect bites as opposed to, say, a float or an electronic bite alarm.

==Description==
The quiver tip is an extension of the fishing rod. The rod is specially designed to take quiver tips; nowadays, they are often called leger or feeder rods.  Very sensitive float rods can be used for quiver tip fishing, but normally fishermen have a specialist rod especially for the task.  The eyed tip of approximately 1–2&amp;nbsp;ft in length is attached as an extension to the end of the rod by a put-in or screw-in method. The quiver tip itself is a means of improving bite detection in conjunction with the ledgering method of fishing, whereby a [[weight]] is attached to the line close to the [[Fish hook|hook]] to assist in casting.

A variation of this method is the [[swim feeder]], which is a small weighted container with small holes in which loose [[eating|feed]] can be placed to attract [[fish]] to the area near the hook [[bait (luring substance)|bait]].

== Use ==
On still water fishing venues after casting, the rod should be placed in a rod rest at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the cast with the tip near to the water to reduce the effects of the wind vibration on the tip. On moving waters such as [[river]]s the rod should be placed on a stand pointing towards the direction of the [[Casting (fishing)|cast]] with the tip high in the air in order to reduce the impact of the water flow on the line. The line between the end of the tip and the weight/swim feeder should be [[tension (mechanics)|tension]]ed so that a slight bend in the quiver tip exists.

The reason for this is to allow for the detection of two types of bite.

The first type of bite occurs when the fish takes the [[Fishing bait|bait]] and moves away from the [[fisherman]], causing the line to tighten and pull on the quiver tip. The second type of bite occurs when the fish takes the bait and moves towards the fisherman causing the line to slacken and the quiver tip to drop back/straighten.

==Types==
Quiver tips are, relative to the rods which hold them, inexpensive and found in all coarse fishing tackle shops. They can be bought in various test curves, which correspond to how stiff the tip is (often measured in [[ounce]]s.) The lower the test curve, the less stiff the tip is (i.e. the less weight required to bend the tip.) The test curve of the tip should be carefully considered as it could drastically impact on the bite detection/playing of the fish and should relate to the type of fish targeted and [[weather]] conditions.  

As a general rule, it is desirable to fish with the lightest tip possible; that means the tip with the lightest test curve.  This is because the lighter and more flexible the tip, the more sensitive and accurate the bite detection it provides.  

One of the basic skills in quiver tip fishing is selecting the correct weight of the tip to match the target fish, having regard to the type of water and the prevailing weather conditions.  For example, if British roach are being targeted on a stillwater in flat calm conditions, a quiver tip of a test curve of no more than an ounce would be a good choice.  Alternatively, fishing for a strong aggressive fish like the British barbel in a fast-flowing river would require a heavier tip, possibly of three ounces or more - a lighter tip would be permanently bent round by the flow of the water, eliminating bite detection, and playing a strong fish would probably break it completely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">A '''reinforced concrete column'''  is a [[List of structural elements|structural member]] designed to carry [[Compressive stress|compressive loads]], composed of concrete with an embedded [[steel]] frame to provide reinforcement.  For design purposes, the columns are separated into two categories: short columns and slender columns.

==Short Columns==
The strength of short columns is controlled by the strength of the material and the geometry of the cross section.  Reinforcing rebar is placed axially in the column to provide additional axial stiffness.  Accounting for the additional stiffness of the steel,hj the nominal loading capacity &lt;big&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; for the column in terms of the maximum compressive stress of the concrete &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'&lt;/big&gt;, the yield stress of the steel  &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, the gross cross section area of the column &lt;big&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, and the total cross section area of the steel rebar &lt;big&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_\mathrm{n} &amp;= 0.85f'_\mathrm{c}(A_\mathrm{g} - A_\mathrm{st}) +  A_\mathrm{st}f_\mathrm{y}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the first term represents the load carried by the concrete and the second term represents the load carried by the steel.  Because the yield strength of steel is an order of magnitude larger than that of concrete, a small addition of steel will greatly increase the strength of the column.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assakkaf.com/Courses/ENCE355/Lectures/Part1/Chapter9b.pdf Microsoft PowerPoint - Lecture 20 - Chapter 9b. Columns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Load===
To give a conservative estimate and build redundancies into the final structural system, the ACI Building Code Requirements give a maximum reduced design load of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{{\phi}P_\mathrm{n}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\phi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the strength reduction factor for the type of column used.  For spiral columns
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\phi}P_\mathrm{n(max)} &amp;= 0.85\phi[0.85f'_\mathrm{c}(A_\mathrm{g} - A_\mathrm{st}) +  A_\mathrm{st}f_\mathrm{y}]\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\phi} = 0.75\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  For tied columns
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\phi}P_\mathrm{n(max)} &amp;= 0.80\phi[0.85f'_\mathrm{c}(A_\mathrm{g} - A_\mathrm{st}) +  A_\mathrm{st}f_\mathrm{y}]\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\phi} = 0.65\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
The additional reduction past the strength reduction factor is to account for any eccentricities in the loading of column.  Distributing a load toward one end of the column will produce a moment in the column and prevent the entire cross section from carrying the load, thus producing high stress concentrations towards that end of the column.

====Spiral Columns====
Spiral columns are cylindrical columns with a continuous helical bar wrapping around the column.  The spiral acts to provide support in the transverse direction and prevent the column from [[barrel failure|barreling]]. The amount of reinforcement is required to provide additional load-carrying capacity greater than or equal to that attributed from the shell as to compensate for the strength lost when the shell spalls off.  With further thickening of the spiral rebar, the axially loaded concrete becomes the weakest link in the system and the strength contribution from the additional rebar does not take effect until the column has failed axially.  At that point, the additional strength from spiral reinforcement engages and prevents catastrophic failure, instead giving rise to a much slower ductile failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The [[American Concrete Institute|ACI]] Building Code Requirements put the following restrictions on amount of spiral reinforcement.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''ACI Code 7.10.4.2:'''  For cast-in-place construction, size of spirals shall not be less than 3/8 in. diameter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''ACI Code 7.10.4.3:'''  Clear spacing between spirals shall not exceed 3 in., nor be less than 1in.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 10.9.3 adds an additional lower limit to the amount of spiral reinforcement via the volumetric spiral reinforcement ratio &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;{\rho}_{s}=0.45(\frac{A_g}{A_{ch}}-1)\frac{f'_c}{f_{yt}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;big&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the shell area, the cross-sectional area measured to the outside edges of transverse reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;American Concrete Institute, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-08) and Commentary.
 &lt;big&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the cross-sectional area of a structural member measured to the outside edges of transverse reinforcement. ACI 318-08 pg 19
&lt;/ref&gt;
P = f/A

====Tied Columns====
Tied columns have closed lateral ties spaced approximately uniformly across the column.  The spacing of the ties is limited in that they must be close enough to prevent barreling failure between them, and far enough apart that they do not interfere with the setting of the concrete.  The ACI codebook puts an upward limit on the spacing between ties.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''ACI Code 7.10.5:'''  Vertical spacing of ties shall not exceed 16 longitudinal bar diameters, 48 tie bar or wire diameters, or least dimension of the compression member.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the ties are spaced too far apart, the column will experience [[Shear stress|shear]]failure and barrel in between the ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Slender Columns==
{{see also|Column#Equilibrium instability and loads}}
Columns qualify as being slender when their cross sectional area is very small in proportion to their length. Unlike Short Columns, Slender Columns are limited by their geometry and will buckle before the concrete or steel reinforcement yields.

== Nonlinear simulation of columns==
There are some analytical stress-strain models and damage indices for confined and unconfined concretes to simulate reinforced concrete columns that make possible without any experimental test to evaluate the stress-strain relationship and damage of confined and unconfined concretes situated inside and outside of stirrups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11204">[[File:5 station.jpg|thumb|This roof seamer uses 5 sets of rolling forming dies to manipulate the metal roof panel at the "seam" where two panels meet.]]
[[File:Roof runner.jpg|thumb|The Roof Runner® machine, manufactured in Sweden, was introduced by Butler Manufacturing for the MR-24® roof system.]]
[[File:Roof seamer roller progression.jpg|thumb|Progressive roller dies of the roof seamer are used to bend the metal roof panel seam into the desired shape to produce a finished seam profile. This shows a cross-section profile of the seam.]]
A '''roof seamer''' is a portable roll forming machine that is used to install mechanically seamed structural standing seam [[metal roof]] panels, as part of an overall metal construction building envelope system. The machine is small and portable to be handled by an operator on top of a roof. The machine is applied to the overlapping area when two parallel roof panels meet. The action of the machine bends the two panels together to form a joint that has weather-tight qualities superior to other types of roof systems and cladding.

== History ==
Commonly, a roof seamer is developed as an afterthought. Since roof seamers are dependent on the metal roof system being used, their development was secondary to the roof panel. A roof seamer is a development that replaced a manual process and hand tools of the past. A hammer and small anvil were tools that were used for [[hemming and seaming]] roof panels together at the edge where they meet with the next roof panel in sequence.

In 1976, a German immigrant and inventor, Ewald Stellrecht,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esemachines.com/about.htm|title=ESE Machines :: About Us|website=www.esemachines.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped develop an early version of a metal roof panel portable roll forming machine in Exton, PA. From this a version of the roof seamer was also created. Since that time, great strides and innovations have been made in the development of roof seaming machines. Also, in the 1970s, [[BlueScope|Butler Manufacturing]] developed and released a proprietary roof system that featured the use of an electric roof seamer, dubbed the Roof Runner®, along with hand tools and an operating platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://butlermfg.com/en/about_us|title=About Us {{!}} Butler Manufacturing|website=butlermfg.com|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many developments have been made since that time to make roof seamers lighter, faster, and more user-friendly. In 1989, Developmental Industries refocused the niche market by developing a line of roof seamers that were universal to many different panel manufacturers' products and were available to [[Renting|rent]] by the end-user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diroofseamers.com/history.html|title=History - D.I.ROOF SEAMERS|website=diroofseamers.com|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, purchasing a roof seamer meant that it would work with one specific roof panel, manufactured by a specific roof panel manufacturer. By opening up builders and installers to the option of [[renting]], this allowed them to have the option of buying from different sources and greatly reducing their cost, making metal roofing a more accessible option for many that would not consider it before.

== Design and Function ==
Today roof seamers are used around the world. As the rise in popularity in sustainable building products has risen in recent years, the need of a roof seaming tool has also increased. Most roof seaming machines can have a life expectancy of 20 or more years, if proper maintenance and care are exercised.

=== Variables ===
Many variables exist when using a roof seamer that may affect the final product outcome. All of the following variables should be considered and decided on during the design process of the building:
* Material: Metal roof panels are made from a variety of materials including coated carbon steel, aluminum, zinc, and copper. The type and strength of the material must be considered, not only for [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] but also [[flexural strength]]. The quality of materials should be considered based on the mill and country it was sourced from. Most often these materials come to the panel manufacturer in the form of a coil, then fed into a [[roll forming]] machine to produce the finished roof panel shape and dimension.
* Material Coating: A coating can be layers of other metals (such as [http://www.galvalume.com/ Galvalume®] or material treated through the process of [[galvanization]]), paint, or extruded coatings.
* Thickness: Different gauges of metal will present a range of thicknesses that must be accounted for with the forming dies of the roof seaming machine. This, in addition to the thickness of the coating, should be factored in to produce an acceptable seamed profile, but not to compromise the coating.
* Geography: The particular location of the structure will play into its performance over time. [[Weather]] patterns, [[temperature]] ranges, and prolonged exposure to the elements can affect the [[Thermal expansion|thermal movement]] of the metal roof panels.
* [[Structural load|Structural Load]]: Many things can produce "load" on a roof. The most common that will be combated by the roof seamer are considered [[Structural load#Environmental loads|environmental loads]], such as [[Wind engineering|wind]], snow, rain, and [[Earthquake engineering|seismic]] considerations. 
* Sealants: Sealants are almost always used inside of the panel lapped seams. These sealants can be applied in a factory setting or at the construction site. In either case, [[Sealant|liquid caulk sealant]] and [[Butyl rubber#Damp proofing and roof repair|butyl tapes]] are the most common. In either case, the amount, location, and application method are specified to cause maximum protection for the building system as a whole.[[File:Roof seamer seam progression.jpg|thumb|This shows an unseamed metal roof panel lap and two common options for a finished seam profile that a roof seamer can produce.]]
* Desired results: The "finished seam profile" can be specified by a roof panel manufacturer as an option for the [[architectural designer]] to consider. Factors that can affect the desired results would be aesthetic appearance and environmental loads.
* [[Roof pitch|Roof Pitch]]: A roof's pitch is simply the angle of the roof. This will create resistance for the roof seamer to overcome. The steeper the pitch, the greater the roof seamer may have to work to ascend and descend the roof panels.
* Fastening method: Mechanically seamed standing seam roof systems use a hidden fastener system. This system consists of a "clip" that is fabricated out of metal and attached to the structure's substrate with [[screw]]s. When the panels are installed over these clips, they will be hidden from view and formed into the seam of the panels with the roof seamer. This prevents penetrations from fasteners and screws through the metal roof panel that would be used to secure them to the structure with other types of [[metal roof]]s.
* Ancillary Attachments: Roof-mounted [[HVAC]], [[solar panel]]s, [[snow guard]]s, and many other products are often attached to standing seam metal roofs. This additional load, attachment methods and the use of dissimilar materials must be considered. Specifically the use of other materials to prevent [[galvanic corrosion]] and premature compromise and degradation of the materials.

=== Power and usage ===
Traditionally, roof seamers are powered by [[electricity]]-driven motors. Depending on the operator's location, either [[Electric power distribution#110–120 volt systems|110-volt]] or [[Electric power distribution#220–240 volt systems|220-volt]] power may be required. On most construction sites, either temporary electrical power is supplied or power is offered by an [[electric generator]]. This gives the operator the flexibility to take the power source onto a roof with them instead of using extensions cords, which can depreciate the power supply and possibly damage the motor of the roof seamer.

=== Training ===
[[File:Worker and roof seamer machine..jpg|thumb|An operator monitors an electric roof seamer as it travels along a metal roof seam.]]
While simple in concept, the effective use of the roof seamer requires a trained person to operate. Training is both practical and effective in on-site troubleshooting. While classroom and practical training are options to learn how to operate a roof seamer, [[on-the-job training]] is recommended as being the most effective method. Manuals, videos, and field guides are also methods that will support training. In all cases, training should be completed before operating alone with a roof seamer to teach proper preventive maintenance steps, simple adjustments and troubleshooting in the event of a machine problem.

In 2015, the [[Metal Construction Association]] published a [http://www.metalconstruction.org/download.php/education/tech_resources/metal_roofs/user_file_1 "best practices" guide] for proper use and operation of roof seaming tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalconstruction.org/Tech-Resources|title=Educational Resources for Architects and Building Owners|website=www.metalconstruction.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
As with any tool, proper maintenance will increase the usefulness and life expectancy. Proper maintenance extends beyond the roof seamer, to the working surface on the roof. Before operating the roof seamer, ensure that the roof panel and seam are clean and clear of debris that could mark or gouge the forming dies. During operation check lubrication points and other recommended maintenance steps. In addition, most manufacturers will recommend scheduled service on an annual basis to ensure internal components are not worn or damaged.

=== Other tools ===
[[File:Hand Crimper.jpg|thumb|A hand crimper is used to flat-form the material ahead of a roof seamer or in place of roll forming in some applications.]]
In conjunction with the roof seaming machine, there are an array of hand tools that are used. The most common tool that is usually required when operating a roof seamer is a "hand crimper". The hand crimper is used to "flat form" the panel seams into the appropriate configuration to prepare the seam for the roof seamer to be applied. Other common tools are [[snips]], [[nibbler]]s, and [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears.]]

== Support Organizations ==
There are numerous professional and trade organizations that support metal roofing, metal construction and the core market where roof seamers are used. The [[Metal Roofing Alliance]] (MRA), [[Metal Construction Association|Metal Construction Association (MCA)]], [[Metal Building Manufacturers Association|Metal Buildings Manufacturers Association]] (MBMA), the Metal Buildings Contractors and Erectors Association (MBCEA), and the [[National Roofing Contractors Association]] (NRCA) are just a few. In addition, many distributors and suppliers offer resources and support documentation for their particular product offerings.

'''Samuel Joseph Haskins''' (11 November 1926 – 26 November 2009), was a British photographer, born and raised in South Africa. He started his career in Johannesburg and moved to London in 1968. Haskins is best known for his contribution to in-camera image montage, and his books, the most influential of which were ''[[Five Girls (book)]]'' (1962), ''[[Cowboy Kate and other stories|Cowboy Kate]]'' (1964) and ''[[Haskins Posters]]'' (1973). He suffered a stroke on 19 September 2009, the opening day of his exhibition to launch 'Fashion Etcetera' at [[Milk Gallery]] in New York and died at home in Bowral, Australia, nine weeks later.

== Youth ==
Haskins was born in [[Kroonstad]] in the province of the [[Orange Free State]] of South Africa. His father Ben was a goods inspector on [[South African Railways]]. Early creative influences were fueled by an interest in [[magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks, kite making, drawing and the circus. A talented athlete, as a teenager he excelled at [[hurdling]] and trained with a circus, resulting in a job offer as a [[trapeze]] catcher.

== Education ==
Formal higher education was at the [[Johannesburg Technical College]] 1945-1948, where he did a general arts course followed by a part-time photographic module. Between 1949 and 1951 he studied at the [[London School of Printing and Graphic Arts]] in [[Bolt Court]], later renamed the [[London College of Printing]] and now the [[London College of Communication]].

== Marriage and children ==
Haskins married Alida Elzabe van Heerden in 1952 and they had two sons; Ludwig (4 August 1955) and Konrad (27 January 1963). They adopted a daughter, Heidi in 1960, but she died in infancy.  Alida gave up a career in fashion soon after their marriage to become Haskins' business partner. She played a key role in the launch of his career by acting as a publishing agent for ''Five Girls'' when he was still an unknown photographer. She continued to negotiate worldwide publication of his books, apart from Fashion Etcetera, his last project, a book and exhibition in New York, managed by Ludwig. Alida died on 5 December 2012. Sam's artistic estate is now owned and managed by his son Ludwig. Konrad Haskins, Ludwig's younger brother and only sibling died on 23 March 2014.

== Career summary ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2014}}Haskins started his career as an advertising photographer in Johannesburg in 1953. He ran what was probably the first modern freelance advertising studio in Africa. He produced commercial work across a very broad spectrum of photography from still life to industrial, fashion and aerial. His first formal creative output was a one-man show at the popular Johannesburg department store [[John Orrs]] in 1960. This featured black-and-white photography of models in the studio and included some photographs of dolls made by the young Elisabeth Langsch, who went on to become Switzerland's leading [[ceramist]].

His international reputation and his signature photographic passions were established by four key books published in the 1960s. ''Five Girls'' (1962) explored a fresh approach to photographing the nude female figure and contained important first explorations with black-and-white printing, cropping and book design, which were a key feature of his subsequent books. ''[[Cowboy Kate &amp; Other Stories]]'' (1964) was probably the first book to deliberately explore black-and-white photographic grain as a medium for expression and image design. It was highly influential at the time, sold roughly a million copies worldwide and won the [[Prix Nadar]] in France in 1964. It continues to influence contemporary photographers, film makers, fashion designers and make-up artists. ''Cowboy Kate &amp; Other Stories'' or 'Kate' as the book is often referred to, had its place in photographic history cemented in 2005 when the ''[[International Center of Photography]]'' in New York included the book in their exhibition ''The Open Book: A History of the Photographic Book from 1878 to the Present''.

''November Girl'' (1967) contained key image collages which formed the basis of many graphic and surrealist experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. ''African Image'' (1967) was a visual homage to the indigenous people, culture, landscape and wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa. The images represent a lifelong interest in photographing graphically stimulating environments and formally document his passion for indigenous craft. He broke bones on river rapids and wrote off two Volvo saloon cars on African dirt roads while shooting the book. Despite its international award, this meticulously constructed book, celebrating a love for sub-Saharan Africa, is probably the least known of his major creative projects, but it is coveted by serious collectors of African art and photography.

In 1968 Haskins moved to London and ran a studio in [[Glebe Place]] just off the [[Kings Road|King's Road]]. He worked as an advertising photographer for international consumer brands [[Pentax|Asahi Pentax]], [[Bacardi]], [[Cutty Sark (whisky)|Cutty Sark]] whisky, [[Honda]], [[BMW]], [[Haig (whisky)|Haig]] whisky, [[DeBeers]], [[British Airways]], [[Unilever]] and [[Zanders]], and specialised in the art direction and shooting of calendars, especially for Asahi Pentax in Japan. Although he endorsed Hasselblad for a short period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his loyalty to the [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[6x7 camera]] and lenses from Asahi resulted in a rare long-term association between a camera manufacturer and photographer. From 1970 to 2000, Asahi Optical (later Pentax) produced 30 calendars, of which Haskins shot and art-directed 15 editions including the millennium calendar. No other photographer was invited to contribute more than once. He is still involved with the Pentax Forum Gallery in Tokyo, which hosts his exhibitions. His first contact came in 1967 when Asahi Optical presented him with a 35&amp;nbsp;mm camera after hearing that he had shot ''African Image'' with various competitors' products.

In 1972 he produced his first colour book, ''[[Haskins Posters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.haskins.com/HsksPstr/HsksPstrs_p01.html Haskins Posters]'' on Haskins' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The large-format publication contained pages printed on one side using a thick stiff paper and a soft glue [[perfect binding]] allowing the pages to be removed and used as posters. Haskins and Alida successfully published the book internationally through their own company, Haskins Press. The book won a gold award at the [[New York One Show]]. At the time the best-known image from ''Haskins Posters,'' a girl's face superimposed on an apple with a bee near the stem, appeared on the cover or in editorials of almost every major photographic magazine around the world. This image was part of a well-publicised visual and graphic experimentation with the apple theme in the 1970s that for a while resulted in photographic journalists nicknaming him 'Sam the Apple man'.

The images in ''Haskins Posters'' traversed different creative themes that all became signature passions for Haskins' image-making over the next three decades; graphically strong compositions of nudes characterised by a natural essence in the models while the image-making explored themes of graphic experimentation, humour and sensual eroticism. Haskins has a recurring theme (rooted in his training as a painter) of creating tension in the surface of his photographs between flat graphic elements and 3D chiaroscuro. These results are often achieved with sophisticated lighting and/or double exposures. A highly creative and design driven approach to lighting almost always plays a key role in Haskins' work, both in the studio and on location. He often develops complex lighting designs for a single specific shot that are never repeated, the most recent example being a fashion shoot for [[New York magazine|''New York'' magazine]]'s 75th anniversary issue shot in New York's [[Pier 57]] studios in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/fashion/06/fall/borrowthis/ Fashion shoot], [http://nymag.com/fashion/06/fall/19406/index.html anniversary].&lt;/ref&gt;

He also often sculpted and painted graphic elements for his photographs and drew inspiration from a combination of surrealism, illustration, film and modern graphic designers.

The graphic experiments first seen in ''Haskins Posters'' and related exhibitions at London's [[Photographer's Gallery]] and [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] resulted in a book called ''Photo Graphics'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.haskins.com/PhtGrphcs/PhtGrphcs_p01.html Photo Graphics]'' at Haskins' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book coined a new term in photography that has since become widely used.

Haskins' next book, ''[[Sam Haskins á Bologna]]'' (1984), resulted from an invitation by the mayor of Bologna to photograph the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.haskins.com/Bologna/Bologna_p01.html Sam Haskins á Bologna]'' at Haskins' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was accompanied by an exhibition in the city. This project led to two more homages to visually rich locations shot over a series of visits; [[Barcelona]] (1991) and [[Kashmir]] (between 1992 and 1994).

From 2000 to 2005, he focused on [[fashion photography]] for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]'' and ''[[New York magazine|New York]]''. A shortage of copies of the original edition of ''Cowboy Kate &amp; Other Stories'' (1964), which was selling to collectors for up to US$3,000, led Haskins to bring out a digitally remastered 'director's cut' version in October 2006, published by Rizzoli in New York. Apart from image editing and layout revisions, the new version has 16 pages of new images.   

In 2002 Haskins and Alida moved to the Southern Highlands in Australia and built the third house-studio of their partnership. The move away from London resulted in a renaissance in Haskins' fashion photography. While he always had a passion for fashion from the start of his career, and ''Cowboy Kate'' influenced fashion designers, who credited Haskins, he had not been courted by the mainstream fashion world and he did not court them. A shoot for [Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent] in Paris in 2002 resulted in a 'rediscovery' that led to a stream of assignments in London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and Sydney working for fashion houses and magazines.

In December 2006, a month after his 80th birthday, the first retrospective exhibition of his work (with a portraiture bias) opened at the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Canberra (Australia). This was also his first exhibition at a national museum/gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portrait.gov.au/static/Sam_Haskins.php Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081004000517/http://www.portrait.gov.au/static/Sam_Haskins.php |date=4 October 2008 }} National Portrait Gallery - Canberra. First retrospective show.&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for four and a half months to 22 April 2007. 

The exhibition included several portraits of other artists never seen before, including one of the late [[Jean-Michel Folon]], a graphic artist much admired by Haskins. Although one or two of the images from this personal portrait project had previously been published, the majority remained part of a quiet collection built up over decades of meeting and befriending other artists. 

In 2009, Sam Haskins published, under the family imprint [[The Haskins Press]], his first book in 24 years. ''Fashion Etcetera'' is a thematic slice through his archive that explores a lifelong passion for fashion, style and design. ''Fashion Etcetera'' was produced over three years working in close collaboration with his son Ludwig and his grandson Oren. The book is dedicated to Ludwig and Oren.  In the last year of Haskins' life, 2009,  his 'Fashion Etcetera' book and exhibition received widespread global publicity and in the process turned images of Gill from 'Five Girls' (1962) into one of the new found icons of the 1960s. Following the death of Sam's wife, Alida Haskins, on 5 December 2009, the Sam Haskins estate is now 100% owned and managed by Ludwig, who continues to publish and exhibit his father's work and negotiate image rights.

== Influences ==
Haskins is unusual among photographers for also being recognised as a designer. He has on various occasions given tribute to the following artists as being an influence on his work: photographers [[Irving Penn]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Jean-Loup Sieff]]; designers and typographers [[McKnight Kaufer]], [[Paul Rand]], [[Louis Dorfsman]], [[Willy Fleckhaus]], [[Alexey Brodovitch]], [[Herb Lubalin]], [[Milton Glaser]], and [[Saul Bass]]; painters [[René Magritte]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Post Impressionism]], [[20th century art]] from Paris, [[Pop Art]]; film makers [[Federico Fellini]], [[Carol Reed]] (for his directing of ''[[The Third Man]]''), [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (primarily for the directing of ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]''). A list of Haskins' favourite photographers, drawn up in 2007, can be found on his [http://www.samhaskinsblog.com blog].

== Slide show ==

Haskins developed a medium format slide show comprising up to 500 images, each displayed for seven seconds, synchronised to music. These were shown with a traditional manual projector operated by Haskins using a darkroom timer. First shown in Brighton at an international photo conference in 1970, the show was hugely popular, filling theatres, cinemas and convention halls at photo conferences and public performances in over 50 cities around the world.

The initial format of the slides was 6cmx6cm as all Haskins' medium format images at that point had been shot on Hasselblad and Rolleiflex. Haskins took delivery of his first [[Pentax 6x7]] in 1970 in Tokyo but it took several years to build up a body of 6x7 slides. The conversion of the slides to 6x7 format took place in 1975 and it was at this point that the show took on a much higher profile internationally.

== Teaching and assessing ==

Haskins returned to his alma mater, [[The London College of Printing]], in 1975 as outside assessor on the photographic diploma course, a position he maintained until 1982.

Between 1980 and 1985 he ran one-week workshops for writers, cinematographers, directors and set designers at Norwegian Television's training school in Oslo.

He ran one-week photographic training workshops in Italy, Sweden and South Africa in the 1970s.

The rest of his teaching was usually at one-day workshops at photo conferences and to groups visiting his studio. Haskins maintained close links with Syracuse University in the USA, hosting groups of visiting students at his studio in London every summer from 1975 to 1988.

A '''sound limiter''' or '''noise limiter''' is a digital device fitted with a [[microphone]] to measure the sound pressure level of environmental noise, expressed by the [[decibel]] logarithmic unit (dB). If the environmental noise level as measured by the microphone exceeds a pre-set level for a certain amount of time (e.g. 5 seconds), the limiter’s [[circuitry]] will cut the power supply to the musical equipment and [[PA system]] for a brief amount of time.

Sound limiters are commonly installed at live music venues, including private venues and particularly those that host [[wedding receptions]] with live wedding bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fixthemusic.com/sound-limiters-guide/|title=Sound Limiters — A Guide for Bookers|author1=Adam Southall|author2=FixTheMusic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual indicator on the limiter works most commonly on a “[[traffic light]]” system: green = no problem, amber = sound levels approaching the threshold, red = threshold breached. If the light stays red for more than a few seconds, then the limiter will take action and cut the power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daftonline.co.uk/sound-limiters-what-you-need-to-know|title=Sound Limiters. What you need to know.|author=Graeme Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no legal requirement to install a sound limiter, they are a reasonably inexpensive piece of equipment, which can help prevent complaints as part of a sound control plan and also protect the health of your staff by ensuring that the levels do not exceed those set by [[The Control of Noise at Work regulations 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmbridge.gov.uk/envhealth/noise/limiter.htm|title=Noise Limiter Devices|author1=Elmbridge Borough Council|author2= Donna Wade|author3= dwade@elmbridge.gov.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F Capodanno Bl South Beach td 06 - Staten Island Bluebelt.jpg|thumb|right|A sign for the Staten Island Bluebelt in [[South Beach, Staten Island|South Beach]].]]
The '''Staten Island Bluebelt''' (also known simply as '''Bluebelt'''), is a large scale system of stormwater [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) that have been under construction on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], since the early 1990s. The Bluebelt includes structural and nonstructural [[stormwater]] management control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[surface runoff|runoff]] caused through changes to land use.

==History==
The Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City’s [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Departments of Environmental Protection]] and [[New York City Department of City Planning|Department of City Planning]], based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by [[Ian McHarg]], a [[landscape architect]].&lt;ref name=unbound&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=319-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project,&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt; one of the Northeast United States’ most ambitious stormwater management efforts.  The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a {{convert|12000|acre|km2|adj=on}} region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last great stand of freshwater wetlands in New York City. The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self-regulating ecosystem that is native to the Staten Island region is of primary importance to the program.

BMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands are planned for the project, about half of which have been constructed to date (2008). In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation. The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site.

The performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered Staten Island in the early 21st century &amp;ndash; including [[Hurricane Sandy]] &amp;ndash; has been described as "brilliant".&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt;

[[File:Oak chips in chardonnay.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chardonnay fermenting.]]
A '''stuck [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]''' occurs in [[Brewing_(beer)|brewing beer]] or [[winemaking]] when the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] become dormant before the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] has completed. Unlike an "arrested fermentation" where the winemaker intentionally stops fermentation (such as in the production of [[fortified wine]]s), a stuck fermentation is an unintentional and unwanted occurrence that can lead to the wine being spoiled by [[bacteria]] and [[oxidation]]. There are several potential causes of a stuck fermentation-the most common are excessive temperatures killing off the yeast or a [[must]] deficient in the [[nitrogen]] food source needed for the yeast to thrive. Once the fermentation is stuck, it is very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by dying yeast cells that inhibit the future growth of yeast cells in the batch. At the winery winemakers take several steps to limit the possibility of a stuck fermentation occurring, such as adding nitrogen to the must in the form of [[diammonium phosphate]] or using cultured yeast with a high temperature and alcohol tolerance. These steps that winemakers may take to prevent a stuck fermentation will each have their own subtle or dramatic effect on the resulting flavors and quality of the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 664-665"&gt; J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 664-665 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
A chronic problem in winemaking is "stuck fermentation," when yeast that should be busily converting grape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide prematurely shuts down, leaving the remaining sugar to instead be consumed by bacteria that can spoil the wine.
A team of researchers including UC Davis yeast geneticist Linda Bisson has discovered a biochemical communication system behind this problem. Working through a [[prion]] -- an abnormally shaped protein that can reproduce itself -- the system enables bacteria in fermenting wine to switch yeast from sugar to other food sources without altering the yeast's DNA.
"The discovery of this process really gives us a clue to how stuck fermentations can be avoided," said Bisson, a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. "Our goal now is to find yeast strains that essentially ignore the signal initiated by the bacteria and do not form the prion, but instead power on through the fermentation."
She suggests that the discovery of this biochemical mechanism, reported Aug. 28 in the journal Cell, may also have implications for better understanding metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, in humans.
Bacteria, yeast and fermentation
Biologists have known for years that an ancient biological circuit, based in the membranes of yeast cells, blocks yeast from using other carbon sources when the sugar glucose is present.
This circuit, known as "glucose repression," is especially strong in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling people to use that yeast for practical fermentation processes in winemaking, brewing and bread making, because it causes such efficient processing of sugar.
Prions play key role
In this study, the researchers found that the glucose repression circuit is sometimes interrupted when bacteria jump-start the replication of the prions in membranes of yeast cells. The interference of the prions causes the yeast to process carbon sources other than glucose and become less effective in metabolizing sugar, dramatically slowing down the fermentation until it, in effect, becomes "stuck."
"This type of prion-based inheritance is useful to organisms when they need to adapt to environmental conditions but not necessarily permanently," Bisson said. "In this case, the heritable changes triggered by the prions enable the yeast to also change back to their initial mode of operation if environmental conditions should change again."
The researchers demonstrated in this study that the process leading to a stuck fermentation benefits both the bacteria and the yeast. As sugar metabolism slows down, conditions in the fermenting wine become more conducive to bacterial growth, and the yeast benefit by gaining the ability to metabolize not only glucose but also other carbon sources as well -- maintaining and extending their lifespan.
Solutions for winemakers
Now that this communication mechanism between the bacteria and yeast is more clearly understood, winemakers should be better able to avoid stuck fermentations.
"Winemakers may want to alter the levels of sulfur dioxide used when pressing or crushing the grapes, in order to knock out bacteria that can trigger the processes that we now know can lead to a stuck fermentation," Bisson said. "They also can be careful about blending grapes from vineyards known to have certain bacterial strains or they could add yeast strains that have the ability to overpower these vineyard bacteria."

There are several potential instigators of a stuck fermentation. One of the most common found in winemaking is a [[nitrogen deficient must]]. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient in the growth and development of yeasts and is usually provided from the wine grapes themselves. Grapes grown in vineyards with soils lacking in nitrogen or [[grape varieties]], such as [[Chardonnay]] and [[Riesling]], which are naturally prone to have low nitrogen to [[sugar (wine)|sugar]] ratios will be at greater risk for having a stuck fermentation. Another cause rooted in the vineyard is from [[ripening|overripe]] grapes. Grapes that are overripe will have high levels of sugars that translates into higher alcohol content. Yeast are unable to reproduce in an environment with 16-18% [[ABV]] but in an environment with multiple stressors the fermentation could get stuck even before the alcohol level reaches that point.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 664-665"/&gt;

[[File:Mthomebrew maceration.JPG|left|450px|thumb|The skins included in the fermentation of red wine provide some nutrients to the yeast.]]
A byproduct of the energy created during fermentation is heat which raises the temperature of the fermenting must as the yeast work. When temperatures near 104[[°F]] (40[[°C]]), activity slows and yeast start to die. If temperatures stay high and the yeast stop reproducing then the fermentation is at grave risk of getting stuck. Even if the must is cooled back down, fermentation will be very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by the dying yeast that serves as an inhibitor to the growth of future yeast cells in the batch. Modern winemaking equipment includes temperature control mechanisms such as stainless steel fermenting tanks with a cooling jacket to help regulate temperatures. Another potential cause is a combination of lack of oxygen and yeast nutrients found in the [[lipid]]s suspended in grape solids. In the absence of oxygen, yeast will seek out the lipids in grape solid as a source of nutrients to sustain its activity. If the wine is lacking grape solids (such as if the wine's been [[clarified (wine)|clarified]]) then the yeast are at risk of starving and causing the fermentation to get stuck. This risk is lower for red wines which are often fermented [[maceration (wine)|with their skins]] in open air containers or [[oak (wine)|oak]] wine barrels which provide plenty of oxygen and grape solids for the yeast to feed on.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 664-665"/&gt;

==Prevention techniques==
There are various techniques that a winemaker can employ to minimize the chances of a stuck fermentation happening. The most common is to use a cultured yeast strain with a high alcohol and high temperature tolerance coupled by diligent control of the fermentation temperature. Another technique is to add yeast nutrients like nitrogen to the must. The [[ammonium]] [[salt]] diammonium phosphate, or yeast nutrient, is a popular inexpensive means of ensuring the must has sufficient nitrogen. Whatever technique the winemaker uses, each has the potential to subtly or drastically affect the resulting flavor and quality of the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 664-665"/&gt;

'''1890 [[Stop sign]]'''

A stop sign is a traffic sign, usually erected at road junctions such as a four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when [[William Phelps Eno]] of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in ''Rider and Driver''. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy Birthday Stop Sign!|publisher=The FatDUX Group ApS|url=http://www.fatdux.com/resources/articles/happy-birthday-stop-sign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1890 [[Tabulating machine]]'''

The tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, [[Herman Hollerith]] invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman Hollerith|publisher=Columbia University|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about Herman Hollerith inventor of the punch card tabulating machine in 1890|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/hollerith.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1890 [[Shredded wheat]]'''
* Shredded wheat is a type of breakfast cereal made from whole [[wheat]]. Shredded wheat also comes in a ''frosted'' variety, which has one side coated with [[sugar]] and usually [[gelatin]].

'''1890 [[Babcock test]]'''
* The Babcock test was the first inexpensive and practical test which were used to determine the fat content of milk. Invented by [[Stephen Moulton Babcock]] in 1890, the test was developed to prevent dishonest farmers who could, until the 1890s, water down their milk or remove some cream before selling it to the factories because milk was paid by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Moulton Babcock|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47410/Stephen-Moulton-Babcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1890 [[Smoke detector]]'''
* A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke and issues a signal. Most smoke detectors work either by optical detection or by physical process, but some of them use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by [[Francis Robbins Upton]] and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], although there is no evidence that Edison contributed to this invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Safety Tips = Smoke Detectors|publisher=Center Pigeon Volunteer Fire Department, Inc.|url=http://centerpigeonfire.org/firesafetytips-smokedetectors.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1891 [[Schrader valve]]'''

A Schrader valve consists of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant [[August Schrader]], invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schrader Valve|publisher=Schrader International|url=http://www.schrader-bridgeport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUGER-BIT|publisher=Google Patents|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=-mxHAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WrightBrothers1899Kite.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Diagram of the Wright brothers' 1899 kite, showing wing bracing and strings attached to hand-held sticks used for warping the wing while in flight]]
Wing warping consists of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to [[Wilbur Wright]] who in 1899, came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their [[Wright Glider#1899 kite|1899 glider]] that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] replaced wing warping in 1904 with the [[aileron]] on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was [[Henry Farman]], a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wing Warping|publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/wing_warping/DI56.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505105053/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/wing_warping/DI56.htm|archivedate=2008-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1899 [[Flash-lamp]]'''

The electric flash-lamp is a device that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium, for a brief sudden burst of bright light "flash" from a chemical reaction of flash powder burning. It was principally used for flash photography in the early 20th century, but had other uses as well. The flash-lamp was invented and patented on November 7, 1899 by New York City resident [[Joshua Lionel Cowen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flash-Lamp|publisher=United States Patent and Trademarlk Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=ctJ1AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1900 [[Duckpin bowling]]'''

Duckpin bowling is a variation of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing {{convert|1|–|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a "flock of flying ducks". While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to do exactly that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duckpin Bowling History|publisher=Bowling Academy|url=http://bowlingacademy.2gobowl.com/page=Duckpin_Bowling_History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1901 [[Assembly line]]'''
[[File:A-line1913.jpg|180px|left|thumb|1913 Ford Model T assembly line production.]]
Used globally around the world, an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner in order to create a finished product more quickly than with older methods. This type of manufacturing greatly reduces the amount of time taken to assemble a product, thus reducing production, material, and labor costs so that an affordable product cost can be passed onto consumers. According to a book entitled ''Michigan Yesterday &amp; Today'' authored by Robert W. Domm, the assembly line and its basic concept is credited to [[Ransom Olds]], who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]].&lt;ref name="michigan yesterday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Michigan Yesterday &amp; Today|publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQdTa9ZXlVAC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olds [[patented]] the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] factory in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/assbline.htm|title=Assembly Line History - Invention of the Assembly Line|first=Phil|last=Ament|date=|website=www.ideafinder.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is often overshadowed by [[Henry Ford]], who perfected the assembly line by installing driven [[conveyor belts]] that could produce a [[Model T]] in ninety-three minutes.&lt;ref name="michigan yesterday"/&gt;

'''1902 [[Periscope|Periscope (collapsible)]]'''
* A periscope is an instrument for observation from a concealed position, known for use in submarines. In a simple form, it is a tube in each end of which are mirrors set parallel to each other and at an angle of 45 with a line between them. Periscopes allow a submarine, submerged at a shallow depth, to search for targets and threats in the surrounding sea and air. When not in use, the periscope is retracted into the hull. A sub commander in tactical conditions must exercise discretion when using his periscope, since it creates an observable wake and may be detectable to radar, giving away the sub's position. The invention of the collapsible periscope for use in submarine warfare is credited to [[Simon Lake]] in 1902, who called his device the omniscope or skalomniscope. Later, it was made to be raised and turned by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keepind an Eye|publisher=SP Guide Publications Pvt Ltd|url=http://www.spsnavalforces.net/story.asp?Book=14&amp;Article=2&amp;h=Keeping-an-Eye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Gage County People|publisher=Gage County Historical Society|url=http://www.gagecountymuseum.org/Famous%20Gage%20County%20People.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1904 [[Automatic transmission]]'''

An automatic transmission is an automobile gearbox that changes gear ratios automatically as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Modern automatic transmissions trace their origins to an early "horseless carriage" gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatic transmission revolutionized motoring|publisher=Article News|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185302013.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1904 [[Banana split]]'''
* A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it is served in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in half lengthwise (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream served in a row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit was introduced to the American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to ''The Food Chronology'', written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banana Splits|publisher=Food Timeline|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodicecream.html#bananasplit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1904 [[Pantograph (rail)|Pantograph (diamond-shaped)]]'''
* A pantograph is a device that collects electric current from overhead lines for electric trains or trams. The term stems from the resemblance to [[Pantograph|pantograph devices]] for copying writing and drawings. In 1904, the diamond-shaped roller pantograph was invented by John Q. Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. A patent was issued on July 5, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trolley|publisher=Google Patents|url= http://www.google.com/patents?id=caV9AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1904 [[Dragline excavator]]'''
* Drag-line excavation systems are heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types are used for road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered by means of a number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Page Walking Draglines|publisher=Michael Bezilla|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/staff/m/x/mxb13/PAGES/draglines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1905 [[Batting helmet]]'''
[[File:BattingHelmet.png|180px|left|thumb|A batter wearing a batting helmet]]
A batting helmet is the protective headgear worn by batters in the game of baseball or softball. It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is "hit by pitch", due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. In 1905, a [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] (the team now known as the San Francisco Giants) baseball player named [[Roger Bresnahan]], after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury (or beaning), created, with assistance from the A.J. Reach Company, a crude, leather, vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet. The headgear was unpopular, even with Bresnahan at the time, and it wasn't until the mid-1950s that his idea was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autograph Analysis and Signing Habits of Hall of Fame Catcher Roger Phillip ''The Duke of Tralee'' Bresnahan|publisher=Professional Authenticator Sports|url= http://www.psacard.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=4249&amp;type=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1905 [[Liquid ring pump]]'''

A liquid ring pump is a rotating positive displacement pump that is powered by an [[induction motor]] and is typically used as a [[vacuum pump]] or as a [[gas compressor]].

'''1905 [[Ice pop]]'''
* An ice pop is a frozen water-based dessert on a stick. It is made by freezing a colored, flavored liquid around a stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. The ice pop was invented by 11-year-old [[Frank Epperson]] in 1905. Living in San Francisco, California, Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight, with a stirrer in it, thus making it freeze. In 1923, Epperson got a patent on his "frozen ice on a stick". Epperson also invented the twin ice pop, with two sticks so it could be shared by two children. The most famous brand name associated with the ice pop is ''Popsicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popsicle|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/epperson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1906 [[Audion tube]]'''
* The Audion is an electronic amplifier device and was the forerunner of the triode, in which the current from the filament to the plate was controlled by a third element, the grid. A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament to the plate, allowing the Audion both to detect radio signals and to provide amplification. The Audion tube was invented by [[Lee De Forest]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee's Audion|publisher=The Complete Lee De Forest|url=http://www.leedeforest.org/inventor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1907 [[Curtain rod]]'''
* A curtain rod or traverse rod is a device used to suspend [[curtain]]s, usually above windows or along the edges of [[shower]]s, though also wherever curtains might be used. The flat, telescoping curtain rod was invented by Charles W. Kirsch of Sturgis, Michigan, in 1907. However, they were not in use until the 1920s. Kirsch also invented the traverse curtain rod in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bungalow details: interior|publisher=Gibbs Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Gwd99wUthMC&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1907 [[Electrostatic precipitator]]'''
* An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In 1907, the California physicist [[Frederick G. Cottrell]] invented and received a patent for the electrostatic precipitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Separating Suspended Particles from Gaseous Bodies Electrostatic Precipitator|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/34.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073535/http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/34.html|archivedate=2013-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1907 [[Paper towel]]'''
* A paper towel has the same purposes as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the [[Scott Paper Company]] heard about it, he decided to try to sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Paper Towels|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/papertowel.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1908 [[Candy apple]]'''
[[File:Candyapple.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A candy apple]]
Candy apples, also known as toffee apples outside of North America, are whole apples covered in a hard sugar candy coating. While the topping varies from place to place, they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat. Toffee apples are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as [[Halloween]] and [[Guy Fawkes Night]] because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest. Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition. However, the origin of the red candy apple is attributed to Newark, New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand. In addition, dipping apples in hot [[caramel]] a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Harte Appetite: Caramel apples with bourbon make for a grown-up confection|publisher=Southeast Missourian|url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1582293.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1909 [[Skee ball]]'''

Skee ball is a common game found in arcades and one of the first redemption games. Skee ball is similar to bowling except it is played on an inclined lane and the player aims to get the ball to fall into a hole rather than knock down pins. The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by rolling balls up an incline and into the designated point value holes. Skee ball was invented and patented in 1909 by J.D. Estes of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Skee Ball|publisher=Skee Ball Amusement Games|url=http://www.skeeball.com/about.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1909 [[Paper shredder]]'''

Paper shredders are used to cut paper into chad, typically either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, confidential, or otherwise sensitive documents. The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor [[Abbot Augustus Low]] of Horseshoe, New York. His patent for a "waste paper receptacle" to offer an improved method of disposing of waste paper received a U.S. patent on August 31, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Shredders|publisher=PSI|url=http://www.papershreddersinfo.com/historyofshredders.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1909 [[Suppressor]]'''
* A suppressor or silencer is a device either attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas, and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet. [[Hiram Percy Maxim]], the son of famous machine gun inventor [[Hiram Stevens Maxim]], is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silencers|publisher=CARYN E.

* The fifth wheel coupling provides a pivoting link between a [[semi-trailer]] and the towing truck, [[tractor unit]], leading trailer or [[Dolly (trailer)|dolly]]. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed in the bed of a [[pickup truck]] as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a [[Rotation|coupling pin]] (or kingpin) on the front of the semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How fifth wheels have advanced over the last century|publisher=Babcox Media, Inc.|url=http://www.fleetequipmentmag.com/Item/85469/how_fifth_wheels_have_advanced_over_the_last_century.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binder clip, or a banker's clip or foldback clip, is a simple device for binding sheets of paper together. It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily unlike the staple. The binder clip was invented in 1911 by Washington, D.C. resident Louis E. Baltzley who was motivated by a desire to help his father, Edwin, a prolific writer and inventor, keep manuscripts in order. The original design was modified five times, but the essential mechanism has never changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Big Clip Job?

'''1911 [[Automobile self starter]]'''

An automobile self-starter is an electric motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, [[Charles F. Kettering]] invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, but none of them were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of an electric motor attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Starter|publisher=Bryant University|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h364proj/sprg_97/dirksen/electric.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of self-starter is born|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=7587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autopilot is a mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic system used to guide a vehicle without assistance from a human being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called ''autopilot''. The first aircraft autopilot was invented by [[Lawrence Sperry]] in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawrence Sperry: Autopilot Inventor and Aviation Innovator|publisher=Weider History Group.|url=http://www.historynet.com/lawrence-sperry-autopilot-inventor-and-aviation-innovator.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traffic light, also known as traffic signal, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right.

The regenerative circuit allows an electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor. A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. [[Edwin Armstrong]], invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armstrong's Regerative Circuit|publisher=Info Age|url=http://www.campevans.org/_CE/html/regenrpt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018015712/http://www.campevans.org/_CE/html/regenrpt.html|archivedate=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1914 [[Fortune cookie]]'''
* A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil with a "fortune" wrapped inside. A "fortune" is a piece of paper with words of faux wisdom or a vague prophecy. In the United States, it is usually served with Chinese food in Chinese restaurants as a dessert. The message inside may also include a list of lucky numbers and a Chinese phrase with translation. Contrary to belief, the fortune cookie associated as a Chinese invention is a fallacy. In 1914, the Japanese-American named [[Makoto Hagiwara]] of the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco, California, introduced the fortune cookie and is thus recognized as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese American Fortune Cookie: A Taste of Fame or Fortune – Part II|publisher=Discover Nikkei|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1915 [[Skeet shooting]]'''
* Skeet shooting is an [[Olympic sport]] where participants attempt to break clay disks flung into the air at high speed from a variety of angles. The firearm of choice for this task is usually a high quality, double-barreled over and under shotgun with 28/30&amp;nbsp;inch barrels and open chokes. The event is in part meant to simulate the action of bird hunting. The shooter shoots from eight positions on a semicircle with a radius of {{convert|21|yd|m}}, and an 8th position halfway between stations 1 and 7. There are two houses that hold devices known as "traps" that launch the targets, one at each corner of the semicircle. Skeet shooting began in Andover, Massachusetts in 1915, when grouse hunter Charles Davis invented a game he called "shooting around the clock" to improve his wingshooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADD A LITTLE SIZZLE TO YOUR SHOOTING TRY THE SHOTGUN SPORTS|work=The Michigan Sportsman|url=http://www.michigan-sportsman.com/hunting_articles/shotgun_sports.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A supermarket is a self-service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise, organized into departments. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store. The concept of a "self-service" grocery store was invented by American entrepreneur [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]] and his Piggly Wiggly stores. Beforehand, customers would shop at a general store where a clerk behind a counter would fetch inventory in limited quantity for customers to purchase. With Saunders' new innovation of self-service, customers would be able to choose a wider selection of goods at competitive prices. Saunders' first store opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarence Saunders|publisher=Soylent Communications|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/054/000166553/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1916 [[Cloverleaf interchange]]'''

A cloverleaf interchange is a two-level interchange in which left turns, in countries that drive on the right, are handled by loop roads. To go left, in right-hand traffic, vehicles first pass either over or under the other road, then turn right onto a one-way three-fourths loop ramp (270°) and merge onto the intersecting road. The cloverleaf was first patented in the United States by Arthur Hale, a civil engineer in Maryland, on February 29, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Major Lane Change|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/07/local/me-cloverleaf7 | first=Hugo | last=Martin | date=April 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1916 [[Tow truck]]'''
* A tow truck is a vehicle used to transport motor vehicles to another location, generally a repair garage, or to recover vehicles which are no longer on a drivable surface. Vehicles are often towed in the case of breakdowns or collisions, or may be impounded for legal reasons. The tow truck was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes, Sr., of Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was a garage worker who was inspired to create the invention after he was forced to pull a car out of a creek using blocks, ropes, and six men. An improved design led him to manufacture wreckers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utc.edu/news07/ehf.php|title=Entrepreneurial Hall of fame inducts three|publisher=University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|date=May 17, 2007|accessdate=February 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623232310/http://www.utc.edu/news07/ehf.php|archivedate=June 23, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1916 [[Condenser microphone]]'''
* A condenser microphone, also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external [[phantom power]]. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at [[Bell Laboratories]] by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible with the advent of the vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell Laboratories and The Development of Electrical Recording|publisher=The Stokowski Legacy|url=http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toggle light switch is a switch, most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud "snap" or "click" noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J.

'''1918 [[French dip sandwich]]'''
* A French dip sandwich, also known as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a "French roll" or [[baguette]]. It is usually served ''[[au jus]]'' ("with juice"), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both ''[[Philippe's|Philippe the Original's]]'' and ''[[Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet]]'', two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich in a pan of ''au jus'''. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard. Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, ''Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet'' also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippe the Original – Los Angeles|work=Nation's Restaurant News|url=http://www.nrn.com/article/philippe-original-los-angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1918 [[Crystal oscillator]]'''
* A crystal oscillator is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time as used in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The first crystal-controlled oscillator, using a crystal of [[Rochelle Salt]], was invented by [[Alexander M. Nicholson]]. However, it is generally accepted that Dr. [[Walter Guyton Cady]] was the first to use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit. Nevertheless, Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the crystal oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RF and Microwave Transmitter Design|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLdHfULzhYC&amp;pg=SA8-PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1924 [[Cheeseburger]]'''
[[File:Cheeseburger.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A cheeseburger]]
A cheeseburger is a hamburger with cheese added to it. Traditionally the cheese is placed on top of the patty, but the burger can include many variations in structure, ingredients, and composition. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words "cheese" and "hamburger." The cheese is usually sliced, and then added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before the patty finishes cooking which allows the cheese to melt. Lionel C. Sternberger is believed to have invented the "cheese hamburger" in the 1920s in the Northeast portion of Los Angeles County. The earliest year attributed to the invention of the cheeseburger by Sternberger is in 1924, while others claimed that he invented it as late as 1926. According to ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', "a local restaurateur was identified as the inventor of the cheeseburger at his death in 1964.

The operation of the compass is based on the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]] with the Earth's magnetic field acting as the induction field for an electric generator. A variation generated voltage, thus allows the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. The earth inductor compass is an American invention. It was designed in 1924 by [[Morris Titterington]] at the [[Pioneer Instrument Company]]. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the [[magnetic compass]], the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earth Inductor Compass|publisher=Wings Publishing|url=http://www.oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1924 [[Moviola]]'''
* A Moviola is a device that allows a film editor to view film while editing. It was the first machine for motion picture editing in order to study individual shots in their cutting rooms that determine where the best cut-point might be. The vertically oriented Moviolas were the standard for film editing in the United States until the 1970s when horizontal flatbed editor systems became more common. In 1924, the Moviola was invented in the United States by Dutch-American [[Iwan Serrurier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INDUSTRY MOURNS ENTREPRENEUR MARK SERRURIER|publisher=Small Movies|url=http://www.city-net.com/~fodder/edit/moviola.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205203729/http://www.city-net.com/~fodder/edit/moviola.html|archivedate=2007-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1924 [[Radio altimeter]]'''
* A radio altimeter measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides the distance between the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer [[Lloyd Espenschied]] invented the radio altimeter. However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Altitude: The instrument of choice|publisher=Cygnus Interactive|url=http://www.amtonline.com/publication/article.jsp?pubId=1&amp;id=1337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1925 [[Reuben sandwich]]'''
* A Reuben sandwich is a hot sandwich of layered meat, [[sauerkraut]] and [[Swiss cheese]], with a dressing, usually [[Russian dressing|Russian]] or [[Thousand Island dressing]], that is grilled between slices of [[rye bread]]. The origins of the Reuben sandwich is disputed. The earliest claim of inventing the Reuben sandwich comes from Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925 when Ukrainian-American grocer Reuben Kulakofsky fed players in a late-night poker game at the [[Blackstone Hotel]] in downtown Omaha. The owner of the hotel was so taken with Reuben's sandwich that he put it on the hotel restaurant menu, designated by its inventor's name. It wasn't until 1956 when a waitress at the Blackstone named Fern Snider entered Reuben's sandwich in a national sandwich competition, one of the earliest documentations given to the name of the sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Reuben Sandwich|publisher=Jim Rader|url=http://www.rowlandweb.com/reuben/history.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story is that the Reuben sandwich hails from New York City.

A cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll filled with thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese of choice is Cheez Whiz, but American and provolone are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies in the balance of flavors, textures and what is often referred to as the "drip" factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor [[Pat Olivieri]] who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, [[Pat's King of Steaks]] on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authentic Philly Cheesesteaks|publisher=Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation|url= http://www.visitphilly.com/restaurants-dining/authentic-philly-cheesesteaks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LVT-4 1.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT) unloading a Willys MB during World War II]]
A Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT), also known as amtracks, alligators, or in their fire support variants as buffaloes, were amphibious tracked vehicles capable of crawling out of the water and onto the beach and beyond. Used primarily by the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan during World War II, later versions were thinly armored, and some were equipped with a light tank turret to provide fire support, making them equivalent to light amphibious tanks. Highly versatile in their use, LVT's landed supplies ashore at Guadalcanal and soldiers ashore at Tarawa, other variations of the LVT were equipped with flamethrowers during the Peleliu Campaign. The LVT was derived from the ''Alligator'', an amphibious vehicle invented by [[Donald Roebling]] in 1933 as a rescue vehicle for downed aviators in the Florida Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LVT Class, Allied Landing Craft|publisher=The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia|url=http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/L/v/LVT_class.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1933 [[Multiplane camera]]'''

The multiplane camera is a special motion picture camera used in the traditional animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another, creating a three-dimensional effect, although not stereoscopic. Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is sometimes referred to as a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, [[Ub Iwerks]] in 1933 invented the multiplane camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode 3: Ub Iwerks' ComiColor|publisher=animationstation's Podcast|url=http://www.animationstation.info/index.php?post_id=75948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1933 [[Frequency modulation]]'''
* In telecommunications, frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While working in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, [[Edwin Armstrong]] invented wide-band frequency modulation radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied the frequency of the wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the [[AM radio]] dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Inventor of FM|publisher=wfmu.org|url=http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/GreatDJ/armstrong.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An impact sprinkler is a type of [[irrigation sprinkler]] that pivots on a bearing on top of its threaded attachment nut, and is driven in a circular motion by a spring-loaded arm that is pushed back by the water stream, then returning to "impact" the stream. This produces an intermittent diffusion of the stream that provides a uniform waterfall closer to the sprinkler. In 1933, the impact sprinkler was invented and patented by lemon tree grower and farmer Orton Englehardt of Glendora, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Professional Practice of Landscape Architecture|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptCw_WcphbkC&amp;pg=PA136|isbn=978-0-471-28680-6|date=1996-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1934 [[Trampoline|Trampoline (modern)]]'''

A trampoline is a gymnastic and recreational device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by [[George Nissen]] and [[Larry Griswold]] around 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trampoline|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/nissen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Beach ball]]'''
[[File:BeachBall.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The beach ball]]
A beach ball is an inflatable ball for beach and water games. Their large size and light weight take little effort to propel; they travel very slowly and generally must be caught with two hands, making them ideal for lazy games and for children. Their lightness and size make them difficult to use in even moderate wind. The beach ball was invented in California by Jonathon DeLonge in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All-TIME 100 Greatest Toys|publisher=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048649_2049004,00.html | date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Fiberglass]]'''

The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been used for millennia. The use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. The first commercial production of fiberglass was in 1936. In 1938, fiberglass was invented by [[Russell Games Slayter]] of Owens-Corning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Wool and Method|publisher=Invent Now|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/297.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Xerography]]'''

Xerography, which means "dry writing" in Greek, is a process of making copies. Xerography makes copies without using ink. In this process, static electricity charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder is applied to the areas of the page to remain white. The [[photocopier]] was invented in 1938 by [[Chester Floyd Carlson]] who marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company, later called the Xerox Corporation, marketed it, and xerography eventually became common and inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester F. Carlson, Inventor of Xerography|publisher=University of Rochester Libraries|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Nylon]]'''
* In 1938, a team of researchers working under [[Wallace H. Carothers]] at [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] invented a plastic that can be drawn into strong, silk-like fibers. Nylon soon became popular as a fabric for hosiery as well as industrial applications such as cordage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of Nylon by Wallace Carothers|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/nylon.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Operant conditioning chamber]]'''
* Also known as a Skinner box, an operant conditioning chamber is a laboratory apparatus used in the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] to study animal behavior.

In 1938, J.F. "Grandpa" McCullough and his son Alex co-invented soft serve ice cream, devising a new way to serve ice cream in its soft, creamy form that it takes before going into the deep freeze to make it scoopable. After Alex McCullough commissioned Harry Oltz in 1939 to design the first soft serve ice cream machine, similar to ones used for making frozen custard, the [[Dairy Queen]] franchise was founded when Sherb Noble opened the first store in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dairy Queen history curls though area|publisher=Moline Dispatch Publishing Company, L.L.C.|url=http://www.qconline.com/progress98/business/prqueen2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1938 [[Teflon]]'''

'''1939 [[Yield sign]]'''

In road transport, a yield sign or give way sign indicates that a vehicle driver must prepare to stop if necessary to let a driver on another approach proceed. However, there is no need to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer [[Clinton Riggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In a sign of the times, inventor refuses to yield|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19890830&amp;id=Qkg0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2072,9591990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1939 [[VU meter]]'''

A VU meter is often included in analog circuit, audio equipment to display a signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a "slow" measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of [[Bell Labs]] and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this and call it a VU meter.

'''1939 [[Starting gate]]'''
* A starting gate, also known as starting stalls, is a machine used in the sports of [[Thoroughbred horse racing|thoroughbred horse]] and [[dog racing]] to ensure a fair start in a race. The starting gate was invented by [[Clay Puett]] of Chillicothe, Texas when it was used at Lansdowne Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for the first time on July 1, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man Who Gave Racing A Fresh Start|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136286/index.ht | date=October 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. patent #2,232,675 was filed by Puett on August 7, 1939 and issued to him on February 18, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starting Gate|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=2eRWAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1939 [[Twist tie]]'''
* A twist tie is a metal wire that is encased in a thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the openings of bags, such as [[garbage bag]]s or [[bread bag]]s. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Profile|publisher=Twist Ems|url=http://www.twistems.com/pages/profile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1939 [[Automated teller machine]]'''
[[File:Atm os2warp.jpg|180px|left|thumb| A Suncorp Metway ATM]]
An automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an [[ATM card]]. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor [[Luther George Simjian]] initially came up with the idea of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luther Simjian|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/simjian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1939 [[Vocoder]]'''

A vocoder, a portmanteau of the words voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist [[Homer Dudley]] invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYNTH SECRETS Part 15: An Introduction To ESPS And Vocoders|publisher=SOS Publications Group|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul00/articles/synthsec.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1940 [[Fluxgate magnetometer]]'''
* A fluxgate magnetometer measures the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields. Fluxgate magnetometer sensors are manufactured in several geometries and recently have made significant improvements in noise performance, crossfield tolerance and power utilization. The fluxgate magnetometer was invented by [[Victor Vacquier]] in 1940 while working for Gulf Research in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Notice: Renowned Geophysicist and Professor: Victor Vacquier Sr.|publisher=University of California at San Diego|url=http://scrippsnews.ucsd.edu/Releases/?releaseID=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1941 [[Aerosol Bomb]]'''
* An Aerosol bomb is a hand-held container or dispenser from which an aerosol is released. Developed in 1941 by [[Lyle D. Goodhue]] and William N. Sullivan and patented in 1943.
  
'''1941 [[Deodorant]]'''
* Deodorants are substances applied to the body to reduce body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. [[Jules Montenier]] holds a number of patents. Arguably, his January 28, 1941 patent for Astringent Preparation is his most famous which dealt with solving the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride, then and now the best working antiperspirant, by adding a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This innovation found its way into "Stopette" deodorant spray, which ''Time'' Magazine called "the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poof! There Goes Perspiration|publisher=OTR Commercials|url=http://www.old-time.com/commercials/1950's/Poof%20There%20Goes%20Perspiration.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1941 [[Acrylic fiber]]'''
* Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer Polyacrylonitrile with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. To be called acrylic in the United States, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. The Dupont Corporation invented the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name "Orlon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orlon : 1941|publisher=DuPont|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1941_dupont/1941_overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1941 [[Solid body guitar|Electric guitar (solid body)]]'''
* A solid body electric guitar, made up of hardwood with a lacquer coating, is an [[electric guitar]] that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an [[amplifier]] or a [[Computer speaker|speaker]]. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist [[Les Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Paul|publisher=Invent Now|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/225.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610005558/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/225.html|archivedate=2011-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1943 [[Magnetic proximity fuze]]'''

A magnetic proximity fuze is a type of [[proximity fuze]] that initiates a detonator in a piece of ordnance such as a land mine, naval mine, depth charge, or shell when the fuse's magnetic equilibrium is upset by a magnetic object such as a tank or a submarine. In 1943, Panayottis John Eliomarkakis of Philiadelphia filed U.S. patent #2,434,551 which was issued on January 13, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetic Fuze|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=bp9HAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1943 Modern Coal Burning Steam Locomotive'''

This invention was only primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers to heat the fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was semi-bituminous and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.

'''1943 [[Slinky]]'''

A Slinky or "Lazy Spring" is a toy consisting of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer [[Richard T. James]] while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs that could be used to support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring "stepped" in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the [[Gimbels]], a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Slinky|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/slinky.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' 1945 [[Microwave oven]]'''
[[File:Microwave.750pix.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A microwave oven with a turn table located inside]]
A microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by [[Percy Spencer]] on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Invented Microwaves?|publisher= J. Carlton Gallawa|url=http://www.gallawa.com/microtech/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first microwave oven built at the company which was called the "Radarange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Leadership |publisher=Raytheon |url=http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/leadership/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322044917/http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/leadership/ |archivedate=March 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1945 [[Cruise control]]'''

Cruise control automatically controls the rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle of the car to maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named [[Ralph Teetor]]. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Teetor: Inventor of Cruise Control|publisher=Dennis Horvath|url=http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104031820/http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|archivedate=2005-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1945 [[Block heater]]'''
* A block heater warms the engine of an [[automobile]] in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a [[power cord]] often routed through the vehicle's [[grille]]. The block heater may replace one of the engine's [[core plug]]s, or may be installed in line with one of the [[radiator]] or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by [[Andrew Freeman (inventor)|Andrew Freeman]] in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your car starts?

In [[contract]] law, a '''warranty''' has various meanings but generally means a guarantee or promise&lt;ref&gt;Hogg M. (2011). ''Promises and Contract Law:
Comparative Perspectives'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNaneRZu-_sC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 48]. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides [[wiktionary:assurance|assurance]] by one party to the other party that specific facts or conditions are true or will happen. This factual guarantee may be enforced regardless of materiality&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt;which allows for a [[legal remedy]] if that promise is not true or followed.

Although a warranty is in its simplest form an element of a contract, some warranties run with a product so that a manufacturer makes the warranty to a consumer with which the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship.

A warranty may be express or implied, depending on whether the warranty is explicitly provided (typically written) and the jurisdiction. Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at one point in time or that the fact will continue into the future (a "continuing warranty).

== Sale of goods ==
Warranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible [[product (business)|product]]s) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold "[[as is]]" with no warranties.

In the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] which provide for implied warranties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts14.htm Warranties in Sales of Goods]. LexisNexis Study Outlines.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these implied warranties were often limited by [[disclaimer]]s. In 1975 the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]] was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods.&lt;ref name=12Magnuson/&gt; Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered.&lt;ref name=12Magnuson&gt;[http://www.jtexconsumerlaw.com/V11N3/JCCL_Magnuson.pdf 12 Reasons to Love the Magnuson-Moss Act]. ''Journal of Texas Consumer Law''. Reprinted with permission from the [[National Consumer Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and "[[lemon law]]s" apply to motor vehicles.

=== Implied warranty ===
{{Main article|Implied warranty}}

Implied warranties are unwritten promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, and the inherent understanding by the buyer, rather than from the express representations of the seller. In the United States, Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (which has been adopted with variations in each [[U.S. state|state]]) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an "[[as is]]" statement):

*The '''warranty of merchantability''' is implied unless expressly disclaimed by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase "[[as is]]" or "with all faults."  To be "merchantable", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects may violate the warranty if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit "as passes ordinarily in the trade".  In [[Massachusetts]] [[consumer protection]] law, it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers.
*The '''warranty of fitness for a particular purpose''' is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow.

=== Defects In Materials and Workmanship. ===
The most common kind of warranty on goods is a warranty that the product is free from defects in materials and workmanship.  This simply promises that the manufacturer properly constructed the product, out of proper materials.  This implies that the product will perform as well as such products customarily do.

It is common for these to be limited warranties, limiting the time the buyer has to make a claim.  For example, a typical 90-day warranty on a television gives the buyer 90 days from the date of purchase to claim that the television was improperly constructed.  Should the television fail after 91 days of normal usage, which because televisions customarily last longer than 91 days means there was a defect in the materials or workmanship of the television, the buyer nonetheless may not collect on the warranty because it is too late to file a claim.

Time-limited warranties are often confused with performance warranties.  A 90-day performance warranty would promise that the television would work for 90 days, which is fundamentally different from promising that it was delivered free of defects and limiting the time the buyer has to prove otherwise..  But because the usual evidence that a product was delivered defective is that it later breaks, the effect is very similar.

One situation in which the effect of a time-limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds a normal lifetime of the product.  If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out would not be able to collect on the warranty.  But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a warranty claim in Year 6.  On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years.

=== Satisfaction guarantee ===
In the United States, the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]] of 1976 provides for enforcement of a satisfaction guarantee warranty. In these cases, the advertiser must refund the full purchase price regardless of the reason for dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Andreoni J. (2005). [http://econ.ucsd.edu/~jandreon/WorkingPapers/verify.pdf Trust, Reciprocity, and Contract Enforcement: Experiments on Satisfaction Guaranteed].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifetime warranty ===
A lifetime warranty is usually a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship that has no time limit to make a claim, rather than a warranty that the product will perform for the lifetime of the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20090813.html Lifetime Warranties]. ''Warranty Week''. [https://www.webcitation.org/6H0uHIxKE WebCite Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual time that product can be expected to perform is normally determined by the custom for products of its kind used the way the buyer uses it.

If a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period longer. For example:

* the Cisco Limited Lifetime Warranty currently lasts for five years after the product has been discontinued, but only if you know where you bought it from as the seller is responsible for administering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Cisco Limited Lifetime Hardware Warranty Terms| url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/LH2DEN__.html| accessdate = 2008-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HP Networking product lifetime warranties last for as long as one owns the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = HP Networking warranty information| url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/support/warranty/index.aspx| accessdate = 2011-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breach of warranty ===
Warranties are violated when the promise is broken or the goods are not as expected. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The [[statute of limitations]] depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] § 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an [[unfair business practice]]. In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from [[revocation]] of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Davis T. (2009). [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/116813.pdf UCC Breach of Warranty and Contract Claims: Clarifying the Distinction]. ''Baylor Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an [[authorized service provider]]. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may [[void (law)|void]] (nullify) the warranty.  However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner's choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY ("Do It Yourself") repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner.

If the defective product causes injury, this may be a [[cause of action]] for a [[product liability]] lawsuit ([[tort]]). [[Strict liability]] may be applied.

== Extended warranty ==
In addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell extended warranties (also called service contracts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appliances - 247 Home Rescue  |url=https://www.247homerescue.co.uk/appliance-breakdown-cover/ |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=247 Home Rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, "acts of God", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.

These types of warranties are provided for various products, but [[automobile]]s and [[Small appliance|electronics]] are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as [[Best Buy]] may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of [[reverse competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199569 Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation].&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an auto warranty from a [[car dealership]] may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.

== Representations versus warranties ==
{{Further information|Misrepresentation}}

Statements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent.&lt;ref name=Primack2009&gt;Primack MA. (2009). [http://www.natlawreview.com/article/representations-warranties-and-covenants-back-to-basics-contracts Representations, Warranties and Covenants: Back to the Basics in Contracts]. ''National Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear;&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009/&gt; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States.&lt;ref name=West&amp;Lewis2009&gt;West GD, Lewis WB. (2009).

&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Appliance warranty]] --&gt;

====Canada and United States====

Written warranties on new major appliances, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[kitchen stove]]s and [[dishwasher]]s, usually cover the cost of parts and labor to repair defects in materials or workmanship which appear under normal home use.

Warranties often cover defects up to a year after purchase or delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.angieslist.com/articles/are-extended-warranties-appliances-worth-it.htm |title=Are Extended Warranties on Appliances Worth It? |last=Moor |first=Tom |year=2016 |publisher=Angies' List |publication-date=2016-07-22 | accessdate=16 January 2017|quote=Most manufacturers offer warranties for appliances that last from three months to up to one year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some exclude new owners when a house or appliance is sold within the year ([[Frigidaire]],&lt;ref name="frigidaire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://manuals.frigidaire.com/prodinfo_pdf/Anderson/241979200en.pdf | title=Frigidaire, All about the Use &amp; Care of your Refrigerator | publisher=Electrolux | accessdate=11 September 2016 | pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LG]],&lt;ref name="lg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lg.com/us/support-product/lg-LFX31925ST | title=LG OWNER’S MANUAL FRENCH DOOR REFRIGERATOR | publisher=LG | accessdate=11 September 2016 | pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]]&lt;ref name="whirlpool"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whirlpool.com/digitalassets/ET0MSRXTL/Warranty_EN.pdf | title=WHIRLPOOL® REFRIGERATOR WARRANTY | publisher=Whirlpool | accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Some manufacturers cover refrigerators' sealed parts (compressors, tubing, etc.) for five years ([[General Electric]],&lt;ref name="ge"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://products.geappliances.com/MarketingObjectRetrieval/Dispatcher?RequestType=PDF&amp;Name=003671728.PDF | title=GE Appliances, Refrigerators, Owner's Manual | publisher=General Electric | accessdate=11 September 2016 | pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]],&lt;ref name="samsung"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/html/warrantyinformation/warrantyinformation7.html | title=Refrigerator Product Info | publisher=Samsung | accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whirlpool]])&lt;ref name="whirlpool" /&gt; or seven years ([[LG]]&lt;ref name="lg" /&gt;) or ten years ([[KitchenAid]]&lt;ref name="kitchenaid"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kitchenaid.com/digitalassets/MLPDF/Warranty%20Page%20-%202305802-W.pdf | title=KITCHENAID® REFRIGERATOR WARRANTY | publisher=KitchenAid | accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Warranties on [[Water heating|water heaters]] cover parts for 5 to 12 years in single family residences, one year otherwise. They do not cover new owners when a house or heater is sold; nor do they cover the original owner if the heater is moved to a second location.&lt;ref name="rheem"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cdn.globalimageserver.com/fetchDocument.aspx?id=95f29833-68e0-4e84-8f1a-3adea90df312 |title=Certificate of Limited Warranty, Rheem and Ruud Water Heaters |date=2014-09-01 |website=ruud.com/product/ruud-residential-electric-water-heaters-professional-achiever-series-standard-electric/#specs-docs |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank models from [[A. O. Smith]] do not allow heating elements to be replaced with lower (or higher) wattages, and do not cover renter-occupied single family.

Smith's tank models for [[manufactured housing]] do not provide coverage if a whirlpool or hot tub is connected.&lt;ref name="smith-mh"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank water heater warranties exclude labor, liability for water damage, and shipping cost to return the old heater or parts. Tankless warranties do not exclude water damage; they cover labor for a year, and Ruud/Rheem covers return shipping on tankless models.&lt;ref name="ruud-tl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith-tl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith's tankless water heaters do not restrict coverage to a single family, and require professional installation.&lt;ref name="smith-tl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Implied warranties under US law could extend for longer periods. However, most states allow the written warranties to include clauses which limit these implied warranties to the same time period as the written warranty.&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/05/the-word-on-warranty-protection/index.htm | title=What you need to know about warranty laws | publisher=Consumer Reports | date=2013 | accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Car warranty ===

====United States====

New car factory warranties commonly range from one year to five years and in some cases extend even 10 years, with typically a mileage limit as well. Car warranties can be extended by the manufacturer or other companies with a renewal fee.

Used car warranties are usually 3 months and 3,000 miles

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, types of warranties have been classified as either an: 
# original manufacturer warranty, 
# insurance warranty underwritten and regulated as insurance or 
# obligor warranty, typically written by a car dealership or garage.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA), which began to regulate insurance contracts in this context in 2005, determined that additional warranties sold by car dealerships are "unlikely to be insurance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsa.gov.uk/smallfirms/resources/factsheets/pdfs/factsheet10.pdf What is a contract of insurance?]. Financial Services Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance warranties may offer greater protection to the consumer.

=== Home Warranty ===
{{Main article|Home warranty}}

A home warranty protects against the costs of home and appliance repair by offering home warranty coverage for houses, townhomes, condominiums, mobile homes, and new construction homes. When a problem occurs with a covered appliance or mechanical system such as an air conditioning unit or furnace, a service technician repairs or replaces it. The homeowner may have to pay for a service call fee and the home warranty company pays the balance for the repair or replacement of the covered item.

==Warranty data==
Warranty data consists of claims data and supplementary data. Claims data are the data collected during the servicing of claims under warranty and supplementary data are additional data such as production and marketing data.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;Wu S. (2012). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qre.1282 Warranty Data Analysis: A Review]. ''[[Quality and Reliability Engineering International]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This data can help determine product reliability and plan for future modifications.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;

Zeobit LLC (stylized ZeoBIT) was a technology and [[software]] company formed in 2009 by CEO Slava Kolomiychuk and located in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. The company specialized in computer security software and internet security. As of December 2016, it is no longer in business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/business-reviews/computer-software-publishers-and-developers/zeobit-in-sunnyvale-ca-1000004640#reasonrating ZeoBIT, LLC Business Review in Sunnyvale, California]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeobit is best known for the bundled utility software [[MacKeeper]]. The software has received mixed reviews with reviewers being very divided as to the effectiveness of the product.

== History ==

Zeobit LLC was incorporated in September 2009 in the US State of [[California]] by Slava Kolomiychuk. Zeobit has a management headquarters in [[Sunnyvale, California]] and partnership offices in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] that house developers and the customer support. In March 2010 their first product, [[MacKeeper]] (for [[macOS]]) was released and in September 2010 PCKeeper (for [[Microsoft Windows]]) was released.  
 
On May 13, 2010, the first beta version of MacKeeper, version 0.8, was released.

On October 4, 2010, PCKeeper (MacKeeper's equivalent for Windows PCs) (version 1.1.48) was released. 

On October 26, 2010, Zeobit released MacKeeper 1.0.

On January 30, 2012, MacKeeper 2.0 was released with updates in security, data control, cleaning and optimization.

In 2014, a Pennsylvania woman filed a class action lawsuit against Zeobit LLC, claiming that the company's computer security program identifies problems that don't exist and generates false error messages to scare users into purchasing an upgrade. (see Holly Yencha, et al. v. Zeobit LLC, Case No. 2:13-cv-00578, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.) According to the complaint filed in US District court, "Once installed, MacKeeper prompts the user to conduct a diagnostic scan", the MacKeeper class action lawsuit says. "This scan purportedly detects errors that lead to the problems identified in Zeobit's marketing materials (i.e., performance issues, security and privacy threats)—problems that MacKeeper is supposedly designed to fix." However, the Zeobit class action lawsuit alleges that after the diagnostic scan is completed, MacKeeper reports that it identified thousands of issues that cause the computer to be in "critical" condition. While the trial version of MacKeeper purports to "fix" a limited number of the issues, customers are encouraged to purchase a full, registered version of the security software to fully repair the computer. Yencha alleges that neither the free trial nor the full versions of MacKeeper perform reliable diagnostic testing of the computer. "Instead, Zeobit intentionally designed MacKeeper to invariably and ominously report that a user's Mac needs repair and is at-risk due to harmful (but fabricated) errors, privacy threats, and other computer problems, regardless of the computer's actual condition", the class action lawsuit alleges. The Class Action was settled in 2015 with no admission of wrongdoing and customers were given refunds.

=== MacKeeper ===
{{main article|MacKeeper}}
[[MacKeeper]] is utility software for macOS that claims to provide tools for security, cleaning, optimization and data control. MacKeeper and Zeobit were the official sponsors of the MacWorld / iWorld  expo in San Francisco, California in 2011 &amp; 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworldiworld.com/sponsors ZeoBIT is MacWorld sponsor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630063114/http://www.macworldiworld.com/sponsors |date=June 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by Kromtech Alliance Corp in May 2013. 

MacKeeper is often criticized for unethical marketing tactics, including [[pop-up advertising]] and buying domain names similar to the names of other antivirus programs.&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Thomas|title=Ongoing MacKeeper Fraud|url=http://www.thesafemac.com/ongoing-mackeeper-fraud/|website=The Safe Mac|publisher=Malwarebytes|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeobit claims their affiliates were responsible for the advertising accused as unethical.&lt;ref name=fraud /&gt; MacKeeper is sometimes referred to as a [[potentially unwanted program]] and is detected by some antivirus programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Thomas|title=PUP Friday: MacKeeper|url=https://blog.malwarebytes.com/puppum/2016/08/pup-friday-mackeeper/|website=Malwarebytes Labs|publisher=Malwarebytes|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PCKeeper ===
PCKeeper is a bundle of most important system utilities for performing different tasks on the PС, such as antivirus, data control and optimization tools, drive clean-up utilities and much more. According to [[Virus Bulletin]], PCKeeper has scored 91.9% in RAP test and was listed as number 6 antivirus in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/test?id=74 Virus Bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by Kromtech Alliance Corp in May 2013.

=== ZeoDisk ===
The ZeoDisk project is a cloud storage solution that will also be integrated in to the existing Zeobit products.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

== Partnerships ==
In 2011 Zeobit partnered with [[Avira]] to integrate their virus database technology in [[Mackeeper|MacKeeper]] and PCKeeper’s [[Internet Security]] features. This partnership allowed Zeobit to offer internet security options for the [[macOS]], [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] computing platforms.

Zeobit was a member of the [[Better Business Bureau]]. It had an F rating, due to complaints about its advertising and the quality of its products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/business-reviews/computer-software-publishers-and-developers/zeobit-in-sunnyvale-ca-1000004640#reasonrating ZeoBIT, LLC Business Review in Sunnyvale, California] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807151725/https://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/business-reviews/computer-software-publishers-and-developers/zeobit-in-sunnyvale-ca-1000004640#reasonrating}}&lt;/ref&gt;
