The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' began on 26 January 2009 with the political opposition movement led by [[Antananarivo]] mayor [[Andry Rajoelina]], which sought to oust [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]] from the presidency. The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.

The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional.  Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] and the [[African Union]] have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement.

Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka|Ratsiraka]]), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, [[Omer Beriziky]], was appointed. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Presidential and parliamentary elections]] were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.

== Origins of the conflict ==
[[File:LocationMadagascar.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Madagascar in Africa]]
In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of [[Antananarivo]]. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; He condemned what he called the "restriction of freedom" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the [[South Korea|Korean]] industrial company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;

Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; As anti-government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.&lt;ref name="135killed" /&gt; The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-2" /&gt;

== Protests ==
{{Politics of Madagascar}}
[[File:Madagascar-carte.png|thumb|left|160px|The protests took place in [[Antananarivo]], the capital and largest city in [[Madagascar]].]]
Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24–25 January 2009, in the capital city, [[Antananarivo]], against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in [[Pretoria]], and flew back to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, "The call for [[revolt]] and [[civil disobedience]]... corresponds to a coup d'état...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions."&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; That same day, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[Télévision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1&amp;nbsp;pm local time on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; About an hour later demonstrators burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24two" /&gt; The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-4" /&gt; In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned.

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name=cna/&gt;

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bbcnews2" /&gt; He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-5" /&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."&lt;ref name="reuters2" /&gt;

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-6" /&gt; On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-7" /&gt; On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt; Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision".&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-8" /&gt;

Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-9" /&gt;

=== Shooting at opposition rally ===
On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-10" /&gt; The demonstrators marched towards [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] and crossed the "ligne rouge" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-11" /&gt; Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals".&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; This brought the number of people killed since the start of the [[political violence]] to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-12" /&gt;

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-13" /&gt;

On 9 February, Defence Minister [[Cécile Manorohanta]] announced her resignation, saying, "After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-14" /&gt; Chief of military staff [[Mamy Ranaivoniarivo]] was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day.&lt;ref name="Defence" /&gt;

7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-15" /&gt;

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-16" /&gt;

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-17" /&gt; Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-18" /&gt; Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-19" /&gt;

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]]. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-20" /&gt; On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-21" /&gt; and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-22" /&gt; However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-23" /&gt;

=== Post-talks ===
A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in [[Fianarantsoa]] on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-24" /&gt; At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle "until we end this dictatorship". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-25" /&gt;

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]]. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-26" /&gt;

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told [[Agence France-Presse]] on 7 March that he was "now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked";&lt;ref name="AutoRI-27" /&gt; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

=== Mutiny and military leadership change ===
{{main article|2009 Camp Capsat mutiny}}
Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-28" /&gt; United Nations envoy [[Tiebilé Dramé]] said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina "under its protection in a diplomatic residence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-29" /&gt; The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General [[Edmond Rasolomahandry]], gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-30" /&gt; The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-31" /&gt; On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-32" /&gt; Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum.&lt;ref name="Lifts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-33" /&gt; A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-34" /&gt; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed.&lt;ref name=Lifts/&gt;

On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces&lt;ref name="AutoRI-35" /&gt; while the president's prime minister held a ten-minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-36" /&gt; The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-37" /&gt; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the [[Iavoloha Palace]] of the president, while some 3,000–5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-38" /&gt;

On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building.&lt;ref name="yn-2009-03-15" /&gt; Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, "is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-39" /&gt; Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6&amp;nbsp;pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office;&lt;ref name=yn-2009-03-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-40" /&gt; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-41" /&gt;

On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-42" /&gt; The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-43" /&gt;

== Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation ==
{{wikinews|Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army}}
On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's [[central bank]]. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted coup d'état". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-44" /&gt; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral [[Hyppolite Ramaroson]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-45" /&gt; Ravalomanana later said, "I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th."&lt;ref name="so-2009-16-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-46" /&gt; At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-47" /&gt; The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".&lt;ref name="lough1" /&gt; However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-18" /&gt; With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009-03-18/&gt; Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.&lt;ref name="aj-2009-03-19" /&gt; The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision.&lt;ref name="cbc-2009-03-21" /&gt;

Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt; Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-48" /&gt; Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will "explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-49" /&gt; According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'état but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions".&lt;ref name="gn-2009-03-21" /&gt; Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.&lt;ref name=gn-2009-03-21/&gt; No foreign diplomats were in attendance;&lt;ref name=cbc-2009-03-21/&gt; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-50" /&gt;

== Backlash ==
On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="pdo-2009-30-25" /&gt; According to their statement, the navy troops "condemn all violence against civilians" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the "civil war occurring in Madagascar".&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops claimed that there was "irrefutable" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of [[Malagasy ariary|ariaries]] and that they should face trials in accordance with military law.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt;

In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to "save the nation, defend the union and our national unity" because Rajoelina's government was "destroying our country with their coup."&lt;ref name="bbc-25-03-2009" /&gt;

Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-51" /&gt; Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections.&lt;ref name="r-26-03-2009" /&gt; Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting.&lt;ref name="ap-26-03-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's political party, [[Tiako I Madagasikara]] (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-52" /&gt;

On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential [[pardon]] to 28 "[[political prisoner]]s" and that more would be pardoned in the future.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;

About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March,&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; the fourth consecutive of such protests.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-53" /&gt; One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-54" /&gt; Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt;

The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days.&lt;ref name="r-27-03-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration.&lt;ref name=r-27-03-2009/&gt;

On 28 March, between 15,000&lt;ref name="bbc-28-03-2009" /&gt; and 20,000&lt;ref name="AutoRI-55" /&gt; protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day.&lt;ref name="aj-28-03-2009" /&gt; In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon.&lt;ref name=aj-28-03-2009/&gt; While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air&lt;ref name="AutoRI-56" /&gt; and used tear gas&lt;ref name=bbc-28-03-2009/&gt; to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people.&lt;ref name="ap-28-03-2009" /&gt; A young protester named "Razily", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a [[cause célèbre]] when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, "Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime."&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; Protests continued nearly every day thereafter.&lt;ref name="bbc-20-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21" /&gt;

On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not "interfere" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp-30-03-2009" /&gt;

Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing [[Manandafy Rakotonirina]] as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-57" /&gt;

On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada,&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; A [[BBC]] reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; [[List of heads of government of Madagascar|Prime Minister]] [[Roindefo Monja]] announced that "all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order."&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day.&lt;ref name="afp-22-04-2009" /&gt; Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days.&lt;ref name=afp-22-04-2009/&gt;

Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April.&lt;ref name="ap-23-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-23-04-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests.&lt;ref name=bbc-23-04-2009/&gt; Six protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="afp-23-04-2009" /&gt;

After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as "the mastermind of last week's violence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-58" /&gt; Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-59" /&gt;

=== Reconciliation meeting ===
At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] would be held in September 2009, [[Malagasy parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary elections]] in March 2010 and [[Malagasy presidential election, 2010|presidential elections]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-62" /&gt;

On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name="bbc-11-04-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, [[Tiébilé Dramé]], acting as an impartial mediator.&lt;ref name="afp-11-04-2009" /&gt; In response, Dramé said he was "seeking a consensus" rather than an "imposed solution".&lt;ref name=afp-11-04-2009/&gt; On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.&lt;ref name=bbc-11-04-2009/&gt;

At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-63" /&gt; However, on 25 May 2009 the party of [[Didier Ratsiraka]] withdrew from the talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-64" /&gt;

=== Mediation crisis talks ===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator. Representatives came from the [[African Union]] (AU), United Nations (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-70" /&gt;

== Unity government deal ==
On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power-sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co-presidents, [[Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina]], aide to former President Ravalomanana and [[Emmanuel Rakotovahiny]], aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister [[Eugene Mangalaza]] who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-71" /&gt;

During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in [[Marojejy National Park]] and other conservation areas in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable [[rosewood]] trees.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January–October 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March–April 2009 alone from the [[Vohemar]] and [[Toamasina]] ports.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4–5 lighter trees, and several [[rosewood]] species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1–5 trees per hectare.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs.&lt;ref name="gm-18-04-2009" /&gt; Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Bribery of customs officials has been reported.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already [[critically endangered]] species such as the [[silky sifaka]] [[lemur]],&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; one of the top 25 most endangered [[primate]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-72" /&gt; A statement jointly released by several [[non-governmental organizations]] criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and [[slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn farming]] occurring in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="fn-30-03-2009" /&gt; The joint statement said that "These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage."&lt;ref name=fn-30-03-2009/&gt; The groups who issued the statement were [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, [[The Peregrine Fund]], ONG Fanamby, [[Madagascar Fauna Group]], L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-73" /&gt;

=== Contracts ===
In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="ft-2009-03-19" /&gt; Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased {{convert|1300000|ha|km2}} of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-74" /&gt; for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-19" /&gt; On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its "approach was wrong", even though "the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome".&lt;ref name="bb-10-04-2009" /&gt; As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation&lt;ref name=bb-10-04-2009/&gt; and would proceed with the project regardless.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company [[Sherritt International]] said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-75" /&gt; On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-76" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-77" /&gt; After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt;

On 28 January 2009, the [[Confederation of African Football]] canceled a match between Madagascar's [[Academie Ny Antsika]] and [[Réunion]]'s [[US Stade Tamponnaise|Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise]], which was set to be played in Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-78" /&gt;

* {{flag|SADC|name=South African Development Community}} refused to recognize Rajoelina's presidency because "his appointment does not only violate the constitution of Madagascar, but also international principles, like the SADC, AU and United Nations protocols."&lt;ref name="ioc 2009-03-19" /&gt; The SADC "strongly condemns in the strongest terms the circumstances that led to the ousting of a democratically elected president of Madagascar."&lt;ref name="ioc 2009-03-19" /&gt; The SADC says that elections should be held within six months, rather than twenty-four months as proposed by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="r-30-03-2009" /&gt; The SADC suspended Madagascar's membership until it restores constitutional order, and it urged Rajoelina to step down so that Ravalomanana could be reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="gn 2009-03-31" /&gt; If Rajoelina does not comply with its decisions, the "SADC shall in collaboration with the African Union and the United Nations consider other options to restore constitutional normalcy."&lt;ref name="gn 2009-03-31" /&gt; On 1 April, Madagascar withdrew its membership in the SADC.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-92" /&gt; A delegation from the SADC visited Madagascar on 20 April, and another delegation visited on 23 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-93" /&gt;
* {{flag|UN|name=United Nations}} Secretary General [[Ban Ki Moon]] called on the Malagasy Government to give absolute priority to protection of the general population. He expressed concern about "the serious unrest" and the deaths.&lt;ref name="Ban: Protect Madagascans" /&gt; Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs [[Haile Menkerios]] said that the United Nations urges "quick and inclusive elections" to return to a constitutional government in a process decided upon by the current and former governments.&lt;ref name="x 2009-04-08" /&gt;

=== Sanctions and suspensions of aid ===
Since 16 March, Norway has instituted sanctions, mostly consisting of a freeze of economic aid, primarily due to the unstable atmosphere in the country prior to the resignation of Ravalomanana, and it has retained such sanctions for the time being.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-94" /&gt;

On 20 March, [[State Department of the United States|U.S. State Department]] spokesman Robert Wood said the United States will suspend all non-humanitarian assistance to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="gn 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The [[Peace and Security Council]] of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an "unconstitutional" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-95" /&gt; The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months.&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-96" /&gt; and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any "extra-constitutional" regime change.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-97" /&gt; The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-98" /&gt;

On 31 March, the [[European Union]] said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-99" /&gt;

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-100" /&gt; The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt; and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-101" /&gt;

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt;

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt;

'''Applied folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and [[traditional]] [[culture|cultural]] materials to address or solve real social problems.  The term was coined in 1939 in a talk by [[folklorist]] [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] who, along with [[Alan Lomax]], became the foremost proponent of this approach over the next thirty years.  Applied folklore is similar in its rationale and approach to [[applied anthropology]] and other [[applied social science]]s, and like these other applied approaches often distinguishes itself from "pure" research, that which has no explicit problem-solving aims.

Botkin's development of the approach emerged from his work on the collecting by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] of [[oral history|oral narratives]] of former [[slaves]], when he worked for the [[Library of Congress]].  He saw the dissemination of these materials as having the potential to improve [[race relations]] in the [[United States]] and to combat prejudice.  The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]] had similarly used the oral narratives of escaped slaves, such as those collected by [[William Still]] in his ''[[Underground Railroad]] Records'', to draw support for their cause.  Botkin's landmark work, ''[[Lay My Burden Down (book)|Lay My Burden Down]]'' (1945) was the first American book to treat oral [[testimony|testimonies]] as [[historiography|historical]] [[evidence]], and it was another thirty years before this became accepted practice.  Botkin also worked with [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] activist [[Rachel Davis DuBois]] to develop public programs to improve race and [[ethnic]] relations by incorporating cultural practices and materials into neighborhood events, such as [[festivals]] and block parties.  Independent of this, [[Myles Horton]], [[Zilphia Horton]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Candie Carawan]], and others at the [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[Tennessee]] incorporated [[folk song]] and [[folk dance]] into the training of [[civil rights]] activists, such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]].

In the 1960s, other American folklorists began to apply knowledge gained from folkloric sources to address social issues, most notably drawing on [[folk medicine]] in the teaching and practice of [[holistic health|holistic]] and [[cross-cultural]] approaches to [[medicine]] and [[public health]].  Folklorists also began to work as consultants in [[city planning]], [[gerontology]], [[economic development]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] [[education]], [[conservation biology|conservation]], and other fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Archaeobiology''', the study of the biology of ancient times through archaeological materials, is a [[Archaeological sub-disciplines|subspecialty]] of [[archaeology]]. It can be seen as a blanket term for [[paleobotany]], animal [[osteology]], zooarchaeology, microbiology, and many other sub-disciplines. Specifically, plant and animal remains are also called [[ecofacts]]. Sometimes these ecofacts can be left by humans and sometimes they can be naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Robert|title=Archaeology: Down To Earth|year=2014|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-60864-6|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeobiology tends to focus on more recent finds, so the difference between archaeobiology and [[palaeontology]] is mainly one of date: archaeobiologists typically work with more recent, non-[[fossil]]ised material found at archaeological sites. Only very rarely are archaeobiological excavations performed at sites with no sign of human presence.

The prime interest of [[paleobotany]] is to reconstruct the vegetation that people in the past would have encountered in a particular place and time.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant studies have always been overshadowed by faunal studies because bones are more conspicuous than plant remains when excavating.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"/&gt; Collection of plant remains could everything including pollen, soil, diatoms, wood, plant remains and [[phytoliths]]. Phytoliths are sediments and diatoms are water deposits. Each plant remain can tell the archaeologist different things about the environment during a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains were the first evidence used by 19th century archaeologists. Today, archaeologists use faunal remains as a guide to the environment. It helps archaeologists understand whether the fauna were present naturally or through activities of carnivores or people.&lt;ref name="Renfrew and Bahn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists deal with [[macrofauna]] and [[microfauna]]. Microfauna are better indicators of climate and environmental change than larger species. These can be as small as a bug or as big as a fish or bird.  Macrofauna helps archaeologists build a picture of past human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacteria and Protists in Archaeology==
[[Bacteria]] and [[Protists]] form two separate  kingdoms, but both are fairly similar when compared. Bacteria are [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] microorganisms, while protists are a group of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. Because both are microorganisms, both fall under the study of [[microbiology]] and special techniques are required for archaeologists to even see them.
Archaeologists, in order to find these microorganisms in a site, have to first take samples from the site and bring them in for lab analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herring|first=Angela|title=Ancient bacteria go under the lens|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2013/10/ancient-bacteria-go-under-the-lens/|publisher=Northeaster.edu|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in the lab, they can use equipment such as [[optical microscope]]s, in order to actually see evidence of micro organic remains. Archaeologists that look at these microorganisms do not actually find the living bacteria or protist, but instead find indentations left behind in material from where they had been. Depending on where the indentations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Stephen|title=Microarchaeology: Beyond the Visible Archaeological Record|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were in the [[strata]], archaeologists can determine the age of the microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Devin|title=Bacterial traces from 3.5 billion years ago are oldest fossils; experts say|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-31/national/36103962_1_australian-rocks-sedimentary-rocks-oldest-fossils|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleomycology==
[[Paleomycology]] is the study of [[fungi]] in the fossil record. The study of past fungi can lead to the evolutionary past. Much of fungi are made up of parasites of animals, plants or insects. Most of the contemporary fungi resemble its ancestors, dating back over a million years ago. For example, “In the Dominican amber, a mosquito was found with several types of parasitic fungi growing on its outside cuticle. What is interesting is that the fungi resemble modern day fungi in class Trichomycetes, which are common gut-inhabiting zygomycetes of insects, but they differ from Trichomycetes in that the fungi are on the outside of the insect rather than the inside.” The study of ancient fungi can be used to track the evolution of fungi through millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodge|first=Kathie|title=Paleomycology: Discovering the fungal contemporaries of dinosaurs|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2009/05/13/paleomycology-discovering-the-fungal-contemporaries-of-dinosaurs/|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osteology in Archaeology==
The study of [[osteology]] is a study of bones and can be a subdiscipline in archeology. Osteologists in archeology reconstruct bones of humans or animals from the past to find more about the past civilizations. . Osteology is used in archaeology to determine the age, gender, and ethnicity of the remains.  It is also helpful to rebuild past societies’ cultural background. Using the remains from the past can help modern archaeologist uncover the past from what they ate to their daily activities. This can help uncover the mysteries of past histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackinnon|first=Michael|title=Osteological Research in Classical Archaeology|journal=State of the Discipline|date=July 2007|pages=1|url=http://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/1113_MacKinnon.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used by [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and other [[Mesopotamian]] cultures beginning in the third millennium BC, '''clay nails''', also referred to as dedication or '''foundation pegs''', cones, or nails, were cone-shaped nails made of [[clay]], inscribed with [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], baked, and stuck into the mud-brick walls to serve as evidence that the [[temple]] or building was the divine property of the [[god]] to whom it was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=They Wrote on Clay |author=Edward Chiera |authorlink=Edward Chiera |editor=George G. Cameron |page=93 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1938 |isbn=978-0-226-10425-6 |series=Babylonian Tablets Speak Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Versions were also made of metal, including [[casting]]s with figurative designs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oscar White Muscarella|Muscarella, Oscar White]], ''Bronze and Iron: Ancient Near Eastern Artifacts in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'', pp. 303-312, 1988, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870995251}}, 9780870995255, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5sxqNhfmcQUC&amp;pg=PA303 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Hurrian foundation pegs]] (Syria, c. 2300 – c. 2159 BCE).

Additionally, uninscribed clay cones painted in different colors were used by Sumerians to create decorative [[mosaic]] patterns on walls and pillars of buildings, which also offered some protection against weathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cone mosaic excavated at the "Columned Hall," Uruk, Mesopotamia |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/L.1995.48.2 |publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar [[funerary cone]]s of [[ancient Egypt]] used the cone base as the major writing surface.

As some of the oldest 'documents' in history, the sponsor, responsible for the construction, or dedication of a work, some of the oldest histories, and/or intrigues are recorded. (Boasting sometimes led to historical inaccuracies, or misstatements of facts.)

===King Entemena===
King [[Entemena]]'s nail is a prime example of a clay nail in excellent condition, as well as a detailed story. He was king of [[Lagash]] towards the late-middle of the 3rd millennium BC.

===King Hammurabi===
One of King [[Hammurabi]]'s clay nails was acquired in March 1938 from an antique dealer. The nail, although fully preserved, is missing almost the entire shaft. The head has a diameter of 187 millimeters. In comparison, the shaft at the base is 110 millimeters in diameter. Both the head and shaft are inscribed with cuneiform writing in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. There are three columns of text on the head of the nail; the first column on the upper half having dulled over the course of centuries, and the lower half of the third column broken off. The clay nail bears the number A 24645 at the Oriental Institute, the [[University of Chicago]]'s archaeology museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelb|first1=I. J.|title=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1948|volume=7|issue=4|pages=267–271|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/542219?sid=21105499609531&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=70 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two replicas of the clay nail with the same inscription located at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] and the [[Oxford Museum]]. However, each were transliterated and translated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clay|first1=A. T.|title=The American Journal of Theology|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1916|volume=20|issue=3|pages=427–430|jstor=3155663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia version is filled with missing text, although the complication was solved with the help of the Chicago version. Simultaneously, the Oxford text gives the Sumerian version. All three clay nails are now preserved in each of their respected locations. They are easily recognized to be from the Hammurabi period due to their distinct style of having a mushroom shape, broad heads, and short shafts.

A '''commissioned survey''' is a kind of archaeological and social survey performed in return for money or goods. Typically, these surveys were conducted in the pre [[Colony|colonial Era]], as part of Age of European Enlightenment to study territories before colonization. They would usually extend to significant and detailed efforts by trading companies to study institutions of indigenous communities as a precursor to colonial powers exerting colonial supremacy. An example would be when soldiers of [[East India Company]] were paid fees to study exotic lands, customs, cultures and literatures of the colonized world. The end product of a commissioned survey would usually be a report or book in a [[Languages of Europe|European language]], which could form a basis for [[Law|law making]] by colonial powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Deep social mind''' is a concept in evolutionary psychology; it refers to the distinctively human capacity to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others while reciprocally enabling those others to read one's own mental states at the same time. The term 'deep social mind' was first coined in 1999 by Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at [[St. Andrews University]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In [[Michael Corballis|M. Corballis]] and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with closely related terms such as '[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]' and '[[intersubjectivity]]', it is now well-established among scholars investigating the evolutionary emergence of human sociality, cognition and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2012). [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Knight-Power-Social-Conditions1.pdf Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language.] In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindreading in apes and humans==

It is widely agreed that the brain is social in both human and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1998. The social brain hypothesis. ''[[Evolutionary Anthropology (journal)|Evolutionary Anthropology]]'' 6: 178-91.&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Andrew Whiten, human sociality goes much further than [[ape sociality]]. Ape social intelligence is overwhelmingly '[[Machiavellian]]' in the sense of scheming, self-interested and egotistically calculating.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. and R. W. Byrne 1988. The manipulation of attention in primate tactical deception. In R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that while an ape may be motivated to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others around it, it has little motive to reciprocate. Instead of making its own mental states transparent to potential rivals, it seeks to block others from 'reading' its own mind. For example, one way to infer what another primate might be thinking is to detect which way its head is pointed, so as to reconstruct what it might be looking at. In the case of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]], adult apes have evolved eyes which give away very little information concerning direction of gaze. Their [[eyes]] are dark-on-dark: the iris is dark brown or even black and the same applies to the [[sclera]] and surrounding skin. Looking at the eyes, therefore, it is not easy to detect direction of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]]. In the human case, the eyes are very different, the dark iris standing out against a white surrounding sclera. This feature, combined with the relatively large size of the [[human eye]] and its horizontally elongated shape, assists neighbouring conspecifics to detect direction of gaze and, on that basis, engage in mind-reading.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H., and S. Kohshima (2001). ‘Unique Morphology of the Human Eye and Its Adaptive Meaning: Comparative Studies on External Morphology of the Primate Eye.’ ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', 40 (5): 419-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 'Deep Social Mind' theory, this means that humans have become cognitively adapted to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]]: as a species, we are well-adapted to read the minds of trusted others while at the same time assisting those others in reading our own minds. One consequence of this is [[self-awareness]] or 'egocentric perspective reversal': I read your mind as you are reading mine. Therefore, between us, we can gain an awareness of our own minds as if from the outside: my mental states as these are reflected in yours and yours as they are reflected in mine. In that sense, if this argument is accepted, our minds mutually interpenetrate. 'Mind' in the human sense is not locked inside this or that skull but instead is relational, stretching between us.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], a [[human child]] normally achieves egocentric perspective reversal — viewing its own mental states as if from the standpoint of others — at around one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello (2000). [http://www.unt.edu/rss/class/mike/5640/articles/culturecogdevelopment.pdf Culture and Cognitive Development.] ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'', 9: 2, pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomba_famiglia_Della_Gherardesca.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus]]
The '''Della Gherardesca Tomb''' is a set of early 14th century sculptures from the tomb of the [[Della Gherardesca family]] in [[Pisa]], originally in the church of [[San Francesco (Pisa)|San Francesco]], of which they were patrons. Its sculptor was [[Lupo di Francesco]].

Originally multicoloured (traces of colour are still visible), the set includes a sarcophagus, statues and Gothic arches. The church was converted into a barracks during Florentine and French rule and the tomb was split up. The arches and some of the statues are now in the [[Museo nazionale di San Matteo]], whilst the sarcophagus is now in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]], where it was seriously damaged during a fire in 1944 - it was restored after the Second World War, although some parts were not replaced.

'''Doubly articulated consonants''' are consonants with two simultaneous primary [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] of the same [[manner of articulation|manner]] (both plosive, or both nasal, etc.). They are a subset of [[co-articulated consonant]]s. They are to be distinguished from co-articulated consonants with [[secondary articulation]]; that is, a second articulation not of the same manner. An example of a doubly articulated consonant is the [[voiceless labial-velar plosive]] {{IPA|[k͡p]}}, which is a {{IPA|[k]}} and a {{IPA|[p]}} pronounced simultaneously. On the other hand, the voiceless [[labialization|labialized]] velar plosive {{IPA|[kʷ]}} has only a single stop articulation, [[velar consonant|velar]] ({{IPA|[k]}}), with a simultaneous [[approximant consonant|approximant-like]] rounding of the lips. In some dialects of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} has a simultaneous [[uvular trill]], but this is not considered double articulation either.

==Possibilities for double articulation==
{{place of articulation}}
There are four independently controllable articulations that may double up in the same manner of articulation: [[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[dorsal consonant|dorsal]], and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]]. (The [[Glottal consonant|glottis]] controls [[phonation]], and works simultaneously with many consonants. It is not normally considered an articulator, and an [[ejective consonant|ejective]] {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, with simultaneous closure of the [[Soft palate|velum]] and [[glottis]], is not considered a doubly articulated consonant.)

[[Approximant consonant]]s, such as {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[ɥ]}}, may be either doubly or secondarily articulated. For example, in [[English language|English]], {{IPA|/w/}} is a labialized velar that could be transcribed as {{IPA|[ɰʷ]}}, but the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{IPA|/w/}} is closer to a true labial–velar {{IPA|[ɰ͡β̞]}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, it is normal practice to use the symbols {{angle bracket|{{IPA|w}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɥ}}}} for the [[Labialized palatal approximant|labialized approximants]], and some linguists restrict the symbols to that usage.

No claims have ever been made for doubly articulated [[flap consonant|flaps]] or [[trill consonant|trills]], such as a simultaneous alveolar–uvular trill, {{IPA|*[ʀ͡r]}}, and these are not expected to be found. Several claims ''have'' been made for doubly articulated [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] or [[affricate]]s, most notoriously a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] phoneme which has its own IPA symbol, {{IPAblink|ɧ}}. However, laboratory measurements have never succeeded in demonstrating simultaneous frication at two points of articulation, and such sounds turn out to be either secondary articulation, or a sequence of two non-simultaneous fricatives. (Despite its name, the "[[voiceless labial-velar fricative]]" {{IPA|[ʍ]}} is actually a [[voiceless approximant]]; the name is a historical remnant from before the distinction was made.) Such sounds can be made, with effort, but it is very difficult for a listener to discern them, and therefore they are not expected to be found as distinctive sounds in any language.

[[Click consonant|Clicks]] are sometimes said to be doubly articulated, as they involve a coronal (more rarely labial) forward articulation, which defines the various 'types' of clicks and the IPA letter assigned to them, plus a [[dorsal consonant|dorsal closure]]. However, this second, dorsal place of closure functions as part of the controlling mechanism of the [[lingual ingressive]] airstream used to generate the click. Thus, much as the glottal closure of ejectives (the airstream-generating mechanism of such consonants) is not considered to be a second place of articulation, clicks are not generally described as such either. Indeed, it is possible to have a true doubly articulated click, such as the labial-dental allophone, {{IPA|[ʘ͡ǀ]}}, of the bilabial click {{IPA|/ʘ/}} in [[Taa language|Taa]].&lt;ref&gt;Traill, Anthony. (1985). ''Phonetic and Phonological Studies of !Xóõ Bushman.'' (Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung, 1). Hamburg: Helmut Buske.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double articulation in stops==

This leaves stops, and both oral and nasal doubly articulated stops are found. However, there is a great asymmetry in the places of their articulation. Of the six possible combinations of ''labial'', ''coronal'', ''dorsal'', and ''pharyngeal'', one is common, and the others vanishingly rare.

*The common articulation is ''labial–dorsal'', which includes '''[[labial–velar consonant|labial–velar stop]]s''' such as the {{IPA|[k͡p]}} mentioned above, and '''labial-uvular stops''' such as [q͡p]. Labial-velar stops are found throughout [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa|Central]] [[Africa]], as well as eastern [[New Guinea]]. Labial-uvular stops are much rarer, but have been found in three [[Mangbutu-Efe languages]] spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Uganda]]: [[Mamvu language|Mamvu]], [[Lese language|Lese]], and [[Efe language|Efe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Didier Demolin, Bernard Teston|first=|date=September 1997|title=Phonetic characteristics of double articulations in some Mangbutu-Efe languages|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00239376/file/662.pdf|journal=International Speech Communication Association|volume=|issue=|pages=803–806|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These languages contain some highly unusual doubly articulated stops that have been confirmed by acoustic and aerodynamic measurements, including a phonemic labial-uvular stop with a voiceless uvular part and a voiced implosive bilabial part, [q͡ɓ], a non-phonemic labial-velar stop with a voiced velar part and a voiceless bilabial part, [ɡ͡p] (which occurs as an allophone of a voiced labial-velar implosive, [ɠɓ]), and a non-phonemic voiceless labial-velar stop with a trilled release, [k͡pʙ̥] (only present in [[Efe language|Efe]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fully voiceless labial-uvular [q͡p] occurs also, as an allophone of /q͡ɓ/.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*A second possibility, ''labial–coronal'', is attested phonemically by [[Labial–alveolar consonant|'''labial–alveolar''' and '''labial–postalveolar''']] in a single language, [[Yélî Dnye language|Yélî Dnye]] of New Guinea. Some West African languages, such as [[Dagbani language|Dagbani]] and [[Nzema language|Nzema]], have labial–postalveolars as allophones of labial–velars before high front vowels.
*A third possibility, ''coronal–dorsal'', is found marginally in a few languages. [[Isoko language|Isoko]], spoken in [[Nigeria]], has [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[dental consonant|dental]] stops (plosives and nasals) that in some dialects are realized as '''dental–palatal''' stops. However, these are not [[contrast (linguistics)|contrastive]] with either dental or palatal stops, unlike the articulations mentioned above, and [[Peter Ladefoged]] considers them to be "accidental contacts in two regions", rather than being inherently double. [[Hadza language|Hadza]] has alveolar–palatal lateral affricates, but the dental contact is optional. Similarly, several languages of [[Australia]], such as [[Maung language|Maung]], have dental–palatals which are variants of laminal [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolars]], with an "extended closure covering the entire region from the teeth to the hard palate". In both cases, the double articulations are variants of laminal consonants, which have inherently broad contact with the roof of the mouth. [[Rwanda language|Rwanda]] is sometimes noted as having ''my'' {{IPA|/mɲ/}}, ''by'' {{IPA|/bɟ/}}, ''tw'' {{IPA|/tkʷ/}}, etc., but these are [[consonant sequence]]s, not double articulation.
*The other three possibilities, which would involve the [[epiglottis]], had not been known until recently. However, with the advent of [[fiber optics|fiber-optic]] [[laryngoscopy]], a greater variety of epiglottal and laryngeal activity has been found than had been expected. For example, the [[Somali language|Somali]] {{IPA|/q/}} was recently found to be a '''[[uvular–epiglottal consonant]]''' {{IPA|[q͡ʡ]}}.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060225135700/http://ling.uta.edu/~jerry/best.pdf] It is not known how widespread such sounds might be, or if [[epiglottal consonant]]s might combine with coronal or labial consonants.

==Triple articulation==
Triply articulated consonants are only attested as glottalized doubly articulated consonants, and this can be argued to be an effect of [[phonation]] or [[airstream mechanism]] rather than as a third articulation, just as other glottalized consonants are not considered to be doubly articulated. The most obvious case are the various types of glottalized clicks mentioned above. Another example is [[no audible release|'unreleased']] final {{IPA|/k/}} in [[Vietnamese phonology|Vietnamese]], which after {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} is often labial-velar {{IPA|[k͡p̚ʔ]}}.

It is possible that some speakers of [[British English]] may in fact articulate the alveolar approximant, /ɹ/, with additional labiodental and velar approximation as well as lip rounding, resulting in a triply articulated approximant, [ʋ͡ɹɰʷ].

'''Fa'afafine''' are people who identify themselves as having a [[third gender|third-gender]] or [[non-binary]] role in [[Samoa]], [[American Samoa]] and the Samoan diaspora. A recognized [[gender identity]]/[[gender role]] in traditional Samoan society, and an integral part of Samoan culture, ''fa'afafine'' are [[Sex assignment|assigned male at birth]], and explicitly embody both masculine and feminine gender traits in a way unique to [[Polynesia]]. Their behavior typically ranges from extravagantly feminine to conventionally masculine.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10508-006-9055-1| pmid = 16909317| title = A Retrospective Study of Childhood Gender-Atypical Behavior in Samoan Fa'afafine| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 35| issue = 6| pages = 659–66| year = 2006| last1 = Bartlett | first1 = N. H. | last2 = Vasey | first2 = P. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent Western theory, among the many anthropological theories about Samoans, was that if a family had more boys than girls or not enough girls to help with women's duties about the house, male children would be chosen to be raised as ''fa'afafine'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/people/hazy.htm|title=Charting the Pacific - Fa'afafine - Samoan boys brought up as girls|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this theory has been refuted by studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/3179/thesis.pdf?sequence=7|title=Ia e Ola Malamalama i lou Faasinomaga, A comparative Study of the Faafafine of Samoa and the Whakawahine of Aotearoa-New Zealand|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 1-5% of Samoans identify as ''fa'afafine''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37227803&lt;/ref&gt; [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] estimates that there are 500 ''fa’afafine'' in Samoa, and the same number in the Samoan [[diaspora]] in New Zealand;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gender-diversity/page-3&lt;/ref&gt; while according to SBS news, there are up to 3000 ''fa'afafine'' currently living in Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/07/16/faafafine-boys-raised-be-girls| title=Fa'afafine: Boys Raised to be Girls ten minute news video about faafafine in Australia|date=26 August 2013| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and terminology ==
The word ''fa'afafine'' includes the causative [[prefix]] ''fa'a–'', meaning "in the manner of", and the word ''fafine'', meaning "woman".&lt;ref&gt;Milner, G.B. 1966. Samoan-English Dictionary. "Fa'afafine" entry pg. 52 under "Fafine"&lt;/ref&gt;  It is [[cognate]] with linguistically related words or social categories in other [[Polynesia]]n languages, such as the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''[[fakaleiti]]'' (also ''fakafefine''), the [[Cook Islands Māori]] ''[[akava'ine]]'', the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''[[māhū]]'' (literally ''in the middle''), the [[Māori language|Māori]] ''whakawāhine'', the [[Niuean language|Niuean]] ''fiafifine'' (also ''fakafifine''), the [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]] ''fakafāfine'', the [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]] ''pinapinaaine'', the [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]] ''binabinaaine'', and the [[Wallisian language|Wallisian]] ''fakafafine''.

The FTM or [[female-to-male]] equivalent in Samoa are known variously as ''fa'atane'', ''fa'atama'', and ''fafatama''. Ultimately, Western terms like gay, transgender, FTM, etc., do not align exactly with Samoan terms like fa'afafine, fa'atane, etc., which have meaning within the [[fa'asamoa]] traditional cultural systems of Samoa.

The Samoan slang word ''mala'' (or "devastation" in the [[Samoan language]]) is in less frequent use for fa'afafine, as it arose from fundamentalist influenced [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Fa'afafine Notes: On Tagaloa, Jesus, and Nafanua| journal = Queer Indigenous Studies: Critical Interventions in Theory, Politics, and Literature. Tucson: University of Arizona Press| pages = 81–94| year = 2011| last1 = Taulapapa McMullin | first1 = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Fa'afafine, through the elisions of colonialism, is difficult to trace. [[Nafanua]], the FTM warrior and chief of Samoan early history, is often held up as an icon of Faafafine and Faatane/Fafatama. In Dolgoy's recorded interviews with faafafine from the 1980s, we know that Johnny Fruitcake was a popular faafafine during the American military occupation of Samoa in World War II; and that Anita (Tony Schwenke) was the founder of Hollywood, a tailoring shop and house of refuge for faafafine in Apia in the 1960s-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Search for Recognition and Social Movement Emergence, Towards an Understanding of the Transformation of the Faafafine of Samoa. University of Alberta.| year = 2000| last1 = Dolgoy | first1 = Reevan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, through the Samoan diaspora, Faafafine began having a presence in contemporary global cultures.

== Role in Samoan society ==
Fa'afafine are known for their hard work and dedication to the family, in the Samoan tradition of ''[[tautua]]'' or service to family. Ideas of the family in Samoa and Polynesia are markedly different from Western constructions, and include all the members of a ''sa'', or communal family within the ''[[fa'amatai]]'' family systems.&lt;ref&gt;Saleimoa Vaai, Samoa Faamatai and the Rule of Law (Apia: The National University of Samoa Le Papa-I-Galagala, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fa'afafine, as a third gender, have sexual relationships almost exclusively with men who do not identify as fa'afafine, and sometimes with women, but apparently not with other fa'afafine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/polare-archive/archived-articles/like-a-lady-in-polynesia.htm |title=Like a Lady in Polynesia |work=Polare magazine |publisher=gendercentre.org.au |first=Roberta |last=Perkins |date=March 1994 |edition=3 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927132628/http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/polare-archive/archived-articles/like-a-lady-in-polynesia.htm |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This third gender is so well-accepted in Samoan culture that most Samoans state that they have friendship relationships with at least one fa'afafine; it is, however, not totally accepted in other communities, such as some Catholic groups and traditional leaders. Traditionally, fa'afafine follow the training of the women's daily work in an ''Aiga'' (Samoan family group).&lt;ref name=bartlett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danielsson, B., T. Danielsson, and R. Pierson. 1978. Polynesia's third sex: The gay life starts in the kitchen. Pacific Islands Monthly 49:10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fa'afafine state that they "loved" engaging in feminine activities as children, such as playing with female peers, playing female characters during role play, dressing up in female clothes, and playing with female gender-typical toys. This is in contrast to women who stated that they merely "liked" engaging in those activities as children. Some fa'afafine recall believing they were girls in childhood, but knew better as adults. In Samoa, there is very seldom ridicule or displeasure towards a biologically male child who states that they are a girl. For instance, one study showed only a minority of parents (20 percent) tried to stop their fa'afafine children from engaging in feminine behavior. Being pushed into the male gender role is upsetting to many fa'afafine. A significant number stated that they "hated" masculine play, such as rough games and sports, even more than females did as children.&lt;ref name=bartlett/&gt;

==Society of Fa'afafine in American Samoa and Samoa Fa'afafine Association==
The Society of Fa'afafine in American Samoa or "Le Sosaiete o Fa’afafine i Amerika Samoa" (S.O.F.I.A.S) is an organization designed to foster collaboration between the fa'afafine and the LGBTQI+ communities in both American Samoa, the Asia Pacific region, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shevon Kaio Matai passes away|url = http://www.samoanews.com/content/en/shevon-kaio-matai-passes-away|website = Samoa News|accessdate = 2015-06-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150530072617/http://www.samoanews.com/content/en/shevon-kaio-matai-passes-away|archivedate = 2015-05-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; SOFIAS describes itself as an organization dedicated to balancing both Samoan values with western influences and aims to promote a positive attitude toward the Samoan fa'afafine community.  Now known as ''Miss SOFIAS'', the [[Miss Island Queen Pageant]] has been held in Pago Pago, American Samoa, since 1979.

The Samoan Faafafine Association Incorporated (S.F.A.) of independent Samoa, based in Apia, has been active for over a decade. It works closely with government, local churches, and youth organizations, supporting community projects for the faafafine community, but also for elders and youth in Samoa. SFA has been active on the international level working with the United Nations and Pacific regional NGO's, on behalf of the fa'afafine, transgender, and LGBT communities of the Pacific Islands. They also been active working with media developing a more equitable representation of fa'afafine by media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Fa’afafine want fair and inclusive reporting|url =http://www.samoaobserver.ws/en/31_03_2017/local/18512/Fa%E2%80%99afafine-want-fair-and-inclusive-reporting.htm|website = Samoa Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been legislative activity initiated in [[Samoa]] by the Samoa Faafafine Association, with faafafine lawyers Alex Su'a and Phineas Hartson Matautia, on issues of [[LGBT rights in Samoa]]. Their efforts to repeal homophobic and transphobic laws inherited from the British and New Zealand colonial administrations have met with partial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paclii.org/journals/fJSPL/vol09no1/5.shtml| title=Discriminating on the Grounds of Status: Criminal Law and Fa'afafine and Fakaleiti in the South Pacific | journal = Journal of South Pacific Law | year = 2009| last1 = Su'a | first1 = Alex| | last2 = Farran | first2 = Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage equality for fa'afafine is still unlawful in [[Samoa]]; and despite marriage equality legalization in the U.S., it is still not recognized in the US Territory of [[American Samoa]].

'''''Facts on the Ground: Archaeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society''''' is a 2001 book by [[Nadia Abu El Haj]] based on her [[Thesis|doctoral thesis]] for [[Duke University]].  The book has been praised by some scholars and criticised by others.&lt;ref name=Arenson&gt;{{cite web|title=Fracas Erupts Over Book on Mideast by a Barnard Professor Seeking Tenure|author=Karen W. Arenson|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/education/10barnard.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the book intensified five years after its publication, after news emerged in 2006 that Abu El Haj was under consideration for [[tenure]] at [[Barnard College]] where she served as an [[Professor#Main positions|assistant professor]]. Barnard alumnae mounted a campaign to deny tenure to Abu El Haj that centered on what they described as the book's anti-Israel bias, prompting a counter-campaign in support of the book and Abu El Haj.&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt; The University ultimately granted Abu El Haj tenure in November 2007.&lt;ref name=Finder&gt;{{cite web|title=Embattled Barnard Anthropologist Is Awarded Tenure |author=Alan Finder |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=November 3, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-04| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/03/nyregion/03barnard.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
In the book, Abu El Haj uses anthropological methods to study the relationship between the development of scientific knowledge in [[Archaeology of Israel|Israeli archaeology]] and the construction of the social imaginations and political orders in the [[Israel|Israeli State]] and what she characterizes as the "formation and enactment of its [[Colonialism|colonial]]-[[Nationalism|national]] historical imagination and...the substantiation of its territorial claims".&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on the Ground'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadia Abu El Haj |publisher=Barnard College Department of Anthropology |accessdate=2007-12-28 |url=http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/anthro/elhaj.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619085704/http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/anthro/elhaj.html |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that facts generated by archaeological practice have fashioned "cultural understandings, political possibilities and 'common-sense' assumptions".&lt;ref name=Barnard/&gt;

In her introduction, Abu El Haj sympathetically cites critics who reject "a positivist commitment to [[scientific method]] whereby politics is seen to intervene only in instances of bad science," favoring various approaches such as "[[post-structuralism]], philosophical critiques of [[foundationalism]], [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]]" with "a commitment to understanding archeology as necessarily political."&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on the Ground'', pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesse Walker]], "The Case of Nadia Abu El Haj" http://reason.com/blog/2007/08/18/the-case-of-nadia-abu-el-haj&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Facts on the Ground'' has been widely reviewed in both scholarly and popular publications. It was one of the winners of the 2002 [[Albert Hourani Book Award]], granted by the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] for outstanding publishing in Middle East studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mesa.wns.ccit.arizona.edu/excellence/hourani_winners_list.htm Albert Hourani Book Award Recipients, 1991-2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815195159/http://mesa.wns.ccit.arizona.edu/excellence/hourani_winners_list.htm |date=2007-08-15 }}, [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESAN).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jere L. Bacharach|Jere Bacharach]], a MESA member and historian at the [[University of Washington]], described the book as a "nuanced, nonpolemic work".&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt;

The book has received both accolades, particularly from Abu El Haj's fellow anthropologists, and denunciations, from some archaeologists, whose colleagues' work she criticizes.&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt; According to [[Jane Kramer]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "the book was praised by colleagues who responded to the critical tropes that were Abu El Haj's legacy from scholars like [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ian Hacking]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Edward Said]], and dismissed by colleagues with a theoretical or a political or simply a turf interest in dismissing it."&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite news

===Academic reviews (chronologically-ordered)===
In the ''MIT Electronic Journal of Middle East Studies'', [[Elia Zureik]], a professor of sociology at [[Queen's University]], writes that Abu El Haj's "use of the sociology of science as a perspective in her research is both clever and refreshing. It further elevates research about Palestine to new heights, by placing it squarely in current social science literature and debates. We need more such studies."&lt;ref name="Zuriek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zuriek |first=Elia |authorlink= |date=October 2002 |title=Nadia Abu El-Haj: Facts on the Ground.

[[Edward Said]] wrote of being "indebted" to the book and work of Abu El Haj, in ''Freud and the Non-European'' (2003), offering that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What she provides first of all is a history of systematic colonial archaeological exploration in Palestine, dating back to [[British empire|British]] work in the mid-nineteenth century. She then continues the story in the period before Israel is established, connecting the actual practice of archaeology with a nascent national ideology - an ideology with plans for the repossession of the land through renaming and resettling, much of it given archeological justification as a schematic extraction of Jewish identity despite the existence of Arab names and traces of other civilizations. This effort, she argues convincingly, epistemologically prepares the way for a fully fledged post-1948 sense of Israeli-Jewish identity based on assembling discrete archaeological particulars -scattered remnants of masonry, tablets, bones, tombs..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said|Said, Edward]] (2003). ''Freud and the Non-European'' [[Verso Books]], {{ISBN|1-85984-500-2}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her review of ''Facts on the Ground'' for ''[[American Ethnologist]]'', [[Kimbra L. Smith]] professor of anthropology at the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]], writes that "Abu El Haj provides an important and timely look at some of the politics of self-representation behind the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government's]] public face, within a broader argument about science's capacity for political involvement and for maintaining and even advancing colonialist policies. However [...] her failure to present either official [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] or public Palestinian/Israeli opinions and attitudes within the context of Israel's (settler) nationalist-archaeological discipline means that answers to the excellent questions she raises are never made clear."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Kimbra L. Smith. [http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592 Book Reviews On-line], ''American Ethnologist'', Volume 30 Number 2, May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apen Ruiz,  at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], writes in [[H-Net]] that "''Facts on the Ground'' offers a unique and pioneering approach to examine the politics of archaeological research." He explains that, "Inspired by cultural and social studies of science, El-Haj puts archaeology under an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] lens and examines its practices: excavating, surveying, cataloguing, naming, mapping, and exhibiting," noting that it is this, "focus on archaeological practices as the main object of study," that is the "primary contribution of the book".&lt;ref&gt;Apen Ruiz. "Review of Nadia Abu El-Haj, Facts on the Ground: Archaeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society," H-Gender-MidEast, [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190 H-Net Reviews], May, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aren Maeir]], professor of archaeology at [[Bar Ilan University]], writing in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', calls the book "a highly ideologically driven political manifesto, with a glaring lack of attention both to details and to the broader context." Regarding Abu El Haj's criticism of methodology in Israeli archeology, Maeir writes, that in contemporary archeology in Israel, "only marginal elements act in accordance with or identify with the non-scientific agendas that she attempts to delineate." Maeir argues that the major reason for the lateness of Israel to adopt modern techniques was not a "hidden colonial agenda," but rather a result of the "European classical archeology" from which it developed.&lt;ref&gt;Aren M. Maeir. ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', Volume 95 Number 3, September 2004. pp. 523-524. Full text at [http://nadiaabuelhaj.com/applaudingdestruction.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James L. Gelvin|James Gelvin]], a [[UCLA]] historian, describes ''Facts on the Ground'' in his book ''The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War'', as "probably the most sophisticated presentation of Israel's archaeological obsession and its relation to nationalism and 'colonial knowledge'".&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Gelvin|Gelvin, James L.]] (2005). ''The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-85289-7}}. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander H. Joffe]], an archaeologist and past director of the pro-Israel organization [[Campus Watch]], writes in the ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'' that "Abu El Haj's anthropology is undone by her [...] ill-informed narrative, intrusive counter-politics, and by her unwillingness to either enter or observe Israeli society [...] The effect is a representation of Israeli archaeology that is simply bizarre." &lt;ref&gt;Alexander H. Joffe. ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'', Volume 64 Number 4, October 2005. p. 297. Available online at [http://www.solomonia.com/images/june06/abu%20el%20haj%20joffe%20review.pdf Solomonia].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Whitelam]], professor of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Sheffield]] and author of ''The Invention of Ancient Israel: The Silencing of Palestinian History'', told a ''[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]'' reporter that ''Facts on the Ground'' was a "first-rate book," which made "a very fine contribution" to the study of "how national identity is constructed and the assumptions which are then built into academic work on history and archaeology."&lt;ref name="New York Sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barnard Alumnae Opposing Tenure for Anthropologist|author=Gabrielle Birkner|publisher=[[The New York Sun]]|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=2007-09-12|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/43652}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, [[William G. Dever|William Dever]], a retired professor of [[Near Eastern archaeology|Middle Eastern archaeology]] at the [[University of Arizona]], describes Abu El Haj's scholarship as "faulty, misleading and dangerous".&lt;ref name="New York Sun"/&gt;

[[Alan F. Segal]], a professor of religion and Jewish studies at Barnard College, has been a vocal critic of the book. In the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', he writes that Abu El Haj's work is tainted by a failure to examine primary sources in [[Hebrew]], a reliance on anonymous sources, and a lack of breadth in its review of scholarship to date. According to Segal, Abu El Haj focuses her attention on the "extreme conclusions" of  "[[The Copenhagen School (theology)|
biblical minimalists]]" who constitute "no more than a handful of scholars" out of "thousands at work (in Biblical scholarship) in the world". Segal writes that "none of the minimalist scholars she relies upon for this purpose is actually a working archaeologist," and that "pretty much every other one of the virtually countless theories about [[Israelites|Israelite]] settlement in [[First Temple]] times would disprove her hypothesis about Israeli archaeology."  He adds that she "does not tell her readers about" these fields, "why they are necessary", or, "how decisions are actually made in biblical studies."&lt;ref name=SegalSpec&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Professional Observations on the Controversy about Nadia Abu El-Haj’s First Book|author=[[Alan F. Segal]]|publisher=''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]''|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2007-09-22|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/?q=node/26830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall 2007 issue of ''The Current'', there was criticism of Abu El Haj from three different scholars. First, [[David M. Rosen]], professor of anthropology at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] asks, "How can a work that apparently demonstrates an impaired understanding of the archeological sciences be regarded as good anthropology?" Answering his own question, he offers that while in the contemporary political climate, "One hardly needs to be Braveheart to be openly antagonistic to Israel at a meeting of anthropologists," the more serious problem lies in the tradition of post-colonial studies, where anthropologists like Abu El Haj can "construct their analyses with little concern for empirical or logical connectedness. Like mythology, they are masters of the found object, and pull in anything to create a story. This methodology has no connection to science. Its power lies in its politics and its aesthetics, and not in such boring ideas as validity and reliability."&lt;ref&gt;Searching for "Facts" on the Ground, by

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Palaeography|paleographer]] and President of [[Gratz College]], suggests that Abu El Haj's "personal agenda" is "the furtherance of her own nationalistic ideology at the expense of decades of careful excavations and rigorous publications" establishing the historicity of much of the Biblical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/articles/fall2007/searching-for-facts-on-the-ground.html Is Truth Attainable? Jonathan Rosenbaum  The Current, Fall 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215014543/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/articles/fall2007/searching-for-facts-on-the-ground.html |date=February 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[James R. Russell]], a professor at [[Harvard University]], describes ''Facts on the Ground'' as a "malign fantasy" designed to demonstrate the
"colonial essence" of Zionism by denying the history of ancient "Jewish sovereignty and long historical presence." &lt;ref&gt;Ideology over Integrity in Academe, by
James R. Russell, The Current, Fall 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/articles/fall2007/ideology-over-integrity-in-academe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313144738/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/articles/fall2007/ideology-over-integrity-in-academe.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulldozer use===
One controversy related to the book came from a passage in ''Facts on the Ground'' in which Abu El Haj wrote that during a [[Excavation (archaeology)|dig]] in [[Jezreel Valley|Jezreel]], British and Israeli archaeologists used "bulldozers ... in order to get down to the earlier strata, which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible." She noted that "among Palestinian officials at the Haram al-Sharif and the Awqaf as well as many other archaeologists ... the use of bulldozers has become the ultimate sign of 'bad science' and of nationalist politics guiding research agendas."&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on the Ground'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that the incident took place "a week after [she] stopped participating in the excavations" and attributed the account to "several participants, both archaeologists and student volunteers," whom she did not name.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on the Ground'', n. 12, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dig in question was led by [[David Ussishkin]] of the [[University of Tel Aviv]], who responded to Abu El Haj's characterization in an [[open letter]] published on the internet in December 2006. While confirming that the earlier strata was the main interest of the dig, Ussishkin denied that any damage was done to other strata, which he insisted were properly excavated. Ussishkin defended the use of the bulldozer at the site as being necessary to properly excavate the site, and said he did not believe it had caused any damage.&lt;ref&gt;David Ussishkin. [http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml Archaeologist David Ussishkin Responds to El Haj Accusations], Solomonia, December 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, archaeologist [[Aren Maeir]], in an opinion column in the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' student newspaper, wrote, "In her book she attacks, harangues, vilifies and slanders respected archaeologists in the field."  According to Maeir, Abu El Haj's assertions concerning Ussishkin are "analogous to accusing a surgeon of deciding whether to use a scalpel or a hacksaw according to the patient’s ethnic 'identity'" and "an attempt to prevent him from doing his work."&lt;ref name=MaeirSpec&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Speech or Freedom of Slander?|author=[[Aren Maeir]]|publisher=''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]''|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2007-09-22|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/?q=node/26827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu El Haj does not mention Ussishkin by name in her book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15170">{{Music of Cuba}}
The '''guaracha''' ({{IPA-es|ɡwaˈɾatʃa|lang}}) is a genre of [[Music of Cuba|Cuban popular music]], of rapid tempo and comic or picaresque lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal 1981. ''Música cubana del Areyto a la Nueva Trova''. 2nd rev ed, Cubanacan, San Juan P.R.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, Giro Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba'' vol 2, p179 says the term is "of Spanish (Andalusian) origin, and the dance was a kind of [[zapateo]]" [transl: contrib.] and the ''Diccionario de la música Labor'' says  "We don't know when it originated; [the word] is supposed to have been used originally for a dance of Spanish origin". However the word may originally have been used, in the context of Cuban music the text here is accurate.&lt;/ref&gt; The word had been used in this sense at least since the late 18th and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pichardo, Esteban 1836. ''Diccionario provincial casi razonado de vozes y frases cubanas''. La Habana. "Báile de la gentualla casi en desuso". p303, 1985 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Guarachas were played and sung in [[Cuban musical theatre|musical theatres]] and in low-class dance salons. They became an integral part of [[Music of Cuba#Bufo theatre|bufo]] comic theatre in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Rine 1982. ''La selva oscura: de los bufos a la neocolonia (historia del teatro cubano de 1868 a 1902)''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; During the later 19th and the early 20th century the guaracha was a favourite musical form in the brothels of [[Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;Canizares, Dulcila 2000. ''San Isidro 1910: Alberto Yarini y su epocha''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez Robaina, Tomas 1983. ''Recuerdos secretos de los mujeres publicas''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; The guaracha survives today in the repertoires of some [[trova]] musicians, [[conjunto]]s and Cuban-style big bands.

==Early uses of the word==

Though the word may be historically of Spanish origin, its use in this context is of indigenous Cuban origin.&lt;ref&gt;see note 2&lt;/ref&gt; These are excerpts from reference sources, in date order: A Latin American carol "Convidando esta la noche" dates from at least the mid 17th century and both mentions and is a guaracha. It was composed or collected by Juan Garcia de Zespedes, 1620-1678, Puebla, Mexico. This is a Spanish guaracha, a musical style popular in Caribbean colonies. "Happily celebrating, some lovely shepherds sing the new style of juguetes for a guaracha. In this guaracha we celebrate while the baby boy is lost in dreams. Play and dance because we have fire in the ice and ice in the fire." 
*The Gazeta de Barcelona has a number of advertisements for music that mention the guaracha.&lt;ref&gt;Mangado y Artigas, Josep María 1998. ''La guitarra en Cataluña, 1769–1939''.  Tecla, London. p560&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention in this source is #64, dated 11 August 1789, where there is an entry that reads "...otra del Sr. Brito, Portugues: el fandango, la guaracha y seis contradanzas, todo en cifra para guitarra...". A later entry #83, 15 October 1796, refers to a "...guaracha intitulada Tarántula...". 
*"Báile de la gentualla casi desusado" (dance for the rabble, somewhat old-fashioned).&lt;ref&gt;Pichardo, Esteban 1836. ''Diccionario provincial casi razonado de vozes y frases cubanas''. La Habana. p303, 1985 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Leal comments on this: "The ''bailes de la gentualla'' are known on other occasions as ''bailes de cuna'' where people of different races mix. The guaracha employs the structure soloist&amp;ndash;coro, that is to say, verses or passages vary between the chorus and the soloist, improvisation occurs, and references made to daily matters, peppered with crafty witticisms." &lt;ref&gt;Leal, Rine 1982. ''La selva oscura, de los Bufos a la neo colonia: historia del teatro cubano de 1868 a 1902.'' La Habana. p19 (contributor's rough translation)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"Una canción popular que se canta a coro... Música u orquesta pobre, compuesta de acordeón o guitarra, güiro, maracas, etc". (a popular song, which is sung alternately (call &amp; response?)... humble music and band &amp;c).&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando 1974. ''Nuevo catauro de cubanismos''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"Cierto género musical" (a particular genre of music).&lt;ref&gt;Santiesteban, Argelio 1985. ''El habla popular cubana de hoy''. La Habana. p239&lt;/ref&gt;

These references are all to music; but whether of the same type is not quite clear. The usage of guaracha is sometimes extended, then meaning, generally, to have a good time. A different sense of the word means jest or diversion.

==Emergence of the Guaracha==

[[File:Vera+Zequeira.jpg|thumb|left|200px|María Teresa Vera &amp; Rafael Zequeira]]
On January 20, 1801, Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer published a note in a newspaper called “El Regañón de La Habana,” in which he refers to certain chants that “run outside there through vulgar voices”. Between them he mentioned a “guaracha” named “La Guabina”, about which he says: “in the voice of those that sings it, tastes like any thing dirty, indecent or disgusting that you can think about…” At a later time, in an undetermined date, “La Guabina” appears published between the first musical scores printed in Havana at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="linares"&gt;Linares, María teresa: La guaracha cubana. Imagen del humor criollo. {{cite web |url=http://www.musica.cult.cu/documen/guaracha.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401204320/http://www.musica.cult.cu/documen/guaracha.htm |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the commentaries published in “El Regañón de La Habana”, we can conclude that those “guarachas” were very popular within the Havana population at that time, because in the same previously mentioned article the author says: “…but most importantly, what bothers me most is the liberty with which a number of chants are sung throughout the streets and town homes, where innocence is insulted and morals offended… by many individuals, not just of the lowest class, but also by some people that are supposed to be called well educated…”. Therefore, we can say that those “guarachas” of a very audacious content, were apparently already sung within a wide social sector of the Havana population.&lt;ref name="linares"/&gt;

Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer mentions also that at the beginning of the 19th century up to fifty dance parties were held in Havana every day, where the famous “Guaracha” was sung and danced among other popular pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo: La música en Cuba, Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1979, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guaracha as a dance==

There is little evidence as to what style of dance was originally performed to the guaracha in Cuba. Some engravings from the 19th century suggest that it was a dance of independent couples, that is, ''not'' a [[sequence dance]] such as the [[contradanza]].&lt;ref&gt;An illustration in Leal, Rine 1982. ''La seva oscura: de los bufos a la colonia''. La Habana. Illustrations following p67 include one subtitled ''La guaracha es un símbolo del bufo, su german musical'', but without data on its source. This engraving shows persons of lower class dancing in couples.&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype independent couples dance was the [[waltz]] (early 19th century ''Vals'' in Cuba). The first creole dance form in Cuba known for certain to be danced by independent couples was the [[danzón]]. If the guaracha is an earlier example, this would be interesting from a [[dance history]] point of view.

==Guarachas in bufo theatre==
During the 19th century, the bufo theatre, with its robust humour, its creolized characters and its guarachas, played a part in the movement for the emancipation of slaves and the independence of Cuba. They played a part in criticising authorities, lampooning public figures and supporting heroic revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Rine 1986. ''Teatro del siglo XIX''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Rine 1982. ''La selva oscura, de los Bufos a la neo colonia: historia del teatro cubano de 1868 a 1902''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; Satire and humour are significant weapons for a subjugated people.

In 1869 at the ''Teatro Villanueva'' in Havana an anti-Spanish bufo was playing, when suddenly some Spanish Voluntarios attacked the theatre, killing some ten or so patrons. The context was that the [[Ten Years' War]] had started the previous year, when [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]] had freed his slaves, and declared Cuban independence. Creole sentiments were running high, and the Colonial government and their rich Spanish traders were reacting. Not for the first or the last time, politics and music were closely intertwined, for musicians had been integrated since before 1800. Bufo theatres were shut down for some years after this tragic event.

In bufos the guaracha would occur at places indicated by the author: guaracheros would enter in coloured shirts, white trousers and boots, handkerchiefs on their heads, the women in white coats, and the group would perform the guaracha. In general the guaracha would involve a dialogue between the [[tiple]], the [[tenor]] and the chorus. The best period of the guaracha on stage was early in the 20th century in the ''Alhambra'' theatre in Havana, when such composers as [[Jorge Anckermann]], [[José Marín Varona]] and [[Manuel Mauri]] wrote numbers for the top stage singer [[Adolfo Colombo]].&lt;ref&gt;Giro Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba''. La Habana. vol 2, p179&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the leading [[trova]] musicians wrote guarachas: [[Pepe Sánchez (trova)|Pepe Sánchez]], [[Sindo Garay]], [[Manuel Corona]], and later [[Ñico Saquito]].

==Lyrics==

The use of [[lyrics]] in theatre music is common, but their use in popular dance music was not common in the 18th and 19th centuries. Only the [[habanera (music)|habanera]] had sung lyrics, and the guaracha definitely predates the habanera by some decades. Therefore, the guaracha is the first Cuban creole dance music which included singers.

The Havana ''Diario de la Marina'' of 1868 says: "The bufo troupe, we think, has an extensive repertory of tasty guarachas, with which to keep its public happy, better than the Italian songs." &lt;ref&gt;From Leal, Rine 1982. ''La selva oscura: de los bufos a la neocolonia (historia del teatro cubano de 1868 a 1902)''. La Habana. p19 (contributor's translation).&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics were full of slang, and dwelt on events and people in the news. Rhythmically, guaracha exhibits a series of rhythm combinations, such as {{music|time|6|8}} with {{music|time|2|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z''. Duke University, Durham NC; Tumi, Bath. p101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Cuban source lists a range of guaracha lyrics: [Anon] 1882. ''Guarachas cubanas: curiosa recopilación desde las más antiguas hasta las más modernas''. La Habana, reprint 1963. The text of this book is not available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alejo Carpentier]] quotes a number of guaracha verses that illustrate the style:
:Mi marido se murió,
:Dios en el cielo lo tiene
:y que lo tenga tan tenido
:que acá jamás nunca vuelva.

::(My husband died,
::God in heaven has him;
::May he keep him so well
::That he never comes back!)

:No hay mulata más hermosa.
:más  pilla y más sandunguera,
:ni que tenga en la cadera
:más  azúcar que mi Rosa.

::(There's no mulatta more gorgeous,
::more wicked and more spicy,
::nor one whose hips have got
::more sugar than my Rosa!) &lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis MN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guaracha in the 20th century==
In the mid-20th century the style was taken up by the [[conjunto]]s and big bands as a type of up-tempo music. Many of the early [[Music of Cuba#Trova|trovadores]], such as [[Manuel Corona]] (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), composed and sung guarachas as a balance for the slower [[bolero]]s and [[canción]]es. [[Ñico Saquito]] was primarily a singer and composer of guarachas. The satirical lyric content also fitted well with the son, and many bands played both genres. Today it seems scarcely to exist as a distinct musical form, except in the hands of trova musicians; in larger groups it has been absorbed into the vast maw of [[Salsa music|Salsa]].

Singers who could handle the fast lyrics and were good improvisors were called ''guaracheros'' or ''guaracheras''. [[Celia Cruz]] was an example, though she, like [[Miguelito Valdés]] and [[Benny Moré]], sung almost every type of Cuban lyric well. A better example is [[Cascarita]] (Orlando Guerra) who was distinctly less comfortable with [[bolero]]s, but brilliant with fast numbers. In modern Cuban music so many threads are interwoven that one cannot easily distinguish these older roots. Perhaps in the lyrics of [[Los Van Van]] the topicality and sauciness of the old guarachas found new life, though the rhythm would have surprised the old-timers.

Among other composers who have written Guarachas is [[Morton Gould]] &amp;ndash; the piece is found in the third movement of his Latin American Symphonette (Symphonette No. 4) (1940).  Later in the 1980s Pedro Luis Ferrer and  Virulo (Alejandro García Villalón) sought to renovate the guaracha, devising modern takes on the old themes.

==Guaracha in Puerto Rico==

During the 19th century, many Bufo Theater Companies arrived in Puerto Rico from Cuba, and they brought with them the Guaracha. At a later time the Guaracha was adopted in Puerto Rico and became part of the Puerto Rican musical tradition, such as the “Rosarios Cantaos”, the Baquiné, the Christmas songs and the Children’s songs.

The Guaracha is a style of song-dance which is also considered music for the Christmas “Parrandas” and concert popular music. Several modern genres, such as Rumba and Salsa are considered to be influenced by the Guaracha. The Guaracha has been cultivated during the 20th century by Puerto Rican musicians such as [[Rafael Hernández Marín|Rafael Hernández]], [[Pedro Flores (composer)|Pedro Flores]], [[Bobby Capó]], Tite Curet, [[Rafael Cortijo]], [[Ismael Rivera]], [[Francisco Alvarado]], Luigi Teixidor and  “[[El Gran Combo]]”.

Some famous Guarachas are: Hermoso Bouquet, Pueblo Latino, Borracho no vale, Compay póngase duro, Mujer trigueña, Marinerito and Piel Canela.&lt;ref&gt;Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico – Fundación Puertorriqueña de Las Humanidades. Artes / La Guaracha. {{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08042302 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326104659/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08042302 |archivedate=2016-03-26 |df= }}.

[[Image:Basho by Kinkoku c1820.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portrait of [[Matsuo Bashō]] by [[Yokoi Kinkoku]], c. 1820. The calligraphy relates one of Bashō's most famous haiku poems: ''Furu ike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto'' (An old pond / a frog jumps in / the sound of water).]]

'''{{nihongo|''Haiga''|俳画||extra=haikai drawing}}''' is a style of [[Japanese painting]] that incorporates the [[aesthetics]] of ''[[haikai]]''. ''Haiga'' are typically painted by [[haiku]] poets (''haijin''), and often accompanied by a haiku poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Daijirin'' entry for ''haiga''|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%BF%B3%E7%94%BB|work=Kotobank dictionary aggregator website|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the poetic form it accompanied, ''haiga'' was based on simple, yet often profound, observations of the everyday world. [[Stephen Addiss]] points out that "since they are both created with the same brush and ink, adding an image to a haiku poem was&amp;nbsp;... a natural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, ''haiga'' vary widely based on the preferences and training of the individual painter, but generally show influences of formal [[Kanō school]] painting, minimalist [[Zen painting]], and [[Ōtsu-e]], while sharing much of the aesthetic attitudes of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' tradition. Some were reproduced as [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]]. The subjects painted likewise vary widely, but are generally elements mentioned in the [[calligraphy]], or poetic images which add meaning or depth to that expressed by the poem. The moon is a common subject in these poems and paintings, sometimes represented by the Zen circle ''[[ensō]]'', which evokes a number of other meanings, including that of the [[Mu (negative)|void]]. Other subjects, ranging from [[Mount Fuji]] to rooftops, are frequently represented with a minimum of brushstrokes, thus evoking elegance and beauty in simplicity.

==History==
[[Image:A little cuckoo across a hydrangea(Haiga) by Yosa Buson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A little cuckoo across a hydrangea by [[Yosa Buson]].]]

[[Nonoguchi Ryūho]] (1595–1669), a student of [[Kanō Tan'yū]], is sometimes credited{{By whom|date=November 2012}} with founding the style; though poetry was commonly accompanied by images for centuries prior, Ryūho was the first poet to regularly include paintings alongside his calligraphy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Matsuo Bashō]], known worldwide as the definitive master of haiku, frequently painted as well. ''Haiga'' became a major style of painting as a result of association with his famous works of haiku.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Like his poems, Bashō's paintings are founded in a simplicity which reveals great depth, complementing the poems they are paired with. Towards the end of his life, he studied painting under [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], his pupil in poetry; the works of both men benefited from the exchange, and a number of works were produced combining Morikawa's painting with Bashō's poetry and calligraphy.

Composing haiku, and painting accompanying pictures, was a common pastime of [[Edo period]] aesthetes, who would pursue these activities in their spare time, or at friendly gatherings as a communal form of entertainment. The famous novelist [[Ihara Saikaku]] was one of many people not normally associated with either poetry or painting, who took part. By contrast, the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' painter [[Yosa Buson]], widely considered second only to Bashō as a master of haiku, is said to be "the only artist to be included in surveys both of great poets and great painters in Japanese history."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other schools of painting which maintained a standard set of styles passed from master to apprentice, the genre of ''haiga'' encompassed a variety of artists with different approaches. Some, like Bashō, were primarily poets, accompanying their compositions with simple sketches,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} while others, like Buson, were primarily painters, devoting more space and centrality of focus to the image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Maruyama Goshun]] and [[Ki Baitei]] were among those who tended to paint portraits of poets and other figures in a relatively quick, loose style which looks somewhat [[cartoon]]ish to the modern eye. Some ''haiga'' paintings, such as those by [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], reflect the formal training of the artists, while others, like those by [[Nakahara Nantenbō]], reflect the artist's background in [[Zen]].

One overall trend that developed over time, despite this wide variety, was a shift from the circles of literati (''bunjin'') painters to the orbit of the [[Shijō school]] of the naturalistic painter [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]. This move was effected primarily by Maruyama Goshun,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and can be seen as well in the works of [[Yamaguchi Soken]]. Some later painters, such as [[Takebe Sōchō]], were influenced by ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' styles, and used color in highly detailed works.

Though traditional-style ''haiga'' are still produced today, contemporary artists experiment with the style, coupling haiku with digital imagery, photography, and other media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Giovanni Borelli - lim joints (De Motu Animalium).jpg|thumb|A page from Giovanni Borelli's ''De Motu Animalium'', showing how various simple machines can be used to model different limbs]]
'''Iatrophysics''' or '''iatromechanics''' (fr. [[Greek language|Greek]]) is the medical application of [[physics]]. It provides an explanation for medical practices with mechanical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780521272056|location=Cambridge|pages=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a school of [[medicine]] in the seventeenth century which attempted to explain [[physiology|physiological]] phenomena in mechanical terms. Believers of iatromechanics thought that physiological phenomena of the human body followed the laws of physics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521732567|location=Cambridge|pages=105|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was related to [[iatrochemistry]] in studying the human body in a systematic manner based on observations from the natural world though it had more emphasis on mathematical models rather than chemical processes.

== Background ==
The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was an era of radically changing ways of thought in Western politics, philosophy, and science. Major sociological changes occurred in the Enlightenment, as well as industrial and scientific. In medicine, the Enlightenment brought several discoveries and studies that were impacted by changing ways of thought. For example, discovery of [[Capillary|capillaries]] were made by [[Marcello Malpighi]]. Jean Baptiste von Helmonni (1577-1644) also was the first to consider digestion a fermentation process. He also identified hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Pathological anatomy and clinical observation were also being integrated into the medical curriculum. The Enlightenment also directly influenced the field of Iatrophysics through the development of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Antonie von Leeuwenhoek]]'s microscope, the advancement of the field of [[ophthalmology]] through the use of physics by [[René Descartes]], and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and idea of gravitational force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeobook.com/the-enlightenment-era-importance-impact-in-history-of-medicine/|title=The enlightenment era-importance &amp; impact in history of medicine {{!}} Homeopathy Resource by Homeobook.com|last=admin|website=www.homeobook.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==
Iatrophysicists drew inspiration from various established physical phenomena in order to explain how certain biological processes took place and how this can be applied towards medicine.

=== Particles ===
A key component of iatrophysical anatomy was the study of particles. This was particularly influenced by 17th century developments in microbiology, the most prominent being the microscope. Antonie von Leeuwenhoeck was a Dutch scientist who is known for his use of the microscope for identifying single-celled organisms. He was also the first to observe muscle fibers, [[bacteria]], [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] and blood flow in capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history-of-the-microscope.org|title=History of the microscope.org - Its all about microscope history|website=www.history-of-the-microscope.org|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another famous figure in microbiology at the time was [[Robert Hooke]], an English scientist most famous for his use of the microscope for the discovery of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|title=UCMP - University of California Museum of Paleontology|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his most famous work, ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665)'','' he attributed “occult properties” as elementary “contrivances of nature”. Like [[Galileo Galilei]], he shared an iatrophysical viewpoint and saw living organisms as groups of small machines. The development of the microscope was largely influential in this view.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/anatomy-and-physiology|title=Anatomy and Physiology - Dictionary definition of Anatomy and Physiology {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanics ===
Machines were used as models by Iatrophysicists to quantitatively describe linear and rotational motion of various biological systems such as human limbs and animals. Some models came into existence before Isaac Newton's formulation of his [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws in classical mechanics]], drawing on basic principles of statics and dynamics to represent how a biological system behaved. [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Giovanni Borelli]] was prolific in applying mechanics to a wide variety of humans and animals in different degrees of activity, drawing upon an array of simple machines and models for translational and rotational motion and equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521732567|location=Cambridge|pages=96–97, 105–106|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of Experimental Biology|last=Lutz|first=Peter|publisher=Humana Press|year=2002|isbn=0-89603-835-1|location=Totawa, New Jersey|pages=96–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maquet|first=Paul|year=1992|title=Iatrophysics to Biomechanics: From Borelli (1608-1679) TO PauwelsS (1885-1980)|url=http://www.bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/content/jbjsbr/74-B/3/335.full.pdf|journal=British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery|volume=74-B|pages=335–337|via=|doi=10.1302/0301-620x.74b3.1587872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluids ===
Iatrophysicists were also interested in studying how bodily liquids and gases were processed. They sought to understand how blood circulated throughout the body and what effects it made on the body. System consisted of arteries, veins, and vasculature verified through experiment and microscope by Marcello Malpighi's observations of capillaries in animal lung tissue. [[Albrecht von Haller]], as did Borelli, postulated that friction from the blood on vessel walls lead to body heat and even fever. A hydraulic model for motion by René Descartes implied the body had a system that maintained flow between the brain and muscles in equilibrium state through nerves and blood vessels.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Iatrophysicists ==
Starting in the 17th century, quantitative fields such as physics and mathematics began gaining legitimacy as a means of studying the natural world with the advent of theory, practices, and instruments. Static principles and simple machines were already in use to create various objects and buildings and thus were established tools that could be used to inspire models of biological systems. The development of medical instruments and techniques, such as the microscope and detailed dissections, changed how natural philosophers thought about how to explain the human body's properties. By enabling more detailed study of aspects of biology, let alone the human body, instrumentation and methods to directly study organic tissue allowed more opportunities for natural philosophers, Iatrophysicists in this case, to postulate and verify their theories. With inspiration from established explanations of natural phenomena and new informative means to study the human body available, iatrophysicists aimed to describe the human body and assert their explanation of various systems of the human body.

One example is the muscle and contraction. Various explanations on a macroscopic and microscopic scale were made to explain how muscles contracted and thus performed movements together. On a macroscopic scale through observation and anatomy, some iatrophysicists such as Borelli focused on explaining how muscles worked in conjunction together to form movements with dynamics or physical models. On a microscopic scale via observation and dissection, the contractility of muscle was to be explained by pneumatic expansion, a popular explanation supported by Descartes and Borelli, or inherent shape deformation, postulated by [[Nicolas Steno]] and [[Albrecht von Haller]] to an extent, based upon principles of fluids and statics. Other aspects of the human body such as circulation and digestion saw a number of explanations, and thus conflicting views based on the methodology used to derive and obtain an explanation, arise in the 17th and 18th centuries.

=== Prominent Iatrophysicists ===
One prominent iatrophysicist was Giovanni Borelli , who modeled the human body, various animals, and their motions using mechanical principles.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=J. D.|date=2003-01-08|title=Review Paper: Continuum biomechanics of soft biological tissues|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/459/2029/3|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=459|issue=2029|pages=3–46|doi=10.1098/rspa.2002.1060|issn=1364-5021}}&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague of Marcello Malphigi, Borelli was a mathematician who made connections between what he observed in living things and inanimate but relatively simple systems. He dissected animals and examined how muscles were to increase mechanical advantage, observed how a variety of living things performed different movements and activities such as running, carrying loads, swimming, and flying naturally rather than by his intervention, and devised simple methods to calculate a person's [[center of mass]]. He also devised relatively simple experiments and devices to make his observations such as a plank and rod for center of mass and a [[spirometer]] for volume of air. At the end of his life, his work culminated in ''De Motu Animalium'' (1679), a publication showcasing his investigations in similarities and differences in muscles across living things and his understanding of the underlying mechanism of muscle contraction, expansion via influx of fluids or gases released from nerves. He also attempted to describe more complicated processes such as nerve transmission and digestion.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maquet|first=Paul|year=1992|title=Iatrophysics to Biomechanics: From Borelli (1608-1679) TO PauwelsS (1885-1980)|url=http://www.bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/content/jbjsbr/74-B/3/335.full.pdf|journal=British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery|volume=74-B|pages=335–337|via=|doi=10.1302/0301-620x.74b3.1587872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable iatrophysicist was the French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, who, as a consequence of his philosophy asserting that the human body and soul are two dual entities, treated the human body as a machine that could be quantified, disassembled, and studied. He attempted to model various phenomena such as the brain, movement, sleep, circulation, and senses with analogies to inanimate objects such as reservoirs, pipes, lenses and steam engines that often sought to maintain an equilibrium for certain states. Some of his claims often were independent of physical observation of the organ or body in question and emphasized what he deemed as "simple" or "rational" rather than reality. For example, he asserts that blood circulates throughout the body by expanding as vapor by the heart's heat rather than from contraction.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[William Harvey]]  postulated blood flow as a closed, continuous loop that run throughout body that contained a certain quantity of blood. To test his claim, Harvey dissected human corpses and animals and, based on his anatomical findings, devised a simple demonstration of how arteries and veins continuously carried blood throughout the body. Taking advantage of the fact that arteries and veins were at different depths below the skin, he tied a person's arm and had them squeeze a bar to shunt blood from arteries to veins, indicating that blood somehow traveled along arteries and into veins. His claim was elucidated by Malphigi's discovery of capillaries and how they were interconnected with arteries and veins.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

One of the most influential iatrophysicists was [[Herman Boerhaave|Hermann Boerhaave]], a Dutch physician and chemist at the [[Leiden University]]. Like other iatrophysicists, he viewed physiology as a mechanism. While he disagreed with the idea that the body and the mind were connected, he attributed everything related to the body to extension, impenetrability, or motion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Francis Glisson]] was known for his work on circulation of the blood, the mechanisms of the nervous system, and hereditary diseases. He was largely influenced by Harvey’s work on the sentient nature of blood and his work demonstrates iatrophysical ideology particularly through his views of attraction and irritability, or the concept of how the body fibers react to irritation. In his work, ''Anatomia hepatis,'' he argues that branches cross, and carried blood is separated in the liver. This in turn is sucked up by biliary vessels through an attraction that Glisson attributes as similar, magnetic, or natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/food-and-drink/food-and-cooking-biographies/francis-glisson|title=Francis Glisson facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Francis Glisson|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albrecht von Haller was another prominent iatrophysicist, who like Glisson, focused on physiology as mechanisms of body fibers. He shared Glisson’s views on irritability, but unlike Glisson, attributed the reaction to external stimuli solely to body fibers, and not in the inherent power of matter as Glisson had suggested. In his work ''Physiologiae Corporis Humani'' (1757–1766), he described organs and muscles of the body as interwoven fibers. His viewpoints on muscles were that they had a contractile tendency which he termed ''vis mortua,'' or dead power. He attributed this muscle contraction to irritability, which he described as being an inherent power. He particularly made the distinction between irritability and sensibility, irritability being the power of muscular contraction and sensibility being nerve impulse. Therefore, a part was irritable if it contracted upon contact, and sensible if the contact impacted the mind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Other Iatrophysicists ===
[[Santorio Santorio]] was a Venetian doctor who, in attempt to quantify human digestion, carefully measured his food/water intake and excretion weight over many years. To establish a mathematical relationship between food/water intake and excretion, Santorius designed a special chair that had a balance that weighed a subject's meal and consequent excrement. Based on these measurements, he then calculated the net change in weight for each day. In addition to knowing what he took in, he also analyzed the contents of his excretions and secretions, categorizing it by type and origin. He also made other clinical instruments to measure other medical quantities such as temperature and pulse.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Nicolas Steno]] was a Danish scientist who developed a purely mechanical and geometrical model of muscle. In this model, he treated a muscle as an interwoven yet simple network of long fibers, forming a uniform and robust geometric shape. Contraction was then explained as the reshaping of this network to either shorten or lengthen along one direction, thus the muscle changed shape at a fixed volume by only changing the angles between each fibre. This explanation of contraction, and his consequent theory that the heart contracted by many of its fibers shortening and lengthening, was considered radical. The most popular explanation, supported by well known Iatrophysicists such as Descartes and Borelli, asserted that the heart contracted from its fibers inflating themselves through a chemical reaction.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrini|first=Paolo|last2=Lanzino|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Parenti|first3=Giuliano Francesco|date=2010-07-01|title=Niels Stensen (1638–1686): Scientist, Neuroanatomist, and Saint|url=https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-lookup/doi/10.1227/01.NEU.0000370248.80291.C5|journal=Neurosurgery|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000370248.80291.c5|issn=0148-396X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Iatrochemistry ==
Similar to iatrophysics, [[iatrochemistry]] was a school of thought that related medicine and anatomy instead to chemistry, instead of mechanics. Iatrophysics and iatrochemistry were closely related. Many prominent iatrophysicists such as Borelli and Descartes utilized chemistry in order to explain physiological processes. Particularly, [[Franciscus Sylvius]] was an adamant believer in chemical processes as an explanation for the body. He emphasized fermentation and effervescence for the input of chemistry and circulation into physiology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although iatrochemistry and iatrophysics were similar in ways of thought, and also went hand-in-hand in many aspects, they also conflicted at times. For example, the concept of fermentation arose from iatrochemical background. A book on fermentation by Henri Louis de Rouviere (1708) connected fermentation with health. However, it also dismissed the relationship of mechanics with health and the mechanistic model of the body. Another conflict arose in explanation of digestion. While iatrophysicists explained the event through mechanistic terms, iatrochemists argued for fermentation as the reason for the digestive processes in the body. Furthermore, while iatrophysicists rejected acid-base theory as an explanation for bodily processes, iatrochemists embraced the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohi8z3wUZiIC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=iatrophysics+and+iatrochemistry+conflict&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aAsH69B0qm&amp;sig=jRs5iyCHZbOVLEJmC0EfPrKXQoE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDjpDxqe3SAhVEPCYKHQLfDZgQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=iatrophysics%20and%20iatrochemistry%20conflict&amp;f=false|title=The French Paracelsians: The Chemical Challenge to Medical and Scientific Tradition in Early Modern France|last=Debus|first=Allen George|date=2002-08-15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521894449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on Medicine ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], Galenic anatomo-physiology prevailed as the leading medical thought. Furthermore, [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] had dominated for centuries, including the humoral system as a primary method of medical thought. However, the philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]], and [[Galen]] began to wane in popularity, replaced by anatomical and philosophical schools of thought based on mechanics and chemical naturalism. Ideologies such as iatrophysics and iatrochemistry began to prevail. The decline of Galenic philosophy-based medicine coupled with the rise of new ideologies was spurred by the advent of new discoveries in anatomy and physiology, such as that of William Harvey’s work centered on circulation of the blood. His idea that pulse, respiration, and nutrition were all working components of a unified system revolutionized preexisting ideas about blood, nutrition, and heat. The discovery of the circulation of the blood was crucial in the development of iatrophysics in that it was the first that related “circulations” to physiological functions. This led to the advent of new discoveries such as the circulation of nutritive fluid, circulation of lymph, and circulation of nervous juice, all of which relate a machine-like mechanism to anatomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditionally, physiological functions were believed to be regulated by purposeful tendencies. However, the advent of the new medicinal schools of thought transformed the way physiology was approached. Secretion and excretion were no longer due to attractive tendencies, the function of the lungs were now due to the mixing of different parts of the blood, digestion was seen as a process of grinding and mincing, and health and disease were associated with movement, obstruction, and stagnation of the various bodily fluids running through the body. The body increasingly became viewed as a function of a machine, especially with the development of Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation and motion. Newtonian physics came to widely influence the way the body was viewed, and physiology was increasingly focused on a clockwork mechanism, and the later hydraulics was even applied to the movement of bodily fluids. Furthermore, with the publication of Newton’s ''[[Opticks]]'' in 1704, physiologists increasingly depended on the notions of ether and effluvia in their anatomical observations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846 p. 313 Swenson/Lowrie translation 1941}}

An '''institutional review board''' ('''IRB'''), also known as an '''independent ethics committee''' ('''IEC'''), '''ethical review board''' ('''ERB'''), or '''research ethics board''' ('''REB'''), is a type of [[committee]] that applies [[research#Research ethics|research ethics]] by reviewing the [[methodology|methods]] proposed for [[research]] to ensure that they are [[ethics|ethical]]. Such boards are formally designated to approve (or reject), monitor, and review [[biomedical]] and [[behavioral]] research involving [[human]]s. They often conduct some form of [[risk-benefit analysis]] in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Human Research Protection. Institutional Review Board Guidebook. "Chapter 3, Section A: Risk/Benefit Analysis.” pp. 1-10 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PSYCH202A-3.1.4-Institutional-Review-Board.pdf] Retrieved May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and [[quality of life|welfare]] of humans participating as subjects in a research study. Along with developed countries, many developing countries have established national, regional or local Institutional Review Boards in order to safeguard ethical conduct of research concerning both national and international norms, regulations or codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy), and seeks to maximize the safety of subjects.

In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (specifically [[Office for Human Research Protections]]) regulations (see [[Human subject research legislation in the United States]]) have empowered IRBs to approve, require modifications in planned research prior to approval, or disapprove research. IRBs are responsible for critical oversight functions for research conducted on human subjects that are "scientific", "ethical", and "regulatory". The equivalent body responsible for overseeing U.S. federally funded research using animals is the [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC).

IRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of [[health]] and the social sciences, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]. Such studies may be [[clinical trials]] of new drugs or devices, studies of personal or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be improved.

==United States mandate for IRBs==
{{see also|Human subject research legislation in the United States}}

Formal review procedures for institutional human subject studies were originally developed in direct response to research abuses in the 20th century. Among the most notorious of these abuses were the [[Nazi human experimentation|experiments of Nazi physicians]], which became a focus of the post-World War II [[Doctors' Trial]], the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]], a long-term project conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], and numerous [[human radiation experiments]] conducted during the [[Cold War]].  Other controversial U.S. projects undertaken during this era include the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]], the [[Stanford prison experiment]], and [[Project MKULTRA]], a series of classified [[mind control]] studies organized by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

The result of these abuses was the [[National Research Act|National Research Act of 1974]] and the development of the [[Belmont Report]], which outlined the primary ethical principles in human subjects review; these include "respect for persons", "beneficence", and "justice". An IRB may only approve research for which the risks to subjects are balanced by potential benefits to society, and for which the selection of subjects presents a fair or just distribution of risks and benefits to eligible participants. A ''[[bona fide]]'' process for obtaining [[informed consent]] from participants is also generally needed. However, this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances – for example, when the risk of harm to participants is clearly minimal.

In the United States, IRBs are governed by Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=HHS.gov |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations define the rules and responsibilities for institutional review, which is required for all research that receives support, directly or indirectly, from the United States federal government. IRBs are themselves regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Additional requirements apply to IRBs that oversee clinical trials of drugs involved in [[new drug application]]s, or to studies that are supported by the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In addition to registering its IRB with the OHRP, an institution is also required to obtain and maintain a ''Federalwide Assurance'' or FWA, before undertaking federally funded human research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html|title=IRBs and Assurances|author=|date=22 December 2010|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an agreement in which the institution commits to abiding by the regulations governing human research. A secondary supplement to the FWA is required when institutions are undertaking research supported by the U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx Human Research Protection Program (HRPP).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055955/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''DoD Addendum'' includes further compliance requirements for studies using military personnel, or when the human research involves populations in conflict zones, foreign prisoners, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx HRPP Information Sheet for DoD Addendum.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055816/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
U.S. regulations identify several research categories that are considered exempt from IRB oversight. These categories include: 
*Research in conventional educational settings, such as those involving the study of instructional strategies or effectiveness of various techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods. In the case of studies involving the use of educational tests, there are specific provisions in the exemption to ensure that subjects cannot be identified or exposed to risks or liabilities.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.101 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research involving the analysis of existing data and other materials if they are already publicly available, or where the data can be collected such that individual subjects cannot be identified in any way.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;
*Studies intended to assess the performance or effectiveness of public benefit or service programs, or to evaluate food taste, quality, or consumer acceptance.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;

Generally, human research ethics guidelines require that decisions about exemption are made by an IRB representative, not by the investigators themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, F. et al, ''Running Behavioral Studies with Human Participants'', Sage Publications Inc. 2013., {{ISBN|9781452217420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International ethics review committees==
Numerous other countries have equivalent regulations or guidelines governing human subject studies and the [[ethics committee]]s that oversee them. However, the organizational responsibilities and the scope of the oversight purview can differ substantially from one nation to another, especially in the domain of non-medical research. The [[United States]] [[Department of Health and Human Services]] maintains a comprehensive compilation of regulations and guidelines in other countries, as well as related standards from a number of international and regional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/index.html International Compilation of Human Research Protections], Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming and composition ==
Although "IRB" is a generic term used in the United States by the FDA and HHS, each institution that establishes such a board may use whatever name it chooses. Many simply capitalize the term "Institutional Review Board" as the [[proper noun|proper name]] of their instance. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the FDA's IRB regulations when studies of FDA-regulated products are reviewed and approved. At one time such a committee was named the "Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects". Originally, IRBs were simply committees at academic institutions and medical facilities to monitor research studies involving human participants, primarily to minimize or avoid [[ethics|ethical]] problems. Today, some of these reviews are conducted by for-profit organizations known as 'independent' or 'commercial' IRBs. The responsibilities of these IRBs are identical to those based at academic or medical institutions, and they are governed by the same U.S. federal regulations.

The regulations set out the board's membership and composition requirements, with provisions for diversity in experience, expertise, and institutional affiliation. For example, the minimum number of members is five, at least one scientist, and at least one non-scientist. The guidance strongly suggests that the IRB contain both men and women, but there is no regulatory requirement for gender balance in the IRB's membership.  The full requirements are set out in 21 CFR 56.107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PART 56 - INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS | url=http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] | date=28 June 1991 | accessdate=2009-05-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813094327/http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | archivedate=13 August 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convened and expedited reviews==
Unless a research proposal is determined to be exempt (see below), the IRB undertakes its work either in a convened meeting (a "full" review) or by using an expedited review procedure.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.108 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a full review is required, a majority of the IRB members must be present at the meeting, at least one of whom has primary concern for the nonscientific aspects of the research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt; The research can be approved if a majority of those present are in favor.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt;

An expedited review may be carried out if the research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects, or where minor changes are being made to previously approved research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.110 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations provide a list of research categories that may be reviewed in this manner.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt; An expedited review is carried out by the IRB chair, or by their designee(s) from the board membership. Research activity cannot be disapproved by expedited review.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt;

==Pharmaceutical trials and good clinical practice==
The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation]] sets out guidelines for registration of pharmaceuticals in multiple countries. It defines [[Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP), which is an agreed quality standard that governments can transpose into regulations for [[clinical trials]] involving human subjects.&lt;ref name=ICH-GCP&gt;{{cite web|last=International Conference on Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use|title=Good Clinical Practice|url=http://ichgcp.net/|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a summary of several key regulatory guidelines for oversight of clinical trials:

*Safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all trial subjects. Special attention should be paid to trials that may include vulnerable subjects, such as pregnant women, children, prisoners, the elderly, or persons with diminished comprehension.
*Obtain trial protocol(s)/amendment(s), written [[Informed consent|Informed Consent Form(s)]] (ICFs) and consent form updates the investigator proposes for use in the trial, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to subjects, investigator's brochure, available safety information, information about payments and compensation available to subjects, the investigator's current ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' and/or other documentation evidencing qualifications, and any other documents the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities.
*Review both the amount and method of payment to subjects to assure neither presents problems of coercion or undue influence on the trial subjects. Payments to a subject should be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion of the trial by the subject. Information regarding payment to subjects, including the methods, amounts, and schedule of payment to trial subjects, should be set forth in the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The way payment will be prorated should be specified.
*Ensure that the proposed trial is reviewed within a reasonable time and document opinions and decisions in writing, clearly identifying the trial, the documents reviewed and recorded dates for approvals, required modifications prior to approval, disapproval of a proposed trial, or termination/suspension of any prior approval. Continuing review of ongoing trials is required at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk to human subjects, but at least once per year.

The reviewers may also request that more information be given to subjects when, in their judgment, the additional information would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the subjects. When a non-therapeutic trial is to be carried out with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative, reviewers should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials. Where the protocol indicates prior consent of the trial subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative is not possible, the review should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately addresses relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials (i.e., in emergency situations).

== Adapting IRB review to social science ==
While the Belmont principles and U.S. federal regulations were formulated with biomedical and social-behavioral research in mind, the enforcement of the regulations, the examples used in typical presentations regarding the history of the regulatory requirements, and the extensiveness of written guidance have been predominantly focused on biomedical research.

Numerous complaints by investigators about the fit between the federal regulations and its IRB review requirements as they relate to social science research have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunsalus|first=C.K.|last2=Bruner|first2=Edward M.|last3=Burbules|first3=Nicholas C.|last4=Dash|first4=Leon|last5=Finkin|first5=Matthew|last6=Goldberg|first6=Joseph P.|last7=Greenough|first7=William T.|last8=Miller|first8=Gregory A.|last9=Pratt|first9=Michael G.|date=2016-06-29|title=The Illinois White Paper|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077800407300785|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=617–649|doi=10.1177/1077800407300785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broad complaints range from the legitimacy of IRB review, the applicability of the concepts of risk as it pertains to social science (e.g., possibly unneeded, over-burdensome requirements), and the requirements for the documentation of participants' informed consent (i.e., consent forms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perrault|first1=E.

In 2003, the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP), in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], unstructured interviews (as if for a piece of journalism), collecting anecdotes, and similar [[free speech]] activities often do not constitute "human subject research" as defined in the regulations and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{Cite journal

Other federal agencies supporting social science have attempted to provide guidance in this area, especially the National Science Foundation. In general, the NSF guidelines assure IRBs that the regulations have some flexibility and rely on the common sense of the IRB to focus on limiting harm, maximizing informed consent, and limiting bureaucratic limitations of valid research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/hsfaqs.jsp|title=FAQs and Vignettes - NSF - National Science Foundation|author=|date=|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of big data research pose formidable challenges for research ethics and thus show potential for wider applicability of formal review processes.&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chen |first=Sophia |date=2017-09-18 |title=AI research is in desperate need of an ethical watchdog |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-research-is-in-desperate-need-of-an-ethical-watchdog/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zhang |first=Sarah |date=2016-05-20 |title=Scientists are just as confused about the ethics of big-data research as you |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/scientists-just-confused-ethics-big-data-research/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_550016a"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |date=2017-10-03 |title=Ethics of Internet research trigger scrutiny: Concern over the use of public data spurs guideline update |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/550016a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/ethics-of-internet-research-trigger-scrutiny-1.22746 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theme is [[data breach]]es, but another with high difficulty is potentially dangerous [[predictive analytics]] with [[unintended consequences]], via [[type I and type II errors|false-positives]] or new ways to invade [[privacy]]. A 2016 article on the hope to expand ethics reviews of such research included an example of a data breach in which a big data researcher leaked 70,000 [[OkCupid]] profiles with usernames and sexual orientation data.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; It also gave an example of potential privacy invasion and government repression in which [[machine learning]] was used to build automated [[gaydar]], labeling strangers as "probably gay" based on their facial photographs.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; Analogies with [[phrenology]]&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"/&gt; and [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–45)|Nazis identifying people as "probably part-Jewish"]] based on facial features have been made to show what can go wrong with research whose authors may have failed to adequately think through the risks of harm. Such challenges broach familiar themes, such as [[mistaken identity]], [[precrime]], and [[persecution]], in new applications.

== Managing conflicts of interest ==
While the IRB approval and oversight process is designed to protect the rights and welfare of the [[research subject]]s, it has been the subject of criticism, by bioethicists and others, for [[conflicts of interest]] resulting in lax oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030309 |title=Should Society Allow Research Ethics Boards to Be Run As For-Profit Enterprises? |publisher=PLOS Medicine |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caroline McNeil |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/7/502.full |title=Debate Over Institutional Review Boards Continues as Alternative Options Emerge |publisher=Jnci.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the for-profit [[Western Institutional Review Board]] claimed to conduct the majority of reviews for new drug submissions to the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott |first=Carl |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2005/12/ethics_for_sale.html |title=Ethics for sale |publisher=Slate.com |date=2005-12-13 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2006 study of 575 IRB members at university medical centers, over one-third reported industry financial ties and over one-third admitted they "rarely or never" disclosed conflicts of interest to other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrp.org/cms/content/view/402/100/|title=Hospital IRBs are "On the Take"-Tainted by Conflicts ofInterest_NEJM - AHRP|author=|date=29 November 2006|website=ahrp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) set up a series of undercover tests to determine whether the IRB system was vulnerable to unethical manipulation.  In one test, a fake product "Adhesiabloc" was submitted to a number of IRBs for approval for human tests.  The product, company, and CVs of the supposed researchers were all fictitious and documents were forged by the GAO.  The product was deliberately formulated to match some "significant risk" criteria of the FDA and was described by GAO as a "gel that would be poured into a patient’s stomach after surgery to collect the bits and pieces left over from an operation."  Despite this, one IRB approved the device for human testing.  Other IRBs to whom the device was submitted rejected the application, one of them saying it was "the riskiest thing I’ve ever seen on this board".  However, none of the IRBs approached detected that the company and product were fake.  The GAO also set up a fake IRB and obtained requests for approval from companies.  They succeeded in getting assurance approval from the HHS for their fake IRB.  HHS has only three staff to deal with 300 IRB registrations and 300 assurance applications per month.  HHS stated that it would not be worthwhile to carry out additional evaluation even if they had the staff to do it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09448t.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;mdash;By Carl Elliott |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/institutional-review-boards |title=Poor Reviews |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124042341694744375 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Alicia | last=Mundy | title=Coast IRB, Caught in Sting, to Close | date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing/institutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602161247/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing%2Finstitutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit |date=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodfreedom.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/fda-approves-nonexistent-product-from-nonexistent-company-for-human-testing/ |title=FDA Approves Nonexistent Product from Nonexistent Company for Human Testing &amp;#124; Food Freedom |publisher=Foodfreedom.wordpress.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:What happened then stories (1918) (14566206889).jpg|thumb|Jack meets a fairy in ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'']]

'''Jack''' is an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[Cornish people|Cornish]] and [[English folklore|English]] [[hero]] and [[stock character]] appearing in [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and [[nursery rhyme]]s, generally portrayed as a [[youth|young adult]]. Unlike [[morality play|moralizing fairy heroes]], Jack is often portrayed as lazy or foolish, but through the use of cleverness and tricks he usually emerges triumphant. In this way, he may resemble a [[trickster]].

Some of the most famous are "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]", "[[Jack Frost]]", "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]", "[[Little Jack Horner]]" and "[[This Is the House That Jack Built]]". While these heroes are not necessarily congruous, their concepts are related and in some instances interchangeable. The notion of "Jack" is closely related and sometimes identical to the English hero [[John (given name)|John]]. He also corresponds with the [[German folklore|German]] [[Hans in Luck|Hans]] (or Hänsel) and the [[Russian folklore|Russian]] Iván.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jack Zipes |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbmmrhmwix0C&amp;dq=jack+hero+-+english+fairy+tales+-15th+century&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Speaking Out: Storytelling and Creative Drama for Children |page=129 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-4159-6660-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jack tales" are also popular in [[Appalachia#Folklore|Appalachian]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ferrum.edu/applit//articles/wondertales.htm |title=Wonder Tales in Appalachia |publisher=AppLit |author=Grace Toney Edwards |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CSxlgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Journey+Through+Fantasy+Literature:+A+Resource+Guide+for+Teachers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tzerVLDRNYiuogSskYGACg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA |title=Journey Through Fantasy Literature: A Resource Guide for Teachers |author=Roberta T.

Council Harmon's grandfather, Cutliff Harmon, is thought to very possibly be the one who originally brought the Jack tales to America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P34ONYQuaLoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Cutliff+Harmon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FvlAHU38_S&amp;sig=cSK2VF4lQ01rKL2ajJ-P42Z1VgY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZCNqTKuuDYP78Aa-xsGzBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Cutliff%20Harmon&amp;f=false Betty N.

"Told by R. M. Ward and his kindred in the Beech Mountain section of Western North Carolina and by other descendants of Council Harmon (1803-1896) elsewhere in The Southern Mountains; with three tales from Wise County, Virginia. Set down from these sources and edited by [[Richard Chase (folklorist)|Richard Chase]]; with an appendix compiled by [[Herbert Halpert]]; and illustrated by Berkeley Williams, Jr."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, where the English original would feature a king or other noble, the Appalachian Jack tale version would have a sheriff. Some stories feature Jack's brothers, Will and Tom. Some Jack tales feature themes that trace to Germanic folk tales.

'''Librairie Avant-Garde ([[Mount Wutai]] Branch)'''  is a bookstore opened by [[Qian Xiaohua]] in 2004, now regarded as the most representative bookstore in [[Nanjing]], [[China]]. It has become a cultural icon of the city, and because of the adjacency to [[Nanjing University]] and the popularity among students, it is dubbed as "the second library of Nanjing University".

The bookshop is hidden in a former government parking lot underneath [[Wutaishan Stadium]], which has been used as a bomb shelter. Covering 3780 sq meter, it provides a large volume of social science and humanities books that have been recognized by the literati and history, ranging from [[literature]], [[history]], [[philosophy]],  [[Film|movie]], [[music]], [[photography]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[cartoon]] and [[Advertising|advertisement]] to [[social science]], [[business]] and [[journalism]], while excluding [[reference work]] and other practical books.

== Founding ==
After all the hardship of running the bookstore, bankruptcy in 2003 and the unpredictable, [[Qian Xiaohua]] restored energy and opened a flagship bookstore in an underground parking lot, on Guangzhou Road. Because at the time most friends of Qian were [[avant-garde]] writers, and he himself was an avid  [[French literature]] lover, he named the bookstore Librairie Avant-Garde, in which Librairie is a French word that means bookshop. He hoped the bookstore could serve as a spiritual guide for the people making their way in darkness. "A good bookshop should provide space, vision and nurture the city with its humanitarian spirit," owner Qian Xiaohua tells CNN. "It's a place for people to have dreams in the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/03/travel/worlds-coolest-bookstores-new/|title=World's coolest bookstores|last=Cha|first=Frances|date=August 4, 2015|website=CNN Travel|publisher=CNN|access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top two countries by number of World Heritage sites are located in this region: Italy with 53 sites and Spain with 46 sites (43 sites not including those on the Canary Islands). Seven sites are shared between several countries: [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art|Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the Côa Valley and Siega Verde]] (Portugal and Spain), [[Rhaetian Railway]] in the [[Albula Railway|Albula]] / [[Bernina railway|Bernina]] Landscapes (Italy and [[Switzerland]]), [[Monte San Giorgio]] (Italy and Switzerland), Historic Centre of [[Rome]], the Properties of the [[Holy See]] in that City Enjoying Extraterritorial Rights and [[San Paolo Fuori le Mura]] (Holy See and Italy), [[Pyrénées]] – [[Mont Perdu]] ([[France]] and Spain), [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] ([[Austria]], France, [[Germany]], Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland) and [[Heritage of Mercury.

In Southern Europe, there are 150 cultural, 12 natural, and 7 mixed sites.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List." One of the sites ([[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]]) in Southern Europe is listed as endangered and four sites ([[Old City of Dubrovnik]], [[Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor]], [[Plitvice Lakes National Park]] and [[Butrint]]) were previously listed. Possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of other cases.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/247 |title=Decision - 28COM 15B.75 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The site, extensively fortified from the 17th to 19th centuries, represents the largest bulwarked dry ditch system in the work. Within its walls, the town contains barracks and other military buildings as well as churches and monasteries. While Elvas contains remains dating back to the 10th century A.D., its fortification began when Portugal regained independence in 1640. The fortifications designed by Dutch Jesuit Padre João Piscásio Cosmander represent the best surviving example of the Dutch school of fortifications anywhere. The site also contains the Amoreira Aqueduct, built to enable the stronghold to withstand lengthy sieges.

It was known as Felix Romuliana, named after the emperor’s mother. The site consists of fortifications, the palace in the north-western part of the complex, basilicas, temples, hot baths, memorial complex, and a tetrapylon. The group of buildings is also unique in its intertwining of ceremonial and memorial functions.

| The four edifices of the site reflect the high points of the Byzantine-Romanesque ecclesiastical culture, with its distinct style of wall painting, which developed in the Balkans between the 13th and 17th centuries. The Dečani Monastery was built in the mid-14th century for the Serbian king Stefan Dečanski and is also his mausoleum. The [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]] is a group of four domed churches featuring series of wall paintings. The 13th-century frescoes of the Church of Holy Apostles are painted in a unique, monumental style. Early 14th-century frescoes in the church of the Holy Virgin of Ljevisa represent the appearance of the new so-called Palaiologian Renaissance style, combining the influences of the eastern Orthodox Byzantine and the Western Romanesque traditions. The style played a decisive role in subsequent Balkan art. The site has been listed as [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]] since 2006 due to a lack of legal protection and management; political instability and security.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1009">'''Louisville''' is a village in the [[Corozal District]] of the nation of [[Belize]], located at {{coord|18|19|N|88|30|W|}}.  According to the 2000 census, it had a population of 655 people mainly from [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Mestizo]] ancestry.

Some substantial artificial mounds at Louisville are the remains of an ancient city of the [[Maya civilization]]. The site seems to have been occupied from about 400 BC to about 950 AD. Excavations, made here by Dr. [[Thomas Gann]] in the mid-1930s, uncovered polychrome stucco portrait heads.

Much of the ancient remains were demolished to reuse stone and make fill for roads.  Further investigations and excavations of Louisville were made in 2000.

&lt;!--Note to editors: Keep this focused on the fan fiction origins and [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|sourceable]], [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] references in the media. If you are going to add/mention a specific character as a "Mary Sue", please be sure to cite a published source, such as a notable review of the work, that clearly and specifically identifies the character as a "Mary Sue". Please do not add any or all powerful, leading female characters without any citations to back them up. See [[chocolate box]] for an example. Thank you.

A '''Mary Sue''' is an idealized and seemingly perfect [[character (arts)|fictional character]]. Often, this character is recognized as an [[Self-insertion|author insert]] or [[wish fulfillment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |first=Miriam |series=Digital Career Building |year=2008 |title=Career Building Through Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing|Rosen Publishing Group]] |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience, and usually are able through some means to upstage the main protagonist of an established fictional setting, such as by saving the hero. A male can also be referred to as a '''Marty Stu,''' '''Larry Stu,''' or '''Gary Stu''', but the name Mary Sue is more commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue30/marysue.htm|website=fmwriters.com|author=Kat Feete|year=2005|title=Who is Mary Sue?|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springhole.net/writing/whatisamarysue.htm |title=What is a Mary Sue? |publisher=Springhole.net |date=2004-03-23 |accessdate=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu |title=Marty Stu |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development of the meaning ==
The term "Mary Sue" comes from the name of a character created by Paula Smith in 1973 for her [[parody]] story "A Trekkie's Tale"&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | first=Joan Marie | last=Verba| title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf| date=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka, Minnesota | isbn=0-9653575-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} published in her [[fanzine]] ''Menagerie'' #2.&lt;ref name=OED1095&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1095 | title = SF Citations for OED: Mary Sue| accessdate = 2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story starred Lieutenant Mary Sue ("the youngest Lieutenant in the fleet — only fifteen and a half years old"), and satirized unrealistic characters in ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fan fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cynthia W.|last=Walker |title=A Conversation with Paula Smith| url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/243/205 | publisher=[[Transformative Works and Cultures]]|date=2011 | number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, ''Menagerie'''s editors stated that they disliked such characters, saying:

{{quote|Mary Sue stories&amp;mdash;the adventures of the youngest and smartest ever person to graduate from the academy and ever get a commission at such a tender age. Usually characterized by unprecedented skill in everything from art to zoology, including karate and arm-wrestling. This character can also be found burrowing her way into the good graces/heart/mind of one of the Big Three &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], [[Spock]], and [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, if not all three at once. She saves the day by her wit and ability, and, if we are lucky, has the good grace to die at the end, being grieved by the entire ship.&lt;ref name="byrd1978"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Patricia|last=Byrd |title=Star Trek Lives: Trekker Slang| journal=[[American Speech]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, North Carolina|date=Spring 1978 | volume=53 | issue=1 | pages=52–58 | jstor=455340 | doi=10.2307/455340}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Mary Sue" today has changed from its original meaning and now carries a generalized, although not universal, connotation of wish-fulfillment and is commonly associated with [[self-insertion]], though the characterization of upstaging the established protagonist(s) of existing properties remains fundamental. True self-insertion is a literal and generally undisguised representation of the author; most characters described as "Mary Sues" are not, though they are often called "proxies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David| last = Orr |url = http://donswaim.com/nytimes.digital.lit.html | title = The Widening Web of Digital Lit | work = [[The New York Times]]| publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=October 3, 2004|accessdate =October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the author. The negative connotation comes from this "wish-fulfillment" implication: the "Mary Sue" is judged as a poorly developed character, too perfect and lacking in realism to be interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas|last = Milhorn | title = Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft | publisher = Lightning Source Incorporated | location=La Vergne, Tennessee|date = 2006| page = 55 | isbn= 1581129181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In chapter four of her book ''Enterprising Women'',&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Camille |last=Bacon-Smith |title=Enterprising Women: Television Fandom and the Creation of Popular Myth |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=December 1, 1991|ISBN=978-0812213799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camille Bacon-Smith states that fear of creating a "Mary Sue" may be restricting and even silencing to some writers.

Smith quotes an issue of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fanzine]] ''Archives''&lt;ref name="Yeoman"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joanna |last=Cantor |title=Mary Sue, a Short Compendium |journal=Archives |volume= |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Yeoman Press |location=Danvers, Massachusetts|date=1980|doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as identifying "Mary Sue" paranoia as one of the sources for the lack of "believable, competent, and identifiable-with [sic] female characters." In this article, author Joanna Cantor interviews her sister Edith, also an amateur editor, who says she receives stories with cover letters apologizing for the tale as "a Mary Sue", even when the author admits she does not know what a "Mary Sue" is. According to Edith Cantor, while Paula Smith's original "Trekkie's Tale" was only ten paragraphs long, "in terms of their impact on those whom they affect, those words [Mary Sue] have got to rank right up there with the [[Selective Service Act of 1948|Selective Service Act]]".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; At Clippercon 1987 (a ''Star Trek'' fan convention held yearly in Baltimore, Maryland), Smith interviewed a panel of female authors who say they do not include female characters in their stories at all. She quoted one as saying "Every time I've tried to put a woman in any story I've ever written, everyone immediately says, this is a Mary Sue." Smith also pointed out that "Participants in a panel discussion in January 1990 noted with growing dismay that any female character created within the community is damned with the term Mary Sue."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 110. A footnote states this was reported to her by Judy Chien, who attended the panel at MostEastlyCon 1990 in Newark.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bacon-Smith notes that fans have argued that in ''[[Star Trek]]'' as originally created, [[James T. Kirk]] is himself a "Marty Stu," and that the label seems to be used more indiscriminately on female characters who do not behave in accordance with the dominant culture's images and expectations for females as opposed to males.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon-Smith, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Ann Crispin|Ann C. Crispin]] is quoted as saying: "The term 'Mary Sue' constitutes a put-down, implying that the character so summarily dismissed is ''not'' a true character, no matter how well drawn, what sex, species, or degree of individuality."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon-Smith, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Scodari, a researcher in media studies from gender perspective, noticed a supposed tendency within [[slash fandom]] to label major female characters (e.g. [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]] in the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' 2009]] film [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]) as "Mary Sues" because the slash fans "begrudged" how the development of the female character takes away screen time from slashable male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christine|last1=Scodari|title="Nyota Uhura is Not a White Girl": Gender, intersectionality, and Star Trek 2009's alternate romantic universes|journal=[[Feminist Media Studies]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=September 2012|volume=12|issue=3|pages=335–351|doi=10.1080/14680777.2011.615605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
'''Marty''',{{anchor|marty_stu}} '''Gary''', '''Gary Stu''', or '''Larry Stu''' are alternative labels names given to this [[Trope (literature)|trope]], when the same wish-fulfillment aspect is applied to male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karin|last1=Kukkonen|first2=Sonja|last2=Klimek|title=Metalepsis in Popular Culture|section=Gary Stu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvf47a4jVzcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Marty+Stu#v=onepage&amp;q=Marty%20Stu&amp;f=false |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Germany|accessdate=20 December 2012|isbn=9783110252781|year=2011|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ongoingworlds"&gt;{{cite web|title=The many different types of Mary Sue|url=http://www.ongoingworlds.com/blog/2011/04/the-many-different-types-of-mary-sue/|publisher=OngoingWorlds.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' character [[Wesley Crusher]] was described, in hostile terms, as a "Gary Stu" by the feminist popular culture magazine ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oRgFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Marty+Stu+Wesley+Crusher&amp;dq=Marty+Stu+Wesley+Crusher | title = Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture | publisher=Bitch Publications|location=Portland, Oregon|date = 2006|volume= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation amongst fans and academics, mainly pejorative, that Wesley was a self-insertion character for [[Gene Roddenberry]], Roddenberry's middle name being Wesley.&lt;ref name="wheaton"&gt;{{cite web |first=Megan |last=Leigh |url= http://pop-verse.com/2013/07/31/nostalgic-impulse-in-defense-of-wesley-crusher |title= Nostalgic Impulse: In defense of… Wesley Crusher |website= Pop Verse |date= July 13, 2013 |accessdate= July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further variant names have been suggested based on the specific personality of a Mary Sue, such as ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] Sue''{{anchor|einstein_sue}} (an implausibily intelligent character), ''Mary [[Sun Tzu|Tzu]]''{{anchor|mary_tzu}} (one with unrealistically sharp tactical acumen), ''Jerk Sue''{{anchor|jerk_sue}} (a short-tempered character who lashes out, yet is still loved by those around them), or ''Sympathetic Sue''{{anchor|sympathetic_sue}} (a depressed character who is meant to incur the reader's sympathy).&lt;ref name="ongoingworlds" /&gt;

== Allusions ==
In 2004, David Orr, in a review of online fan fiction websites FanFiction.net and Godawful Fan Fiction for ''The New York Times Book Review'', referred to "Mary Sue" as "a ludicrously empowered author proxy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Orr|url=http://donswaim.com/nytimes.digital.lit.html|title=The Widening Web of Digital Lit|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=2004|accessdate=October 2, 2006||quote=When you've had your fill of slash, gen, and 'ship fiction (fanfic terms for various character entanglements), when you groan at the arrival of each new "Mary Sue" (a ludicrously empowered author proxy) ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[Superstar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Superstar]]" has been analyzed as being a deliberate [[satire]] of Mary Sue/Marty Stu type of stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shiloh|last=Carroll|url=http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage28/Carroll.htm|title=Psychology of a "Superstar": A Psychological Analysis of Jonathan Levinson|website=Slayage Online.com|accessdate=June 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119141738/http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage28/Carroll.htm|archivedate=November 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Rhonda V.|last1=Wilcox|first2=David|last2=Lavery|title=Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer?|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|date=February 25, 2002|via=Google Books)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbgaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=buffy+superstar+mary+sue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tUss-ER3-m&amp;sig=TzBFkDB2U_BWemtEQowqOZF7uw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=epuFVKuZPIyVyATq3wE&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=buffy%20superstar%20mary%20sue&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular subject of debate pertains to whether the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]] features a Mary Sue in its protagonist, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. Screenwriter [[Max Landis]] opines that the character fits this description,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=Max Landis|user=Uptomyknees|url=https://twitter.com/Uptomyknees/status/678046484873416704|title=they finally did it they made a fan fic movie with a Mary Sue as the main character|number=678046484873416704|website=Twitter|date=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Rey is excessively gifted at a variety of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Woburn|url=http://whatculture.com/film/8-problems-nobody-wants-to-admit-about-star-wars-the-force-awakens|title=Eight Problems Nobody Wants to Admit About Star Wars: The Force Awakens|website=[[What Culture]]|date=December 25, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Caroline Framke]] of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' contended that Rey did not fit the Mary Sue profile, stating that "Any additional skills Rey has—mechanical work, hand-to-hand combat, climbing, etc—are explained when we first meet her... If she hadn't picked up those skills, she'd probably be dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Caroline|last=Framke|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/12/28/10672628/star-wars-force-awakens-rey-mary-sue|title=What is a Mary Sue, and does Star Wars: The Force Awakens have one?|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=New York City|date=December 28, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as Tasha Robinson of ''[[The Verge]]'', have defended the idea of Rey being a Mary Sue, stating that "for women who've felt underrepresented through decades where most of the ladies onscreen were victims, tokens, rewards, or shrews, it's natural to feel a sugar rush of fulfillment over characters like [[Katniss Everdeen]] and [[Imperator Furiosa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tasha|last=Robinson|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/19/10626896/star-wars-the-force-awakens-rey-mary-sue-feminist|title=With Star Wars' Rey, we've reached Peak Strong Female Character -- And There's Nothing Wrong With That|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=New York City|date=December 19, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Kain in ''[[Forbes]]'' defines Mary Sue and argues that Rey's abilities do not make her one, given the details of her allegedly established backstory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Erik|last=Kain|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/01/04/no-rey-from-star-wars-the-force-awakens-is-not-a-mary-sue/?linkId=20069979|title=No, Rey from 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is Not a Mary Sue'|magazine=[[Forbes|Forbes Games]]|publisher=[[Forbes Media]]|location=New York City|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4389">{{nihongo|'''Midori Suzuki'''|鈴木 みどり|Suzuki Midori|extra=April 28, 1941 – July 23, 2006}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] media educator, [[feminism|feminist]] and media researcher. She was professor of Media Studies at the Faculty of Social Sciences of [[Ritsumeikan University]] in [[Kyoto]] from 1994 until her death.

Suzuki was known for her work on [[media literacy]], especially several seminal textbooks and the over one hundred workshops, symposia and media watch projects that she facilitated. She also introduced overseas research to Japan, for example through translations of work by [[Jerry Mander]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20050910000111/http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=4441&amp;4441_0=4987 David Buckingham]) and the Ontario Teacher's Association. 

In addition,  Suzuki maintained an exceptionally high level of international networking. She was an active member of the [http://www.waccglobal.org/ World Association of Christian Communication (WACC)], a co-founder and core member of the Asian Network of Women in Communication (ANWIC), a long-term member of the [http://iamcr.org/ International Association of Media and Communications Research (IAMCR)], and on the International Exchange Committee of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061108123542/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/mscom/ Japan Society for Studies in Journalism and Mass Communication （日本マス・コミュニケーション学会)]. She also participated in [[UNESCO]]-sponsored research and projects, and was involved in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061108123542/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/mscom/ Global Media Monitoring Project] (1994, 2000 and 2005), for which she served as a steering committee member and a Japanese liaison.

Although Suzuki had received her master's degree in [[mass communication]]s from  [[Stanford University]] in 1966, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071001110149/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ss/sansharonshu/424pdf/01-03.pdf] she soon became critical of the mass communications research approach, especially its inherent view of people as 'passive receivers' or consumers of information. She instead began to develop a citizen-centered approach. Through her work with the [http://mlpj.org Forum for Citizen's Television and Media (FCT)], which she co-founded in 1977, she focused on informed criticism of commercial television programming, especially for children, as well as of gender [[stereotype]]s and other misconceptions and biases found in the mainstream Japanese media. Suzuki noted that "critical is creative" and saw [[media literacy]] as part of a bigger vision for media democratization. An early advocate for communication rights in Japan, she championed an active role for citizens in media society, including in policy making.

The '''music industry''' consists of the companies and individuals that earn money by [[musical composition|creating]] new [[song]]s and pieces and selling live concerts and shows, audio and video recordings, compositions and [[sheet music]], and the organizations and associations that aid and represent [[music]] creators. Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s who create new songs and musical pieces; the [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[conducting|conductors]] and [[bandleader]]s who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell [[sound recording|recorded music]] and/or [[sheet music]] (e.g., [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]], [[Record producer|music producers]], [[recording studios]], [[Audio engineering|engineers]], [[record label]]s, retail and [[online music store]]s, [[performance rights organization]]s); and those that help organize and present [[live music]] performances ([[sound engineer]]s, [[talent agent|booking agents]], [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]], [[music venue]]s, [[road crew]]).

The industry also includes a range of professionals who assist singers and musicians with their music careers ([[talent manager]]s, [[artists and repertoire]] managers, [[business manager]]s, [[entertainment law]]yers); those who broadcast audio or video music content ([[satellite radio|satellite]], [[internet radio|Internet radio stations]], [[radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] and [[television broadcasting|TV stations]]); [[music journalist]]s and [[music critic]]s; [[DJ]]s; [[music education|music educators and teachers]]; [[musical instrument]] manufacturers; as well as many others. In addition to the businesses and artists who work in the music industry to make a profit or income, there is a range of organizations that also play an important role in the music industry, including musician's unions (e.g., [[American Federation of Musicians]]), not-for-profit performance-rights organizations (e.g., [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]) and other associations (e.g., [[International Alliance for Women in Music]], a non-profit organization that advocates for [[Women in music|women composers and musicians]]).

The modern Western music industry emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, when [[Gramophone record|records]] replaced [[sheet music]] as the most important product in the music business. In the commercial world, "the recording industry"—a reference to [[sound recording|recording performances of songs and pieces]] and selling the recordings–began to be used as a loose synonym for "the music industry". In the 2000s, a majority of the music market is controlled by three major corporate labels: the French-owned [[Universal Music Group]], the Japanese-owned [[Sony Music Entertainment]],&lt;ref name="sonybmg"&gt;Sony Corporation announced October 1, 2008 that it had completed the acquisition of Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG, which was originally announced on August 5, 2008.

Labels outside of these three major labels are referred to as [[independent label]]s (or "indies"). The largest portion of the live music market for concerts and tours is controlled by [[Live Nation]], the largest promoter and [[music venue]] owner. [[Live Nation]] is a former subsidiary of [[iHeartMedia|iHeartMedia Inc]], which is the largest owner of radio stations in the [[United States]].

In the first decades of the 2000s, the music industry underwent drastic changes with the advent of widespread digital distribution of music via the [[Internet]] (which includes both illegal [[file sharing]] of songs and legal music purchases in [[online music store]]s). A conspicuous indicator of these changes is total music sales: since 2000, sales of recorded music have dropped off substantially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Music Industry | url=http://www.economist.com/background/displayBackground.cfm?story_id=10498664 | date=October 15, 2008 | work= The Economist

==History==

===Early history===

'''Printed music in Europe:'''
[[Image:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|260px|Prior to the invention of the [[printing press]], the only way to copy [[sheet music]] was by hand, a costly and time-consuming process. Pictured is the hand-written music manuscript for a French [[Ars subtilior]] chanson (song) from the late 1300s about love, entitled ''Belle, bonne, sage'', by Baude Cordier. The [[music notation]] is unusual in that it is written in a heart shape, with red notes indicating rhythmic [[#Notational characteristics|alterations]].]]
Music publishing using machine-printed [[sheet music]] developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era in the mid-15th century. The development of music publication followed the evolution of [[printing]] technologies that were first developed for printing regular [[book]]s. After the mid-15th century,  mechanical techniques for printing sheet music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg Bible]] was printed. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. To copy music notation by hand was a very costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular (non-religious) music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy aristocrats. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.

The use of printing enabled sheet music to reproduced much more quickly and at a much lower cost than hand-copying music notation. This helped musical styles to spread to other cities and countries more quickly, and it also enabled music to be spread to more distant areas. Prior to the invention of music printing, a composer's music might only be known in the city she lived in and its surrounding towns, because only wealthy aristocrats would be able to afford to have hand copies made of her music. With music printing, though, a composer's music could be printed and sold at a relatively low cost to purchasers from a wide geographic area. As sheet music of major composer's pieces and songs began to be printed and distributed in a wider area, this enabled composers and listeners to hear new styles and forms of music. A German composer could buy songs written by an Italian or English composer, and an Italian composer could buy pieces written by Dutch composers and learn how they wrote music. This led to more blending of musical styles from different countries and regions.

The pioneer of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]]  (born in Fossombrone in 1466 – died in 1539 in Venice ), a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. [[Venice]] was one of the major business and music centers during this period. His ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han's ''Missale Romanum'' of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci's later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font. He printed the first book of [[polyphony]] (music with two or more independent melodic lines) using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Antoine Brumel]]. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the [[Renaissance music]] era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.

Until the 18th century, the processes of formal composition and of the printing of music took place for the most part with the support of [[patronage]] from [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] and [[Religion|churches]]. In the mid-to-late 18th century, performers and composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] began to seek more commercial opportunities to market their music and performances to the general public. After Mozart's death, his wife ([[Constanze Weber]]) continued the process of commercialization of his music through an unprecedented series of memorial concerts, selling his manuscripts, and collaborating with her second husband, [[Georg Nissen]], on a biography of Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jane Glover |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/02/classicalmusicandopera |title=Dear Constanze &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.png|thumb|right|200px|An example of mechanically printed sheet music.]]

In the 19th century, [[sheet music|sheet-music]] publishers dominated the music industry. Prior to the invention of [[sound recording]] technologies, the main way for music lovers to hear new symphonies and [[opera]] arias (songs) was to buy the sheet music (often arranged for piano or for a small chamber music group) and perform the music in a living room, using friends who were amateur musicians and singers. In the United States, the music industry arose in tandem with the rise of "[[black face]]" [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a [[black people|black person]]. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of negative [[racial stereotype]]s of African-American people.&lt;ref&gt;For the "darky"/"coon" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, ''The American Diary of a Japanese Girl'', Temple University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59213-555-2}}. See also Lewis A. Erenberg (1984), ''Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890–1930'', University of Chicago Press, p. 73, {{ISBN|0-226-21515-6}}. For more on the "darky" stereotype, see J. Ronald Green (2000), ''Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux'', Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, {{ISBN|0-253-33753-4}}; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific "coon" archetype.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late part of the century the group of music publishers and songwriters which dominated popular music in the United States became known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], and a plaque (see [[#plaque|below]]) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of [[Manhattan]]. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut. Some date it to the start of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s when the [[phonograph]] and radio supplanted [[sheet music]] as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of [[rock &amp; roll]].

===Advent of recorded music and radio broadcasting===
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief on a cylinder phonograph in 1916.]]
[[File:Donald Manson working as an employee of the Marconi Company.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A radio broadcasting system from 1906.]]
At the dawn of the early 20th century, the development of [[sound recording]] began to function as a [[disruptive technology]] to the commercial interests which published sheet music. During the sheet music era, if a regular person wanted to hear popular new songs, he or she would buy the sheet music and play it at home on a piano, or learn the song at home while playing the [[accompaniment]] part on piano or guitar. Commercially released [[phonograph]] records of musical performances, which became available starting in the late 1880s, and later the onset of widespread [[radio broadcasting]], starting in the 1920s, forever changed the way music was heard and listened to. Opera houses, concert halls, and clubs continued to produce music and musicians and singers continued to perform live, but the power of radio allowed bands, ensembles and singers who had previously performed only in one region to become popular on a nationwide and sometimes even a worldwide scale. Moreover, whereas attendance at the top symphony and opera concerts was formerly restricted to high-income people in a pre-radio world, with [[broadcast radio]], a much larger wider range of people, including lower and middle-income people could hear the best [[orchestra]]s, [[big band]]s, popular singers and opera shows.

The "record industry" eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force. A multitude of record labels came and went. Some noteworthy labels of the earlier decades include the [[Columbia Records]], Crystalate, [[Decca Records]], Edison Bell, [[The Gramophone Company]], Invicta, Kalliope, [[Pathé]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/vintage78rpm/great78/Early_Record_Labels.htm |title=Early Record Label History |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many record companies died out as quickly as they had formed, and by the end of the 1980s, the "Big six" — [[EMI]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[PolyGram]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[MCA Records|MCA]] — dominated the industry. [[Sony]] bought CBS Records in 1987 and changed its name to Sony Music in 1991. In mid-1998, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Music Group]] merged with MCA Music Entertainment creating what we now know as [[Universal Music Group]]. Since then, Sony and BMG merged in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3908405.stm "Sony and BMG merger backed by EU"], BBC News, July 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Universal took over the majority of EMI's recorded music interests in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved "Universal's £1.2bn EMI takeover approved – with conditions"], ''The Guardian'' (London),&lt;/ref&gt; [[EMI Music Publishing]], also once part of the now defunct British conglomerate, is now co-owned by Sony as a subsidiary of [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 "Sold! EMI Music Publishing to Consortium Led by Sony/ATV, Michael Jackson Estate for $2.2 Billion"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', June 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre-wise, music entrepreneurs expanded their industry models into areas like [[folk music]], in which composition and performance had continued for centuries on an [[ad hoc]] self-supporting basis. Forming an [[independent record label]], or "indie" label, or signing to such a label continues to be a popular choice for up-and-coming musicians, especially in genres like [[hardcore punk]] and [[extreme metal]], despite the fact that indies cannot offer the same financial backing of major labels. Some bands prefer to sign with an indie label, because these labels typically give performers more artistic freedom.

===Rise of digital and online distribution===
{{Main article|2000s in the music industry|2010s in the music industry}}
[[File:Download on iTunes.svg|thumb|right|200px|The logo for [[Apple Inc.]]'s online [[iTunes store]], which sells digital files of songs and musical pieces–along with a range of other content, such as digital files of [[TV show]]s and [[movie]]s.]]

In the first decade of the 2000s, digitally downloaded and [[streaming media| streamed music]] became more popular than buying physical recordings (e.g. [[CD]]s, [[Gramophone record| records]] and [[Compact Cassette |tapes]]). This gave consumers almost "friction-less" access to a wider variety of music than ever before, across multiple devices. At the same time, consumers spent less money on recorded music (both physically and digitally distributed) than they had in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-freeloaders/8027/ | last= McCardle | first= Megan |date= May 2010 | title= The Freeloaders | magazine = The Atlantic | quote= industry revenues have been declining for the past 10 years | accessdate= December 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total "music-business" revenues in the U.S. dropped by half, from a high of $14.6&amp;nbsp;billion in 1999 to $6.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009, according to [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!--ILLEGAL FILESHARING ---&gt;
In response to the rise of widespread illegal [[file sharing]] of digital music-recordings, the record industry took aggressive legal action. In 2001 it succeeded in shutting down the popular music-website [[Napster]], and threatened legal action against thousands of individuals who participated in sharing music-song sound-files.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt; However, this failed to slow the decline in music-recording revenue and proved a [[public-relations]] disaster for the music industry.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt;  Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads did not cause the decline in sales of recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= C Net | last= Borland | first= John | date= March 29, 2004 | title= Music sharing doesn't kill CD sales, study says | url= http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027_3-5181562.html | accessdate= July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 British Music Rights survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Orlowski]]. ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/ 80% want legal P2P - survey]''. [[The Register]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file-sharing service, however only half of the respondents thought that the music's creators should be paid.  The survey was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the [[Open Music Model]] was based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]. ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438 Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models]''. [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION--&gt;
Legal digital downloads became widely available with the debut of the Apple [[iTunes Store]] in 2003. The popularity of music distribution over the [[Internet]] has increased,{{cn|date=December 2018}} and by 2011 digital music sales topped physical sales of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/05/technology/digital_music_sales/index.htm | work= CNN | title= Digital music sales top physical sales | date= January 5, 2012 | accessdate= April 24, 2012 | first= Laurie | last= Segall|authorlink= Laurie Segall | quote = According to a Nielsen and Billboard report, digital music purchases accounted for 50.3% of music sales in 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atlantic Records reports that digital sales have surpassed physical sales.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"/&gt;
However, as ''The Economist'' reported, "paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs".&lt;ref name=Economist2008/&gt;

&lt;!--SUBSRCIPTION-BASED SERVICES--&gt;
After 2010, Internet-based services such as [[Deezer]], [[Pandora Radio| Pandora]], [[Spotify]], and [[iTunes Radio| Apple's iTunes Radio]] began to offer subscription-based "[[streaming media |pay to stream]]" services over the Internet. With streaming services, the user pays a subscription to a company for the right to listen to songs and other media from a library. Whereas with legal digital download services, the purchaser owns a digital copy of the song (which they can keep on their computer or on a digital media player), with streaming services, the user never downloads the song file or owns the song file. The subscriber can only listen to the song for as long as they continue to pay the streaming subscription. Once the user stops paying the subscription, they cannot listen to audio from the company's repositories anymore. Streaming services began to have a serious impact on the industry in 2014.&lt;!-- WILL ADD MORE SHORTLY WHEN I GET SOME REFERENCES --&gt;

[[Spotify]], together with the [[music streaming | music-streaming]] industry in general, faces some criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for their work as downloaded-music sales decline and music-streaming increases. Unlike physical or download sales, which pay a fixed price per song or album, Spotify pays artists based on their "market share" (the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Marshall|first= Lee|date= 2015-07-03|title= 'Let's keep music special.

Spotify reports paying on average US$0.006 to US$0.008 per stream. In response to concerns, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business by migrating "them away from piracy and less monetised platforms and allowing them to generate far greater royalties than before" by encouraging users to use their paid service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.yahoo.com/music/bp/exclusive--taylor-swift-on-being-pop-s-instantly-platinum-wonder----and-why-she-s-paddling-against-the-streams-085041907.html|title= Exclusive: Taylor Swift on Being Pop's Instantly Platinum Wonder...

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) revealed in its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 34.3 percent of the year's U.S. recorded-music-industry revenue, growing 29 percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source of income, pulling in around $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite web|title= News and Notes on 2015 RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics|url= https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RIAA-2015-Year-End-shipments-memo.pdf|publisher= RIAA|accessdate= December 1, 2018 | quote = Combining all categories of streaming music (subscription, ad-supported on-demand, and SoundExchange distributions), revenues grew 29% to $2.4 billion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Streaming made more revenue for music industry in 2015 than digital downloads, physical sales|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/23/streaming-made-more-revenue-for-music-industry-in-/|publisher= The Washington Times |accessdate= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; US streaming revenue grew 57 percent to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Shaw|first1= Lucas|title= The Music Industry Is Finally Making Money on Streaming|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/spotify-apple-drive-u-s-music-industry-s-8-first-half-growth|publisher= Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate= January 5, 2017|date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with  the $14.6 billion in revenue that was received in 1999 by the U.S. music industry from the sale of CDs.

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS ---&gt;
The turmoil in the recorded-music industry in the 2000s altered the historically anomalous twentieth-century balance between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music-stores and consumers. {{As of | 2010}}, [[big-box store]]s such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]] sell more records than music-only CD stores, which have ceased to function as a major player in the music industry. Music-performing artists now rely on [[concert|live performance]] and [[merchandise]] sales (T-shirts, sweatshirts, etc.) for the majority of their income, which in turn has made them more dependent - like pre-20th-century musicians - on patrons, now exemplified by music promoters such as [[Live Nation (events promoter) | Live Nation]] (which dominates tour promotion and owns or manages a large number of [[music venue]]s).&lt;ref name = "Live Nation"/&gt; In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies increasingly rely on the "[[360 deal]]", a new business-relationship pioneered by [[Robbie Williams]] and EMI in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.cnet.com/Recording-industry-should-brace-for-more-bad-news/2010-1027_3-6226487.html|title= Perspective: Recording industry should brace for more bad news|last= Rosso|first= Wayne|publisher= [[CNET]]|date= January 16, 2009|accessdate= January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the other extreme, record companies can offer a simple manufacturing- and [[distribution deal | distribution-deal]], which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expenses of marketing and promotion.

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS p2 ---&gt;
Companies like [[Kickstarter]] help independent musicians produce their albums through [[crowdfunding|fans funding bands]] they want to listen to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thestreet.com/story/12096110/1/startups-not-apple-lead-music-industrys-rebirth.html |title= Startups, Not Apple, Lead Music Industry's Rebirth |website= Thestreet.com |date= |accessdate= November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newer artists no longer see a [[record deal]] as an integral part of their [[business plan]] at all. Inexpensive recording-hardware and -software make it possible to record reasonable-quality music on a laptop in a bedroom and to distribute it over the Internet to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-10-13-apogee-gio-music_N.htm  | title = Musicians ditch studios for tech such as GiO for Macs  | author= Jefferson Graham  | date = October 14, 2009  | newspaper= [[U.S.A.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Changes in the music industry have given consumers access to a wider variety of music than ever before, at a price that gradually approaches zero.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt; However, consumer spending on music-related software and hardware increased dramatically over the last decade, providing a valuable new income-stream for [[technology company | technology companies]] such as [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Pandora Radio]].

==Business structure==
The music industry is a complex system of many different organizations, firms and individuals. It has undergone dramatic changes in the first decades of the 21st century. However, the majority of the participants in the music industry still fulfill their traditional roles, which are described below.&lt;ref&gt;All of the information in this section can be found in:* {{Krasilovsky et al 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of [[property]] that are created and sold by the recording industry: [[musical composition|compositions]] (songs, pieces, lyrics), [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] (audio and video) and media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]] or [[MP3]]s, and [[DVD]]s). There may be many recordings of a single composition and a single recording will typically be distributed via many media. For example, the song "[[My Way]]" is owned by its composers, [[Paul Anka]] and [[Claude François]], [[Frank Sinatra]]'s recording of "My Way" is owned by [[Capitol Records]], [[Sid Vicious]]'s recording of "My Way" is owned by [[Virgin Records]], and the millions of CDs and vinyl records that can play these recordings are owned by millions of individual consumers.

===Compositions===

[[Song]]s, instrumental pieces and other musical compositions are created by [[songwriter]]s or [[composer]]s and are originally owned by the composer, although they may be sold or the rights may be otherwise assigned. For example, in the case of [[work for hire]], the composition is owned immediately by another party. Traditionally, the copyright owner [[licensed|licenses]] or "assigns" some of their rights to [[publishing companies]], by means of a [[publishing contract]]. The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as "[[Music royalties|publishing royalties]]") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. [[Sheet music]] provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the composers and their publishing company. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an [[advance payment|advance]] against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song "placements" on [[television]] or in [[film]]s.

===Recordings===
[[File:Sound Gobo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A musician in a recording studio.]]
Recordings are created by [[recording artist]]s, which includes [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s (including [[session musician]]s) and [[musical ensemble]]s (e.g., [[backing band]]s, [[rhythm section]]s, [[orchestra]]s, etc.) usually with the assistance and guidance from [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s. They were traditionally made in [[recording studio]]s (which are rented for a daily or hourly rate) in a [[recording session]]. In the 21st century, advances in digital recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create "[[home studio]]s" using high-end computers and digital recording programs like [[Protools]], bypassing the traditional role of the commercial recording studio. The [[record producer]] oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artists. The record producer has a range of different responsibilities including choosing material and/or working with the composers, hiring session musicians, helping to [[musical arrangement|arrange]] the songs, overseeing the musician performances, and directing the audio engineer during recording and mixing to get the best sound. [[Audio engineer]]s (including [[recording engineer|recording]], [[mixing engineer|mixing]] and [[mastering engineer]]s) are responsible for ensuring good audio quality during the recording. They select and set up microphones and use [[effects unit]]s and [[mixing console]]s to adjust the sound and level of the music.  A recording session may also require the services of an [[arranger]], [[orchestrator]], [[studio musician]]s, [[session musician]]s, [[vocal coach]]es, or even a discreetly-hired [[ghostwriter|ghostwriter to help with the lyrics or songwriting]].
[[File:Ben Feggans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A studio engineer working with an [[audio mixer]] in a recording studio.]]

Recordings are (traditionally) owned by [[record companies]]. Some artists own their own record companies (e.g., [[Ani DiFranco]]). A [[recording contract]] specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The [[A&amp;R]] department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of [[radio promotion|promoting]] and [[marketing]] the record. For physical media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]]), the company also pays to [[manufacture]] and [[distribution (business)|distribute]] the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as "[[independent record label|indies]]") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. The record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, also known as a "royalty", but this is distinct from the publishing royalties described above. This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. [[Session musician]]s and [[orchestra]] members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide [[work for hire]]; they are typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than ongoing royalties.

===Media===

Physical media (such as CDs or vinyl records) are sold by music [[retail]]ers and are owned by the consumers after they buy them. Buyers do not typically have the right to make digital copies from CDs or other media they buy, or rent or lease the CDs, because they do not own the recording on the CD, they only own the individual physical CD. A music distributor delivers crates of the packaged physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains commercial relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the [[record company]] for the recordings. The record company pays [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] to the publisher and composer via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads or online [[streaming media|streaming]] of music, there is no physical media other than the consumer's computer memory on his or her portable media player or laptop. For this reason, artists such as Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and others have called for legal changes that would deny social media the right to stream their music without paying them royalties.&lt;ref name="Knopper2009" /&gt; In the digital and online music market of the 2000s, the distributor becomes optional. Large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to provide distribution services for vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads or listening to music streaming, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in [[copyright]]; for example, some services may allow consumers to freely share the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives or devices.

===Broadcast, soundtrack and streaming===

When a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a [[background music]] service such as [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]), [[performance rights organisation]]s (such as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a performance royalty, which is paid to songwriters, composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]]. Within the past decade, more than "15 to 30 percent" of tracks on streaming services are unidentified with a specific artist. Jeff Price says "Audiam, an online music streaming service, has made over several hundred thousand dollars in the past year from collecting royalties from online streaming.&lt;ref name="billboard.com" /&gt; According to Ken Levitan, manager from Kings of Leon, Cheap Trick and others, "Youtube has become radio for kids". Because of the overuse of YouTube and offline streaming, album sales have fallen by 60 percent in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Knopper2009" /&gt; When recordings are used in [[television]] and [[film]], the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a [[synchronization rights|synchronization license]]. In the 2000s, online subscription services (such as [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.

===Live music===

[[File:Pro2Type - CSD Straßenfest Köln 2013-1759.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A live musical performance at [[Cologne Pride]], 2013.]]
A [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] brings together a performing artist and a [[Music venue|venue]] owner and arranges contracts. A [[booking agency]] represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as [[Ticketmaster]]. In the US, [[Live Nation]] is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own [[Ticketmaster]]. Choices about where and when to tour are decided by the [[artist manager|artist's management]] and the artist, sometimes in consultation with the [[record company]]. Record companies may finance a tour in the hopes that it will help promote the sale of recordings. However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote ticket sales for live shows, rather than book tours to promote the sales of recordings.

Major, successful artists will usually employ a [[road crew]]: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels with the artist during concert series. The road crew is headed by a [[tour manager]]. Crew members provides [[stage lighting]], [[Audio engineering|live sound reinforcement]], [[guitar technician|musical instrument tuning and maintenance]], [[bodyguard]] for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and [[catering]] staff. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves. Bands signed with small "indie" labels and bands in genres such as [[hardcore punk]] are more likely to do tours without a road crew, or with minimal support.

===Artist management, representation and staff===

Artists such as singers and musicians may hire a number of people from other fields to assist them with their career. The [[artist manager]] oversees all aspects of an artist's career in exchange for a percentage of the artist's income. An [[entertainment law]]yer assists them with the details of their contracts with record companies and other deals. A [[business manager]] handles financial transactions, taxes and bookkeeping. Unions, such as [[AFTRA]] and the [[American Federation of Musicians]] in the U.S. provide [[health insurance]] and instrument insurance for musicians. A successful artist functions in the market as a [[brand]] and, as such, they may derive income from many other streams, such as [[merchandise]], personal endorsements, appearances (without performing) at events or Internet-based services&lt;ref&gt;http://info.dcc-studios.com/blog/why-branding-is-important-for-djs-and-producers/&lt;/ref&gt;. These are typically overseen by the artist's [[artist manager|manager]] and take the form of relationships between the artist and companies that specialize in these products. Singers may also hire a [[vocal coach]], [[Dance teacher|dance instructor]], [[Drama teacher|acting coach]], [[personal trainer]] or [[life coach]] to help them.

===Emerging business models===

In the 2000s, traditional lines that once divided singers, instrumentalists, publishers, record companies, distributors, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred or erased. Artists may record in a [[home studio]] using a high-end [[laptop]] and a digital recording program such as [[Protools]] or use [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for an expensive studio recording session without involving a record company. Artists may choose to exclusively promote and market themselves using only free online video sharing services such as [[YouTube]] or using [[social media]] websites, bypassing traditional promotion and marketing by a record company. In the 2000s, [[consumer electronics]] and [[computer]] companies such as [[Apple Computer]] have become [[Online music store|digital music retailers]]. New digital music distribution technologies and the trends towards using [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of older songs in new songs or blending different songs to create [[mashup (music)|"mashup"]] recordings have also forced both governments and the music industry to re-examine the definitions of [[intellectual property]] and the rights of all the parties involved. Also compounding the issue of defining copyright boundaries is the fact that the definition of "royalty" and "copyright" varies from country to country and region to region, which changes the terms of some of these business relationships.

Prior to December 1998, the industry was dominated by the "Big Six": Sony Music and BMG had not yet merged, and [[PolyGram]] had not yet been absorbed into Universal Music Group. After the PolyGram-Universal merger, the 1998 market shares reflected a "Big Five", commanding 77.4% of the market, as follows, according to MEI World Report 2000:
* Independent labels — 22.6%
* Universal Music Group — 21.1%
* Sony Music Entertainment — 17.4%
* EMI — 14.1%
* Warner Music Group — 13.4%
* BMG — 11.4%

In 2004, the joint venture of Sony and BMG created the 'Big Four' at a time the global market was estimated at $30–40&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [https://www.riaa.com/news/marketingdata/default.asp RIAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521233108/http://www.riaa.com/News/marketingdata/default.asp |date=May 21, 2007 }} the world music market is estimated at $40&amp;nbsp;billion, but according to [http://www.ifpi.org/&lt;!--site-content/statistics/worldsales.html--&gt; IFPI] (2004) it is estimated at $32&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;/ref&gt; Total annual unit sales (CDs, music videos, [[MP3]]s) in 2004 were 3&amp;nbsp;billion. Additionally, according to an [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] report published in August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20050802.html |title=IFPI releases definitive statistics on global market for recorded music |publisher=Ifpi.org |date=August 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the big four accounted for 71.7% of retail music sales:&lt;!--this adds up to 100.1%--&gt;

[[Nielson SoundScan|Nielsen SoundScan]] in their 2011 report noted that the "big four" controlled about 88% of the market:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120105005547/en/Nielsen-Company-Billboard%E2%80%99s-2011-Music-Industry-Report "The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2011 Music Industry Report,"] Business Wire (January 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Warner Music Group]] (USA based) —  19.13% 
* [[:Category:Independent record labels|Independent labels]] — 12.11% 
* EMI Group — 9.62%

After the absorption of EMI by Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group in December 2011 the "big three" were created and on January 8, 2013 after the merger there were layoffs of forty workers from EMI. European regulators forced Universal Music to spin off EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group which was acquired by Warner Music Group.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pakinkis, [http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/emi-lay-offs-reported-in-the-us/053075 "EMI lay-offs reported in the US,"] Music Week (January 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nielson SoundScan|Nielsen SoundScan]] issued a report in 2012, noting that these labels controlled 88.5% of the market, and further noted:&lt;ref name="NielsenReport2012"&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130104005149/en/Nielsen-Company-Billboard%E2%80%99s-2012-Music-Industry-Report "The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2012 Music Industry Report,"] Business Wire (January 4, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (USA based) which owns publishing arm of [[EMI|EMI Group]] —   30.25% 
* Warner Music Group— 19.15%
* Independent labels— 11.42%

Note: the IFPI and Nielsen Soundscan use different methodologies, which makes their figures difficult to compare casually, and impossible to compare scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clicknoise.net/digital-music-futures-and-the-independent-music-industry/ "Digital Music Futures and the Independent Music Industry",] ''Clicknoise.net'', February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;


Current Markets shares as of September 2018 are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld report 51221&lt;/ref&gt;
* Warner Music Group — 25.1%
* Universal Music Group — 24.3%
* Sony Corporation — 22.1%
* Other — 28.5%

The largest players in this industry own more than 100 subsidiary record labels or sublabels, each specializing in a certain market niche. Only the industry's most popular artists are signed directly to the major label. These companies account for more than half of US market share. However, this has fallen somewhat in recent years, as the new digital environment allows smaller labels to compete more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld report 51221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albums sales and market value===
Total album sales have declined in the early decades of the 21st century, leading some music critics to declare the [[death of the album]]. (For instance, the only albums that went platinum in the US in 2014 were the [[Frozen (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the Disney animated film ''Frozen'']] and [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|Taylor Swift's ''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.)&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows album sales and market value in the world in 2014.

====2003–2007====
Approximately 21% of the [[gross revenue|gross CD revenue]] numbers in 2003 can be attributed to used CD sales.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This number grew to approximately 27% in 2007.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The growth is attributed to increasing on-line sales of used product by outlets such as Amazon.com, the growth of used music media is expected to continue to grow as the cost of digital downloads continues to rise.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The sale of used goods financially benefits the vendors and online marketplaces, but in the United States, the [[first-sale doctrine]] prevents copyright owners (record labels and publishers, generally) from "double dipping" through a levy on the sale of used music.

====2011====
In mid-2011, the RIAA trumpeted a sales increase of 5% over 2010, stating that "there's probably no one single reason" for the bump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/blog.php?content_selector=riaa-news-blog&amp;blog_selector=Midyear-Digital-Music-Milestones&amp;news_month_filter=7&amp;news_year_filter=2011&amp;searchterms=Music%20sales&amp;terminclude=&amp;termexact=|date=July 11, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2012|title=Midyear Digital Music Milestones|quote=There's probably no one single reason, but we'd like to think that enhanced marketing efforts – like the sale of music at nontraditional outlets – and anti-piracy successes like the closure of LimeWire have helped.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021050119/http://www.riaa.com/blog.php?content_selector=riaa-news-blog&amp;blog_selector=Midyear-Digital-Music-Milestones&amp;news_month_filter=7&amp;news_year_filter=2011&amp;searchterms=Music%20sales&amp;terminclude=&amp;termexact=|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2012 Industry Report shows overall music sales increased 3.1% over 2011. Digital sales caused this increase, with a Digital Album sales growth of 14.1% and Digital Track sales growth of 5.1%, whereas Physical Music sales decreased by 12.8% versus 2011. Despite the decrease, physical albums were still the dominant album format. Vinyl Record sales increased by 17.7% and Holiday Season Album sales decreased by 7.1%.&lt;ref name="NielsenReport2012" /&gt;

==Transparency==
In the 15 or so years of the Internet economy, the digital music industry has come a long way, but there are still major hurdles to cross. Platforms like [[iTunes]], [[Spotify]], and [[Google Play Music|Google Play]] are major improvements over the early illegal file sharing days, but the multitude of service offerings and revenue models make it difficult to understand the true value of each and what they can deliver for musicians and music companies. These difficulties are further compounded by the fact that, according to a new study from the [[Berklee College of Music]] and its Rethink Music initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6627418/what-a-mess-new-report-from-berklee-college-of-music-looks-to-fix-an-aging |title=What a Mess: New Report From Berklee College of Music Looks to Fix an Aging, Fractured Business |publisher=Billboard |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are major transparency problems throughout the music industry caused by outdated technology. With the emerging of new business models as streaming platforms, and online music services, a large amount of data is processed. Access to [[big data]] may increase transparency in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/08/transparency-in-the-music-industry.html |title=Creating Transparency In The Music Industry |website=Hypebot.com |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics''' (NACCL) is an annual [[academic conference]] that focuses on research in [[Chinese language]] and [[linguistics]].  

The conference was first held in 1989 at [[Ohio State University]], as the Northeast Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NECCL), and changed its name to "North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics" at its third annual session in 1991.&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;{{cite web | title=History of NACCL: The First Two Decades | url=http://chinalinks.osu.edu/naccl-20/proceedings/NACCL_history.pdf | last=Chan | first=Marjorie K.M. | publisher=[[Ohio State University]] | work=Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20) | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/ealc//chinling/naccl2.htm | title=Chinese Linguistics: NACCL | publisher=[[University of Southern California]] | accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is held every year in late spring, and includes both theoretical and empirical research from all subfields of Chinese linguistics;&lt;ref name="chan"/&gt; presenters include graduate students in addition to professors and other well-established scholars.  The conference generally hosts talks both in Chinese and in English.  The proceedings are published annually after the conference is finished; after NACCL-20 in 2008, the proceedings were published online for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chinalinks.osu.edu/naccl-20/proceedings/preface.pdf | title=Preface | work=Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20) | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-10-21 | last=Chan | first=Marjorie K.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjects presented include: Sociolinguistics, Phonetics/Phonology, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, Orthography, Historical linguistics, Computational/Corpus Linguistics, Language Acquisition, Psycholinguistics, and Morphology.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''omnipotence paradox''' is a family of [[paradox]]es that arise with some understandings of the term 'omnipotent'. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  [[Thomas Aquinas]] to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|Alvin Plantinga]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]], contend that a no-limits understanding of omnipotence is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology.  Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether or not omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.

The omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 12th century. It was addressed by [[Averroës]]&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;[[Averroës]], ''Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)'' trans. Simon Van Den Bergh, Luzac &amp; Company 1969, sections 529–536&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA/&gt; [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to "deny himself".

The most well-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the so-called ''paradox of the stone'': "Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?"&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"&gt;Savage, C. Wade. "The Paradox of the Stone" ''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 74–79 {{doi|10.2307/2182966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrasing of the omnipotence paradox is vulnerable to objections based on the physical nature of [[gravity]], such as how the [[weight]] of an object depends on what the local gravitational field is. Alternative statements of the paradox that do not involve such difficulties include "If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?" and "Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?".

==Overview==
A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: "Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being ''can'' create a stone that it cannot lift, then it seems that it can cease to be omnipotent. If the being ''cannot'' create a stone it cannot lift, then it seems it is already not omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"/&gt;

A related issue is whether the concept of 'logically possible' is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.

The dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the [[irresistible force paradox]]: ''What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?'' One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim{{who|date=May 2015}} that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But this is not a way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/the-omnipotence-paradox-has-puzzled-people-for-centuries-curiosity/|title=The Omnipotence Paradox Has Puzzled People For Centuries|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--If they are GUARANTEED not to meet then I don't see what the problem is.--&gt;

==Types of omnipotence==
{{Main|Omnipotence}}
[[Peter Geach]] describes and rejects four levels of omnipotence. He also defines and defends a lesser notion of the "almightiness" of God.

#"Y is '''absolutely omnipotent'''" means that "Y" can do anything that can be expressed in a string of words even if it is self-[[contradiction|contradictory]]: "Y" is not bound by the laws of logic."&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P. T. "Omnipotence" 1973 in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 63–75&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true [[if and only if]] X is a logically consistent description of a state of affairs. This position was once advocated by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas, Thomas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 3&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of omnipotence solves some of the paradoxes associated with omnipotence, but some modern formulations of the paradox still work against this definition. Let X = "to make something that its maker cannot lift." As [[George I. Mavrodes|Mavrodes]] points out there is nothing logically contradictory about this. A man could, for example, make a boat that he could not lift.&lt;ref name="Mavrodes"&gt;Mavrodes, George. "[http://spot.colorado.edu/~kaufmad/courses/Mavrodes.pdf Some Puzzles Concerning Omnipotence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" first published 1963 now in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 131–34&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true if and only if "Y does X" is logically consistent. Here the idea is to exclude actions that are inconsistent for Y to do but might be consistent for others. Again sometimes it looks as if Aquinas takes this position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 4 response #3&lt;/ref&gt; Here Mavrodes' worry about X= "to make something its maker cannot lift" is no longer a problem, because "God does X" is not logically consistent. However, this account may still have problems with moral issues like X = "tells a lie" or temporal issues like X = "brings it about that Rome was never founded."&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means whenever "Y will bring about X" is logically possible, then "Y can bring about X" is true. This sense, also does not allow the paradox of omnipotence to arise, and unlike definition #3 avoids any temporal worries about whether or not an omnipotent being could change the past. However, Geach criticizes even this sense of omnipotence as misunderstanding the nature of God's promises.&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''almighty'''" means that Y is not just more powerful than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name="Geach" /&gt; In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] seems to think that almightiness is one of the things that make God count as omnipotent.&lt;ref name = "amselm"&gt;[[Anselm of Canterbury]] Proslogion Chap VII in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his [[City of God (book)|City of God]] writes "[[God]] is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills" and thus proposes the definition that "Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X". 
 
The notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An '''essentially omnipotent''' being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an '''accidentally omnipotent''' being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, Joshua, Rosenkrantz, Gary. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/ "Omnipotence"] ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2002 Edition)''. Edward N. Zalta (ed.). (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"&gt;Descartes, Rene, 1641. ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Cottingham, J., trans., 1996. Cambridge University Press. Latin original. Alternative English title: ''Metaphysical Meditations''. Includes six ''Objections and Replies''. A second edition published the following year, includes an additional ‘’Objection and Reply’’ and a ''Letter to Dinet''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a [[false dilemma]], as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence.&lt;ref name=Haeckel1&gt;[[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel, Ernst]]. ''The Riddle of the Universe.'' Harper and Brothers, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern approaches to the problem have involved [[semantics|semantic]] debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig.]] [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] (6.41 and following)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed answers==

===Omnipotence doesn't mean breaking the laws of logic===

A common response from Christian philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] or [[William Lane Craig]], is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything ''at all'' but, rather, that he can do ''anything that's possible according to his nature.'' The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is "impossible for God to lie."

Another common response to the omnipotence paradox is to try to define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes.&lt;ref name = "Mavrodes" /&gt; Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a "task" is termed by him a "pseudo-task" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. [[Harry Frankfurt]]—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone&lt;blockquote&gt;For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposed capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?&lt;ref name="frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt, Harry. "The Logic of Omnipotence" first published in 1964 in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' and now in ''Necessity, Volition, and Love''. [[Cambridge University Press]] November 28, 1998 pp.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a being is ''accidentally omnipotent'', it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether or not the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;Gore, Charles, "A Kenotic Theory of Incarnation" first published 1891, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

If a being is ''essentially omnipotent'', then it can also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.

The omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself—thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position [[Augustine of Hippo]] took in his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.V.10.html|title=NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.

In a 1955 article in the philosophy journal ''Mind'', [[J. L. Mackie]] tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]], "Evil and Omnipotence." ''Mind'' LXIV, No, 254 (April 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.&lt;ref name = "TPoG"&gt;The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978. Keene and Mayo disagree p. 145, Savage provides 3 formalizations p. 138–41, Cowan has a different strategy p. 147, and Walton uses a whole separate strategy p. 153–63&lt;/ref&gt;

;God and logic

: &lt;p&gt;Although the most common translation of the noun "Logos" is "Word" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as "Logic": "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the [[law of non contradiction]] by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question, similar to the [[Euthyphro Dilemma]], of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians ([[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]]), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his [[omniscience]] or [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;/p&gt;

===Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry, meaning it makes grammatical sense, but has no intelligible meaning===

Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase "could not lift" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Problem of Pain, Clive Staples Lewis, 1944 MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loving Wisdom: Christian Philosophy of Religion by Paul Copan, Chalice Press, 2007 page 46&lt;/ref&gt; This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, ''which it is not''.  An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he couldn't lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that ''could'' lift the stone could not.

The lifting a rock paradox (''Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?'') uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:

#'''Lifting''' covers up the definition of '''translation''', which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, "''Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?''" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.
#The words, "Lift a Stone" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, "''Is God capable of being incapable?''" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.

The act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a ''lack'' of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely ''synthetic'': constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent [[omnipresence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] asserts that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. He maintains that inherent contradictions and logical impossibilities do not fall under the omnipotence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |title=Summa Theologica |publisher=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  J. L Cowan sees this paradox as a reason to reject the concept of 'absolute' omnipotence,&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, J. L. "The Paradox of Omnipotence" first published 1962, in ''The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil''. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 144–52&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent, despite the problem.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"/&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing "a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it" is nonsense just as much as referencing "a square circle"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking "Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" is just as much nonsense as asking "Can God draw a square circle?" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement "God can lift this rock" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that’s too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this doesn’t quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.

In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a ''limit'' on its actual agency, but an ''epistemological boundary'' without which omnipotence could not be ''identified'' (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic [[Liar Paradox]]: If I say, "I am a liar", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an ''epistemological'' paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless.  Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, "God can" before it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Lewis additionally said that, "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, ''as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.''

==Language and omnipotence==
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', he stays generally within the realm of [[logical positivism]] until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that [[ethics]] and several other issues are "transcendental" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, "When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 6.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in [[semantics]]—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort "That's only semantics," is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the ''Tractatus,'' then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the ''Tractatus'' gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: "What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as [[D. Z. Phillips]].&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;[[D. Z. Phillips]] "Philosophy, Theology and the Reality of God" in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings. William Rowe and William Wainwright eds. 3rd ed. 1998 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the ''Tractatus'',&lt;ref name="hacker"&gt;Hacker, P.M.S. Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy. 1996 Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.

==Other versions of the paradox==
In the 6th century, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in [[Acts 13]]:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether or not God can "deny himself" ala 2 Tim 2:13.&lt;ref name = "psd"&gt;[[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], "Divine Names" 893B in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works. trans Colm Luibheid Paulist Press. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.&lt;ref name="anselm"&gt;Anselm of Canterbury Proslogion Chap. VII, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in [[Summa contra Gentiles]]:

{{quotation|Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.&lt;ref&gt;"Cum principia quarundam scientiarum, ut logicae, geometriae et arithmeticae, sumantur ex solis principiis formalibus rerum, ex quibus essentia rei dependet, sequitur quod contraria horum principiorum Deus facere non possit: sicut quod genus non sit praedicabile de specie; vel quod lineae ductae a centro ad circumferentiam non sint aequales; aut quod triangulus rectilineus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis". Aquinas, T. ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Book 2, Section 25. trans. Edward Buckner&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, "If given the axioms of [[elliptic geometry|Riemannian geometry]], can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles ''do not'' add up to ''more'' than 180 degrees?" In either case, the real question is whether or not an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.

A version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or [[parliamentary sovereignty]], which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.&lt;ref&gt;Suber, P. (1990) [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec01.htm#C ''The Paradox of Self-Amendment: A Study of Law, Logic, Omnipotence, and Change'']. Peter Lang Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox — a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it — is grounded in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is ''constantly'' lifted—strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: "An omnipotent being creates a [[universe]] that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?"

[[Ethan Allen]]'s ''Reason'' addresses the topics of [[original sin]], [[theodicy]] and several others in classic [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] fashion.&lt;ref name = "allen"&gt;[[Ethan Allen|Allen, Ethan]]. [http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/allen-reason.html ''Reason: The Only Oracle of Man.''] J.P. Mendum, Cornill; 1854. Originally published 1784. (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that "omnipotence itself" could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, "the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature." Labeled by his friends a [[Deism|Deist]], Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout ''Reason'' he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.

In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]],'' [[Descartes]] tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18157">According to the [[United States Office of Government Ethics]], a '''political appointee''' is "any employee who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], or agency head".  As of 2016, there are around 4,000 political appointment positions which an incoming administration needs to review, and fill or confirm, of which about 1,200 require Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These positions are published in the ''[[United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions]]'' (Plum Book), a new edition of which is released after each [[United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plum Book: About|url=https://m.gpo.gov/plumbook/|publisher=Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
There are four basic categories of political appointments:

* '''Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation (PAS)''': These positions require a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] and a confirmation vote of the full Senate under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1251_ed9g.pdf NLRB v. SW General, Inc.]'', no. 15-1251 (March 21, 2017) (U.S. Supreme Court)&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2016, PAS positions included [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|1,212 senior positions]], including the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] secretaries and their subordinates at the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, and Assistant Secretary levels; the heads of most [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]; and [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassadors]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://presidentialtransition.org/blog/posts/160316_help-wanted-4000-appointees.php|title=Help Wanted: 4,000 Presidential Appointees|last=Piaker|first=Zach|date=2016-03-16|work=|newspaper=[[Partnership for Public Service]] Center for Presidential Transition|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[United States Attorney|United States Attorneys]] and [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshals]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/opinion/donald-trump-is-now-hiring.html|title=Donald Trump Is Now Hiring|last=The Editorial Board|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011]] reclassified about 170 PAS positions to PA, to no longer needing Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2012/11/09/hire-presidential-appointees.aspx|title=How to become a presidential appointee|last=Tuutti|first=Camille|date=2012-11-09|website=FCW|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ttps://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/08/obama-signs-bill-giving-him-more-power-over-appointments-132463 Obama signs bill giving him more power over appointments]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Presidential appointments without Senate confirmation (PA)''': These appointments do not require a Senate hearing or vote.  As at 2016, there were 353 PA positions, most of which were in the [[Executive Office of the President]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Non-career Senior Executive Service (NA)''': The [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]] (SES) forms the level just below the presidential appointees.  While the SES largely consists of career officials, up to 10%, or (as of 2016) 680 positions, can be political appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Schedule C appointments (SC)''': [[Schedule C appointment|Schedule C appointees]] serve in confidential or policy roles immediately subordinate to other appointees.  As of 2016, there are 1,403 Schedule C appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Unlike the presidential appointments, the non-career SES and Schedule C appointments tend to be made within each agency and then approved by the [[Office of Presidential Personnel]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ethics restrictions ==
Political appointees, referring broadly to anyone appointed by the President, the Vice President, or agency head, are subject to more ethics restrictions than regular executive-branch employees. There are two categories of appointees, and each category is subject to additional and slightly different ethics restrictions.&lt;ref name="oge" /&gt;
* The [[spoils system]]/patronage system is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity.
* The [[merit system]] is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system. A common conception of the federal government's merit system principles is that they are designed to ensure fair and open recruitment and competition and employment practices free of political influence or other non-merit factors. Although that is certainly true, a closer reading of those principles suggests a much broader policy objective that relates directly to managing the ongoing performance of the federal workforce.
Political appointees are required to take an ethics pledge not to accept gifts from [[lobbyists]]. This is because of [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13490 Under [[s:Executive_Order_12674#Sec._102._Limitations_on_Outside_Earned_Income|Section 102]] of Executive Order 12674, political appointees who are appointed by the president are not allowed to receive any income from outside employment or activities.&lt;ref name="oge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Appointees|url=http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|publisher=U.S. Office of Government Ethics|accessdate=2013-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217212029/http://oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|archivedate=2013-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions to the gift rule include:

* 	Positions within a [[White House]] operating unit that is designated as not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition
* 	Positions within the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]
* 	[[U.S. Foreign Service]] positions that do not require Senate confirmation
Political appointees sometimes attempt to transfer to a career position in the [[competitive service]], [[excepted service]], or [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]].  This practice, known as "burrowing in", is desired by employees due to increased pay and job security, as career positions do not end when a presidential administration changes.  As these appointed positions are selected noncompetitively, while career employees are supposed to be selected on the basis of [[Meritocracy|merit]] and without political influence, these conversions are subject to extra scrutiny.  Since 2010, such conversions require advance approval from OPM, and the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) periodically audits the conversions.  In 2008, members of Congress criticized the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] for improperly allowing political employees to convert to career positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehousetransitionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Appointment-to-Career-Conversions_110212-1.pdf|title=Conversion of Employees from Appointed (Noncareer) Positions to Career Positions in the Executive Branch|last=Schwemle|first=Barbara L.|date=2012-11-02|website=|publisher=Congressional Research Service|pages=1, 5, 8|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the politics of the United States, the system of political appointments comes from a history of the [[spoils system]] (also known as a [[patronage system]]) which is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory. The term was derived from the phrase "to the victor belong the spoils" by New York Senator [[William L. Marcy]], referring to the victory of the [[Jackson Democrats]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1828|election of 1828]], with the term "spoils" meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory. Though it is commonly assumed that the patronage system in the United States first came into general use during [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidency, it actually has an older history. President [[Thomas Jefferson]], a [[Democratic-Republican]], favored a policy of keeping rival [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] out of government.

The patronage system thrived in the U.S. federal government until 1883. In 1820 [[United States Congress|Congress]] limited federal administrators to four-year terms, which led to constant turnover; by the 1860s and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], patronage had led to widespread inefficiency and political corruption. Although it used to be confined to cabinet positions, department heads, and foreign ambassadorships, by the 1860s patronage had spread to low-level government positions. This meant that when the incumbent political party lost a presidential election, the federal government underwent wholesale turnover.

On July 2, 1881, [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disaffected and mentally unstable political office seeker, [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinated]] President [[James Garfield]]. This highlighted how much the patronage problem had gotten out of control, and shifted public opinion, convincing the United States that the President of the United States had more important things to do than to engage in patronage. Congress was eventually spurred to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] of 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patronage|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/lib/student_work/florence96/jessdave/patronage.html|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created a [[Civil Service Commission]] and advocated a [[merit system]] for selecting government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Garfield: A Biography|last = Peskin|first = Allan|publisher = Kent State University Press|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0873382106|location = Kent, OH|pages = 591|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SRmY164czTQC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, passage of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] of 1939 forbade the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibited using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbade officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support, which restricted most partisan political activities of federal employees. By 1980, 90% of federal positions had become part of the civil service system, which lead to state and local governments to employed large patronage systems. Big-city political machines in places such as [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Chicago]] thrived in the late nineteenth century. Being as a patronage system not only rewarded political supporters for past support, it also encouraged future support, because persons who have a patronage job would try to retain it by campaigning for the party at the next election. Large-scale patronage systems declined steadily during the twentieth century. During the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920), "good government" reformers overthrew political machines and installed civil service systems. Chicago, under Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], remained the last bastion of patronage, existing in its purest form until the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti- Corruption Report|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/pols/ChicagoPolitics/AntiCorruptionReport_4.pdf|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In today’s more observant standards, politicians wanted to pull away from the negative intonation of the name casting of Patronage, and Spoil system which led them to rename the process “Political Appointments”.

==Issues==
The United States has more political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy in the world. Even though the United States has one of the largest populations of political appointees in the system, the efficiency of political appointees is constantly shifting. Political appointees are engraved in everyday decisions even making the final call on major events.

'''Post-politics''' refers to the critique of the [[emergence]], in the post-[[Cold War]] period, of a politics of [[consensus]] on a global scale: the dissolution of the [[Communist bloc|Eastern Communist bloc]] following the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] instituted a promise for post-ideological consensus. The political development in post-communist countries went two different directions depending on the approach each of them take on dealing with the communist party members. Active [[decommunisation]] process took place in Eastern European states which later joined EU. While in Russia and majority of former USSR republics communists became one of many political parties on equal grounds.

Generated by a cohort of radical philosophers – namely [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Alain Badiou]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]] – and their concern with politics as the institution of radical, active equality, this critique claims that the post-ideological politics of consensus has occasioned the systematic foreclosure of the properly political moment: with the institution of a series of new “[[Post-democracy|post-democratic]]" governmental techniques, internal politics proper is reduced to social administration.  Meanwhile, with the rise of the postmodernist "politics of self" comes a concomitant new "politics of conduct", in which political values are replaced by moral ones (what [[Chantal Mouffe]] terms "politics in the register of morality").

== Roots of the post-political consensus ==
=== The global political landscape post-1989 ===
The disintegration of the Eastern communist bloc following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 announced the end of the Cold War era, and with it the great ideological stand-off between East and West, between the communist and capitalist worlds.  In eyes of Western society Capitalism emerged the victor with liberal democracy as its corresponding political doctrine.  With the fall of state-communism in Eastern Europe and Eurasia as the final blow to an already crisis-ridden system, the USSR as a key political player on side of communism abandoned its [[social democratic]], [[Keynesian]] form; and neoliberalism entered a new global phase. In the USSR the main driver for this change was idea of "convergention" between socialism and communism formulated by [[Andrej Sakharov]] in his Nobel price speech. With [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s [[End of History and the Last Man|End of History]] as its founding statement, this was the birth of the post-political, post-ideological "[[Zeitgeist]]".

=== Intellectual climate ===
Alongside Fukuyama, various other intellectual currents are associated with the consolidation of the post-political consensus.  The "[[reflexive modernity]]" thesis of post-industrial sociologists [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Ulrich Beck]], for example, has acted as the intellectual accompaniment to Third Way politics.  In "reflexive modernity", say these authors, the central imperative of political action shifts from issues of social welfare (a politics of redistribution) to the management of "risk" (a politics of "distributive responsibility"): that is, the "environmental externalities" that are the ever more visible, unwanted by-products of techno-economic progress.  For both Beck and Giddens it is this imperative, and the new "social reflexivity" that has developed in response – rather than instrumental rationality or, crucially, political struggle – that has driven the profound [[social change]]s of the post-war period.  Indeed, for Giddens, it is "social reflexivity" – the enhanced autonomy of individual action called forth by the dispersal of socio-technological knowledge and risk in "post-traditional" society – that paves the way for:
# post-Fordist production (based as it is on flexible production and bottom-up decision-making);
# the reconfiguration of society’s relation to authority (political, expert and administrative, both within the state and beyond) according to the principles of deliberation and “active trust”.
According to both Beck and Giddens, these changes render obsolete material, class-based, ideologically grounded politics organised via traditional, collective forms such as the party or trade union.  In their place, we see the emergence of a new “politics of self” (“subpolitics” in Beck; “life politics" in Giddens) in which, as part of the wider [[Postmodernity|post-modern]] turn, issues previously considered to be purely personal enter the political arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all commentators agree with this version of events, however, and it is the critical perspectives considered in this section from which the post-political critique derives.  Nikolas Rose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|title=Community, citizenship, and the third way|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2000|volume=43|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, counters Beck and Giddens by highlighting the role of a new governmental "politics of conduct" in forging the political subjectivities that emerge with the advent of Third Way politics in Britain under New Labour (and, by extension, in developed nations in the post-industrial period).  Against Giddens' "social reflexivity"-based account, Rose's study of this new "ethopolitics" suggests that it is the strictures of the new, market individualist (Schumpeterian) forms of governance-beyond-the-state that has driven the recent emphasis on the autonomous, freedom-aspiring, self-sufficient individual.  A key feature of "ethopolitics", says Rose, is its concern with the ethical, rather than political sensibilities of its subjects; a trend wholly consistent with the moralistic turn that politics took on under neoliberalism.  Indeed, in his work on the decline of the public sector in Britain, David Marquand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marquand|first=David|title=Decline of the public|year=2004|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the moral ideology that – via the wider "revenge of the private" – underpinned the neoliberal reforms and sell-offs imposed on the sector by the Thatcher and Blair governments.  This is a key development to which the post-political critique responds: Mouffe speaks here of “politics played out in the register of morality”; while Rancière’s re-envisioning of the political is an express challenge against the de-politicisation of political philosophy that occurred with the field’s Aristotlean, “ethical” turn in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, while Beck points to [[environmentalism]] as a paradigm case of the progressive potential of the personalisation of politics, [[Erik Swyngedouw]] reminds us that in the guise in which it most often appears in the developed world, environmentalism's emphasis on personal lifestyle choices and on particularist struggles against the locally felt effects of environmental "bads" can work to draw attention away from the properly political issue of human society's structural relationship with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|author=Swyngedouw, Erik |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, Rob |editor2=David, Gibbs|pages=13–40(23)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Beck celebrates the new scepticism associated with post-modern, [[Identity politics|identity-based politics]] as a progressive consequence of the universal uncertainty that characterises [[risk society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, critics lament the profound consequences that the anti-essentialist position on truth has had for the imagination of "[[grand narrative]]s" (read political [[Teleology#Modern and postmodern philosophy|teleologies]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-Thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – for proponents of the post-political critique, it is these grand narratives that are the real substance of politics.

== The post-political critique ==
Proponents of the post-political critique do not represent a united theoretical body.  Nonetheless, and excepting Mouffe, the philosophers associated with this critique are sometimes treated together, based on:
* the contribution they have made in recent years to the beginnings of a reinvigoration of radical left thought
* their concern with active, radical equality (equality as an axiomatic given, in contrast to formal equality) and with human emancipation
* their broadly [[Materialism|materialist]] bent – while engaging to a greater or lesser degree with [[Marxism]] in their later work, all were influenced by Marxism in their early years.  Additionally, while influenced by it in important ways, all depart substantially from [[post-structuralism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
What Rancière, Badiou and Žižek, along with Mouffe, agree upon is that under the present post-political conjuncture we have seen a systematic foreclosure of the "properly political dimension", the reinstitution of which will depend upon a radical re-envisioning of our notion of the political.

Against the widespread resignation to addressing politics solely at the [[ontic]] or empirical level – that is, a concern with the "facts of politics" or with politics as 'the exercise of power or the deciding of common affairs'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; – this re-envisioning must, they say, concern itself with the [[Ontology|ontological]] dimension of politics: that is, with the essence of the political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While each conceptualises the properly political in different ways, all agree upon its irreducibly and inherently antagonistic dimension:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alain Badiou: Live Theory|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|author=Badiou, A|authorlink=Alain Badiou|editor=Feltham, O.|pages=136–139 (139)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a radical-progressive position must, says Žižek, 'insist on the unconditional primacy of the inherent antagonism as constitutive of the political'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Challenge of Carl Schmitt|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|author=Zizek, Slavoj|authorlink=Slavoj Zizek|editor=Mouffe, Chantal|pages=18–37(29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the charge that post-politics, with consensus as its defining logic, forecloses the properly political.

=== Rancière's account of the political ===
==== Politics versus police ====
Rancière's work reclaims the notion of politics.  For him, the latter does not consist in 'the exercise of power or the deciding of common affairs', as is ordinarily assumed.  Rather, if politics is born out of the fact of sharing a common space and thus common concerns; and if 'every decision on common affairs requires the prior existence of the common', politics proper surely, says Rancière, denotes the inherent antagonism that exists between competing representations of this common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this basis, Rancière's account of the political proceeds via the distinction he draws between this latter notion of politics proper (''le politique'') (as antagonism), and what he terms the police or police order (''la police'').  The fundamental divergence between politics proper and the police, says Rancière, is their respective representations of the common.  The former not only recognises, but also calls forth the contested nature of the common.  Meanwhile, the police:

‘…symbolises the community as an ensemble of well-defined parts, places and functions, and of the properties and capabilities linked to them, all of which presupposes a fixed distribution of things into common and private – a distinction which itself depends on an ordered distribution of the visible and the invisible, noise and speech, etc…This way of counting [parts, places and functions] simultaneously defines the ways of being, doing, and saying appropriate to these places.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense (and although he disagrees with Foucault on some crucial points), Rancière's definition of police is akin to that given to it in [[Michel Foucault]]'s work.

==== ''Le partage du sensible'' (the "partition" or "distribution" of "the perceptible") ====
Rancière's aesthetic conceptualisation of politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows him to take Foucault's "police" one step further: not only, says Rancière, does the specific allocation of “parts” given in the police order govern ‘the ways of being, doing and saying’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. the behavioural codes 'appropriate to these places'); rather, as the nomination suggests, this particular "partition of the ''perceptible''" also acts to draw, and subsequently police, the very boundaries of what is and is not visible, audible, comprehendible – in short, perceptible – under this order.

This distinctive insight derives in part from Rancière's enquiry into the origins of democracy and in part from the centrality to his theory of the notion of ''mésentente''.  While translated into English simply as "disagreement" (with obvious reference to the constitutively antagonistic element of politics, as discussed above), in French ''mésentente'' also implies, in a speech situation, the fact of misunderstanding between parties, or more precisely in the Rancièrian sense of "talking past one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(5)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rancière's point here is to underline that the fact of misunderstanding is not a neutral one: rather, the partition of the perceptible given in the police order decides whether an enunciation is heard as speech or instead as noise; as rational discourse (as in [[Deliberative democracy|deliberative democratic]] theory, such as that of [[Jürgen Habermas]] or [[John Rawls]]), or instead as a grunt or moan.  In Rancière, the fact of labelling a voice "inaudible" is, therefore, associated with the denial of the subject of that voice as a (political) subject.

==== The contingency of the police order: constitutive excess, the miscount and political subjectivation ====
As suggested above, in so far as the “count” always entails a “miscount” (i.e. denies the subjecthood of certain constituencies), the “logic of the proper”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(175)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which the police order operates is incommensurable with the logic of active, radical equality proposed by Rancière.  Grounded in his account of the usurpatory action that instituted the [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] as the locus of popular sovereignty in ancient Athens, Rancière defines democracy as 'the specific power of those who have no common title to exercise power, except that of not being entitled to its exercise': 'democracy is the paradoxical power of those who do not count: the count of the unaccounted for’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dissenting Words: A Conversation with Jacques Ranciere|journal=diacritics|year=2000|volume=30|issue=2|pages=113–124(124)|author=Ranciere, Jacques|editor=Panagia, David|doi=10.1353/dia.2000.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properly and essentially political "sequence" (to borrow a term from Badiou), then, arises in the rare moment in which ''les sans-part'' exercise this title and make their "usurpatory claim"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a stake in the common: in this moment of “political subjectivation” – that is, the coming into being of a new political subject – the logic of equality meets with and violently unclothes the inegalitarian police logic of the proper; ''les sans-part'', asserting the audibility of their voice and the visibility of their collective body, thus seize their place in the partition of the perceptible and overturn the inaugural “wrong” done to them by a police order whose count left them unaccounted for.

For Rancière, this moment of dramatic ‘rupture in the order of legitimacy and domination’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dissenting Words: A Conversation with Jacques Ranciere|journal=diacritics|year=2000|volume=30|issue=2|pages=113–124(124)|author=Ranciere, Jacques|editor=Panagia, David|doi=10.1353/dia.2000.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constant possibility and as such posits the ultimate [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of any given police order.  This assertion is explained by the specific agency lent to ''les sans-part'' by the nature of their relationship to the police.  Rancière is at pains to underline that ''les sans-part'' is not so much a social class or group excluded and thus awaiting incorporation: that would imply not only a procedural account of equality but also the existence of the emergent political subject – as an identity pre-given in the police order – prior to the political moment, both scenarios not worthy of the name politics according to Rancière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(178)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Les sans-part'' should instead be thought of as a supernumerary category, existing 'at once nowhere and everywhere':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(176)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; '…political subjects are ''supernumerary'' collectives which call into question the counting of the community's parts and the relations of inclusion and exclusion which define that count.  Subjects…''are not reducible'' to social groups or identities but are, rather, collectives of enunciation and demonstration ''surplus'' to the count of social groups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(7)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is from this conceptualisation that ''les sans-part'' derive their agency: crucially, the police logic of the proper is a logic ‘predicated upon saturation’, upon the assumption that it is possible to designate society as a totality "{{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} groups performing specific functions and occupying determined spaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(606)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the at-once visible/invisible proof of the age-old adage that, contrary to this logic, 'the whole is more than the sum of its parts',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(176)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very existence of ''les sans-parts'' as ''excess'' therefore radically negates the police logic of the proper.

==== Excess and the Universal in Rancière, Žižek, Badiou and Mouffe ====
There would seem to be a contradiction that appears in Rancière's schema (outlined above): political subjectivation entails assertion of a place, yet it also negates the very logic of places, of the proper.  Rancière deals with this by specifying that the political moment is called forth only to the extent that the 'part of the no-part' is asserted in such a way that it forms an identification 'with the community as a whole.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rancière's claim is that this distinctly universalist gesture works to deny the particularist logic that partitions social space into a series of private, proper places, functions and parts, thus resolving the aforementioned contradiction.  In his account of the (post-)political, Slavoj Žižek also insists heavily on the role of the universal.  For Žižek, a situation becomes political when:

…a particular demand…starts to function as a metaphoric condensation of the global [universal] opposition against Them, those in power, so that the protest is no longer just about that demand, but about the universal dimension that resonates in that particular demand…What post-politics tends to prevent is precisely this metaphoric universalisation of particular demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of dealing with the aforementioned contradiction, however, Žižek's concept of the "indivisible remainder"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; is somewhat more instructive than his emphasis on the universal.  The figure of the "remainder" of course corresponds closely to that of "excess" or "surplus" in Rancière.  Meanwhile, the notion of "indivisibility" implies a strong resistance to partitioning (perhaps stronger than the universalist gesture upon which Rancière relies).

In this respect, the ontological status of the remainder in Žižek comes closer to that of the privileged figure of Badiou's "non-expressive dialectics": the generic set.  Derived from mathematical [[set theory]], a generic set is the name given by its discoverer [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] to 'the mathematical object without clear description, without name, without place in the classification…[it is] an object the characteristic of which is to have no name'.  It therefore offers the solution to the fundamental problem of politics, which according to Badiou presents itself as follows: if in the battle between the suturing logic of Law (the police) and the emancipatory logic of Desire, Desire must necessarily always be directed at something beyond the ontological universe specified by Law, the crucial problem for political action must be to find ways of naming the object of Desire without prescribing it and thus subsuming it back under the ontological domain of Law, as this would be to negate Desire, and with it the possibility of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Politics: A Non-expressive Dialectics|url=http://blog.urbanomic.com/sphaleotas/archives/badiou-politics.pdf|work=Is the Politics of Truth still Thinkable? (Conference Title)|accessdate=7 January 2011|location=Birkbeck Institute of Humanities, London|date=26 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; With genericity being closely associated to universality in Badiou's work, the latter therefore contributes a great deal to developing the notion of "surplus" or "excess" in both Rancière and Žižek.  It also points more resolutely than does Rancière to the designation of politics proper as the moment of institution of an entirely new conception of the social totality.  Or, as Žižek puts it: ‘…[A]uthentic politics…is the art of the impossible – it changes the very parameters of what is considered "possible" in the existing constellation';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(199)}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence also, for Žižek, its inherently antagonistic dimension.

The figure of excess fulfils a different purpose in Mouffe's theory of the political, which rests heavily on her and Laclau's notion of [[hegemony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laclau|first=Ernesto|title=[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]|year=1985|publisher=Verso|location=London|author2=Mouffe, Chantal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dikec, hegemony in Laclau and Mouffe's image presupposes the impossibility of 'a totally sutured society, or, in other words, a total closure of the social'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(174)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because hegemony is possible only through antagonism; and antagonism, in turn, can exist only through lack or surplus: consensus, in this view, is never a complete closure; rather, it only ever exists as the ‘temporary result of a provisional hegemony’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=Deliberative Democracy or Agonistic Pluralism?|journal=Social Research|year=1999|volume=66|issue=3|pages=745–758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as it rests on an assertion of the impossibility of saturation, Mouffe's critique of post-politics therefore displays some commonality with those of Rancière, Badiou and Žižek.  Mouffe's resistance to saturation, however, is explained by her [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] politico-theoretical persuasion and its attendant anti-essentialism.  In this respect, her theory of the political differs widely from the above-mentioned philosophers, all of whom, while inspired in various ways by it, are careful to distance themselves from post-structuralist thought, not least on account of the contribution it has in their eyes made to the consolidation of the post-political Zeitgeist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|page16-17=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also explains the absence of the universalist gesture in Mouffe.  Indeed, as explained above, the political is the struggle for hegemonic control over the particular content that is to stand-in for the Universal.  An authentic universality is therefore impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171-244(175-182)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saturation and post-politics ====
The present conjuncture is characterised as post-political not insofar as it denies equality: on the contrary in the advanced liberal democracies that are the heartlands of post-politics, formal equality is declared triumphant, leaving only the “perfection” of democracy via more participative, deliberative mechanisms.  Rather, from the philosophical perspective outlined above, post-politics is characterised as such insofar as its insistence on saturation and its denial of excess are particularly strong.  Thus, under the present, liberal democratic conjuncture, the drive towards the democratic inclusion of all has particularly suturing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(202)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(609)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the insistence on the achievement of formal equality is especially ignorant to the fact of "surplus".  Despite the concerted strategies of consensual incorporation or exclusion directed at it, the persistence of "surplus" is clearly evidenced in the present period: firstly in the deepening of real-world, material inequalities and secondly in those properly political gestures that resist the conditional nature of (post-)democratic participation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John|title=Markets, Deliberation and Environment|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, that resist accession to the post-political consensus.

== Post-politics and the environment ==
As both Žižek and Badiou explicitly recognise, the post-political scenario is particularly well-advanced in the ecological sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alain Badiou: Live Theory|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|author=Badiou, A|authorlink=Alain Badiou|editor=Feltham, O.|pages=136–139 (139)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this cue, environmental geographer [[Erik Swyngedouw]] has led an emerging literature that identifies within environmental politics many of the classic symptoms of the post-political condition.

=== Symptoms of the post-political condition exemplified in environmental politics ===
==== Post-ideological consensus ====
As noted above, the post-political configuration is characterised by the disciplining role of consensus.  With the market and the liberal state as it organising principles, the present global "meta-level" consensus has taken cosmopolitanism and humanitarianism as the central and uncontestable tenets of its corresponding moral (rather than political) value system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(609)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearly twenty years since the [[Rio Earth Summit]] (1992), [[sustainability]] has not only established itself as an additional tenet of this moral order.  In so doing, it has also stepped in as one of the primary post-ideological "ideologies" of the present age: as Swyngedouw notes, as a concept sustainability is so devoid of properly political content that it is impossible to disagree with its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13–40(20) |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swyngedouw's analysis of the particular representation of nature called forth by sustainability discourse explains why this is so.  He argues that the nature that enters political debate via sustainability discourse is a radically conservative and reactionary one that posits a singular, ontologically stable and harmonious Nature thrown "out of synch" by human intervention.  In denying the plurality, complexity and unpredictability of actually existing natures, sustainability "codes" nature in such a way as to pose status quo (read market-based) solutions that side-step debate over the properly political question of what kind of socio-environmental futures we wish to inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13-40(20-23)|authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw|editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Managerialism and technocracy ====
{{main|Technocracy}}

The post-political condition is characterised by the rise of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certainly exercised in a democratic fashion (i.e. via the deliberative engagement described by Giddens' social reflexivity thesis (see above)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;), expert adjudication nonetheless comes to substitute properly political debate.

This trend is particularly visible in the environmental sphere.  According to Gert Goeminne and Karen François,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goeminne|first=Gert|author2=Francois, Karen|title=The Thing Called Environment: What It Is and How to Be Concerned With It|journal=The Oxford Literary Review|year=2010|volume=32|issue=1|pages=109–130|doi=10.3366/olr.2010.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; more concerning still than the increasing "colonisation" of this sphere by science is that it is a radically depoliticised version of science that is doing the colonising.  Drawing heavily from [[Bruno Latour]], Goeminne and François' work serves to problematise the representational work done by science: science is neither a neutral conductor of material reality that produces “facts”, nor should its legitimacy to speak on behalf of nature escape scrutiny.  By contrast, ‘…the fact-value divide of the Modern Constitution acts to obscure the work of composition that goes into the construction of a matter of fact’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goeminne|first=Gert|title=Climate Policy is Dead, Long Live Climate Politics!|journal=Ethics, Place and Environment|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=207–214(212)|doi=10.1080/13668791003778867}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving way to the post-political configuration, in which politics is reduced to 'the administration and management of processes whose parameters are defined by consensual socio-scientific knowledges'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(602)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In environmental politics, then, 'disagreement is allowed, but only with respect to the choice of technologies, the mix of organisational fixes, the details of the managerial adjustments, and the urgency of the timing and implementation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13–40(23) |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding global climate adaptation and mitigation, that debate over climate scientists' varying interpretations of crucial [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]] diverts attention from questions of "[[climate justice]]" is a case in point.

The [[Technocracy|technocratic]], "post-democratic" tendency ushered in with the neoliberal transition towards governance-beyond-the-state (henceforth [[governance]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Governance Innovation and the Citizen: The Janus Face of Governance-beyond-the-State|journal=Urban Studies|year=2005|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1991–2006|doi=10.1080/00420980500279869}}&lt;/ref&gt; has therefore been reinforced by consensus politics.  And as the environmental sphere has been a particularly privileged site for experimentation in neoliberal governance, so too is it particularly vulnerable to the post-political tendency.  The neoliberal shift in environmental policy implementation was signalled in the 1990s by the growing influence of [[New Public Management]] (NPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. A. W|title=The New Governance: Governing without Government|journal=Political Studies|year=1996|volume=XLIV|pages=652–667|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb01747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing preference for [[new environmental policy instruments]] (NEPIs).  Meanwhile, one need only point to the predominance of quantitative measures such as [[Cost Benefit Analysis]] (CBA) or the vast regulatory apparatuses associated with the new and burgeoning carbon markets as evidence of what Mitchell Dean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Mitchell|title=Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society|year=1999|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; has labelled "post-democratic" concern with metricisation, accountancy, auditing and benchmarking.

Alongside this latter concern, Dean, along with Barbara Cruikshank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cruikshank|first=Barbara|title=Revolutions within: self-governance and self-esteem|journal=Economy and Society|year=1993|volume=22|issue=3|pages=327–344|doi=10.1080/03085149300000022}}&lt;/ref&gt; also associates the "post-democratic" turn with a series of new "technologies of citizenship".  As forms of [[biopower]], these latter work to increasingly displace 'regulatory competence'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemke|first=T.|title=Foucault, governmentality and critique|journal=Rethinking Marxism|year=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=49–64|doi=10.1080/089356902101242288}}&lt;/ref&gt; onto the morally responsible, autonomous subject that the state increasingly seeks to forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Governance Innovation and the Citizen: The Janus Face of Governance-beyond-the-State|journal=Urban Studies|year=2005|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1991–2006|doi=10.1080/00420980500279869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|title=Community, citizenship, and the third way|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2000|volume=43|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politics as the negotiation of particular interests ====
As both Žižek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rancière&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue, under post-politics the political claims of particular groups are denied their potentially universal character.  Oosterlynk and Swyngedouw's application of the post-political critique to the dispute over [[noise pollution]] associated with Brussels airport is a classic example: the geographically differentiated impact of noise pollution was used to pit residents’ associations against one another, precluding the potential that a universal claim against the global [[Just in time (business)|"just-in-time"]] economy (the ultimate source of increased flights) be articulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oosterlynck|first=Stijn|title=Noise reduction: the postpolitical quandary of night flights at Brussels airport|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2010|volume=42|pages=1577–1594|doi=10.1068/a42269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Populism and the resurgence of the properly political ====
[[Populism]], as the residue of the properly political, is the ultimate symptom of the post-political condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(611)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the post-political consensus itself tends towards populist gestures as a substitute for the properly political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601-20(611-613)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, popular frustration with the confines of consensual politics inevitably gives way to alternatives that, faced with the depoliticising strategies of the consensual order, often take a populist form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most characteristic features of populism is its invocation of a common, external threat or enemy.  The homogenising, unifying effect of this invocation is what produces the mythical – but more importantly reactionary and invariably exclusionary –  notion of "the people" that is so central to the populist gesture.  Swyngedouw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601-20(611-613)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in climate politics "the people" becomes a united "humanity" facing a common predicament, regardless of the differentiated responsibility for and capacity to respond to anthropogenic climate change.  Following other scholars who have analysed the alarmist tone of climate discourse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamblyn|first=R.|title=The whistleblower and the canary: rhetorical constructions of climate change|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|year=2009|volume=35|pages=223–236|doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2008.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skrimshire|first=Stefan|title=Future ethics: climate change and apocalyptic imagination|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swyngedouw also underlines that the millenarian, apocalyptic imaginaries called forth by the latter create an external threat, while also giving way to an elite-led, almost crusade-like action (the latter being a further classic feature of populism).  The environmental consensus therefore entails a populist dimension.

Meanwhile, as Žižek has shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; disaffection with the consensus tends to favour Far Right movements, whose populist tactics respond to the same need to substitute the properly political described above; and whose violent gestures mimic the properly political impetus towards antagonism.  On the other hand, properly political claims that resist both consensual strategies of incorporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John|title=Markets, Deliberation and Environment|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what Žižek has called "the populist temptation" are made audible only as violent or fanatical outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the environmental arena, media coverage of "resource wars" is a prime example of disputes that may well have a properly political dimension (though may not, of course, necessarily be progressive or without populist dimensions, of course) being neutralised in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Apocalypse Forever|journal=Theory, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=27|issue=2-3|pages=213–232|doi=10.1177/0263276409358728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Budapest Rearing Horse and Mounted Warrior, right side, by E.C.Rae.png|thumb|upright=1.35|1945 black-and-white photo]]
The '''''Rearing Horse and Mounted Warrior''''' or '''''Budapest horse''''' is a [[bronze]] sculpture attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Depicting [[Francis I of France]] on a [[destrier]] horse, it is estimated to have been cast from a clay or wax model in the first half of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.szepmuveszeti.hu/adatlap_eng/mounted_warrior_leonardo_da_vinci_2778 |title=Mounted Warrior |publisher=Budapest Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is in the permanent exhibit of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]].

The bronze statuette consists of the horse and a detachable rider.

Hungarian art historian Mária Aggházy noticed a resemblance between the content-looking rider and the young [[Francis I of France]], soon to be king, and Leonardo's patron from his later years.{{sfn|Sturman|May|Luchs|2015|p=29}} Francis was an avid participant in [[jousting]] tournaments, which in the more entertaining but also more dangerous French style were run with less armour and other equipment than in Italy. Aggházy theorised that the rider's light clothing, likely after a victorious duel, demonstrated bravery on Francis's part as he followed the [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] ideals of the [[Nine Worthies]].{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|pp=36–37}}

[[File:Francois Ier by Jean Clouet.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Young Francis I by [[Jean Clouet]] c.1515]]
In 1516, after invitations from King Francis I of France and his predecessor, [[Louis XII of France]], Leonardo moved to France and entered the service of Francis I. Art chronicler [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], close to Leonardo's heirs, wrote in 1584 that Leonardo had made several models of horses for Francis. This statuette is believed to be one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leonardo Da Vinci: Drawings of Horses and Other Animals from the Royal Library at Windsor Castle |last=Pedretti |first=Carlo |date=1984 |publisher=Johnson Reprint Corporation |isbn=0-384-45282-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGlQAAAAMAAJ |page=74 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his life, Leonardo was working on several equestrian monuments, and did several studies of horses on worksheets that have been preserved in the [[Royal Collection]] in [[Windsor Castle]]. This statuette was depicted in sketches from c.1490&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|912283|Folio RL 12283}} Retrieved 28 March 2017.

By then Leonardo was unable to continue with artwork much beyond sketches, but did for instance supervise bronze casting of statues at the king's [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=25}}

By 1540, Leonardo's follower [[Leone Leoni]] was also commissioned to create an equestrian statuette while he was a [[court painter|court sculptor]] to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who governed Milan at the time.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=46}} In 1549 and 1550, Leoni sent several letters to [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle]] requesting that Leonardo's statuette from the king's court be sent back to him.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=48}} An equestrian bronze model was recorded in the Leoni collection at their home [[Casa degli Omenoni]] before the collection was dispersed by 1620.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leone Leoni's Collection in the Casa Degli Omenoni, Milan: The Inventory of 1609 |last=Helmstutler Di Dio |first=Kelley |date=August 2003 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=145 |number=1205 |jstor=20073166 |page=572–578 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the statuette also features in a c.1545 [[Scroll (art)|scrollwork]] from the Fontainebleau workshops of Francis I.

[[File:Ferenczy István 1810 crop.png|thumb|upright=0.75|István Ferenczy in 1810 by Sándor Ádám Ehrenreich]]
In 1818, a Hungarian sculptor, [[István Ferenczy]], moved from Hungary to Rome and spent 6 years there as a student of the acclaimed sculptors [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] and [[Antonio Canova]].{{sfn|Meller|1916|p=243}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mno.hu/migr_1834/szobrok-a-falbol-772194 |title=Leonardo da Vinci és a Ferenczy István-hagyaték: egy szenzációs művészeti pör |last=Ferch |first=Magda |publisher=[[Magyar Nemzet]] |language=Hungarian |date=21 September 2002 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Rome, Ferenczy gathered a collection of 82 works of art, including this statuette, which he had acquired in the mistaken belief that it was a Greek work. In 1846 he prepared an inventory with the intention of selling the collection to the Hungarian state, still with the statuette as an ancient work from Athens, but the sale did not go through.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Sturman|May|Luchs|2015|p=41}} As Ferenczy's will stated that the crates of his collection were not to be opened for 50 years, the collection remained untouched for a long time after his death in 1856.{{sfn|Ferch|2002}} The family reached a deal with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest]] and sold the collection to them in 1914, still none the wiser about the statuette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/szepmuveszeti/docs/issuu_rsz_eng_web_jav |title=History of the Sculpture Collection of the Museum of Fine Arts Budapest |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest |date=8 January 2014 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|Museum of Fine Arts|2014}}

Simon Meller, the curator of the Budapest museum, began exploring the statuette with more knowledge of Leonardo's equestrian works. He came to the conclusion that the style of the statuette is consistent with Leonardo's other works, particularly those in the studies for [[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|the painting of ''The Battle of Anghiari'']] and the [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio|Trivulzio]] monument. He attributed the statuette to Leonardo da Vinci for the first time since the 17th century, and published it in a 1916 journal of the museums in the [[Prussia]]n region.{{sfn|NGA|2009a}}{{sfn|Meller|1916|pp=243–244}} To mark the occasion, another sculptor in the Ferenczy family, [[Béni Ferenczy]], gifted Meller a commemorative medal with a [[relief]] of the statuette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://100hires.hu/cikkek/ferenczy-beni |title=Ferenczy Béni |website=100 híres |publisher=Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute |language=Hungarian |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette became a permanent exhibit in the museum in the 1920s.{{sfn|Museum of Fine Arts|2014}}

The 1940s were a tumultuous time for Europe's artworks, with the statuette, the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], and many other works of art captured in the [[Nazi plunder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagazin.hu/artmagazin_hirek/magyar_mukincsek_a_muncheni_collecting_pointban_iii..3402.html?pageid=119 |title=Magyar műkincsek a müncheni Collecting Pointban III |last=Kovács |first=Ágnes |website=Artmagazin Online |date=August 2015 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |language=Hungarian |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Hungary joined the [[Axis powers]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/05/how-world-war-ii-shaped-modern-hungary |title=How World War II shaped modern Hungary |last=Pálfi |first=Rita |date=5 May 2015 |publisher=Euronews |accessdate=3 April 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1942, Russia unexpectedly bombed Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hungary at War: Civilians and Soldiers in World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ2j2_wcWxMC&amp;pg=PA36 |last=Eby |first=Cecil D. |year=2010 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=9780271040882 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian planes bomb Budapest |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11994048 |date=7 September 1942 |work=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=29,964 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum began the protection of their works of art by packing them into crates and moving them to lower floors.

The Museum of Fine Arts was under the control of the Ministry of Education, where the newly installed [[Ferenc Rajniss]], sympathetic to the Nazi rule, ordered the majority of the museum's artwork to be sent to Austria.

In August 1945, they were contacted by the "Monuments Men" working in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] in Munich. They had been cataloging art looted by the Nazis, and at the [[Munich Central Collecting Point]] had works of art from the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. The statuette, along with most of the other artwork, was returned to the museum by 1947.{{sfn|Kovács|2015}}

== Attribution ==

[[File:Budapest Fine Arts Museum R01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest]]
The statuette was attributed to Leonardo in 1916 by Simon Meller, the curator at the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts, due to its similarities to Leonardo's drawings.{{sfn|NGA|2009a}} Mária Aggházy summarised the attribution in the 1970s and 80s beyond the comparisons to Leonardo's drawings, by saying that the rider's composure matches the reported personality of the young to-be-king Francis I of France, that there is no armour or saddle as is suitable for French jousting, that the figure is wearing a royal-style crown ornament, and that the statuette was depicted in later French artwork for jousting.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=34}}

The attribution has been widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |chapter= Chapter Seven: 1503–1508 |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |date=26 November 2015 |publisher=Penguin UK |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-198237-3 |page=ccxxxviii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=budapest |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; more seriously than other sculpture attributions to Leonardo,{{sfn|Sturman|May|Luchs|2015|p=26}} and according to art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]], is well supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Overview of Leonardo's Career and Projects Until c.1500 |editor-last=Farago |editor-first=Claire J. |chapter=Christo fanciullo |last=Kemp |first=Martin |language=English |year=1999 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8153-2934-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fMDoImNWqHQC&amp;pg=PA303 303] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMDoImNWqHQC |ref={{sfnref|Kemp|1999a}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, some doubt, especially on the rider.

In the 1920s, following Meller's attribution, a dozen art scholars published their opinions about the statuette. Half of them, including [[Edmund Hildebrandt]], agreed with Meller's attribution, and the rest thought it was a later work by one of Leonardo's pupils.{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=56}} [[Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich|L.H. Heydenreich]] wrote in 1954 that the statuette proves Leonardo's competency for casting in bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heydenreich|first=Ludwig Heinrich|title=Leonardo da Vinci|date=1954|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|volume=1|page=66|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent publications, Martin Kemp noted the unusual lack of attention to detail on the horse's anatomy,{{sfn|Kemp|1999a}} which others have echoed due to the extreme bending of the horse's hind legs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leonardo and sculpture: Atlanta and Los Angeles |last=Butterfield |first=Andrew |date=August 2010 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=152 |number=1289 |jstor=25769741 |page=570–571 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a perceived lack of energy typical to Leonardo's other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonian.com/arts-culture/leonardos-horse-141786173/ |title=Leonardo's Horse? |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|Smithsonian Institution}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the surface modelling suggests that the bronze cast may have been made by one of Leonardo's pupils from a wax model of his,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The drawings of Leonardo da Vinci in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor Castle |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |last2=Pedretti |first2=Carlo |date=1968 |edition=2 |volume=1 – Text |isbn=0-7148-1343-5 |publisher=Phaidon |location=London |page=30 |url=http://bibdig.museogalileo.it/Teca/Viewer?an=336457_1&amp;vis=D#page/104/mode/2up |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|Kemp|2015|p=238}} as in one of Leonardo's worksheets he had made a note to himself to "make a little one of wax about four inches long" next to horse sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The ''Battle of Anghiari'': A Speculative Reconstruction of Leonardo's Design Process |last=Farago |first=Claire J. |date=1996 |journal= The ALV Journal |volume=9 |url= http://bibdig.museogalileo.it/Teca/Viewer?an=339156_9 |page=[http://bibdig.museogalileo.it/Teca/Viewer?an=339156_9&amp;vis=D#page/90/mode/2up 84] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|912328|Folio RL 12328}} Retrieved 28 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Clark]], Martin Kemp, and [[Carlo Pedretti]] all suggested that the note refers to the Budapest statue.{{sfn|Clark|Kemp|2015|p=238}}{{sfn|Clark|Pedretti|1968|p=30}} Some believe the statuette is merely based on one of Leonardo's sketches.{{sfn|Bush|1999}} [[Giovanni Francesco Rustici]] has also been considered as the sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=European bronze statuettes |last=Radcliffe |first=Anthony |date=1966 |publisher=Connoisseur |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWRQAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv}} via [[#{{sfnref|Aggházy|1989}}|Aggházy 1989]] p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical evidence from a 2009 investigation organised by the [[National Gallery of Art]] suggests that the statuette was cast near or after Leonardo's death in 1519 using the [[lost-wax casting|lost wax technique]]. The composition of the metal alloy is identical in all the parts of the statuette, apart from the modern pin used to attach the rider.{{sfn|NGA|2009a}}

Particularly the ''Rearing Horse'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/195311 |title=Rearing Horse |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|The Met}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Hunt Museum]] in Limerick, Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntmuseum.com/collection/rearing-horse-da-vinci-horse/ |title=Rearing Horse/ Da Vinci Horse |publisher=The Hunt Museum |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|Hunt Museum}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been considered as being by an early follower of Leonardo, such as [[Leone Leoni]].{{sfn|Aggházy|1989|p=49}} The three were exhibited for the 1969 Congress of the [[Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art]] as "Horses of Leonardo da Vinci" with reservation on their attribution.{{sfn|Aggházy|1971|p=[https://library.hungaricana.hu/en/view/ORSZ_SZEP_Kozl_036/?pg=62&amp;layout=r 61-78]}} For repeat exhibitions in the US in 2009–2010, the National Gallery of Art investigation confirmed the New York and Limerick horses to be the result of techniques and alloys available only since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/02/art-deciphering-the-da-vinci-code/ |title=Deciphering the da Vinci code |work=The Washington Times |date=2 August 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |ref={{sfnref|Washington Times}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provenance of the rider is disputed due to its size and lesser quality of work. Because the current attachment of the rider is modern, the horse lacks a saddle, and the rider is of smaller scale than the horse, the National Gallery of Art considered the possibility that the rider is a later addition. In their 2009 exhibit, the ''Rearing Horse'' was for the first time displayed separately from the ''Mounted Warrior'', which was placed beside the horse.{{sfn|NGA|2009a}} The [[Hermitage Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Russia, holds a horseman statuette that shares the crude features of the Budapest rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warrior |url=https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/06.+Sculpture/56460 |publisher=Hermitage Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Warrior'', it has been attributed to Leone Leoni or one of his followers, and may be based on the same model as the ''Mounted Warrior''.{{sfn|Sturman|May|Luchs|2015|p=29}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">The '''Scottish Militia Bill''' (known formerly as the '''Scotch Militia Bill''') is the usual name given to a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] that was passed by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] of the Parliament of  [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in early 1708. However, on 11 March 1708,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/parliament/1705 |title=Parliaments: 1705 |author= |website=The History of Parliament |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |access-date=6 November 2016 |quote="On 11 Mar. 1708, when the Queen attended the Lords to give assent to several bills, she used her prerogative of veto against one, the bill for settling the Scottish militia."}} &lt;!-- Note that per WP:OSNS we record this as 11 March 1708, but contemporary records would put it in 1707 as the legal year did not start until 25 March. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld [[royal assent]] on the advice of her ministers for fear that the proposed [[militia]] would be disloyal.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Anne's veto is recorded as "La Reine se avisera" ("The Queen will consider it") in 18 H.L. Jour. 506 (1707).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The bill's long title was "An Act for settling the Militia of that Part of Great Britain called Scotland". Its object was to arm the Scottish militia, which had not been recreated at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]]. This happened as the unification between Scotland and England under the [[Acts of Union 1707]] had been passed.

On the day the bill was meant to be signed, news came that the French were sailing toward Scotland for the [[Planned_French_invasion_of_Britain_(1708)|planned invasion of 1708]] and there was suspicion that the Scottish might be disloyal. Therefore, support for a veto was strong.

==Significance==
The Scottish Militia Bill is the last bill to have been refused royal assent. Before this, [[William III of England|King William III]] had vetoed bills passed by Parliament six times. Royal assent to bills and governments generally came to be viewed as a mere formality once both Houses of Parliament had successfully read a bill three times, or a general election had taken place.

In the British colonies, the denial of royal assent had continued past 1708, and was one of the primary complaints of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776: that the King "has refused his Assent to Laws, most wholesome and necessary for the public Good" and "He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance".

'''''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[feminist]] [[academic journal]]. It was established in 1975 by [[Catharine R. Stimpson]], and is published quarterly by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. ''Signs'' publishes essays examining the lives of women, men, and [[Non-Binary|non-binary]] people around the globe from both historical and contemporary perspectives, as well as theoretical and critical articles addressing processes of [[gender]]ing, [[sexualization]], and [[racialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=M|year=2011|title=Signs 2005–2015: Reflections on the Nature and Global Reach of Interdisciplinary Feminist Knowledge Production|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657513|journal=Signs|volume=36|issue=3|pages=511–519|doi=10.1086/657513|jstor=10.1086/657513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and significance ==
The founding of ''Signs'' in 1975 was part of the early development of the field of [[women's studies]], born of the [[women's liberation movement]] of the late 1960s and 1970s. The journal had two founding purposes, as stated in the inaugural editorial: (1) "to publish the new scholarship about women" in the U.S. and around the globe, and (2) "to be [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stimpson|first=Catharine R.|last2=Burstyn|first2=Joan N.|last3=Stanton|first3=Domna C.|last4=Whisler|first4=Sandra M.|date=1975-10-01|title=Editorial|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493202|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=1|issue=1|pages=v–viii|doi=10.1086/493202|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was for readers of the journal to "grasp a sense of the totality of women's lives and the realities of which they have been a part."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The meaning behind the name ''Signs'' is that signs "represent" and "point": the original editors wanted the journal to "represent the originality and rigor" of women's studies and to "point" to new directions for feminist scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Former editor-in-chief Ruth-Ellen Boetcher Joeres said in an article in the [[Yale Journal of Criticism]] that ''Signs'', from its inception, was meant to be "something different, even insurgent...an agent for change", because it emerged from the "[[grassroots]]" feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joeres|first=Ruth-Ellen B.|date=1997-10-01|title=The Paradox of a Feminist Academic Journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/36767|journal=The Yale Journal of Criticism|volume=10|issue=2|pages=439–443|doi=10.1353/yale.1997.0021|issn=1080-6636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joeres explored the "paradox" of how a journal can be both an "agent for change" and regarded as "respectable in the academy," and concluded with the hope that ''Signs'' could retain its activist roots and transform the academy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the effort to avoid the tendency of the academy to "codify" and limit scholarship, ''Signs'' rotates institutional homes roughly every 5 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is currently based at [[Northeastern University]], with [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], Director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Professor of Sociology, serving as editor-in-chief. In her inaugural editorial, Walters laid out five "core concerns" for ''Signs'': (1) for the field of women's studies to "substantively reckon" with [[Gender studies|gender and sexuality studies]] and [[queer studies]]; (2) to focus on "racial and ethnic difference"; (3) to re-emphasize "inter- or transdisciplinarity"; (4) to not lose sight of "the big questions about gender and sexuality" by getting too narrow in scope; and (5) to expand the journal's "digital presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/inaugural-editorial-thinking-and-doing-feminism/|title=Inaugural Editorial: Thinking and Doing Feminism|date=2014-12-08|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of ''Signs'' is explored extensively in Kelly Coogan-Gehr's 2011 book ''The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcJgAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Geopolitics+of+the+Cold+War+and+Narratives+of+Inclusion:+Excavating+a+Feminist+Archive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4prGtkuvVAhVJ2oMKHRciAeAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Geopolitics%20of%20the%20Cold%20War%20and%20Narratives%20of%20Inclusion:%20Excavating%20a%20Feminist%20Archive&amp;f=false|title=The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive|last=Coogan-Gehr|first=K.|date=2011-11-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230370555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coogan-Gehr uses ''Signs'' as a case study to complicate what she calls the "stock narrative of feminist field formation." She argues that dominant histories of the development of academic feminism, in focusing solely on the women's movement and other radical movements of the 1960s, fail to take into account the role of "changes the Cold War produced in higher education."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book, she calls ''Signs'' a "premier academic feminist journal."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Feminist Public Intellectuals Project (FPIP) ==
In 2015, ''Signs'' launched the [http://signsjournal.org/feminist-public-intellectuals-project/ Feminist Public Intellectuals Project], which seeks to engage feminist theorizing with pressing political and social problems via three open-access, online-first initiatives: [http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/ Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism,] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ Currents: Feminist Key Concepts and Controversies], and [http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/ Ask a Feminist.] Given the fragmentation of feminist activism and the persistent negative freighting of the term “feminist,” the Feminist Public Intellectuals Project seeks to reimagine what role a journal can play in provoking activism.

''Short Takes'' features commentaries by feminist activists and public intellectuals on recent books that "have shaped popular conversations about feminist issues," alongside a response by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/|title=Short Takes|date=2015-06-12|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured books include [[Roxane Gay|Roxane Gay's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/bad-feminist Bad Feminist]'', [[Rebecca Traister|Rebecca Traister's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/all-the-single-ladies/ All the Single Ladies]'', and [[Andi Zeisler|Andi Zeisler's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/zeisler/ We Were Feminists Once.]''

''Currents'' publishes essays that put forth "a nuanced and edgy take on a key issue circulating in the feminist definitional landscape."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Issues addressed include [http://signsjournal.org/currents-identity-politics/ "identity politics,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-trigger-warnings/ "trigger warnings,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-celebrity-feminism/ "celebrity feminism,"] and [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ "affirmative consent."]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/|title=Currents: Affirmative Consent|date=2015-11-02|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ask a Feminist'' is an interview series that seeks to create "conversation between and among feminist scholars, media activists, and community leaders," to bridge the divide between scholarship and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/|title=Ask a Feminist|date=2016-05-17|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent features include "[[Angela P. Harris]] on Gender and Gun Violence"[http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist-harris-farrell/] and "[[Cathy J. Cohen]] on [[Black Lives Matter]], Feminism, and Contemporary Activism."[http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist-cohen-jackson/]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/|title=Ask a Feminist|date=2016-05-17|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catharine R. Stimpson Prize ==
''Signs'' awards the Catharine R. Stimpson Prize for Outstanding Feminist Scholarship, named for the founding editor-in-chief of ''Signs,'' biennially to the best paper from an international competition of "emerging" feminist scholars (meaning "fewer than seven years since receipt of the terminal degree"). The submissions are judged by an international jury of prominent feminist academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/anna-hajkova-wins-2013-catharine-stimpson-prize-for-feminist-scholarship/|title=Anna Hájková Wins 2013 Catharine Stimpson Prize for Feminist Scholarship|date=2012-08-24|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners receive a $1,000 honorarium and have their papers published in ''Signs'''.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/for-authors/calls-for-papers/#stimpson|title=Calls for Papers|date=2012-08-21|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Singapore Sling: The Man Who Loved a Corpse''''' ({{lang-el|Singapore Sling: Ο Άνθρωπος που Αγάπησε ένα Πτώμα|italic=yes}}, [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] ''Singapore Sling: O Anthropos pou Agapise ena Ptoma'') is a 1990 Greek [[black and white]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] and regarded as his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]]. Considered a difficult film to label while still managing to develop something of a [[Cult film|cult]] following throughout the years nonetheless, it was shot in a bizarre manner somewhat resembling [[film noir]] or neo-noir and black comedy as well as the [[exploitation film|exploitation]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and crime genres mixed with some elements of eroticism and [[horror film|horror]] with sex being used as a power game and received a theatrical release in Greece on 6 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hardy|editor-first=Phil|editor-link=Phil Hardy (journalist)|year=1995|title=The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror|title-link=The Aurum Film Encyclopedia|volume=3|publisher=New York, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]|pages=478–479|isbn=0-87951-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/08/25/review-singapore-sling-a-man-in-love-with-a-corpse/|title=Review: ''Singapore Sling'' – A Man in Love with a Corpse|website=The Dreamin' Demon: Real Life Horror (Reviews: S)|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Nikolaidis' career as a film director in his home country which stretches to the early 1960s he was almost entirely unknown outside Greece before the early 1990s and is still less known outside it and it was only with this film, which has immediately achieved cult status, that international fame came to him and it probably still remains the film for which he is best known today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/06/22/singapore-sling-18-207547/|title=''Singapore Sling'' (18)|last=Rudd|first=Amy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=22 June 2008|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exemplified by the fact that it was released on DVD by [[Synapse Films]], the only one of Nikolaidis' films to so far receive a home video release in North America. The film was officially selected for screening at the Rimini Film Festival.

==Plot==
Two mentally ill women who are clearly suffering from not otherwise specified delusional disorders, a mother and a (grown) daughter, live together in a secluded mansion. They are in a relationship and both are recognised for their beauty. They spend their days playing perverse [[BDSM]]-related incestuous games in memory of their [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] patriarch who, when he was still alive, raped his daughter when she was eleven, murdered several servants, and is now a mummified corpse with which the daughter is shown having sex. They occasionally kill their servants and bury their bodies in the garden.

When first glimpsed the psychotic mother-daughter protagonists, half-dressed, are burying their disemboweled chauffeur into a pit, they have just finished to dig in their backyard on a dark and stormy night with thunder and heavy rain. They lay down their shovels and drag out of the bushes, his fresh corpse. He was killed in one of their usual games combining incestuous sex with murder. Shortly after this and at first unnoticed by the two women, a lovesick detective pulls his car up to the residence. He is suffering from a painful bullet wound and an equally painful yearning to track down Laura, his long-missing beloved for whom he has been searching for three years and about whom it is known that she has visited the area. What he does not yet know is that he has stumbled onto the lair of two profoundly insane women who have already lured Laura into their home and brutally killed her (in the process decorating their kitchen with her viscera, as a flashback helpfully shows). It is also revealed that the daughter is physically very similar to Laura and is desperately looking for a man's companionship. 

The duo then easily take the seriously wounded and bleeding detective, having already figured them out to be responsible for Laura's kidnapping, into their home, essentially kidnapping him. As the exhausted detective was silent and apparently refuses to speak, even in order to state his own name, the two women christen him 'Singapore Sling', after they discover a recipe in his pocket notebook for that type of [[Singapore Sling|cocktail]]. They use him as a pawn in their sexually tinged [[Sexual roleplay|role-playing games]] and as a party to their distorted and perverse form of entertainment, during which Singapore Sling, now a prisoner, is tied up, chained to a bed, vomited on, electrocuted, used as a sex slave, and subjected to various other forms of torture and atrocities in which he is forced to participate. However, as Singapore Sling's confinement wears on he regains his strength and takes a more active role in the games. His deranged captors become concerned and alarmed when a sharp kitchen knife, belonging to the late father, goes missing and they discover Singapore Sling digging a deep hole in their backyard. As psychotic as these two are, they are still lucid enough to recognize that a killing is imminent, if not two or even three. In an atmosphere of decadence and dark madness, the characters gradually sink into the depths of their subconscious mind.

A few days later, the daughter decides that she is fed up with having to suffer under the yoke of maternal authority, and, together with Singapore Sling, murders her mother. Singapore Sling then takes what up until now used to be the mother's role in the sexual games. However, during one of these games, a reenactment of Laura's murder, he stabs the daughter, playing Laura, with the aforementioned missing kitchen knife now attached to his penis. The daughter, while bleeding to death, shoots Singapore Sling and then he goes out to the garden and falls into the pit which he himself had recently dug. The film hence ends, in short, with all three characters dead.

==Themes==
The film's protagonist's search for a woman named Laura is a direct reference to the classic [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) by American director [[Otto Preminger]]. The film uses as background music, in addition to classical music by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], the compositions used by [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Julie London]] in ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).

==Reception==
Director [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] said the following about this film's reception during an interview: "When I was shooting ''Singapore Sling'', I was under the impression that I was making a comedy with elements taken from Ancient Greek Tragedy... Later, when some European and American critics characterized it as 'one of the most disturbing films of all times,' I started to feel that something was wrong with me. Then, when British censors banned its release in England, I finally realized that something is wrong with all of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cult-cinema.ru/reviews/s/singapore_sling/|script-title=ru:''Singapore Sling''/''Сингапурский Слинг'' (1990)|last=Меренков|first=Сергей|date=21 December 2007|website=CULT Cinema: Рецензин, S|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic neo-psychedelia band [[Singapore Sling (band)|Singapore Sling]] is named after the film. As the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson explained in a June 2003 interview with Belgium's [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: "We had a first gig. It was booked and we didn't have a name and I had been looking for a film called ''Singapore Sling'' for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere. It sounded cool, so that became the name of the band. It's some kind of dark, perverse [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] film from 1990. I haven't found it yet, so if you know someone who has it, please let me know. I hope it's good. A dark perverse noir film and a guy who has sex with a corpse. And he's called Singapore Sling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cucamonga.be/interviews/SingaporeSling0603.htm|title=Singapore Sling – ''The Curse of Singapore Sling''|date=16 June 2003|website=Cucamonga Fansite/[[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: Interviews, S|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921123939/http://www.cucamonga.be/interviews/SingaporeSling0603.htm|archivedate=21 September 2005|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, after the completion of his last film ''[[The Zero Years]]'', a tale of [[perversion]] and [[dominance and submission|sexual dominance]] which failed to replicate the earlier success of ''Singapore Sling'', Nikolaidis declared his intention to stop making movies in order to deal with music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemainfo.gr/directors/interviews/nikosnikolaidis/index.html|script-title=el:Κουράστηκα να κάνω ταινίες: Μια συνέντευξη σε πρώτο ενικό.

'''Smarthistory''' is a free resource for the study of [[art history]] created by art historians Beth Harris and Steven Zucker.

According to the Smarthistory about page:
{{quote|We are interested in delivering the narratives of art history using the read-write web's interactivity and capacity for authoring and remixing. Publishers are adding multimedia to their textbooks, but unfortunately they are doing so in proprietary, password-protected adjunct websites.

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''solar cycle''' is a 28-year cycle of the [[Julian calendar]] with respect to the [[week]]. It occurs because [[leap years]] occur every 4 years and there are 7 possible days to start a [[leap year]], making a 28-year sequence.

This cycle also occurs in the [[Gregorian calendar]], but it is interrupted by years such as 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500, which are divisible by four but which are [[common years]]. This interruption has the effect of skipping 16 years of the solar cycle between February 28 and March 1. Because the Gregorian cycle of 400 years has exactly 146,097 days, i.e. exactly 20,871 weeks, one can say that the Gregorian so-called solar cycle lasts 400 years.

Calendar years are usually marked by [[Dominical letter]]s indicating the first [[Sunday]] in a new year, thus the term solar cycle can also refer to a repeating sequence of Dominical letters.

Unless a year is not a leap year due to Gregorian exceptions, a sequence of calendars is reused every 28 years.

The name ''solar cycle'' comes from ''Sunday'', the traditional [[week|first day of the week]].

====Dominical letter====

'''Stepan Yosypovych Smal-Stotsky''' ({{lang|uk|Степан Смаль-Стоцький}}) was a Ukrainian linguist and academician, [[slavist]], cultural and political figure, member of the [[Union for the Liberation of Ukraine]], and ambassador of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] in [[Prague]].

His doctorate on Slavic philology accepted [[Franc Miklošič]] at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1885.

Smal-Stotsky is a father of [[Roman Smal-Stocki]] and a grandfather of [[George S. N. Luckyj]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18069">In [[legend]] and in the early [[historiography of Switzerland]] there is an account of a migration of a population of [[Swedes]] and [[Frisians]] settling in the [[Swiss Alps]], specifically in [[Schwyz]] and in [[Oberhasli|Hasli]] (''Schwedensage'').

==Medieval legend==
The legend is discussed in Ericus Olai's ''[[Chronica regni Gothorum]]'' (c. 1470).  Olai notes that the Swiss (''Svitenses'') claimed to be descended from "[[Gothicismus|Swedes or Goths]]". Olai also notes the similarity in toponymy, ''Swycia, quasi Suecia''. This is reflected in a  late-15th-century gloss from [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]]  reading  ''Suecia, alias Helvicia, inde Helvici, id est Suetones.''&lt;ref&gt;
The gloss dates to the late 15th century, and there has been some debate on the  possibility of its being influenced by Olai. See Marchal (1976), p. 65: "Die sog. Reichenauer Glosse (''Suecia alias Helvetia, inde Helvici, id est Suetones''), die als Beleg für den Anfang des 15 . Jh. von Ernst Ludwig Rochholz, Tell und Gessler, Heilbronn 1877, S. 69, und Vetter, Sage, S.6, angeführt wurde, entstammt einer Papierhandschrift von Ende des 15. Jahrhundert; vgl. schon Franz Joseph Mone, Anzeiger für Kunde der teutschen Vorzeit 3 (1834), 346. QW III 2/2 S. 17 Anm. 35"&lt;/ref&gt;

A near-contemporary record is that of [[Petermann Etterlin]], who wrote  in the 1470s (printed as ''[[Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation]]'' in 1507).
Etterlin telling the legend refers to "the Swedes, who are now called the Switzer" (''die Schwediger, so man yetz nempt Switzer'') presents an [[eponymous founder]],  one ''Suit'' (''Swit, Schwyt, Switer''), leader of the migrating Swedes, who  defeated his brother   ''Scheyg'' in single combat in a dispute over leadership of the new settlement.
He gives an account of their decision to settle on the site of [[Schwyz]]:&lt;ref&gt;Vetter (1877),[https://archive.org/stream/ueberdiesagevond00vett#page/10/mode/2up p. 10f].&lt;/ref&gt;

|''Also zugent sy gegen hôchen tütschen landen zuo, und kâment in gegne nit ferr  von dem vinstren walde, das man yetz nennet zuo unser frowen zuo Einsidlen. Dâ  liessent sy sich nider in einem tal heisset Brunnen, dâ gar nützet was anders dann ein hüpsche  wilde, und was keine wonung nyenâ dâselbs umb, dann ein hüssle, dâ einer inne sass, der des fars wartet (dann es ist alwegen ein strâss und ein far daselbs gewesen): dâ wolttentz mornendes über sê gefaren sin, und dannent hin über die pirg und den Gotthart gen Rôm zuo. Alsô stuond in der nacht ein grûssamlicher ungehürer wind uff, des gelîchen vormâlen nyemer gesechen worden was, umb des willen sy nit ab stat komen möchtent. Dô giengent sy in den welden hin und har, besâhent die landtschaft und fundent dâ hübsch holz, frisch guot brunnen und ein toügenlîch gelegenheit, die, als sy bedûcht, wann es erbûwen wêr, irem lande in Swêden nit unglîch, und wurdent ye mit ein andren ze rât, dass sy da selbs wolten verharren und ein botschafft hinweg schicken, Soliche gegne und wilde von dem Riche ze entpfachent, als ouch beschach.''
|"So they travelled towards Upper Germany, and came to a land not far from the dark forest that is now known as [[Einsiedeln Abbey|Our Lady of Einsiedeln]]. There they settled in a valley called [[Brunnen]], where there was nothing but a handsome wilderness, and there was no habitation anywhere around that place, other than a cottage, where one lived who was taking care of the ferry (as there had always been a road and a ferry in that place): there they planned to cross the [[Lake Lucerne|lake]] in the morning, and from there across the mountains and [[Gotthard Pass]] towards Rome. But during the night a cruel and terrible wind rose, such as had never been seen before, because of which they could not move from the place. So they went walking to and fro in the woods and looked at the landscape, and they found there handsome woods, fresh and good wells and a suitable situation that, as they thought, if it would be cultivated would be not unlike their own lands in Sweden, and they agreed among themselves that they would dwell in that place and send a messenger asking to receive these lands and wilderness as [[Reich|imperial]] fief, as did in fact happen."

Etterlin's account is  supposedly based on a "common Swiss chronicle" (''Gesta Suitensium'', ''gemeine Schwyzerchronik'') also reflected in the [[White Book of Sarnen]], Heinrich von Gundelfingen (''Das Herkommen der Schwyzer und Oberhasler''&lt;ref&gt;''Das Herkommen der Schwyzer und Oberhasle'' is now generally attributed to Heinrich von Gundelfingen, whereas older authors attributed it to [[Elogius Kiburger]].
Hungerbühler (1871) attributed it to [[Johannes Fründ]], dating it to c. 1440.
Hugo Hungerbühler, ''[Vom Herkommen der Schwyzer: Eine wiederaufgefundene Schrift aus dem XV. Jahrhundert, mit Erläuterungen und kritischen Untersuchungen'' (1871). The attribution to Fründ is due to [[Aegidius Tschudi]], a claim that is reviewed and accepted by Hungerbühler ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=JfwuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 pp. 51&amp;ndash;70]).&lt;/ref&gt;) and later by [[Aegidius Tschudi]] (''Die  Geschichte der Ostfriesen, Swedier und andre, so mit jnen gereisset, vnd wie Switer dem Lande  den Namen Swiz gegeben''). 
Etterlin presents the three ''[[Waldstätte]]n'' as representing three different stocks or races, the people of Schwyz as the most recent immigrants (from Sweden), the people of Uri representing the original "[[Migration period|Goths and Huns]]", and the people of [[Unterwalden]] representing "[[Gallo-Roman|the Romans]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vetter (1877),[https://archive.org/stream/ueberdiesagevond00vett#page/10/mode/2up p. 10].
[[Martin Zeiller]] in 1642 reports Unterwalden as divided in two separate [[Talschaft]]en the inhabitants of which were derived from separate races, those of Obwalden from the "[[Gallo-Roman|Romans]]", those in Nidwalden from the "[[Cimbri]]" (viz. [[Alemanni|Germans]]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrich von Gundelfingen gives an elaborate version of the legend, stating the emigration from Sweden and Frisia was due to a famine, which was met by king "Cisbertus of Sweden" by a decree that every month, the lot should be drawn and one in ten men would be forced to emigrate with all his family and possessions. Heinrich is the origin of the figures of 6,000 Swedes and 1,200 Frisians taking part in the migration with a certain ''Suicerus'' as their leader.

The legend is also mentioned by [[Albrecht von Bonstetten]], a monk in Einsiedeln abbey, in 1479 (''Superius Germanie Confederationis descriptio''). In this version, the toponym ''Schwyz'' derives from a Swedish founder named ''Switerus''.&lt;ref&gt;'A Svedia igitur Svitenses vocati vel eo, quod ex ductoribus eorum unis appelatus fuit Switerus, qui fratrem suum (ut asserunt) naturalem in duello pro nomine ipso interfecit'. Viktor Wiebel, [http://retro.seals.ch/digbib/view?pid=mhv-001:1972:65::173 'Suittes - Schwyz - Schweiz. Geschichte und Deutung des Namens Schwyz'], in ''Mitteilungen des historischen Vereins des Kantons Schwyz'' 65 (1972), pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigismund Meisterlin]] (d. 1488) in his  ''Chronicon Norimbergense'' claims the people of Schwyz as descendants of the Huns, with a leader called ''Swifter'' ruling the valley, while his brother ''Senner'' ruled the high pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel (1972), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Records from the early 16th century confirm that the tradition was in fact part of local folklore (and not the result of learned etymological speculation); in an ''Urner [[Tellenspiel]]'' performed between 1511 and 1525, the identification of  Gothic and Hunnic  ancestry of Uri,  Roman  ancestry of Unterwalden and Swedish ancestry
of Schwyz,&lt;ref&gt;''Woher die von Schwytz entsprungen? Aus Schweden seind dieselben kommen.'' Vetter (1877), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
and for the [[Landsgemeinde]] of Schwyz in 1531 we have the record of a performance of an ''Andacht der Altvorderen'' (remembrance of the forefathers) in memory of the ''Austreibung aus Schweden'' (eviction from Sweden) in times of famine.&lt;ref&gt;Vetter (1877), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The saga is also reflected in early-16th-century [[Friesland|Frisian]] chronicles such as the ''Tractatus Alvinus'', Jancko Douwama's ''Boeck der Partijen'' and subsequent writings, as well as in the biography of the [[condottiere]] Wilwolt von Schaumberg from [[Thuringia]], who led the conquest of Frisia by [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert of Saxony]] in 1498.&lt;ref&gt;A. Campbell, ''Thet Freske Riim. Tractatus Alvini'', The Hague 1952. [http://images.tresoar.nl/wumkes/pdf/DouwamaJancko_Geschriften.pdf ''Jancko Douwama's geschriften: Boeck der partijen''], Leeuwarden 1849, p. 52. Ludwig von Eyb, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Omw4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 ''Die Geschichten und Taten Wilwolts von Schaumburg''], ed. A. von Keller, Stuttgart 1859, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; According to the latter, 'the Frisians, when they write to each other, even nowadays, call the Swiss "son" and the Swiss call the Frisians "cousin".'

The first critical evaluation of the story is that of [[Aegidius Tschudi|Tschudi]] in 1570, who is unsure if he should reject the account of Kiburger wholesale, or if the tradition might have a historical source in the [[Cimbri]] of 114 BC (unlike his 19th-century successors, Tschudi does not consider the possibility of a Viking Age migration).

==Early Modern reception==
Once the legend had been written down in the late 15th century [[Swiss chronicles]] it became a standard topos of the early modern [[historiography of Switzerland]]. 
The legend did remain current in the folklore of Schwyz and Hasli in the 19th century, no doubt reinforced by historiographical and literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;on the point of the feedback of written historiography into oral tradition see Marchal (1976), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Schiller's ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' (1804) makes reference to the legend (act 2, scene 2), in the voice of ''[[Werner Stauffacher|Stauffacher]]''. The [[Brothers Grimm]] included the legend in their ''[[Deutsche Sagen]]'' of 1818 (nr. 514 ''Auswanderung der Schweizer''), and [[Ludwig Bechstein]] in his ''Deutsches Sagenbuch'' (1853) includes it as nr. 2 '' Des Schweizervolkes Ursprung ''). 
In Sweden, Uppsala historian Jakob Ek published an account of the legend in  ''De Colonia Suecorum in Helvetiam egressa''   (1797).

[[Johannes von Müller]] in 1780  accepted that the foundational 
population of Schwyz was a separate race (i.e. separate from that of Uri and Unterwalden) and argued that this was still visible in the "exceptionally handsome" population of [[Oberhasli]] and the neighbouring [[Bernese Oberland]] as well as of [[Entlebuch]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Schweizer Geschichte'' part I (1780), p. 419. "Sie waren ein besonderer Stamm und können nach so langer Zeit am besten in dem vorzüglich schönen Volk zu  Oberhasli, in dem benachbarten Oberlande und an den Entlibuchern erkannt werden."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Johann Georg Kohl]] (1849) also described the physiology of the people of Oberhasli as being of the Scandinavian type, as "remarkably tall, strong and blond".
&lt;ref&gt;
''Man beschreibt die Oberhasler gewöhnlich als auffallend grosse, langgewachsene, starke und blondhaarige Leute und bringt auch dies mit ihrer schwedischen Abkunft in Verbindung. ...  Ganz Merkwürdig ist es, dass die Kirche in Meiringen ähnlich gebaut ist, wie die Kirchen in Nordfriesland und Skandinavien. Ihr Thurm steht nämlich neben der Kirche, ganz von dem Gebäude derselben isolirt.'' 
''Alpenreisen'' (1849), cited after [http://www.jungfrauzeitung.ch/artikel/?cq_*61c4e181=ivxPU=879870g7 jungfrauzeitung.ch]  16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his ''History of the Swedes'' (1832&amp;ndash;36) notes that the legend was now limited to the population of ''Haslidale'' but had once also been generally believed by the people of Schwyz. In this version, the Swedes march from a place called ''Hasle'' on the banks of the [[Rhine]], defeating a  [[Franks|Frankish]] army on the way, and settle in the alpine valleys because the landscape reminded them of their own country.
Geijer adds his opinion that the events would fall into the "age of the northern expeditions" (i.e. the [[Viking Age]]) of the 9th century. He cites a Viking Age chronicle which relates that in 861 a Viking expedition ascended the Mosel and wintered in a fortified camp at a place called ''Haslow'', defeated a Frankish army and moved onward pillaging along the Rhine.
Geijer equates this expedition with one mentioned in ''[[Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (disambiguation)|Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar]]'', in which the sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]] participated, advancing as far as ''Wiflisburg'' ([[Avenches]]) in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Turner (trans.) ''The History of the Swedes, by Eric Gustave Geijer'', 1845,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VulAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA15  p. 15].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, [[Johann Georg Kohl]] travelled to Hasli, describing both its natural landscape and its population. Kohl recorded a tradition  telling of a march of 6,000 [[Frisians]] and [[Swedish people|Swedes]] exiled from their homes by a famine. The names of the leaders of the immigrating Swedes is reported as ''Restius'' and ''Hastus''. Kohl describes the architecture of the [[Meiringen]] church as reminiscent of North Frisian and Scandinavian types.&lt;ref&gt;
''Der Glaube an ihre Abstammung von den Schweden ist unter den Oberhaslern ganz allgemein. Und da mir an dieser uns leider so unwahrscheinlich überlieferten Sage eben jener allgemein im Volte verbreitete Glaube das Merkwürdigste ist, so will ich über diesen Punkt noch einige Beobachtungen, die ich machte, mittheilen. Nicht nur jeder Prediger und Gelehrte in diesen Gegenden weiss von dieser Sage, die dahin geht, dass zur Zeit einer Hungersnoth (das Jahr Christi kennt man nicht) 6000 Schweden und Friesen sich den Rhein hinauf gekämpft und nach der Erreichung der hiesigen Bergthäler, die ihrem Vaterlande so ähnlich gesehen, hier fixirt hätten – sondern auch fast alle Bauern glauben selbst daran.''
...
''Das Volk von Hasli trägt sich sogar noch täglich mit den Namen der ersten Anführer der Schweden herum. Sie sollen Restius und Hastus geheissen haben. Bei jenen 6000 Schweden, die einen Grafen Peter von Franken am Rhein besiegten, die daher allerfrühestens doch erst am Anfange des Mittelalters kommen konnten, begreift man nicht, wie sie sich ohne gewaltige Kämpfe, von denen die Geschichte uns gewiss einige Kunde aufbewahrt hätte, in den Besitz der jener damals längst bewohnten Thäler, die ihnen zugeschrieben werden, setzen konnten.''

The Hasli legend was received in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]], with e.g. Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschläger]] publishing a poem ''Haslidalen'' in 1849.

'''Tartu''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈtɑrtˑu|est}}, [[South Estonian]]: ''Tarto'') is the second largest city of [[Estonia]], after Estonia's political and financial capital [[Tallinn]].

Tartu is often considered the intellectual centre of the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlandia.de/en/tourism-estonia/cities/tartu.html Tartu – the intellectual centre of Estonia] estlandia.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bousfield ''The Rough Guide to Estonia, Latvia &amp; Lithuania''.

The city also houses the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]], the Ministry of Education and Research, and the new building of the [[Estonian National Museum]], opened to the public in October 2016.

It is also the birthplace of [[Estonian Song Festival]]s.

Situated {{convert|186|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of Tallinn and 245 kilometres (152 miles) northeast of Riga, Tartu lies on the [[Emajõgi]] ("Mother river"), which connects the two largest lakes of Estonia. The city is served by [[Tartu Airport]].

{{see also|Names of Tartu in different languages}}
Since 1918, the Estonian name ''Tartu'' has been used, but as the town has come under control of various rulers throughout its history, there have been various names for it in different languages.  Most of them derive ultimately from the earliest attested form, the Estonian ''Tarbatu''.  In German, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] the town has been known and is sometimes still referred to as {{Audio|De-Dorpat.ogg|'''Dorpat'''}}, a variant of ''Tarbatu''.  In Russian, the city has been known as {{lang|ru|Юрьев}} (''Yur′yev'', after [[Yury|Yuri]], the [[baptismal name]] of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]]) and as {{lang|ru|Дерпт}} (''Derpt'', from the [[Low German]] variant of ''Dorpat''). Similarly, the city has been known as ''Tērbata'' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], while [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speakers use the toponym ''Tartto''.

===Beginnings===

Archaeological evidence of the first permanent settlement on the site of modern Tartu dates to as early as the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583793/Tartu |title=Tartu |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäesalu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirp.ee/archive/2001/12.10.01/Sots/sots1-6.html |title=Vene kroonikate Jurjev oli tõenäoliselt siiski Tartu|first=Ain|last=Mäesalu |publisher=[[Sirp]] |date=12 October 2001 |language=Estonian |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 7th century, local inhabitants had built a wooden fortification on the east side of Toome Hill (''Toomemägi'').&lt;ref name="Mäesalu"/&gt;

The first documented record of the area was made in 1030 by chroniclers of [[Kievan Rus]]. [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], Prince of [[Kiev]], invaded the region that year, built his own fort there, and named it ''Yuryev''&lt;ref name="Mäesalu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tvauri|first1=Andres|title=The Migration Period, Pre-Viking Age, and Viking Age in Estonia|date=2012|pages=33, 59, 60|url=https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Publications/Display/b80b6f11-43ed-4b8c-b616-48ac53b70ec5?language=ENG|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "Yury's" – Yury (a Russified form of ''George'') being Yaroslav's Christian name). Kievan rulers then collected tribute from the surrounding ancient Estonian county of [[Ugaunia]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} possibly until 1061, when, according to chronicles, Yuryev was burned down by Estonian tribe called ''Sosols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mäesalu|first1=Ain|title=Could Kedipiv in East-Slavonic Chronicles be Keava hill fort?|journal=Estonian Journal of Archaeology|date=2012|volume=1|page=199|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/Archaeology/2012/sup_vol_1/arhe-keava-2012-195-200.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kievan Rus' again controlled Tartu from 1133 for an unknown period, possibly up to 1176/1177.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartu.ee/?lang_id=1&amp;menu_id=6&amp;page_id=83 |title=Tartu orduajal |first=Otto|last=Freymuth |year=1927 |language=Estonian |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century Tartu was the most notable Slavic settlement in Chud territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/120239/%D0%AE%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2 |script-title=ru:Юрьев уездный город Лифляндской губернии |publisher=Dic.academic.ru |date=14 March 1957 |language=Russian |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonian amateur historian [[Enn Haabsaar]] speculates that the "Yuryev" mentioned in this context is actually [[Bila Tserkva]], Ukraine, a town that was also founded by Yaroslav I the Wise as Yuriev about the same time, 1032.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirp.ee/2001/21.09.01/Sots/sots1-4.html Haabsaar, E.

During the period of [[Northern Crusades]] in the beginning of the 13th century the fort of ''Tarbatu'' (or ''Tharbata'', Tartu) was captured by the crusading [[Livonian Knights]] — also known as the [[Brothers of the Sword]] (German: ''Schwertbrüder'') — and recaptured by Estonians on several occasions. In 1224, after Ugaunia had recognized the supremacy of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] princes who sent additional troops led by prince [[Vyachko]] of [[Koknese|Kukenois]] to the fort, it was [[Siege of Tartu (1224)|besieged and conquered]] for one last time by the German crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti Selart]], [[Ivar Leimus]], [[Linda Kaljundi]], [[Heiki Valk]]. ''Ristiretked ja vallutussõjad 13. sajandi Liivimaal'', in "Eesti ajalugu II. Eesti keskaeg." Editor Anti Selart. Tartu 2012. Pp. 52—53&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, known as Dorpat (Latin: ''Tarbatum''), Tartu became a commercial centre of considerable importance during the later [[Middle Ages]] and the capital of the semi-independent [[Bishopric of Dorpat]].

In 1262 the army of Prince [[Dmitri of Pereslavl]], son of [[Alexander Nevsky]] launched an assault on Dorpat, capturing and destroying the town. His troops did not manage to capture the bishop's fortress on Toome Hill. The event was recorded both in German and [[Old East Slavic]] chronicles, which also provided the first record of a settlement of German merchants and artisans which had arisen alongside the bishop's fortress.

In medieval times, after the Livonian Order was subsumed into the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1236, the town became an important trading city. In the 1280s Dorpat joined the [[Hanseatic League]]. As in all of Estonia and Latvia, the largely [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking]] nobility, but in Tartu/Dorpat (as in Tallinn) even more so, the Baltic German bourgeoisie, the ''literati'', dominated culture, religion, architecture, education, and politics until the late 19th century. For example, the town hall of Dorpat was designed by an architect from [[Rostock]] in [[Mecklenburg]], while the university buildings were designed by Johann Wilhelm Krause, another German. Many, if not most, of the students, and more than 90 percent of the faculty members were of German descent, and numerous statues of notable scholars with German names can still be found in Tartu today. Most Germans left during the first half of the 20th century, in particular as part of the ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' program of the Nazis, following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939.

===Swedish and Polish rule===

[[File:Tartu Ülikooli peahoone 2012.jpg|thumb|left|University of Tartu main building.]]
In 1558, tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] invaded Tartu beginning the [[Livonian War]]. Forces under the command of Pyotr Shuiski encircled the town and began heavy bombardment. In light of this and without any prospect of external help the town surrendered. The local bishop was imprisoned in Moscow, which effectively ended the period of local self-government. In the effect of the [[Truce of Jam Zapolski]] of 1582 the city along with southern regions of [[Livonian Confederation]] became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In 1598 it became the capital of the [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] of the [[Duchy of Livonia (1561–1621)|Duchy of Livonia]]. A [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[grammar school]] "Gymnasium Dorpatense" was established in 1583. In addition, a translators' seminary was organized in Tartu and the city received its red and white flag from the Polish king [[Stephen Báthory]].

The activities of both the grammar school and the seminary were stopped by the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–11)|Polish–Swedish War]]. Already in late 1600 the forces of [[Charles IX of Sweden]] besieged the city defended by three [[Chorągiew (military unit)|banners]] of [[reiter]]s and the city's burghers. Despite repeated assaults, the Swedes could not enter the city. Finally in 1601 Capt. Hermann Wrangel switched sides, assaulted the [[castellan]] and opened the gates for the Swedish forces. The town was retaken by Poland on 13 April 1603 following a brief siege led by [[hetman]] [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]]; roughly 1000 Swedish soldiers surrendered and were escorted to [[Tallinn]].

In the effect of yet another [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–29)|Polish-Swedish War]], in 1625 Tartu was once again captured by Sweden, this time for good. In the effect of the 1629 [[Truce of Altmark]] the city became part of the [[Dominions of Sweden]], which led to the foundation of the [[University of Tartu]] in 1632 by king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]].

===Imperial Russia===

[[File:Album von Dorpat, TKM 0031H 06, crop.jpg|left|thumb|The Stone Bridge and the Old Town in 1860]]
In 1704 the town was taken by Russian army in the presence of tsar Peter the Great himself. As a result, around a quarter of the town and much of the fortifications were damaged. In 1708 the remainder of the fortifications and houses, including the remains of bishops castle, were blown up, all movable property was looted and all citizens deported to Russia. With the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, the city became part of the [[Russian Empire]] and was known as ''Derpt''. Fires in the 18th century destroyed much of the medieval architecture, the [[Great Fire of Tartu]] in 1775 removed most of the buildings in the centre. The city was rebuilt along [[Baroque architecture|Late Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] lines including the [[Tartu Town Hall]] which was built between 1782 and 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tartu.ee/?lang_id=2&amp;menu_id=9&amp;page_id=1417 The Town Hall of Tartu], tartu.ee, retrieved 27 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, Tartu was the cultural centre for Estonians in the era of [[Romantic nationalism]]. The city hosted Estonia's first [[Estonian Song Festival|song festival]] in 1869. ''[[Vanemuine]]'', the first national theatre, was established in 1870. Tartu was also the setting for the foundation of the Society of Estonian Writers in 1872.
[[File:Tartu Raekoda 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tartu Town Hall]]]]
[[Tartu railway station]] was opened in 1876 when [[Tapa, Estonia|Tapa]]–Tartu route was built. The station building was opened in 1877.

In 1893, the city was officially retitled to the ancient Russian name ''Yuryev''. The university was subsequently [[Russification|russified]] from 1895 on with the introduction of compulsory Russian in teaching. Much of the university property was relocated to [[Voronezh]] in 1918 and during the German occupation the University worked under the name Landesuniversität Dorpat. During the [[Estonian War of Independence]] university of Tartu was re-opened as an Estonian language university on 1 December 1919.

With Estonian independence after World War I, the city officially became known by the [[Estonian language|Estonian]] name ''Tartu''. At the end of [[Estonian War of Independence]] following World War I, a peace treaty between the [[Bolsheviks]] and Estonia was signed on 2 February 1920 in Tartu ([[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]]). The treaty meant that [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] renounced territorial claims to Estonia "for all time". However, as a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] of 1939, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia and Tartu in 1940.

[[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Peace treaty between Soviet Russia and Finland]] was also signed in Tartu in 1920.

During the interwar period [[Tähtvere]] neighbourhood was built, former [[Raadi Manor]] buildings started to house [[Estonian National Museum]] (destroyed during [[Tartu Offensive]] in 1944) and art school [[Pallas (art school)|Pallas]] was opened.

===Soviet period===

During World War II, a large part of the city as well as the historical ''Kivisild'' (Stone Bridge) (built by [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1776–1778) over the [[Emajõgi]] river were destroyed by the retreating Soviet Army, partly in 1941 and almost completely in 1944 by then retreating German Army. Already heavily damaged Tartu was bombed by Soviet forces on 27 January 1943, 26 February 1944, 7–8 March 1944, and 25–26 March 1944. After the war ended, much of the historical downtown area was left in ruins. Even the less damaged buildings in entire city blocks were torn down by the order of the occupational authorities and large swaths of land turned into public parks.

After the war, Tartu was declared a "closed town" to foreigners, as an air base for bombers was constructed on [[Raadi Airfield]], in the northeast outskirts of the city. It was one of the biggest military air bases in Eastern Europe and housed intercontinental fighters, that carried nuclear bombs. The location itself was where the Estonian 2nd Air Division was situated prior to the Soviet occupation. The asphalt runway there now houses a large used cars market, and is sometimes used for automotive racing.

[[Tartu Airport]] was opened in south of city in 1946. Besides the airport [[Estonian Aviation Academy]] was established in 1993 and [[Estonian Aviation Museum]] was opened to the public in 2002.
During Soviet times the population of Tartu almost doubled from 57,000 to 100,000, partly due to mass [[immigration]] from other areas of the Soviet Union.

===Modern era===

Since Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the old town centre is being renovated. Notably, [[St. John's Church, Tartu|St. John's Church]], in ruins since World War II, has been restored.

Many new commercial and business buildings have been erected (Tartu Shopping Center, Tasku, Emajõe Commercial Center, Lõunakeskus, Kvartal etc.). Highest residential building and local landmark [[Tigutorn]] was opened in 2008.

Science center [[AHHAA]] relocated to a new building in 2011 and [[Estonian National Museum]], the new main building was opened in 2016.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Tartu lies within the temperate [[humid continental climate]] zone. The climate is rather mild considering the high latitude, largely due to the proximity of the Baltic Sea and warm airflows from the Atlantic. Nevertheless, continental influence can be felt on hot summer days and cold spells in winter, when temperature can occasionally (but rarely) drop below {{convert|-30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Generally, summers are cool to warm and winters are cold.

==Government==

There are 49 members on the town council, elected by residents every four years using a proportional system of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartu.ee/?lang_id=1&amp;menu_id=2&amp;page_id=97 |title=Tartu Linnavolikogu liikmete nimekiri |publisher=Tartu.ee |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive branch of the town government consists of a mayor and five deputy mayors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartu.ee/?lang_id=1&amp;menu_id=2&amp;page_id=164 |title=Linnavalitsuse koosseis |publisher=Tartu.ee |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current mayor is [[Urmas Klaas]]. [[Andrus Ansip]], [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] from 2005 to 2014, was mayor of Tartu from 1998 to 2004. The position was later served by other politicians who eventually became ministers of government, [[Laine Randjärv|Laine Jänes]] and [[Urmas Kruuse]]. All of them are members of the [[Estonian Reform Party]], which has dominated in Tartu since 1998.

==Economy==

Mostly known as a university town, Tartu is also a site of heavy industry. The food industry has traditionally been important for the town's economy and some bigger companies in the field include [[A. Le Coq]], [[Tartu Mill]] and [[Salvest]]. [[Kroonpress]] is the leading printing press company the Baltic States.

In the beginning of the 21st century, many [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] enterprises and other high-tech companies have taken a foothold in Tartu. Notable examples include [[Playtech]] Estonia, [[Nortal]] (formerly Webmedia Group), [[ZeroTurnaround]], Tarkon, Reach-U and Raintree Estonia. [[Skype]] has an office in Tartu. The university is one of the largest employers, which explains the large proportion of highly skilled professionals – researchers, professors, doctors, and [[Tartu University Clinic]] has been considered the largest employer of Tartu.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Education and culture==

The city is best known for being home to the [[University of Tartu]], founded under King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632. Mainly for this reason, Tartu is also – tongue-in-cheek – known as "[[Athens]] of the Emajõgi" or as "[[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] of the North".

Tartu is also the seat of the [[Estonian University of Life Sciences]], the [[Baltic Defence College]], [[Estonian Aviation Academy]] (formerly known as Tartu Aviation College), and the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research. Other notable institutions include the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]] (re-established in Tartu in autumn 1993), the [[Estonian Historical Archives]], [[Estonian National Museum]], [[Estonian Sports Museum]] as well as the oldest and renowned theatre in the country, [[Vanemuine]], where they have a well-respected ballet company as well as theatre, opera and musical productions.

In music, there exists the [[Tartu school of composition]].

Most of the sculptures in Tartu are dedicated to historical figures. Among them the most famous are the [[Barclay de Tolly monument]] on the [[Barclay Square]] in downtown, the [[Kissing students]] monument on the town hall square and [[Gustav II Adolf]]´s monument on the [[Kuningaplats]].

==Science==

Tartu has been an intellectual centre of both Estonia and Baltic countries for several centuries. Scholars hailing from Tartu include the pioneer of embryology [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], a pioneer of animal behaviour studies [[Jakob von Uexküll]], and a cultural theorist and semiotician [[Juri Lotman]]. Nobel Chemistry Prize laureate [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] studied and worked in Tartu. [[Tartu School]] is one of the leading scientific schools in the field of [[semiotics]].

==Main sights==

{{double image|left|Tartu-Jaani-church-2012-06 3.png|230|Tartu St Johns church interior.jpg|200|St. John's Church|Interior}}
The architecture and city planning of historical Tartu mainly go back to the pre-independence period, with Germans forming the upper and middle classes of society, and therefore contributing many architects, professors and local politicians.

Most notable are the old [[Lutheran]] [[St. John's Church, Tartu|St. John's Church]] ({{lang-et|Jaani Kirik}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Johanneskirche}}), the 18th-century [[Tartu Town Hall|town hall]], the university building, ruins of the 13th-century [[Tartu Cathedral|cathedral]], the botanical gardens, the main shopping street, many buildings around the town hall square and [[Barclay Square]].

The historical slum area called Supilinn (''Soup Town'') is located on the bank of river Emajõgi, near the town centre and is regarded as one of the few surviving "poor" neighbourhoods of 19th-century Europe. At the moment Supilinn is being rapidly renovated, undergoing a slow transformation from the historic slum into a prestigious high-class neighborhood. The active community embodied by the Supilinn Society is committed to preserving the heritage.

The Second World War destroyed large parts of the city centre and during the Soviet occupation many new buildings were erected – notably the new Vanemuine Theater. The effects of the war are still witnessed by the relative abundance of parks and greenery in the historic centre. Typical Soviet-style neighbourhoods of blocks of high-rise flats were built between World War II and the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the largest such district being [[Annelinn]].

Presently, Tartu is also known for several modern buildings of the "steel, concrete and glass" variation, but has managed to retain a mix of old and new buildings in the centre of town. Notable examples include the Tigutorn Tower and the Emajõe Centre, both built during the current period of independence; Tartu's tallest and second tallest towers, respectively. Tartu's large student population means that it has a comparatively thriving nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, including the world's highest-ceiling pub, in the historic [[Gunpowder Cellar of Tartu]].

Annually, in the summer, Tartu hosts the Hanseatic Days festival ({{lang-et|Hansapäevad}}) to celebrate its Hanseatic heritage. The festival includes events such as handicraft markets, historic workshops and jousting tournaments.

==Sports==

Tartu is the home for basketball club [[Tartu Ülikool/Rock]], which is participating in the [[Korvpalli Meistriliiga]], the [[Baltic Basketball League]] and the [[EuroChallenge]].

[[Association football|Football]] club [[JK Tammeka Tartu]], one of the [[Meistriliiga]] clubs, is located in Tartu. Their home stadium is the [[Tamme Stadium|Tamme Staadion]], which has a capacity of 1 600 people. The city is also home to the [[Tartu JK Welco]] and [[FC Santos Tartu]] clubs, which play in the [[Esiliiga]], the second division.

There is a professional handball team, the [[Tartu Ülikool/Glassdrive]], which plays in the second division of Estonian handball.

Tartu is the hometown of the [[Tartu Volleyball|BIGBANK Tartu]] volleyball club.
 
Tartu is also the hometown of [[Clement "Puppey" Ivanov]], captain of [[Team Secret]], a professional [[Dota 2]] team. He won the first [[The International (Dota 2)|International]], and was runner-up two years in a row with Natus Vincere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Teams|url=http://www.dota2.com/international/teams/|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=20 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 World Orienteering Championships were held in Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woc2017.ee|title=Nokian Tyres World Orienteering Championships 2017|website=www.woc2017.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual running event [[Tartu Sügisjooks]] takes place in Tartu.

{{Literature}}
'''''The Gettysburg Review''''' is a quarterly literary magazine featuring [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[essays]] and reviews. Work appearing in the magazine often is reprinted in "best-of" anthologies and receives awards. 

The little magazine "is recognized as one of the country’s premier journals," according to a description at the Web site of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/periodically2007.cfm  "Literary Magazine Editors Introducing Emerging Writers at The New York Public Library"] New York Public Library Web site (the description does, however appear to have come from the magazine itself; nevertheless, it was approved for publishing at the respected library's Web site), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[U.S. News]]'' guide to the best colleges described the review as "recognized as one of the country's best literary journals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drmiss_3268_brief.php] Web page titled "America's Best Colleges 2007 / Gettysburg College", (given the similarity in wording, the phrase, slightly reworded, may have come from some promotional material from the college; nevertheless, the magazine's editors endorsed it by publishing it), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Web page of the English Department of the University of Wisconsin Colleges, the Gettysburg Review is considered a "major literary journal in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm Literature and Writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603002824/http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm |date=2007-06-03 }} University of Wisconsin Colleges Web site, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Literary Magazine|url=http://www.everywritersresource.com/topliterarymagazines.html|work=EWR|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine is published by [[Gettysburg College]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]. Its quarterly issues come out in January, April, July, and October.&lt;ref name=mast&gt;[http://public.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/masthead.html "Masthead"] ''The Gettysburgh Review'', Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

The magazine does not print material which has been published elsewhere. Along with fresh and new short stories, it is open to publishing original poetry, whether short or long,  and excerpts from novels. The magazine will occasionally serialize longer fictional works over more than one issue. "Essays can be on virtually any subject, so long as it is treated in a literary fashion &amp;mdash; gracefully and in depth," according to the magazine's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/sbmssns.html Submissions] ''The Gettysburg Review'' Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-fic&gt;[http://www.gettysburgreview.com/submissions/guidelines/  Guidelines - Fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gettysburg Review'' is one of the most frequent sources of material for ''[[The Best American Essays]]'', ''[[The Best American Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' series. Other anthologies that have reprinted work originally published in the magazine: ''The Pushcart Prize: Best of the Small Presses'', ''The Best Creative Nonfiction'', ''The Best American Mystery Stories'', ''Best New American Voices'', ''Best New Poets'', ''New Stories from the South'', and ''Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards''. Other work has been reprinted in publications such as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'' and the ''UTNE Reader.''&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://newpages.com/magazineguide/gettysburg_review.htm Gettysburg Review] New Pages, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent writers who have appeared in the magazine's pages include [[E. L. Doctorow]], [[Rita Dove]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Jeffrey Eugenides]], [[Linda Pastan]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], and [[Donald Hall]].&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Recent writers published in the journal include [[Gary Fincke]], [[Robert Gibb (poet)|Robert Gibb]] and [[Jacob M. Appel]].

The periodical has won awards including the Best New Journal award, four Best Journal Design awards from the Council of Editors of Learned Journals, and a PEN/Nora Magid Award for Excellence in Editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettysburg.edu/uniquely_gettysburg/ Uniquely Gettysburg] Gettysburg College Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 review of the magazine, Ron Tanner wrote that the stories in the 1993 issues were widely varied in style, but "are clearly in the mainstream of contemporary American fiction &amp;mdash; you will not find 'experimental' work in ''The Gettysburg Review''." 

He also found the stories have a common "concern for character, and an examination of the emotional and psychological distance one might travel when faced with a problem.  [...] each compels the character to make a decision, to make an effort, to make a move. Consequently, things happen in these stories. Which is to say that we end in a place very different from the story's beginning. In no resolution of a ''Gettysburg'' story, however, do we find ourselves living Happily Ever After. Life is more complicated than that, these writers assert."&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Ron. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2455/is_n3_v31/ai_15801087/pg_1 Gettysburg Review] ''Studies in Short Fiction'', Summer, 1994, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

The quarterly gets about 6,000 submissions per year and does not solicit work except for occasional reviews. "[W]e work hard not to have a regular stable of writers or favored persons of any kind," according to founding editor Peter Stitt. "We are most proud of publishing writers who have never before appeared in a nationally-circulated journal. But we do not actively search through the slush pile for anything but good writing."&lt;ref name=emerging&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050214092444/http://www.breaktech.net/EmergingWritersForum/View_Interview.aspx?id=115 "Interview with LitJournals / Conducted by Dan Wickett on January 19, 2005"] Emerging Writers Forum, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine is supported financially by Gettysburg College, for the most part, although it also receives grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the NEA, along with some revenue from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=emerging/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">''' The Language Conservancy''' is a nonprofit organization that provides [[language revitalization]] support to the world's [[endangered language]]s, restoring them to health and stability, and safeguarding them for future generations. The LC supports several ongoing language restoration efforts through its affiliate organizations, and includes the [[Lakota language]], [[Assiniboine language]], [[Crow language]] and the [[Hidatsa language]].  The Language Conservancy raises funds for and revitalizes these languages.

==Native American language crisis==

''' The Language Conservancy''' is currently focused largely on indigenous languages in the United States, where only a dozen or so of the original 400-500 have a chance of surviving beyond the next thirty years.  Government aid to this problem is limited and the few grant-providing foundations are over-burdened.

==Language Revitalization Best Practices==

The following Best Practices standards were developed in 2004 by a consortium of Lakota Tribal leaders and academic linguistic science and education professionals, to bring about the revitalization of the Lakota language. The result is a comprehensive system for language revitalization, comprising five major parts that are clearly defined, measurable, and interdependent. This consortium is now the Board and staff of the Language Conservancy.

''' Linguistics:'''  develop pedagogically correct curriculum and literature for the language at all its levels and across a range of uses; our primary focus is on K-16 schools.

''' Instruction:'''  retrain existing Lakota language teachers and develop a new language teacher corps utilizing proven teaching methodologies.

''' Education:'''  start with a standard, sequenced second language curriculum to lay the ground work for a population of second-language speakers and eventual Lakota-medium instruction.

''' Oversight:''' provide accountability by conducting pre-and post-testing of language proficiency in schools at sequenced intervals of instruction.

''' Social:'''  promote and support language use beyond the schools – homes and communities.

'''''The Scousers''''' was a regular series of sketches from the [[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]] [[BBC Television|BBC]] comedy show of the early 1990s.

==Gary, Barry and Terry==
It featured a set of stereotyped [[Liverpudlian]] characters or [[Scousers]], "Ga'", "Ba'" and "Te'" (Gary, Barry and Terry) played by [[Gary Bleasdale]], [[Harry Enfield]], [[Joe McGann]], and [[Mark Moraghan]]. The original inspiration for the Scousers sketches were [[Barry Grant]] and [[Terry Sullivan (Brookside)|Terry Sullivan]], two characters from the [[Channel 4]], [[soap opera]] ''[[Brookside]]'', set in Liverpool. Bleasdale, McGann and Moraghan actually are scousers, being from Liverpool originally.

The Scousers were usually depicted with [[Kevin Keegan]] bubble [[permanent wave|perm]] hairstyles and bushy [[moustache]]s, wearing [[Tracksuit|shell suits]], and speaking in exaggerated [[Scouse]] accents. Common catch phrases they came up included ''"Eh? Eh? Eh?"'' ''"Dey do do dat dough don't dey dough"'' ("They do do that though, don't they though").

=="Calm Down!"==
Whenever a potential problem or dispute arose, this would result in The Scousers repeating to each other their most famous [[catch phrase]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''" Eh! Eh! Alright! Alright! Calm down! Calm down!"'''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This catch phrase was Bleasdale's input as he changed the scripted original, which was ''"Break it up 'ey, come on, break it up"'', during the first rehearsal. McGann brought ''"Dey do dough, don't dey dough"'' to the sketches. The characters had allegiances to the city's football teams with "Ga'" being an [[Everton FC|Everton]] fan while "Ba'" &amp; "Te'" were [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans. This leads to even more disagreement.

The actors [[Paul Usher]] and [[Brian Regan (actor)|Brian Regan]] who played Brookside characters [[Barry Grant|"Barry"]] and [[Terry Sullivan (Brookside)|"Terry"]] also appeared in a ''"The Scousers"'' sketch'' "Terry Gets Married"''. One of The Scousers re-emerged in several years later on Enfield's sketch show ''[[Harry and Paul]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47089">The '''Vienna Circle''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Kreis}}) of [[Logical Empiricism]] was a group of [[philosopher]]s and [[scientist]]s drawn from the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social Sciences|social sciences]], [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] who met regularly from 1924 to 1936 at the [[University of Vienna]], chaired by [[Moritz Schlick]].

[[File:Eingang Mathematisches Kolloquium.TIF|thumb|Entrance to the Mathematical Seminar at the [[University of Vienna]], Boltzmanngasse 5. Meeting place of the Vienna Circle.]]

==Overview==
Among the members of the inner circle were [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Viktor Kraft]] and [[Edgar Zilsel]]. In addition, the Vienna Circle was occasionally visited by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]]&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Morgenstern: ''The Collaboration Between Oskar Morgenstern and John von Neumann on the Theory of Games''. In: ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 14(3), 1976, p. 806.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the partition into "inner circle" and "periphery" in Stadler 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] were in close contact to the Vienna Circle, but never participated in the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;From 1926 to 1933 there were occasional meetings of Wittgenstein with Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl. Cp. Stadler 2001, chapter on "Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle", 422–441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Popper and the Vienna Circle, cp. Stadler 2001, 453–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical position of the Vienna Circle was called [[logical empiricism]] (German: ''logischer Empirismus''), [[logical positivism]] or [[neopositivism]]. It was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]], [[David Hilbert]], French [[conventionalism]] ([[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]]), [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. The Vienna Circle was pluralistic and committed to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It was unified by the aim of making philosophy scientific with the help of modern [[logic]]. Main topics were foundational debates in the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics; the modernization of [[empiricism]] by modern logic; the search for an empiricist criterion of meaning; the critique of [[metaphysics]] and the unification of the sciences in the [[unity of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stöltzner/Uebel 2006, LII-LXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna Circle appeared in public with the publication of various book series – ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'') and the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' – and the organization of international conferences in [[Prague]]; [[Königsberg]] (today known as [[Kaliningrad]]); [[Paris]]; [[Copenhagen]]; [[Cambridge]], UK, and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Its public profile was provided by the ''Ernst Mach Society'' (German: ''Verein Ernst Mach'') through which members of the Vienna Circle sought to popularize their ideas in the context of programmes for national education in Vienna.

During the era of [[Austrofascism]] and after the [[annexation of Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]] most members of the Vienna Circle were forced to emigrate. The murder of Schlick in 1936 by a former student put an end to the Vienna Circle in Austria.

The Vienna Circle's influence on [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of science]] and [[analytic philosophy]], is immense up to the present day.

==History of the Vienna Circle==
The history and development of the Vienna Circle shows various stages:&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the phases in Stadler 2001. See 579–580 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "First Vienna Circle" (1907–1912) ===
The pre-history of the Vienna Circle began with meetings on the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]] from 1908&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's Vienna, New Edition, Elephant Paperback, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; on, promoted by [[Philipp Frank]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Frank 1949, Stadler 2001, Uebel 2000. The expression goes back to Rudolf Haller, "Der erste Wiener Kreis", in: ''Fragen zu Wittgenstein und Aufsätze zur Österreichischen Philosophie'', Amsterdam 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], the oldest of the three (1879–1934), was a mathematician. He received his degree in [[mathematics]] in 1902. Afterwards he studied under the direction of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in Vienna and [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. In 1905 he received the [[Habilitation]] in mathematics. He taught at [[Innsbruck]] (1905–1906) and [[Vienna]] (from 1909).

[[Otto Neurath]] (1882–1945) studied [[mathematics]], [[political economy]], and [[history]] in Vienna and Berlin. From 1907 to 1914 he taught in Vienna at the [[Neue Wiener Handelsakademie]] (Viennese Commercial Academy). Neurath married Olga, Hahn's sister, in 1911.

[[Philipp Frank]], the youngest of the group (1884–1966), studied [[physics]] at Göttingen and Vienna with Ludwig Boltzmann, David Hilbert and Felix Klein. From 1912, he held the chair of [[theoretical physics]] in the [[German University in Prague]].

Their meetings were held in Viennese coffeehouses from 1907 onward. Frank remembered:

{{quotation|After 1910 there began in Vienna a movement which regarded Mach's [[positivist]] philosophy of science as having great importance for general intellectual life [...] An attempt was made by a group of young men to retain the most essential points of Mach's positivism, especially his stand against the misuse of [[metaphysics]] in science. [...] To this group belonged the mathematician H. Hahn, the political economist Otto Neurath, and the author of this book [i.e. Frank], at the time an instructor in [[theoretical physics]] in Vienna. [...] We tried to supplement Mach's ideas by those of the French philosophy of science of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]], and also to connect them with the investigations in [[logic]] of such authors as [[Louis Couturat|Couturat]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]], Hilbert, etc.|Uebel, Thomas, 2003, p. 70.}}

A number of further authors were discussed in the meetings such as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]], [[Husserl]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Lenin]] and [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 143–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably the meetings stopped in 1912, when Frank went to [[Prague]], to hold the chair of theoretical physics left vacant by [[Albert Einstein]]. Hahn left Vienna during [[World War I]] and returned in 1921.

=== The formative years (1918–1924) ===
The formation of the Vienna Circle began with Hahn returning to Vienna in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 195–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the mathematician [[Kurt Reidemeister]] he organized seminars on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus logico-philosophicus]]'' and on Whitehead and Russell's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.

With the support of Hahn, [[Moritz Schlick]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy of the inductive sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922 – the chair formerly held by [[Ernst Mach]] and partly by [[Boltzmann]]. Schlick had already published two important works ''Raum und Zeit in die gegenwärtigen Physik'' (''Space and Time in contemporary Physics'') in 1917 and ''Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre'' (''General Theory of Knowledge'') in 1918.

Immediately after Schlick's arrival in Vienna, he organized discussions with the mathematicians around Hahn. In 1924 Schlick's students [[Friedrich Waismann]] and [[Herbert Feigl]] suggested to their teacher a sort of regular "evening circle". From winter term 1924 on regular meetings were held at the Institute of Mathematics in Vienna's Boltzmanngasse 5 on personal invitation by Schlick. These discussions can be seen as the beginning of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The non-public phase of the Vienna Circle – The Schlick Circle (1924–1928) ===
The group that met from 1924 on was quite diverse and included not only recognized scientists such as Schlick, Hahn, Kraft, Philipp Frank, Neurath, [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], and [[Heinrich Gomperz]], but also younger students and doctoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199–218.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the group invited foreign visitors.
 
In 1926 Schlick and Hahn arranged to bring [[Rudolf Carnap]] to the University of Vienna as a ''Privatdozent'' (private lecturer). Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' was intensely discussed in the Circle.

Also Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus logico-philosophicus'' was read out loud and discussed. From 1927 on personal meetings were arranged between Wittgenstein and Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl.&lt;ref&gt;For the recording of these meetings see Brian McGuinness, ''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann.'' Trans. by Joachim Schulte and Brian McGuinness. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The public phase – Schlick Circle and ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (1928–1934) ===
In 1928 the ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (''Ernst Mach Society'') was founded, with Schlick as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 219–290.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the society was the spreading of a "scientific world conception" through public lectures that were in large part held by members of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the lectures of the ''Ernst Mach Society'' 1929–1932 see Stadler 2001, 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Vienna Circle made its first public appearance under this name – invented by Neurath&lt;ref&gt;Frank 1949, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – with the publication of its manifesto ''Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung. Der Wiener Kreis'' (''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' also known as ''Viewing the World Scientifically: The Vienna Circle''&lt;ref name="Edmunds, D 2001, page 151"&gt;Edmunds, D. and Eidenow, J. ''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,'' 2001, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;) The pamphlet is dedicated to Schlick, and its preface was signed by Hahn, Neurath and Carnap.

The manifesto was presented at the ''Tagung für Erkenntnislehre der exakten Wissenschaften'' (''Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences'') in autumn 1929, organized by the Vienna Circle together with the [[Berlin Circle]]. This conference was the first international appearance of [[logical empiricism]] and the first of a number of conferences: [[Königsberg]] (1930), [[Prague]] (1934), [[Paris]] (1935), [[Copenhague]] (1936), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Mass.]] (1939), and [[Chicago]] (1941).

While primarily known for its views on the natural sciences and metaphysics, the public phase of the Vienna Circle was explicitly political. Neurath and Schlick were both [[socialism|socialists]] and believed the rejection of magic was a necessary component for liberation of the working classes. The manifesto linked [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to their political and anti-metaphysical views, indicating a blur between what are now considered two separate schools of contemporary philosophy - [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 246-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society took over the journal ''Annalen der Philosophie'' and made it the main journal of logical empiricism under the title ''[[Erkenntnis]]'', edited by Carnap and Reichenbach. In addition, the Vienna Circle published a number of book series: ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception'', ed. by Schlick und Frank, 1928–1937),&lt;ref&gt;In 1934 Karl Popper's ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'' was published in this series.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'', edited by Neurath, 1933–1939), and later the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'' (edited by Neurath, Carnap and [[Charles W. Morris]], 1938–1970).

=== Disintegration, emigration, internationalization (1934–1938) ===
Since the beginning of the 1930s first signs of disintegration appeared for political and [[racist]] reasons: [[Herbert Feigl]] left Austria in 1930. Carnap was appointed to a chair at [[Prague University]] in 1931 and left for Chicago in 1935.

1934 marks an important break: Hahn died after surgery, Neurath fled to Holland because of the victory of [[Austrofascism]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]] following which the ''Ernst Mach Society'' was dissolved for political reasons by the [[Schuschnigg]] regime.

The murder of Moritz Schlick by the former student [[Hans Nelböck]] for political and personal reasons in 1936 set an end to the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For documents concerning the murder of Moritz Schlick and the trial against Nelböck see Stadler 2001, 869–909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the circle such as Kraft, Waismann, Zilsel, Menger and Gomperz continued to meet occasionally. But the [[annexation of Austria]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 meant the definite end of the activities of the Vienna Circle in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Only after the war in 1949 arose the ''[[Kraft Circle]]'' in Vienna, a successor to the Vienna Circle, under the leadership of Viktor Kraft, a former member of the Vienna Circle. Among the members of this circle was [[Paul Feyerabend]].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emigration went along the internationalization of [[logical empiricism]]. Many former members of the Vienna Circle and the [[Berlin Circle]] emigrated to the [[English-speaking world]] where they had an immense influence on the development of [[philosophy of science]]. The [[unity of science]] movement for the construction of an ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science'', promoted mainly by Neurath, Carnap, and Morris, is symptomatic of the internationalization of logical empiricism, organizing numerous international conferences and the publication of the ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''.&lt;ref&gt;For a chronology of the emigration of the Vienna Circle see Hans-Joachim Dahms, "The Emigration of the Vienna Circle", in: Friedrich Stadler, Peter Weibel (ed.), ''The Cultural Exodus from Austria'', Vienna 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview of the members of the Vienna Circle ===
Apart from the central figures of the Schlick Circle the question of membership in the Vienna Circle is in many cases unsettled. The partition into "members" and "those sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" produced in the manifesto from 1929 is representative only of a specific moment in the development of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stöltzner and Uebel 2006, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the criteria used (regular attendance, philosophical affinities etc.) there are different possible distributions in "inner circle" and "periphery".

In the following list (in alphabetical order), the "inner circle" is defined using the criterion of regular attendance. The "periphery" comprises occasional visitors, foreign visitors and leading intellectual figures who stood in regular contact with the Circle (such as Wittgenstein and Popper).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 573. This list follows the presentation in Stadler 2001, 571ff., including further bio-bibliographical information on all the persons listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inner Circle:''' [[Gustav Bergmann]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], [[Béla Juhos]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Victor Kraft]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rose Rand]], [[Josef Schächter]], [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Edgar Zilsel]].

'''Periphery:''' [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Egon Brunswik]], [[Karl Bühler]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Heinrich Gomperz]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Eino Kaila]], [[Hans Kelsen]], [[Charles W. Morris]], [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], [[Karl Raimund Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Olga Taussky-Todd]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Reception in the United States and the United Kingdom===
The spread of [[logical positivism]] in the United States occurred throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 and in 1932, Schlick was a Visiting Professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], while Feigl, who immigrated to the United States in 1930, became lecturer (1931) and professor (1933) at the [[University of Iowa]]. The definite diffusion of logical positivism in the United States was due to Carl Hempel, Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, and Herbert Feigl, who emigrated and taught in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nagel, "Nature and Convention" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 26, 1929, in which Nagel discussed Reichenbach's interpretation of the theory of relativity;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Hook, "Personal Impression of Contemporary German Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 27, 1930, in which Hook presented a favorable report on logical positivism;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.&amp;nbsp;E. Blumberg and H. Feigl, "Logical Positivism: A New Movement in European Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 28, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link to the United States is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], who traveled in 1932 and 1933 as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], and [[Warsaw]]. Moreover, American [[semiotician]] and philosopher [[Charles W. Morris]] helped many German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap, in 1936.

In the United Kingdom it was [[Alfred Jules Ayer]] who acquainted the British academia with the work of the Vienna Circle with his book ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). [[Karl Popper]] was also important for the reception and critique of their work, even though he never participated in the meetings of the Vienna Circle.

==Topics and debates==
The Vienna Circle cannot be assigned ''one'' single philosophy. First, there existed a plurality of philosophical positions within the Circle, and second, members often changed their views fundamentally in the course of time and in reaction to discussions in the Circle. It thus seems more convenient to speak of "the philosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle".&lt;ref&gt;Cp. [[Thomas Uebel]], "Vienna Circle", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/vienna-circle/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some central topics and debates can be identified.

===The Manifesto (1929)===
This states the scientific world-conception of the Vienna Circle, which is characterized "essentially by two features.&lt;ref&gt;On the historical background of the manifesto see Stadler 2001, 334–339.&lt;/ref&gt; First it is [[empiricism|empiricist]] and positivist: there is knowledge only from experience. Second, the scientific world-conception is marked by the application of a certain method, namely [[logic|logical analysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' in Sarkar, Sahotra, 1996, p. 331—hereinafter ''VC''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical analysis is the method of clarification of philosophical problems; it makes an extensive use of [[symbolic logic]] and distinguishes the Vienna Circle empiricism from earlier versions. The task of philosophy lies in the clarification—through the method of logical analysis—of problems and assertions.

Logical analysis shows that there are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; the other kind includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about [[experience]] and thus they are devoid of meaning. [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] statements belong to this second kind and therefore they are meaningless. Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of scientific inquiries.

One source of the logical mistakes that are at the origins of metaphysics is the ambiguity of natural [[language]]. "Ordinary language for instance uses the same [[part of speech]], the substantive, for [[object (philosophy)|thing]]s ('apple') as well as for [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] ('hardness'), relations ('friendship'), and processes ('sleep'); therefore it misleads one into a thing-like conception of functional [[concept]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of mistakes is "the notion that ''thinking'' can either lead to knowledge out of its own resources without using any empirical material, or at least arrive at new contents by an [[inference]] from given states of affair".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; [[synthetic proposition|Synthetic knowledge]] a priori is rejected by the Vienna Circle. Mathematics, which at a first sight seems an example of necessarily valid synthetic knowledge derived from pure [[reason]] alone, has instead a [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] character, that is its statements are [[analytic proposition|analytical statements]], thus very different from Kantian synthetic statements. The only two kinds of statements accepted by the Vienna Circle are synthetic statements ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' (i.e., scientific statements) and analytic statements ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (i.e., logical and mathematical statements).

However, the persistence of metaphysics is connected not only with logical mistakes but also with "social and economical struggles".&lt;ref name="Vc"&gt;''VC'' p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysics and [[theology]] are allied to traditional social forms, while the group of people who "faces modern times, rejects these views and takes its stand on the ground of empirical sciences".&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt; Thus the struggle between metaphysics and [[science|scientific world-conception]] is not only a struggle between different kinds of philosophies, but it is also—and perhaps primarily—a struggle between different political, social, and economical attitudes. Of course, as the manifesto itself acknowledged, "not every adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter".&lt;ref&gt;VC p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians of the Vienna Circle see in the latter sentence an implicit reference to a contrast between the so-called 'left wing' of the Vienna Circle, mainly represented by Neurath and Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The aim of the left wing was to facilitate the penetration of the scientific world-conception in "the forms of personal and public life, in [[education]], upbringing, [[architecture]], and the shaping of economic and social life".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Schlick was primarily interested in the theoretical study of science and philosophy. Perhaps the sentence "Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic" is an ironic reference to Schlick.&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt;

The manifesto lists [[Walter Dubislav]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Kurt Grelling]], Hasso Härlen, [[Eino Kaila]], Heinrich Loewy, [[F.&amp;nbsp;P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], and [[Edgar Zilsel]] as people "sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" and [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as its "leading representatives".

===Unified science===
{{See also|Unity of science}}
The final goal pursued by the Vienna Circle was [[Unified Science|unified science]], that is the construction of a "constitutive system" in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given [[experience]]. "The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; From this aim follows the search for clarity, neatness, and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, [[Joergen Joergensen]] (after Hahn's death) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in [[Europe]] of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the [[World War II]]. In 1938 a new series of publications started in the United States. It was the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section ''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'' was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the ''Preface'' to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science:

{{quotation|The ''Encyclopedia'' was in origin the idea of Otto Neurath. It was meant as a manifestation of the unity of science movement [...] Original plans for the Encyclopedia were ambitious. In addition to the two introductory volumes, there was to be a section on the methodology of the sciences, one on the existing state of the unification of sciences, and possibly a section on the application of the sciences. It was planned that the work in its entirety would comprise about twenty-six volumes (260 monographs)|''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'', vol. 1, The University of Chicago Press, 1969, p. vii.}}

[[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well known work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', was published in this Encyclopedia in 1962, as the number two in the second volume.

===Critique of metaphysics&lt;!--linked from 'Template:Positivism'--&gt;===
The attitude of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap in the article 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache' in ''Erkenntnis'', vol. 2, 1932 (English translation 'The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language' in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., ''Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'', New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a [[vocabulary]], i.e., a set of meaningful words, and a [[syntax]], i.e., a set of rules governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have no meaning, are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.

A word ''W'' has a meaning if two conditions are satisfied. First, the mode of the occurrence of ''W'' in its elementary sentence form (i.e., the simplest sentence form in which ''W'' is capable of occurring) must be fixed. Secondly, if ''W'' occurs in an elementary sentence ''S'', it is necessary to give an answer to the following questions (that are—according to Carnap—equivalent formulation of the same question):
* What [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s is ''S'' deducible from, and what sentences are deducible from ''S''?
* Under what conditions is ''S'' supposed to be true, and under what conditions false?
* How is ''S'' verified?
* What is the meaning of ''S''?
(Carnap, "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;12)

An example offered by Carnap concerns the word '[[arthropod]]'. The sentence form "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod" is an elementary sentence form that is derivable from "''x'' is an animal", "''x'' has a segmented body" and "''x'' has jointed legs". Conversely, these sentences are derivable from "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod". Thus the meaning of the word 'arthropod' is determined.

According to Carnap, many words of metaphysics do not fulfill these requirements and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word 'principle'. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence "''x'' is the principle of ''y''" is supposed to be equivalent to the sentence "''y'' exists by virtue of ''x''" or "''y'' arises out of ''x''". The latter sentence is perfectly clear: ''y'' arises out of ''x'' when ''x'' is invariably followed by ''y'', and the invariable association between ''x'' and ''y'' is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of 'principle'. They assert that no empirical relation between ''x'' and ''y'' can completely explain the meaning of "''x'' is the principle of ''y''", because there is something that cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the lacking of any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word 'principle' when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as "water is the principle of the world" or "the spirit is the principle of the world" are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.

However, there are pseudo-statements in which occur only meaningful words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An example is the word sequence "Caesar is a [[prime number]]"; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that "prime number" is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind "''x'' is ''y''", where ''x'' is a noun and ''y'' is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So "Caesar is a general" and "Caesar is a prime number" are both well-formed, in contrast for example with "Caesar is and", which is ill-formed. In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as "Caesar is a prime number" are ill-formed. Now, and this is the main point of Carnap's argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent sources of errors from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb "to be", which is sometimes used as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ("I am hungry"), and sometimes to designate existence ("I am"). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign &lt;math&gt;\exists \;&lt;/math&gt;), which occurs only in statements such as &lt;math&gt;\exists \;xP(x)&lt;/math&gt;, never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as "cogito, ergo sum" has arisen.

Another source of mistakes is type confusions, in which a predicate of a kind is used as a predicate of another kind. For example, the pseudo-statements "we know the Nothing" is analogous to "we know the rain", but while the latter is well-formed, the former is ill-formed, at least in a logically constructed language, because "Nothing" is incorrectly used as a [[noun]]. In a formal language, "Nothing" only means &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;x&lt;/math&gt;, such as "there is nothing which is outside"—i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;xO(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus "Nothing" never occurs as a noun or as a predicate.

According to Carnap, although metaphysics has no theoretical content, it does have content: metaphysical pseudo-statements express the attitude of a person towards life, and this is the role of metaphysics. He compares it to an art like lyrical poetry; the metaphysician works with the medium of the theoretical; he confuses art with science, attitude towards life with knowledge, and thus produces an unsatisfactory and inadequate work. "Metaphysicians are musicians without musical ability".&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, 'The Elimination of Metaphysics', in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses and publications&lt;!--This section is linked from [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|International Encyclopedia of Unified Science#International Congresses for the Unity of Science}}
The Vienna Circle was very active in advertising their new philosophical ideas. Several congresses on [[epistemology]] and philosophy of science were organized, with the help of the [[Berlin Circle]]. There were some preparatory congresses: Prague (1929), [[Königsberg]] (1930), Prague (1934) and then the first congress on scientific philosophy held in [[Paris]] (1935), followed by congresses in [[Copenhagen]] (1936), Paris (1937), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. (1939). The Königsberg congress (1930) was very important, for Kurt Gödel announced that he had proven the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]] and the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of formal [[arithmetic]]. Another very interesting congress was the one held in Copenhagen (1936), which was dedicated to [[quantum physics]] and [[causality]].

Between 1928 and 1937, the Vienna Circle published ten books in a collection named ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), edited by Schlick and Frank. [[Karl Raimund Popper]]'s book ''Logik der Forschung'' was published in this collection. Seven works were published in another collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''). In 1930 Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach undertook the editorship of the journal ''Erkenntnis'', which was published between 1930 and 1940 (from 1939 the editors were Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris).

The following is the list of works published in the two collections edited by the Vienna Circle.

''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), edited by Schlick and Frank:

==Institute Vienna Circle==
In 1991 the [[Institute Vienna Circle]] was established in Vienna. It is dedicated to studying the work and influence of the Vienna Circle. In 2011 it was integrated in the [[University of Vienna]] as a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education. In 2015 the Institute co-organized an exhibition on the Vienna Circle in the main building of the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibition.html|title=Exhibition|website=www.univie.ac.at|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1200">The {{Nihongo|'''Yubetsu technique'''|湧別技法|Yūbetsu gihō}} is a special technique to make [[microblade]]s, proposed by Japanese scholar Yoshizaki in 1961, based on his finds in some [[Upper Palaeolithic]] sites in [[Hokkaido]], Japan, which date from c. 13,000 bp.

The name comes from the {{Nihongo|[[Yūbetsu River]]|湧別川|Yubetsugawa}}, on the right bank of which the {{Nihongo|[[Shirataki, Hokkaidō|Shirataki]]|白滝遺跡|Shirataki Iseki}} Palaeolithic sites were discovered. 

To make microblades by this technique, a large [[biface]] is made into a [[Lithic core|core]] which looks like a tall carinated scraper. Then one lateral edge of the bifacial core is removed, producing at first a triangular spall. After, more edge removals will produce ski spalls of parallel surfaces. 

This technique was also used from [[Mongolia]] to [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] during the later Pleistocene.
