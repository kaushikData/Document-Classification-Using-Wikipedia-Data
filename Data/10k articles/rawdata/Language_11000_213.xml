He became Minister of Communication in Haiti (2012–13), after a brilliant experience as Chief of Staff of the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He deeply designed reforms for public communication without propaganda, respecting the human rights organizations and positioned Haiti as a powerful member of the African Union at Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).

Ady Jean Gardy is also the founder of the [[Haitian Press Federation]], an [[umbrella organization]] for various Haitian press associations. He founded the Haitian University of Journalism and Social Communication or the Haitian Center for  Teaching  Journalists.

He  contributed  to the modernization and the revitalization of the Haitian media world. He took part in many training missions in West Africa and worked to establish the [[African Press Federation]] (Fédération de la Presse Africaine – FPA) along with various press leaders from Mali, Togo, Benin, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Congo, Madagascar, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. The Conference of [[Ouagadougou]] in 2004 devoted the wishes of the founder of this great structure, through the unconditional support of the honorable Daniel Whitman of the State Department.

==Early life and education==
After his elementary school at the Catholic school of the Salésiens Fathers led by the Dutch priest Arthur Bonhenn, Ady Jean-Gardy entered Alexander Pétion High School. He began his journalistic career at the age of 12 years of age as a caricaturist on the Creole newspaper ''Bon Nouvel'' directed by the Belgian priest Jorris Ceuppens. At 14 years old he wrote a novel ''Deblozay'' in Creole who was worth the Price of National Creole Media. He also wrote ''Poems of my Seventeen Years'' published by Henri Deschamps's Editions, soon after became Cultural Affairs Director of the Haitian intellectual magazine ''Petit Samedi Soir'' and editor of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] review ''Inter Jeunes''.

After high school, he was granted a scholarship by President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] of [[Senegal]] and studied in the field of  Communications and of Journalism in [[Dakar]], Senegal. On his return to Haiti he was named at 20 years old, manager of Haiti TV ([[cable television]]) under the direction of American Edward B. Hatton. He continued studying Communication of Mass Media at the Institute of Washington, and Social Communication at the [[University of Chicago]].

He pursued his higher learning in Haiti at the Institute of Linguistics Applied, studied Architecture at the Civil Engineering Institute of Richard Leconte and finally obtained a bachelor's degree in economics at the Institute of the Economic Science and Politics in  Haiti. Classified among the first class honors, he won a [[USAID]] scholarship to study  at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Economy, Finance and Administrative Management. Returning to Haiti, he followed courses at the Center of Sociology and Psychology by Canadian Prof Yves Bergeron, and of the correspondence courses from the French Institute of Modern History [[Paris]]. He also carried out a course on the teaching modern media studies at the International Training Centre, [[Cologne]], Germany.

He participated in the International Movie Prize, the Berlin's Futura Price in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], and he obtained the Caribbean's prize for a documentary film ''Christmas in vodoo colors''.

==Career==
Jean-Gardy, who signs his name as Adyjeangardy on all professional documents, was a [[civil servant]] of the [[UNDP]] (United Nations Development Programme), an operations manager of the United Nations Programs (1989–1992), associate Programs of the Environment with the Ministry of  Agriculture of Haiti (1992–1993), operations manager at the Office of [[UNESCO]] (1993–1994), represented Haiti at the Center for Strategic studies and Diplomacy of Paris (1994–1997), operations manager at the Center for Communication Studies of [[Deutsche Welle]] in Germany (1998).

In 1999 he was invited by the American State Department as an international representative of Haiti at the Assembly on the Democracy organized by the United Nations in Poland. He built strong international relations and is one of the most consulted Haitians about Caribbean affairs.

At the start of 2000 he fought the Haitian Government on the international scene following several assassinations of Haitian journalists, such as [[Brignol Lindor]] of the town of Petit-Goave and [[Jean Dominique]], Director of [[Haiti Radio-Inter]], alerting the International Press Federation, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the Inter-American Press Company and the International Court of the Human Rights at [[The Hague]].

In 2003, Jean-Gardy went to Amsterdam to meet members of the International Court of The Hague about the trafficking of Haitian children under the guise of adoption. On this subject he had a series of discussions with Dutch government officials, demanding  better control on international  adoptions to avoid a new black [[slave trade]] from Haiti. These steps led to a systematic inspection of adoption records between Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the United States and Europe.

In 2004, Jean-Gardy led several missions to the Governor of Florida [[Jeb Bush]] and his officials to convince them to create a Plan of Assistance to Haiti in the priority fields of public health, education and gifts of equipment for rubbish collection and fire control. In Florida he created a new television network called Haiti World TV (HWT) which broadcasts information programs about Haiti and Haitian History for the education of Haitian communities.

Contracted to the  International Center of Journalists in Washington, D.C. since 2004, consulting during two years with the Africa Section of the American State Department, and Advisor since 2005 of the Office Haiti-Freedoms France, he continues to travel between Europe and America reinforcing the bases of his work within the framework of inter-disciplinary solidarity.

Representative of Haiti to the International Conference of the Inter American Press Association on  modern global Strategies of Communication, his wishes was to see the Haitian State Media (radio and television) become  a community media with scrutiny by Parliament and the press organizations in the country. Being president of the International Media Foundation (IMF), by 2006 he produced a number of reports and recommendations for professional development in the media.

Dean of the University Center for the training of  Journalists, in 1985 he was asked by the Military Academy of Haiti to deliver courses on communication techniques, then, at the Police Academy of Haiti in 1995.

==Fall of Duvalier==
In the fall of the Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier, the National council of Government of Haiti (CNG) appointed him director of the Daily newspaper of State Haiti Released (1986), but he resigned 6 months later affirming "not want to guarantee useless massacres of the civil population".  Jean Gardy has entirely reorganized the Association of the Haitian Journalists (AJH) which he directed for 4 years, imposing the presence of this institution in the new Haitian Constitution of 1987.

He was Director General of the Investigation Group Press (1987), and  called by the president Ertha Pascal Trouillot to head the National radio of Haiti (1990–1991) and to help  in the organization of the Presidential Elections which led to the presidential election of Jean Bertrand Aristide. Named by Aristide Ambassador of Haiti in Japan in 1991, Jean-Gardy retracted following the arrest of the President Ertha Pascal Trouillot. He preferred to integrate the system of the United Nations where he was hired by the Representative resident Reinhart Helmcke(Germany), as Coordinator of Programs (Hai89018 project) and Consulting National at the World Health Organization (WHO). Other experiments allowed  Jean-Gardy to be the Representative in Haiti of International Union of the French Press for freedom of expression. He became thereafter Permanent correspondent of Voice of America (USA) in Haiti.

[[File:Jim Thorpe, 1912 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jim Thorpe]] at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]]]

An '''athlete''' (also '''sportsman'''  or '''sportswoman''') is a person who competes in one or more [[sport]]s that involve [[physical strength]], speed or [[endurance]]. The application of the term to those who participate in other activities, such as horse riding or driving, is somewhat controversial.

Athletes may be [[Professional sports|professional]]s or [[amateur sports|amateurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary, Millennium Ed. - 'athlete'&lt;/ref&gt; Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.

==Overview==
[[File:Armedforces crosscountry coppingerandballas.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes taking part in a race on a snowy park in the U.S.]]
The word "athlete" is a [[romanization]] of the {{lang-el|άθλητὴς}}, ''athlētēs'', one who participates in a contest; from ἄθλος, ''áthlos'', or ἄθλον, ''áthlon'', a contest or feat. The primary definition of "sportsman" according to Webster's ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'' (1960) is, "a person who is active in sports: as  (a): one who engages in the sports of the field and especially in hunting or fishing." Athletes involved in isotonic exercises have an increased mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume and are less likely to be depressed.&lt;ref&gt;MORGANROTH, JOEL, et al. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1024.7587&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Comparative left ventricular dimensions in trained athletes]." Annals of internal medicine 82.4 (1975): 521-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oler, Michael J., et al. "[http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7987512 Depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use among adolescents. Are athletes at less risk?]." Archives of Family Medicine 3.9 (1994): 781-785.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their strenuous physical activities, athletes are far more likely than the general population to visit [[massage]] salons and pay for services from massotherapists and masseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Jönhagen, Sven, et al. "[http://www.taichiqigongreikicentre.com.au/resources/Sports%20Massage%20after%20Eccentric%20Exercise.pdf Sports massage after eccentric exercise]." The American Journal of Sports Medicine 32.6 (2004): 1499-1503.&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes whose sport espouses endurance more than strength usually have a lower calorie intake than other athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Paul D., et al. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002604958490249X The effects of caloric restriction or exercise cessation on the serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of endurance athletes]." Metabolism 33.10 (1984): 943-950.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titles ==
{{see also|Athlete of the Year}}

==="All-around athlete"===
An "'''all-around athlete'''" is a person who competes in multiple sports at a high level. Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Lionel Conacher]], [[Deion Sanders]], [[Danny Ainge]], [[Babe Zaharias]] and [[Erin Phillips]]. Others include [[Ricky Williams]], [[Bo Jackson]], and [[Damon Allen]], each of whom was drafted both by [[Major League Baseball]] and by professional [[gridiron football]] leagues such as the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. Another female example is [[Heather Moyse]], a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in [[Bobsleigh|bobsled]] and member of the [[World Rugby Hall of Fame]] who also represented Canada internationally in [[track cycling]] and competed at [[U Sports|university]] level in basketball and track and field. Japanese athletes such as [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], [[Kazuyuki Fujita]], [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Naoya Ogawa]] have successfully performed in [[professional wrestling]] (which isn't a sport) and competed in [[mixed martial arts]].

==="World's Greatest Athlete"===
The title of "'''World's Greatest Athlete'''" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the [[decathlon]] (males) and [[heptathlon]] (females) in [[track and field]]. The [[decathlon]] consists of 10 events: [[100 meters]], [[long jump]], [[shot put]], [[high jump]], [[400 meters]], [[110 m hurdles]], [[discus]], [[pole vault]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[1500 m]]. The [[heptathlon]] consists of seven events: the [[100 m hurdles]], [[high jump]], [[shot put]], [[200 meters]], [[long jump]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[800 meters]]. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance.

Although the title "World's Greatest '''Athlete'''" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with [[Jim Thorpe]]. During the 1912 [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the [[Decathlon]] (among others). Thorpe notably also competed professionally in [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[American Football]], and [[basketball]]; and competed collegiately in [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[lacrosse]], and did [[ballroom dancing]]. King [[Gustav V of Sweden]], while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold said: "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world." That title has become associated with the decathlon event ever since.

== Origin ==
As soon as Students of this school came to know an Urdu teacher will join their school, they gave a petition to Headmaster-in-charge not to allow to join Urdu teacher as there are no Urdu medium students in this school rather they want others language teacher especially Bengali.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Preliminary Headmaster in charge give assurance but on 20 September Urdu teacher try to join the school with help of police protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Then Students of Daribhit High School started agitation for seeking Bengali teacher.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Police firing ==

On September 20, 2018, while cops from Islampur police station accompanied the three teachers to the school, the students, alumni, and villagers instantly took to an agitation. Some 2,000-off of them blocked the entrance to the school and also the highway passing nearby.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As soon as police asking to lift the blockades, a commotion broke out between students and police. Promptly police served a warning that force will be applied if the agitators do not back out. And then situation became more tense.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Initially cops run for a cover and with reinforcement arriving a little later, police turned aggressive. They first resorted to firing tear gas shells, rubber bullets and then a lathi-charge. The students continued to retaliate by hurling brickbats.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Newspaper reported, fretted cops then open fire&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; on the agitators. ''Rajesh Sarkar'',&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 19, an alumnus of the school and a student of Islampur ITI College, gunned down on spot and another student ''Tapas Barman''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; died next day in hospital.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Another class tenth student '''''Biplab Sarkar'''''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also injured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Protests ==

=== Students' protest ===
Sources said that after three new teachers were appointed at the school, a group of students put up a protest saying that they had demanded teachers of literature and science subjects and teachers who were proficient in imparting education in Bengali medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-19-year-old-student-killed-in-alleged-police-firing-in-bengal-s-north-dinajpur-bjp-calls-for-bandh-2665663|title=19-year-old student killed in alleged police firing in Bengal’s North Dinajpur, BJP calls for bandh|date=2018-09-20|work=dna|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students claimed that there was no one in the school who studied in the Urdu medium&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and alleged that the police had acted without provocation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bing–Borsuk conjecture''' states that every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[absolute neighborhood retract]] space is a [[topological manifold]]. The conjecture has been proved for dimensions 1 and 2, and it is known that the 3-dimensional version of the conjecture implies the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

==Definitions==

A [[topological space]]  is ''homogeneous'' if, for any two points &lt;math&gt;m_1, m_2 \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which takes &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

A [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an ''absolute neighborhood retract'' (ANR) if, for every closed embedding &lt;math&gt;f: M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space), there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the image &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; which [[retract]]s to &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an alternate statement of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture: suppose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[embedding|embedded]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;m \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; and this embedding can be extended to an embedding of &lt;math&gt;M \times (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

The conjecture was first made in a paper by [[R. H. Bing]] and [[Karol Borsuk]] in 1965, who proved it for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bing|first1=R. H.|last2=Armentrout|first2=Steve|title=The Collected Papers of R. H. Bing|date=1998|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821810477|pages=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnBQ0xp_rUcC&amp;pg=PA167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Włodzimierz Jakobsche showed in 1978 that, if the Bing–Borsuk conjecture is true in dimension 3, then the Poincaré conjecture must also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsche|first1=W.|title=The Bing–Borsuk conjecture is stronger than the Poincaré conjecture|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=106|issue=2|url=https://eudml.org/doc/211089|language=en|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every [[Busemann G-space|Busemann &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space]] is a topological manifold. It is a special case of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to&amp;nbsp;4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">'''Case in tiers''' is a model for assigning [[declension|surface case]] to [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) in a sentence. Introduced in Yip, Maling, and [[Ray Jackendoff|Jackendoff]] 1987, it has received at least 88 scholarly citations according to Google Scholar. The model takes its inspiration from the seminal and at that time already successful model of [[prosodic morphology]] (McCarthy 1981), which posits that the structure of a phonological word is a stack of types of elements (e.g., vowels, consonants, syllabic pitches), with each element type being provided with its own tier of the stack. Yip ''et al.'' decompose the structure of an individual sentence into a tier of structural cases, a tier of lexical cases, and a skeletal tier of the NPs in the sentence. The structural case tier is homologous to the consonant matrix lexical root of a Semitic verb, while the [[lexical case]] tier is homologous to the set of vowels in a Semitic verb word form. The lexical cases are assigned to specific NPs in the skeletal tier. The structural cases are assigned sequentially, with the direction of assignment depending on which [[case alignment]] is the characteristic one for the language in question. For [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] alignment, the structural cases are assigned from left to right, with [[Nominative case|nominative]] case preceding [[Accusative case|accusative]]. For [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] alignment, the direction of assignment is right to left, with [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] preceding [[Ergative case|ergative]]. For instance:

*Nominative alignment (English):
**[[intransitive verb]]: ''He'' [NOM] ''ran''.
**[[transitive verb]]: ''He'' [NOM] ''sees me'' [ACC].
*Ergative alignment (West Greenlandic) (Yip ''et al.'' 1987: 220):
**intransitive verb: ''Kaali'' [ABS] ''pisuppoq''. = 'Karl is walking.'
**transitive verb: ''Kaalip'' [ERG] ''Hansi'' [ABS] ''takuaa''. = 'Karl sees Hans.' (Sadock ex. 12a)

In debuting the model, the authors claimed for it the following achievements: unification of ergative and nominative case alignments under a single framework; accounting for the movement of lexical case with an NP in passivization; and accounting for the appearance of post-verbal nominative case in Icelandic. However, the model seemed to fail when assigning case in languages with OSV word order or free word order. It also did not correctly handle some [[grammatical voice]]s, e.g., the [[antipassive voice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8990">The '''Catalogue of Endangered Languages''' (ELCat) is a major resource for information on the [[endangered languages]] of the world. It is available to the public via the [[Endangered Languages Project]] [http://www.endangeredlanguages.com website].

==Language information==

The Catalogue of Endangered Languages provides information on each of the world's currently endangered languages. It provides information on:

# the languages' vitality (their prospects for continued use), such as number of speakers, trends in the number of speakers, intergenerational transmission
# the language's spheres of use
# locations, where they are spoken
# the social, linguistic, economic, political, and geographic context of each endangered language.

The information about each endangered language in ELCat comes from published sources and direct communications from individuals with specialized knowledge of specific endangered languages. All information provided in the Catalogue is referenced to its original source (e.g. journal article, book, personal communication, etc.), and information from multiple different sources is provided for each language, where available.

Users of the Endangered Languages Project website are encouraged to contribute suggestions for improving the information in the Catalogue. All user suggestions are reviewed by Regional Directors, specialists in the languages of specific regions of the globe.&lt;ref name="About ELCat"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7vQLUpU_2qcVEVqNzFKWFA2cUk |title=About ELCat |author1=Lyle Campbell |author2=John Van Way |author3=Nala Lee }} {{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discoveries made as the Catalogue was created have resulted in new knowledge about the world's languages. For example, on the one hand, many languages included in other reference works proved spurious, either not to exist or not to be distinct from other languages, and were removed; on the other hand, ELCat has added 260 new languages not identified by the [[ISO 639-3]] standard. ELCat has found that 45% of all currently-spoken languages are endangered, based on the 3116 still-spoken endangered languages in ELCat compared to the 6861 still-living languages listed by [[Ethnologue]]. ELCat finds that 299 languages have fewer than 10 speakers and that 792 are "critically" or "severely" endangered. Importantly, contrary to the often-repeated claim that a language becomes extinct every two weeks, ELCat discovered that on average about one language each three months becomes extinct, about 4 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle, Raina Heato, Nala Lee, Eve Okra, Sean Simpson, Kaori Ueki, and John Van Way. 2013. New knowledge: Findings from the Catalogue of Endangered Languages. Paper presented at the 3rd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation. Honolulu, February 28. http://hdl.handle.net/10125/26145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and personnel==

The Catalogue of Endangered Languages was developed by the linguistics departments at the [[University of Hawai'i at Mānoa]] (UHM) and [[Eastern Michigan University]] (EMU) between 2011 and 2016. The structure of ELCat was designed during the [[National Science Foundation]]-funded workshop on the [http://linguistlist.org/eliip/index.html Endangered Languages Information and Infrastructure Project (ELIIP)], held at the University of Utah in 2009. The development ELCat was funded by the National Science Foundation and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060402190920/http://hluce.org/ Henry Luce Foundation], under the supervision of Principal Investigators [[Lyle Campbell]] (UHM) and Anthony Aristar, [[Helen Aristar-Dry]], and later Veronica Grondona (EMU).&lt;ref name="About ELCat"/&gt; ELCat and the [[Endangered Languages Project]] website are now permanently housed at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, with ELCat under the direction of Gary Holton (UHM).

During its construction phase (2011-2016), ELCat was supervised by a board of Regional Directors, linguists with expertise in specific regions of the world.&lt;ref name="About ELCat" /&gt; From 2017 onward, the data in ELCat will be supervised by an International Board of Directors, a group of scholars with expertise in endangered languages, currently chaired by Bill Palmer ([[University of Newcastle, Australia]]).

Funded research to compile the bulk of the Catalogue ended in 2016; however, maintenance and hosting of the Catalogue's database and its contents will continue indefinitely at the University of Hawaii. This includes processing and implementation of user suggestions and feedback, as well as addition of information from newly available sources about endangered languages.

==Language Endangerment Index (LEI)==

The Language Endangerment Index (LEI) provides a numeric rating of a language's endangerment, based on four primary factors. These factors, and the levels and descriptions for each, are outlined below. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! 5 Critically endangered !! 4 Severely endangered !! 3 (Moderately) endangered !! 2 Threatened !! 1 Vulnerable !! 0 Safe
|-
| '''Number''' || 1-9 || 10-99 || 100-999 || 1000-9999 || 10,000-99,999 || ≥ 100,000
|-
| '''Transmission''' || only a few elderly speakers 
|| Many of the grandparent generation speak the language, but the younger people generally do not. 
|| Some adults in the community are speakers, but the language is not spoken by children. 
||Most adults in the community are speakers, but children generally are not.
|| Most adults and some children are speakers. 
|| All members of the community, including children, speak the language.
|-
| '''Trends''' 
|| A small percentage of the community speaks the language, and speaker numbers are decreasing very rapidly. 
|| Less than half of the community speaks the language, and speaker numbers are decreasing at an accelerated pace. 
|| Only about half of community members speak the language. Speaker numbers are decreasing steadily, but not at an accelerated pace. 
|| A majority of community members speak the language. Speaker numbers are gradually decreasing. 
|| Most members of the community speak the language. Speaker numbers may be decreasing, but very slowly. 
|| Almost all community members speak the language, and speaker numbers are stable or increasing.
|-
| '''Domains''' || Used only in a few very specific domains, such as in ceremonies, songs, prayer, proverbs, or certain limited domestic activities. 
||  Used mainly just in the home and/or with family, and may not be the primary language even in these domains for many community members. 
|| Used mainly just in the home and/or with family, but remains the primary language of these domains for many community members. || Used in some nonofficial domains along with other languages, and remains the primary language used in the home for many community members. 
|| Used in most domains ''except'' for official ones such as government, mass media, education, etc. 
|| Used in most domains, ''including'' official ones such as government, mass media, education, etc.
|}

Intergenerational transmission is considered the most important factor in linguistic vitality, and is thus accorded twice the weight of each of the other factors in the scoring algorithm. The scores for each factor are compiled to produce a composite percentage; according to the percentage, the language is assigned to an endangerment level (e.g. a score of 72% would be LEI level 5, "Severely Endangered").

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;math&gt;LEI = { Number + IntergenTrans * 2 + Trends + Domains  \over highest\ attainable\ score\ with\ given\ factors} * 100&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

ELCat also assesses a confidence level for the LEI by calculating the number of factors used to compute the LEI. Again, the intergenerational transmission factor is weighted doubly in this calculation. An LEI which employs information from all four factors would thus have a confidence level of 100%, while an LEI which uses only the speaker numbers and intergenerational transmission factor would have a confidence level of 60%.&lt;ref name="Assessing Levels of Endangerment"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Nala |last2=Van Way |first2=John |date=2016 |title=Assessing levels of endangerment in the Catalogue of Endangered Languages (ELCat) using the Language Endangerment Index (LEI) |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10275808&amp;fileId=S0047404515000962 |journal=Language in Society |publisher=Cambridge |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=271–292 |doi=10.1017/S0047404515000962 |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">'''Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783''' was a proclamation by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] dated September 22, 1783 prohibiting the extinguishment of [[aboriginal title in the United States]] without the consent of the federal government.&lt;ref name="proc"&gt;25 Journals of the Continental Congress 602 (1783).&lt;/ref&gt; The policy underlying the proclamation was inaugurated by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], and continued after the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] by the [[Indian Nonintercourse Act|Nonintercourse Acts]] of 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, 1802, and 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Miller, The Discovery Doctrine in American Indian Law, 42 Idaho L. Rev. 1, 51 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Beach, Land Claims of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe: Are They "Holding Hostages" or Asserting Valid Property Rights?, 26 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1009, 1036 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Pearce, Self-Determination for Native Americans: Land Rights and the Utility of Domestic and International Law, 22 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 361, 392--94 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Clinton, The Proclamation of 1763: Colonial Prelude to Two Centuries of Federal-State Conflict over the Management of Indian Affairs, 69 B.U. L. Rev. 329, 369 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Articles of Confederation]]-era, several [[U.S. states]], particularly [[New York (state)|New York]], purchased lands from Indians without the consent of Congress. In the 1980s, in the wake of the ''[[Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County|Oneida I]]'' (1974) decision permitting tribes to pursue such claims in federal courts, several tribes challenged such conveyances as contrary to the Proclamation. However, the Second Circuit has held that Congress had neither the authority nor the intent to prohibit such purchases within the borders of individual states, and thus that the Proclamation applied only to the [[territories of the United States|federal territories]].

==Text==
The Proclamation prohibits:
&lt;blockquote&gt;all persons from making settlements on lands inhabited or claimed by Indians, without the limits or jurisdiction of any particular State, and from purchasing or receiving any gift or cession of such lands or claims without the express authority and directions of the United States in Congress assembled.&lt;ref name="proc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Proclamation also declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;that every very such purchase or settlement, gift or cession, not having the authority aforesaid, is null and void, and that no right or title will accrue in consequence of any such purchase, gift, cession or settlement.&lt;ref name="proc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Litigation==
Few early cases cite the Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Foreman'', 16 Tenn. 256 (1835).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Proclamation has been cited in more recent litigation challenging conveyances of [[aboriginal title]] from tribes between 1783 and 1790.&lt;ref&gt;''Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Cuomo'', 730 F. Supp. 485, 486 n.2 (N.D.N.Y. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Cuomo'', 565 F.Supp. 1297, 1304--05 (N.D.N.Y. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York'', 520 F.Supp. 1278, 1288, 1291, 1317, 1322 (N.D.N.Y. 1981), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, ''Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York'', 691 F.2d 1070, 1078, 1082, 1084--95 (2d Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most in-depth analysis of the Proclamation was conducted by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in ''Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/860/1145/465529/ Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York]'', 860 F.2d 1145 (2d Cir. 1988), aff'g, ''Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York'', 649 F.Supp. 420 (N.D.N.Y. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; There, the [[Oneida Indian Nation]] challenged purchases of Oneida lands by the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1785 and 1788.&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1148.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Jon O. Newman]], for a unanimous three-judge panel, became one of the first U.S. federal judges to rule on the powers of the Congress and the states under the [[Articles of Confederation]], 200 years after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1150 ("Before examining these contentions, we pause to notice the jurisdictional conundrum posed for an Article III court by a claim alleging a violation of the Articles of Confederation. During the Confederation, there were no national courts authorized to adjudicate any issues arising generally under national law.")&lt;/ref&gt; Newman held:
*the states were empowered under the Articles to purchase land from Indians without the consent of Congress;&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1150--62.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the clauses in the Articles relating to Congress' authority to make war and peace with Indians were [[non-justiciable]];&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1151--52.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the lands, disputed by New York and [[Massachusetts]], were within the territory of New York at the time of the purchase;&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1167.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] did not prohibit the purchase;&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1162--66.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the Proclamation did not apply to lands within states;&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1166--67.&lt;/ref&gt;
*if the Proclamation had applied to such lands, it would have exceeded Congress's power under the Articles.&lt;ref&gt;860 F.2d at 1153--1162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of this decision was to extinguish "one of the largest land claims" claiming between {{convert|5500000|and|6000000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Kennedy, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59674799.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp; Appeals court rejects Indian land claim], ''Boston Globe'' (November 2, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Billmyer, Oneidas Lose Lawsuit to Win Back Land, ''The Post-Standard'' (November 2, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;Diane Zielinski, N.Y.

'''DATR''' is a language for [[lexicon|lexical]] [[knowledge representation]].&lt;ref name="Y.)1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Ooi (B. Y.)|title=Computer Corpus Lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9Wu7Zz8Ec4C&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=20 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0815-7|pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical knowledge is encoded in a network of nodes. Each node has a set of attributes encoded with it. A node can represent a [[word]] or a word form.

DATR was developed in the late 1980s by Roger Evans, Gerald Gazdar and Bill Keller
&lt;ref name=DATR&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Roger |author2=Gerald Gazdar |title=DATR: A language for lexical knowledge representation |journal=Computational Linguistics |year=1996 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=167–216 |url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J96/J96-2002.pdf |accessdate=2014-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619140838/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J96/J96-2002.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/C/C96/C96-2109.pdf |title=An evaluation semantics for DATR theories |first=Bill |last=Keller |authorlink= |year=1996 |conference=Proceedings of the 16th conference on Computational linguistics-Volume 2.

, and used extensively in the 1990s; the standard specification is contained in the Evans and Gazdar RFC, available on the Sussex website (below). DATR has been implemented in a variety of programming languages, and several implementations are available on the internet, including an RFC compliant implementation at the Bielefeld website (below).

DATR is still used for encoding inheritance networks in various linguistic and non-linguistic domains and is under discussion as a standard notation for the representation of lexical information.

A '''double majority''' is a voting system which requires a [[majority]] of votes according to two separate criteria.  The mechanism is usually used to require strong support for any measure considered to be of great importance. Typically in legislative bodies, a double majority requirement exists in the form of a [[quorum]] being necessary for legislation to be passed.

==Examples in use==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], [[Constitution of Australia|constitutional]] changes must be passed at a [[referendum]] in a majority of states (4 of the 6), and by a majority of voters nationally.  Prior to 1977, the votes of citizens in the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] did not affect the national or state-based count.  After a Constitution Alteration put to referendum in 1977 and given vice-regal assent on 19 July 1977, Territorial votes contribute towards the national majority, but the Territories themselves do not count towards the majority of states.

===Canada===
Since the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] in 1982, thorough [[amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amending formulae]] for the constitution were adopted.  Per the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], many amendments can be passed only by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and a [[two-thirds majority]] of the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial legislatures]], those provinces together representing at least 50% of the national population-–this is known as the 7/10 formula (as there were and are 10 provinces, so 7 constitutes a two-thirds majority). Additionally, a province can explicitly choose to dissent to an amendment that "derogates from the legislative powers, the proprietary rights or any other rights or privileges of the legislature or government of a province", in which case it does not apply in that province even if passed. Though not constitutionally mandated, a referendum is also considered to be necessary by some, especially following the precedent established by the [[Charlottetown Accord]] in 1992.

However, there are some parts of the constitution that can be modified only by a vote of all the provinces plus the [[Parliament of Canada]]; these include changes to the composition of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], changing the process for amending the constitution itself, or any act affecting the [[monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] or [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]].

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], double majority voting is a form of [[Qualified Majority Voting]] which is to apply to almost all policy areas starting in 2014 under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. Any decision taken under this scheme will require the support of at least 55% of the [[Council of the European Union]] members who must also represent at least 65% of the EU's [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6(2) of the Lisbon Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8337791.stm|title=Timeline: The road to Lisbon|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-11-04 | date=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Changing the [[constitution of Finland]] requires that a simple majority of the sitting [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]] vote in favor of the amendment. After this, the amendment is postponed until the next general election. After the election, the next parliament may finally vote to ratify the amendment, but this requires a supermajority of two thirds of the MPs. Thus, a double majority of two different parliaments is usually required to pass constitutional amendments. An expedited process may however be entered if a supermajority of five sixths of the sitting parliament vote to declare an amendment urgent. After this, a two-thirds majority of the current parliament may ratify an amendment using the expedited process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/lakiensaataminen/lainvalmistelu_vaiheet/Sivut/default.aspx | title =Eduskunta säätää lait - lainvalmistelun vaiheet  | website =Eduskunta.fi | publisher =Parliament of Finland | access-date =19 March 2016| language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Montenegro ===
When [[Montenegro]] [[Montenegro Independence Referendum 2006|voted]] to split from [[Serbia]], the EU insisted on a supermajority of 55% for it to recognise the result. This supermajority implemented something akin to a double majority and avoided the endless debate that might result if the result had a tiny majority.

=== Northern Ireland ===
Under the terms of the [[Belfast Agreement]], if 30 members or more request it, a measure may be put to a "[[cross-community vote]]" which requires a majority from both the Nationalist and Unionist camps.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], a national referendum is considered valid only if at least 50% plus one of the registered voters cast their ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/3_2000.php Romanian Referendum Law from February 2000] (Legea nr. 3/2000 privind organizarea și desfășurarea referendumului){{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a valid referendum, the outcome is determined by a simple majority of valid votes cast. The whole process thus involves a double majority in form of a [[quorum]].

A controversial amendment to the referendum law arose during the [[2012 Romanian political crisis|2012 political crisis]] and allowed for an exception to be made in case of a referendum regarding the impeachment of the [[President of Romania|President]]. The original law, which required a double majority for impeachment, was modified by governmental emergency decree to circumvent the [[quorum]] requirement. This would have resulted in a successful impeachment of the President in the following [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|referendum]]. The referendum was, however, subsequently invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]], the body responsible for overseeing the whole process, putting an end to the crisis.

=== Sudan ===
The [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|independence referendum]] for [[South Sudan]] required 51% of the vote and 60% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/world/article.aspx?id=562020&amp;vId=2083896&amp;cId=World |title=Sky News Australia - World News Article |publisher=Skynews.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], the passing of a constitutional amendment by [[Voting in Switzerland|popular vote]] requires a double majority; not only must a majority of people vote for the amendment but a majority of [[Canton (Switzerland)|cantons]] must also give their consent. This is to prevent a larger canton from foisting amendments onto the smaller ones and vice versa.

===United States===
Double majority is used in the [[United States]] for some [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] votes on issues such as a [[tax|tax levy]] or [[Bond (finance)|bond]]. Essentially, a double majority standard applies a two-part test to a [[vote]] outcome before a measure is passed:
* Did a [[majority]] of registered voters turn out for the election?
* Did votes in favor outnumber votes against, by the required margin?
If the answer to either of these questions is No, the measure fails.

This mechanism is used to prevent a small group from passing spending measures that affect the entire population in order to support their pet causes, especially at an election expected to have low [[voter turnout]]. Double majorities are also frequently used in municipal [[annexation]]s, wherein majorities of both the residents in the annexing territory and the territory to be annexed must support the annexation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} A similar rule exists for adopting [[consolidated city–county|Metro government]] in [[Tennessee]], where the referendum must pass both inside and outside the principal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://michie.lexisnexis.com/tennessee/lpext.dll/tncode/4867/489b/48e5/4907?fn=document-frame.htm&amp;f=templates&amp;2.0#htm|title = Tennessee Code Annotated 7-2-106, ''Referendum on proposed charter.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

Mainstream stations employ high-status presenters for drive time shows. In the United States, popular national hosts who are associated with morning drive include [[Howard Stern]], [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Steve Inskeep]], while [[Sean Hannity]] is associated with afternoon drive on the East Coast.

Drive time often includes a heavier run of [[traffic reporting|traffic report]]s, for which many stations employ their own [[helicopter]]s or hire a third-party traffic reporting service.

For [[popular music]]-oriented stations, morning drive-time is typically dominated by the "[[morning zoo]]" genre of radio program, with the afternoon portion is often given over to music (often in commercial-free blocks, especially in markets with long commute times) and light entertainment features. For [[talk radio]] stations, drive time is characterized by regular news updates, as well as extremely frequent updates on [[traffic]] and [[Weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] to help commuters get to and from work. Primary [[News broadcasting|news radio]] stations are almost always local during this time period.

==Variations by country==
In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term ''drive time'' is used almost exclusively to refer to the peak evening period (most commonly 16:00&amp;ndash;19:00); the term used for the period of peak morning listening is ''breakfast'', akin to the phrase ''[[breakfast television]]'' used for morning TV shows. In circumstances where the phrase ''drive time'' may be ambiguous, the term ''home time'' may also be used for afternoon drive.

In the United States drive time consists of the morning hours when listeners wake up, get ready, and head to work or school, and the afternoon hours when they are heading home and before their evening meal. The exact times vary: ''morning drive times'' typically include 6–10&amp;nbsp;a.m.; ''afternoon drive times'' typically include 3–7&amp;nbsp;p.m. In the United States, these are the time slots as defined by [[Nielsen Audio]] for [[audience measurement]].

Drive time programming is almost exclusively restricted to during the work week. On weekends, because driving habits are much less uniform, lower profile programs (often [[rerun]]s or [[brokered programming]]) typically air in the respective time slots.

===Multiple time zones===
Depending on the station, morning drive can start as early as 5 a.m. local time, although rarely any earlier. Because the contiguous United States spans four time zones, [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|what constitutes drive time on one coast does not broadcast in drive time on the other]], which can cause issues for nationally syndicated programs; this is not as much of an issue in morning drive, which usually incorporates a [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] to air at the same time in all time zones, as it is for afternoon drive. However this effectively means that morning shows are heavily [[New York City|New York]] or [[East Coast bias|East Coast]]–centric to allow time-shifting in all time zones, with some Central Time Zone shows making some additional headway. For all intents and purposes though, morning shows originating west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] must additionally plan to be mid-morning offerings for the rest of the country and adjust accordingly to be office-appropriate for those stations which take the shows in the east. National satellite networks typically air their morning drive programs from 6–11&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, with heavy repetition. 

These issues are not present in the United Kingdom or New Zealand, where the entire country is in the same time zone. In Australia, there is a two-hour time zone difference between the eastern and western coasts; and [[Time in Australia|three time zones]]; however, other than [[Greater Perth]], most of the country's population is located in the southern and eastern portions of the country, and its time zones are only a half-hour apart. Although [[Time in Canada|Canada also spans several time zones]], most of its drive time programs are local and are thus unaffected by these problems.

==Issues regarding   [[Vepkhistqaosani|''The Man in the Panther Skin'']]==
In the articles and monographs by E.Khintibidze on [[Vepkhistqaosani|''The Man in the Panther Skin'']] (''MPS'') on the basis of an analysis of the key elements of the artistic structure, as well as key philosophical and theological terms of the Poem, an attempt is made  to define the religious, philosophical and literary thought and the place of Rustaveli in Medieval thinking.  
Khintibidze’s  research on this field includes the following spheres: theological, philosophical, ethical and astrological. The scholastic terms in the MPS are studied also.&lt;ref&gt;The World View of Rustaveli's Vepkhistqaosani (The Man in the Panther Skin), "Kartvelologi", 2009, 860p.&lt;/ref&gt;
The antique philosophical stream in The Man in the Panther Skin is discussed by Khintibidze. Namely, the Aristotelian definition of soul popular in the Medieval centuries; attitude of friendship in the MPS to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] concept of friendship; the concept of  ''the best  middle''; [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustvelian]] concept of  vice in relation to [[Plato]]'s ethical conception; It is found  the trace of [[Plato]]'s theory of  perfection in the epic by [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]]; Significant part of the research to this field is assigned to a study of Rustaveli's   ethical views, largely  in the  context of Christian and Classical ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) moral  conceptions.  The decision of murdering the groom; meeting at the castle of Kaj, categories of abundance and courage in [[Vepkhistqaosani|The Man in the Panther Skin]] &lt;ref&gt;The World View of Rustaveli's Vepkhistqaosani (The Man in the 
Panther Skin), "Kartvelologi", 2009, 860p&lt;/ref&gt;
Special research is dedicated to the study of the concept of the human being in the MPS;&lt;ref&gt;The World View of Rustaveli's [[Vepkhistqaosani|Vepkhistqaosani (The Man in the Panther Skin)]], "Kartvelologi", 2009, 860p&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, regarding friendship as love.&lt;ref&gt;''Love in Vepkhistqaosani (The Man in the Panther Skin)'', "Kartvelologi", Tbilisi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Prof. Khintibidze proposes a new interpretation of love in the epic of Rustaveli, according to which there is no sharp division between divine and human love: love is the one essence, one unity,  a divine emotion, and only its manifestation between human beings can be depicted in literature. From this point of view, love also includes friendship. According to  the theoretical discussion in the prologue of this poem, this concept takes rise from the interpretation of love mentioned in the [[New Testament]] and belongs to the type manifested later in European reality in [[Dante]] and [[Petrarch|Petrarca]] (but a different way) as a form of manifestation of the  divine love in human love.&lt;ref&gt;''The World View of Rustaveli's [[Vepkhistqaosani]] (The Man in the Panther Skin)'', "Kartvelologi", 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Khintibidze reveals the following cosmological model in [[Vepkhistqaosani|''The Man in the Panther Skin'']]: God Heavenly forces Human world&lt;ref&gt;''The World View  of Rustaveli's Vepkhistqaosani (The Man in the Panther Skin''), "Kartvelologi", Tbilisi, 2009, 860 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar substantiates this model in specific studies. 
According  to Khintibidze the world view of the [[Vepkhistqaosani|''MPS'']] is introducing the ideas of [[Renaissance]] into the social attitudes of the late Middle Ages, the most significant of which is the emphasis on a human being, trust in his logical and analytical thinking.  According to this theory, the Rustavelian world view is the harmonious synthesis of the [[Medieval]] and the [[Renaissance]] thought which does not imply the negation of the [[Medieval]] but compliments it with the new philosophy – the [[Renaissance]].  
According to the scholar, the belief in the values of this reality, perception of the beauty of the human world, belief in the human mind  and intellect in [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]]'s epic is directly connected to  the traditional Christian ideals – beliefs in the immortality of the soul, eternity of the Good and Gracious Creator and the hope of union with the infinite  God after death. This belief in the dual ideals – human and divine – had to be surrounded by a  deep feeling of inner peacefulness and glory. This feature of the worldview must also condition those great poetic features which the poem still retains. The similar stage  in the process of the Christian thought on the level of European literary and social thought is testified from the 13th-14th centuries.  In the case of [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]] this starts with the Christian theology and is theoretically substantiated based on specific means and is weaving within the artistic system.

According to the final conclusion by Khintibidze, Of its contemporary and immediately following or proceeding great literary creations [[Vepkhistqaosani|The Man in the Panther Skin]] is one of the first that expresses – with maximum conceptualization and consistency – the new world view, i.e. romantically coloured realistic outlook established in medieval transcendental Weltanschauung. [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]] is the youth of our contemporary thinking. Trusting in the beauty of life, power of reason and highest spiritual and emotional ideals, he dreams of man's happiness and sees this happiness – along with eternal life – in the triumph of good in earthly life and in man's love for human beings. Love and friendship are turned by Rustaveli  into an ideal, which imparts divine elevation to man's earthly life. And the essence of human, man's cognitive life is seen precisely in this human relationship: friendship and love. 
The striving of the great intellectuals of the [[Late Middle Ages]], including [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]], towards establishing divine harmony in worldly reality, in later centuries developed under the primacy of search for material well-being in this world, gradually leading to a  breakdown of medieval faith. The new period easily renounced the [[Renaissance]] ideals of search for man's moral and physical perfection and fame, setting up idols of money, accumulation  of wealth and carnal pleasure.  As though the moral foundation gained through the millennial history of mankind is being totally shaken: You shall not commit murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not give false evidence against your neighbor. The Biblical formula: “Where do you come from? Where are you going?” (Judg. 19.17) is acquiring a new shade and intonation. Considerable time will pass and a long process will set in of man's striving towards regaining the divine bearings of faith, hope and love, which will be followed from the start by a desire of gaining divine love in worldly relations. (gv. 790, msoflmxedvelobidan.)
It is revealed by the scholar that [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]]'s thinking not only finds parallels in the development of European literary thinking ([[Troubadours]],  [[Dante]], [[Petrarch]]a),  but the trace of the MPS is  directly demonstrated   in the European  literary works. As revealed by Khintibidze, the plot of [[Vepkhistqaosani|The Man in the Panther Skin]]  is used by the English dramatists of the 17th century - [[William Shakespeare]], [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vepkhistqaosani|The Man in the Panther-Skin]] in England in the Age of [[Shakespeare]], Tbilisi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The trace of the MPS's plot is evident  in  popular plays of the 17th century: [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Cymbeline]], Beaumonte and Fletcher's  [[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]   and  [[A King and No King|King and No King]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vepkhistqaosani|The Man in the Panther Skin]] [[William Shakespeare]]'s  Literary Source, The Kartvelologist", #19, 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The author reveals an assumed way through which  Rustaveli's epic must have  reached the highest intellectual circles of  Shakespearean England.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man in the Panther Skin: Cultural Bridge from East to West": Georgia (The Proceedings of International Seminar on "Georgia, Previous Experiences, Future Prospects"), Tehran 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epigraphy''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιγραφή}}, "inscription") is the study of inscriptions or epigraphs as [[writing]]; it is the science of identifying [[grapheme]]s, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a [[document]] and the artistic value of a [[literature|literary]] composition.

A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an ''epigrapher'' or ''epigraphist''. For example, the [[Behistun inscription]] is an official [[document]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] engraved on native rock at a location in [[Iran]]. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of [[historian]]s, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person.

An epigraph is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] prescription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as [[numismatics]] or [[palaeography]]. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: [[engraving]]s in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] on cast metal, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] on precious stones, painting on [[ceramic]] or in [[fresco]]. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a [[clay tablet]] in a conflagration.

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture.  Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in [[Mycenaean Greece]] the deciphered texts of "[[Linear B]]" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are "[[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]]" in its original sense.

==History==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|The high medieval [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]], composed in [[Latin]] and stamped in [[Roman square capitals]]]]

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as [[Georg Fabricius]] (1516–1571); [[Stefano Antonio Morcelli]] (1737–1822); [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]] (1815–1877); [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903); [[Emil Hübner]] (1834–1901); [[Franz Cumont]] (1868–1947); [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] (1904–1985).

The ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New [[Book|fascicles]] are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The ''Corpus'' is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' ''[[Zoological Record]]''— the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different [[text corpus|corpora]]. There are two. The first is ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of [[classics]].

Other such series include the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]]'' (Etruscan inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae'' (Crusaders' inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' (Celtic inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum'' (Iranian inscriptions), "Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia" and "Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, [[Jean-François Champollion]], and the British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].

The interpretation of [[Maya hieroglyphs]] was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael D.

====Materials====
Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, [[terracotta]], or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in [[Egypt]]). In Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In [[Greece]] the favourite material, especially in [[Athens]], was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline [[limestone]]s, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;The following sections are based on specialist work consulted from the following sources: {{aut|[[Ernest Arthur Gardner]]}}'s article on "Epigraphy and Inscriptions", in Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was [[bronze]]: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. (cf. [[numismatics]].) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in [[Crete]]. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (''[[ostraka]]'') were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, [[amphora]] handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The ''tools'' used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of [[chisel]], usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a [[punch (tool)|punch]] or pointed [[hammer]]. Sometimes a circular punch was used for '''''O''''' or a letter of which ''O'' formed a part.

====Styles of cutting====
Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the [[hieroglyphs]] are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge-shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called ''[[cuneiform]]'' system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce ''[[Apex (diacritic)|apices]]'' or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in [[Latin Inscriptions|Roman inscriptions]], which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. [[dating methodologies in archaeology]].)

Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at [[Delos]], under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of [[Thucydides]]; and many other inscriptions approach this in length.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Symbols and forms of writing===
{{SpecialChars}}
{{see also|History of writing}}
Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also [[pictography]], which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world — in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Crete]], among the [[Hittites]] and in [[China]] and [[Americas|America]]. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from [[Ideographs]] (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to [[syllabaries]] or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the [[Phoenicians]], from whom the [[Greeks]] borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the [[Latin language|Latin]], and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] was derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].

[[File:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]
The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or [[Stone mason|masons]]' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge-shaped is most conspicuous in [[cuneiform]], but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze.

In the north of [[Europe]] the [[Ogham]] [[Ogham inscription|inscriptions]] are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the [[Morse code]]; but [[Runes]], which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] or the [[Latin alphabet]]s.

In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a [[decimal|decimal system]], doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or ''rhombi''), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at [[Epidaurus]] in the 4th century BC. In [[Athens]] the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, '''M''' for Μύριοι (10,000), '''X''' for χίλιοι (1,000), '''H''' for εκατόν (100), '''Δ''' for δέκα (10), '''π''' for πεντε (5) and '''I''' for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The [[Roman numeral|Roman]] system of numerals — M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of [[ideograph]]s representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

[[File:Crete - law of Gortyn - boustrophedon.JPG|thumb&lt;!--autosize to fit handheld devices--&gt;|left|Ancient Greek [[boustrophedon]] inscription, [[Gortyn code]], Crete, 5th century BC]]

Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under [[list of classical abbreviations]]. [[Compendia]] or [[monogram]]s also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Byzantine]] inscriptions.

Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists.This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross ([[File:Greek cross.svg|15px]]) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end.

The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern — in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (''[[boustrophedon]]'', or as an [[ox]] in [[ploughing]]). Most [[Semitic alphabets]], including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Position or place===
[[File:Roman - Funeral Stele - Walters 2316 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|Roman marble funeral [[stele]] with inscription: "CIL VI 23414: D(is) M(anibus) / M(arco) Ogulnio / Iusto filio / pientissimo / vix(it) ann(os) XV mens(es) II d(ies) XXII / M(arcus) Ogulnius / Iustus pater / et sibi fecit" - 1st century AD]]
The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired.

In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (''[[stelae]]''), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed [[tombstone]]s were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Chief periods and nationalities===
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb]]
The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded.

Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of [[hieratic]] modification were used at different times. On the famous [[Rosetta Stone]], in the [[British Museum]], which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Assyria]]n and [[Old Persian|Persian]], until it was superseded, after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the [[Middle Minoan|Middle]] and [[Late Minoan]] periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of [[Knossos]], about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the [[Cypriot syllabary]], which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this  was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC.

In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]) the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian alphabet]], which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by [[Athens]], and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local [[Italian alphabet]]s, including the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], were derived with various modifications. The [[Roman alphabet]] was among these, being based on the [[Archaic Greek alphabets|alphabet]] of [[Caere]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day.

The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through [[medieval]] times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek Corpus]]'' records the building of a bridge in [[Sicily]] in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Methods of dating===
{{main article|Dating methodologies in archaeology}}
It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the [[Ionic alphabet]] was adopted in place of the early [[Attic Greek|Attic alphabet]] in the archonship of [[Eucleides]], 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by [[Archinus]].{{r|fragment}} But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the [[Eponymous]] [[Archon]], and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by [[Olympiads]], which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an [[emperor]]. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his [[consulate]], or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by "Indiction"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the [[Eastern Empire]] the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used.

The Greek motto ''gnōthi sauton'' ("know thyself", ''nosce te ipsum'') combines with the image to convey the famous warning: ''Respice post te; hominem te esse memento; [[memento mori]]'' (Look behind; remember that you are mortal; remember death)]]

===Purpose of inscriptions===
Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object — for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god — and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a [[potsherd]]. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by [[advertisements]] or [[posters]], thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — [[codes of law]] and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the [[Acropolis]] or the [[Agora]], could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy, Robert |author2=Sharon, Ring |author3=Salkin, Boda |year=1996 |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 66 |isbn=978-1-884964-02-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative inscriptions===

Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to [[picture]] or [[relief]] chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of [[Cypselus]], of about 600 BC [[hexameter]] verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and [[Samos]] has a relief at its head representing the [[goddess]] [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by [[Cicero]], of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of "recycling": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of [[Germanicus]], probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Cicero]] reference cf. {{cite book |author=Margherita Guarducci   |authorlink=Margherita Guarducci |year=1995 |title=Epigrafia greca |location=Rome |publisher=Ist. Poligrafico dello Stato |pages= 87ff |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent inscriptions===
The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as ''(a) Religious'' and ''(b) Political and Social''. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention.

====Temples, their foundation and administration====
A [[temple]] was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and [[bullion]], mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or [[peculation]]. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest — there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous [[Serpent Column]], once at [[Delphi]] and now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], with the list of the Greek States which took part in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] at [[Dodona]] after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Priests and other officials====
[[File:KaranisSouthTempleGreekInscr.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription at the south temple, [[Karanis|Kom Aushim (Karanis)]], [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]]]
Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a [[priesthood]] was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly — for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple.

Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were ''[[manteis]]'' or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in [[divination]]; at [[Eleusis]] we find records of the [[hierophant]], the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.

There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Ritual====
[[File:Votive relief Asklepios BM809.jpg|thumb|Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of [[Asclepius]] at [[Milos]], [[Ægean Sea]].]]

The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from [[Thasos]] in the [[Louvre]]:— "To the [[Nymphs]] and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No [[paean]] is sung. To the [[Graces]] it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20Ma%20696&amp;object=Sculpture Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture)], ''Relief Plaques from Thasos''; see also classification on [http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink3/4DACTION/LSAGwebDisplayInscription?searchTerm=Relief&amp;searchType=browse&amp;searchField=object&amp;returnList=0&amp;sequence=0&amp;thisListPosition=8 Poinikastas:"Thasos, inscriptions"] - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of [[Alectrona]] at [[Ialysus]], it was prescribed that "no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt; Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at [[Andania]], in [[Messenia]], the arrangements for the celebration of the local [[Eleusinia]], the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.&lt;ref name="GEpi"&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUASHSU5ET&amp;sig=7bVtQ6GblyM1sojunQokSFuWsp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy''], Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUFC3S-7r4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWja_v4xvP&amp;sig=d2eJ6F9VifPiDz35NlU7PXqzFbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''Ancient Athens''], Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other [[oracle]] in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances.

Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of [[Asclepius]] at [[Epidaurus]]. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the ''[[Epidaurus|abaton]]'', has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Private associations for religious purposes====
Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which "there can be neither [[Jew]] nor [[Greek people|Greek]], there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:28|Galatians 3:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early [[codes of law]] preserved on stone, notably at [[Gortyna]] in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when [[Locrians]] established a colony in [[Naupactus]]; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his classic work (downloadable) [https://archive.org/details/griechischeepigr00larf ''Griechische Epigraphik'' (1914)] at [[University of Toronto]] - Robarts Library, eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the [[prytany]] (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate ([[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]]) or the assembly of the people ([[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the [[Hellenistic Age]], and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from [[Roman emperors]], inscribed and set up in public places.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the [[arsenal]] of [[Philon]] at the [[Peiraeus]] which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;Built under the administration of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], {{cite book|author=Smith, Sir William, ed.|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|chapter=Philon, A very eminent architect at Athens|year=1859|volume=vol. III|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|page= 314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}. E. A. Gardner, ''op.cit.'' p. 557, observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." It was to hold the rigging of the [[galley]]s; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian [[democracy]]. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the [[First Mithridatic War#Sulla's siege of Athens, summer 87-early 86 BC|Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Erechtheum]], we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the [[Parthenon]], spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Jenkins   |title=Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLego4eAgZUC|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02388-8|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey M. Hurwit   |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-42834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the [[galley]]-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A set of records of high historical value are the ''"tribute lists"'', recording the quota paid to Athens by her [[Members of the Delian League|subject allies]] during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. [[Delian League]]).

[[File:Stele with an ephebic list NAMA 1484 (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|[[Stele]] with an [[ephebos|ephebic]] list, Athens, 4th century BC]]

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the [[ephebos|ephebic system]] at Athens. There are not only records of lists of [[ephebos|ephebi]] and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=O. W. Reinmuth   |title=The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. |url= |accessdate= |year=1971 |publisher=Leiden Brill |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.&lt;ref name="GEpi"/&gt;

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and [[Epidaurus]], 151 citizens of [[Megara]] were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of ''[[proxenia]]''. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed ''proxenos'' of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s, with the essential difference that the ''proxenos'' is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a ''proxenos'', and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the ''proxenos'', and record honours consequently conferred upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Enrica Culasso Gastaldi   |title=Le prossenie ateniesi del IV secolo a.C.: gli onorati asiatici (Fonti e studi di storia antica, 10) |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |location=Alessandria |publisher=Edizioni dell'Orso |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the [[Prytaneum]] at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of [[Pericles]] on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor [[Kresilas]]. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
[[File:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|Black-figure [[dinos]] with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by [[Sophilos]]: ΣΟΦΙΛΟΣ [...] ΜΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, "Sophilos drew me"]]

These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the ''[[Victory]]'', signed on its pedestal by [[Paeonius]] at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, [[#FN1|the statue of Hercules/Heracles]] below)

A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by [[Attic vase|Attic]] and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute [[Pottery of ancient Greece|historical and stylistic study]] of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', {{cite book|author=Joseph Veach Noble   |title=The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |location=New York |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500050477 |pages=}}; {{cite book|author=Martin Robinson   |title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens |url= |accessdate= |year=1992 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521338813 |pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|autobiographical account of the deeds and administration]] of [[Augustus]], which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], because the most complete copy of it was found at [[Ancyra]]. The [[Marmor Parium]] at [[Oxford]], found in [[Paros]], is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author1=P. Botteri |author2=G. Fangi |title=The Ancyra Project: the Temple of Augustus and Rome |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |location=Ankara |publisher=ISPRS Archives, volume XXXIV part 5/W12 Commission V |isbn= |pages=84–88}}; see also ''[https://archive.org/details/parianchronicle00robegoog The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity]'' by [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] 1788, from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his [[deme]]. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as "a good and wise man". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such [[epitaph]]s were frequently in [[metrical form]], usually either [[hexameter]] or [[elegiacs]]. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'' the interesting ''[[Epitaph of Seikilos]]'' by C. V. Palisca &amp; J. P. Burkholder, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin inscriptions==
{{See also|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|List of classical abbreviations}}
[[File:Aquileia Basilica - Ausgrabungen Mosaik 5.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Aquileia]], 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: ''IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX'' (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic)]]

[[Latin language|Latin]] inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the [[provinces of the Roman Empire]]. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering [[Latin Inscriptions]] lies in the very extensive use of [[List of classical abbreviations|initials and abbreviations]]. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.&lt;ref&gt;A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in [[René Cagnat]]'s ''Cours d'épigraphie Latine'' (repr. 1923). A selection is included in [[Wikipedia]]'s "[[List of classical abbreviations]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as '''V.S.L.M.''' (''votum solvit libens merito''), or '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'') offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of ''[[tesserae]]'' or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

===Religious===

====Dedications and foundations of temples, etc.====
[[File:RMW - Weiheplakette Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Votive plaque for ''Victoria'', set by Flavius Primus, curator of the [[Turma]] [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximini]]&lt;ref&gt;It reads: ''Victo(riae) Fl(avius) P/rimus cur(ator) / tur(mae) Maxi/mini''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is '''D.D.''' (''dedit, donavit'') often with additions such as '''L.M.''' (''libens merito''). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and '''V.S.''' (''votum solvit'') is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of [[Equestrian order|equestrian status]]; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the [[Arval Brothers]]. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various collegese for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the [[Augurs]], the [[Fetiales]], the [[Salii]]; also the [[Sodales Augustales|Sodales Divorum Augustorum]] in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. [[Haruspices]] and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|Luperci]] were of equestrian rank.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word ''lex'' (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian orgies]] in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula '''QDERFP''' (''quid de ea re fieri placeret''); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with '''DERIC''' (''de ea re ita censuerunt''). '''C.''' is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of [[Diocletian]], [[Edict on Maximum Prices|fixing the prices of all commodities]]. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=E.R. Graser   |title=An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome Volume V: Rome and Italy of the Empire |editor=T. Frank |url= |accessdate= |year=1940 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press — esp. "A text and translation of the Edict of Diocletian" |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Records of buildings, etc.====
[[File:Hans lutz Pfk bozen.jpg|thumb|German inscription recording the building of [[Bozen]]-Bolzano's Parish Church ([[South Tyrol]]) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501–1519)]]
A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, roads, especially on [[milestone]]s, baths, [[basilica]]s, [[portico]]s and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., '''S.P.''', ''sua pecunia'') and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
[[File:AMG - Ziegel Cohors III.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brick stamp with military record: "C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)", from [[Bavaria]].]]

These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. "They are numerous and of all sorts — tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important."&lt;ref name="Haverf"&gt;{{aut|Francis Haverfield}}, "Roman Authority" in {{aut|S. R. Driver, D. G. Hogarth, F. L. Griffith}}, ''et al.'' ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature'', Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, "you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers."&lt;ref name="Haverf"/&gt;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in [[Roman Republic|republican times]]; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.
&lt;span id="FN1"&gt;
{{double image|right|Herakles Farnese MAN Napoli Inv6001 n01.jpg|130|Herakles Farnese MAN Napoli Inv6001 n07.jpg|260|Roman copy of [[Lysippus]]‘ ''[[Hercules]]'' (left) and copyist's signature (''Glykon Athenaios epoiei''→made by Glycon of Athens) on statue (right)}}

====Proxeny====
{{See also|Patronage in ancient Rome}}
This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'', by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (''[[cursus honorum]]''), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of [[Hercules]] by [[Lysippus]], of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was [[#FN1|made by Glycon (see images)]]. Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' in Rome, which records the great naval victory of [[Gaius Duilius]] over the [[Carthaginians]]; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]. The various sets of [[Fasti]] constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====
[[Image:Scipio-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tomb]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], erected around 150 BC, contains an [[Old Latin]] inscription in [[Saturnian Metre]].]]
These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipios]] at Rome, recording, mostly in [[Saturnian Metre]], the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.&lt;ref name="Cour"&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Edward Courtney   |title=MUSA LAPIDARIA: A Selection of Latin Verse Inscriptions |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters '''D.M.''' or '''D.M.S.''' (''Dis Manibus sacrum''), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the [[Manes|body of ghosts or spirits of the dead]]. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with '''H.I.''' (''Hic iacet''), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use — for instance, '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'', this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, '''V.S.F.''' (''vivus sibi fecit''). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.&lt;ref name="Cour"/&gt;

====Milestones and boundaries====
Milestones (''[[Miliarium#Milestones and markers|miliaria]]'') have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (''[[Boundary marker|termini]]'') are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called '''III. viri A.I.A.''' (''agris iudicandis adsignandis'') in the time of the [[Gracchi]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of [[Roman history]] and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is [[Roman history]] in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship — all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, [[Etruscology]], Italic and Latin [[philology]], ancient pottery, comparative [[palaeography]], Roman nomenclature, [[Latin verse]], [[lexicography]] (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography0, Roman architecture and [[prosopography]], and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arthur E. Gordon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Latin Epigraphy''], [[University of California Press]], 1983, Introd., pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estonian language''' ({{lang|et|eesti keel}} {{IPA-et|ˈeːsti ˈkeːl||et-eesti keel.ogg}}) is the official language of [[Estonia]], spoken natively by about 1.1 million people: 922,000 people in Estonia and 160,000 outside Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.estonica.org/en/Society/The_Estonian_Language/Estonian_in_a_world_context/ |title=Estonian in a world context |website=www.estonica.org |language=en |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Southern Finnic language and is the second most spoken language among all the [[Finnic languages]].

==Classification==
Estonian is closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and belongs to the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]]. It is one of the few [[languages of Europe]] that is not of an [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin. Despite some overlaps in the vocabulary due to borrowings, in terms of its origin, Estonian and Finnish are not related to their nearest geographical neighbours, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], which are all [[Indo-European languages]].

Although the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German languages|High German]] (including [[Standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.

Estonian is a predominantly [[agglutinative language]], but unlike Finnish, it has lost [[vowel harmony]], the front vowels occurring exclusively on the first or stressed syllable, although in older texts the vowel harmony can still be recognized. Furthermore, the loss of word-final sounds is extensive, and this has made its inflectional morphology markedly more [[fusional language|fusional]], especially with respect to noun and adjective inflection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Word order is considerably more flexible than English, but the basic order is [[subject–verb–object]].

==History==
The two different historical Estonian languages (sometimes considered [[dialects]]), the North and [[South Estonian language]]s, are based on the ancestors of modern Estonians' migration into the territory of Estonia in at least two different waves, both groups speaking considerably different [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] vernaculars.&lt;ref name="Rannut"/&gt; Modern standard Estonian has evolved on the basis of the dialects of Northern Estonia.

[[File:EstonianGrammar1637.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Estonian grammar]] published in Reval in 1637 by Heinrich Stahl]]
The oldest written records of the Finnic languages of Estonia date from the 13th century. ''Originates Livoniae'' in [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences.

===Estonian literature===
{{main article|Estonian literature}}
The earliest extant samples of connected (north) Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&amp;pg Aspects of Altaic Civilization By Denis Sinor] {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525 the first book published in the Estonian language was printed. The book was a Lutheran manuscript, which never reached the reader and was destroyed immediately after publication.

The first extant Estonian book is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.{{nbsp}}Wanradt and J.{{nbsp}}Koell dating to 1535, during the [[Protestant Reformation]] period. An Estonian grammar book to be used by priests was printed in German in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC |title=Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages |last=Dalby |first=Andrew |date=2004 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0231115695 |edition=rev. |location=New York |pages=182 |oclc=56555329}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Testament]] was translated into [[Võro language|southern Estonian]] in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two languages were united based on northern Estonian by [[Anton thor Helle]].

Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840)|Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750–1840).

The birth of native Estonian literature was in 1810 to 1820 when the patriotic and philosophical poems by [[Kristjan Jaak Peterson]] were published. Peterson, who was the first student at the then German-language [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] to acknowledge his Estonian origin, is commonly regarded as a herald of [[Estonian literature|Estonian national literature]] and considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. His birthday, March 14, is celebrated in [[Estonia]] as [[First language|Mother Tongue]] Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;pg=PA126 |title=Culture and Customs of the Baltic States |last=O'Connor |first=Kevin |date=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313331251 |pages=126 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fragment from Peterson's poem "Kuu" expresses the claim reestablishing the birthright of the Estonian language:

:''Kas siis selle maa keel''
:''Laulutuules ei või''
:''Taevani tõustes üles''
:''Igavikku omale otsida?''

In English:
:''Can the language of this land''
:''In the wind of incantation''
:''Rising up to the heavens''
:''Not seek for eternity?''
:::''Kristjan Jaak Peterson''
	
In the period from 1525 to 1917, 14,503 titles were published in Estonian; by comparison, between 1918 and 1940, 23,868 titles were published.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In modern times [[Jaan Kross]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kross Jaan Kross] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaan Kaplinski]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kaplinski Jaan Kaplinski] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; remain as two of [[Estonia]]'s best known and most translated writers.

===State language===
Writings in Estonian became significant only in the 19th century with the spread of the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840)|Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750–1840). Although [[Baltic Germans]] at large regarded the future of Estonians as being a fusion with themselves, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Estonia: Identity and Independence |last=Jansen |first=Ea |date=2004 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=90-420-0890-3 |editor-last=Subrenat |editor-first=Jean-Jacques |page=84 |translator-last=Cousins |translator-first=David |chapter=The National Awakening of the Estonian Nation |translator-last2=Dickens |translator-first2=Eric |translator-last3=Harding |translator-first3=Alexander |translator-last4=Waterhouse |translator-first4=Richard C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Estonian War of Independence]] in 1919, the Estonian language became the [[state language]] of the newly independent country. In 1945, 97.3% of Estonia considered itself ethnic Estonian&lt;ref name="Rannut"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Rannut |first=Mart |date=2004 |title=Language Policy in Estonia |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=996236 |journal=Noves SL.: Revista de sociolingüística |language=es |issue=1-2 |issn=1695-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke the language.

When Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union in [[World War II]], the status of the Estonian language changed to the first of two official languages (Russian being the other one).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&amp;pg=PA207 |title=Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education |last=Baker |first=Colin |last2=Jones |first2=Sylvia Prys |date=1998 |publisher=Multilingual Matters |isbn=1853593621 |pages=207 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Latvia many immigrants entered Estonia under Soviet encouragement.&lt;ref name="Rannut" /&gt; In the second half of the 1970s, the pressure of bilingualism (for Estonians) intensified, resulting in widespread knowledge of Russian throughout the country. The Russian language was termed as ‘the language of friendship of nations’ and was taught to Estonian children, sometimes as early as in kindergarten. Although teaching Estonian to non-Estonians in schools was compulsory, in practice learning the language was often considered unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Rannut" /&gt;

During the [[Perestroika]] era, The Law on the Status of the Estonian Language was adopted in January 1989. The 1991 collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] led to the restoration of the [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]]'s [[History of Estonia#Regaining independence|independence]]. Estonian went back to being the only [[state language]] in Estonia which in practice meant that use of Estonian was promoted while the use of [[Russian language|Russian]] was discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/europe/estonie.htm |title=Estonie |last=Leclerc |first=Jacques |publisher=Tlfq.ulaval.ca |access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The return of Soviet immigrants to their countries of origin has brought the proportion of Estonians in Estonia back above 70%. And again as in Latvia, today many of the remnant non-Estonians in Estonia have adopted the Estonian language; about 40% at the 2000 census.&lt;ref name="Rannut" /&gt;

== Dialects ==
[[File:Wastne Võro keeli A B D raamat.jpg|thumb|An 1885 ABC-book in [[Võro language|Võro]] written by [[Johann Hurt]]: "Wastne Võro keeli ABD raamat"]]
The Estonian dialects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.murre.ut.ee/assets/EESTIkhkingl.jpg |title=Map of Estonian Dialects |website=Tartu University’s Estonian Dialect Corpus |access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.murre.ut.ee/home/ |title=Home |date=2013-03-28 |website=Tartu University’s Estonian Dialect Corpus |access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; are divided into two groups&amp;nbsp;– the northern and southern dialects, historically associated with the cities of [[Tallinn]] in the north and [[Tartu]] in the south, in addition to a distinct ''kirderanniku'' dialect, [[Northeastern coastal Estonian]].

The northern group consists of the ''keskmurre'' or central dialect that is also the basis for the standard language, the ''läänemurre'' or western dialect, roughly corresponding to [[Lääne County]] and [[Pärnu County]], the ''saarte murre'' (islands') dialect of [[Saaremaa]] and [[Hiiumaa]] and the ''idamurre'' or eastern dialect on the northwestern [[shore]] of [[Lake Peipus]].

[[South Estonian]] consists of the Tartu, Mulgi, [[Võro language|Võro]] and [[Seto dialect|Seto]] varieties. These are sometimes considered either variants of South Estonian or separate languages altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture Tourism in South Estonia and Võru county|url=http://www.siksali.ee/cultour/EE_SituationAnalysisSummary_ENG.pdf|work=Siksali|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Seto and Võro distinguish themselves from each other less by language and more by their culture and their respective Christian confession.&lt;ref name="Rannut" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portaal.eki.ee/component/content/article/34-murded/46-murded.html |title=Estonian Dialects |website=The Institute of the Estonian Language |access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
{{main article|Estonian orthography}}

===Alphabet===
Estonian employs the [[Latin script]] as the basis for [[Estonian alphabet|its alphabet]], which adds the letters ''[[ä]]'', ''[[ö]]'', ''[[ü]]'', and ''[[õ]]'', plus the later additions ''[[š]]'' and ''[[ž]]''. The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are limited to [[proper names]] of foreign origin, and ''f'', ''z'', ''š'', and ''ž'' appear in loanwords and foreign names only. ''Ö'' and ''ü'' are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Finnish and Swedish (when followed by 'r'), ''Ä'' is pronounced [æ], as in English ''mat''. The vowels Ä, Ö and Ü are clearly separate [[phonemes]] and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter ''[[õ]]'' denotes {{IPA|/ɤ/}}, unrounded {{IPA|/o/}}, or a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]]. It is almost identical to the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[ъ]] {{IPA|/ɤ̞/}} and the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[ơ]], and is also used to transcribe the Russian [[ы]].

===Orthography===
Although the Estonian [[orthography]] is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each [[grapheme]] corresponding to one [[phoneme]], there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example preservation of the morpheme in [[declension]] of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced)&lt;!--examples needed--&gt; and in the use of 'i' and 'j'.{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Where it is very impractical or impossible to type ''š'' and ''ž'', they are substituted with ''sh'' and ''zh'' in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the ''h'' in ''sh'' represents a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], as in ''Pasha'' (''pas-ha''); this also applies to some foreign names.

Modern Estonian orthography is based on the ''Newer Orthography'' created by [[Eduard Ahrens]] in the second half of the 19th{{nbsp}}century based on Finnish orthography. The ''Older Orthography'' it replaced was created in the 17th{{nbsp}}century by [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius]] and [[Johann Hornung]] based on [[German language|standard German]] orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ''ad hoc'' orthography based on [[Latin]] and [[Middle Low German]] orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography — for example, writing 'W'/'w' instead of 'V'/'v' — persisted well into the 1930s.

Estonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources are often back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of "ya" for "ä" (e.g. Pyarnu instead of [[Pärnu]]), "y" instead of "õ" (e.g., Pylva instead of [[Põlva]]) and "yu" instead of "ü" (e.g., Pyussi instead of [[Püssi]]). Even in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' one can find "ostrov Khiuma", where "ostrov" means "island" in Russian and "Khiuma" is back-transliteration from Russian instead of "[[Hiiumaa]]" (''Hiiumaa'' &gt; Хийума(а) &gt; ''Khiuma'').

==Phonology==
{{Summarize|from|Estonian phonology|date=March 2015}}
{{main article|Estonian phonology}}There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.&lt;sup&gt;[[Estonian phonology#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only /ɑ e i o u/ occur as the second component. A vowel characteristic of Estonian is the unrounded back vowel /ɤ/, which may be [[Close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid back]], [[Close back unrounded vowel|close back]], or [[Close-mid central unrounded vowel|close-mid central]].

==Grammar==
{{main article|Estonian grammar}}
Typologically, Estonian represents a transitional form from an [[agglutinating language]] to a [[fusional language]]. The canonical word order is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beltranslations.com |title=beltranslations.com |language=ru |access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have [[grammatical gender]], but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[illative]], [[inessive]], [[Elative case|elative]], [[allative]], [[adessive]], [[ablative]], [[translative]], [[terminative]], [[essive]], [[abessive]], and [[comitative]], with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for ''kollane maja'' ("a yellow house") is ''kollasesse majja'' ("into a yellow house"), but the terminative is ''kollase majani'' ("as far as a yellow house"). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. ''maja&amp;nbsp;– majja'' and the [[Ostrobothnia (language)|Ostrobothnia]] dialect of Finnish ''maja&amp;nbsp;– majahan''.

The direct object of the verb appears either in the [[Accusative case|accusative]] (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects). The accusative coincides with the genitive in the singular and with nominative in the plural. Accusative vs. partitive case opposition of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] used with transitive verbs creates a [[telicity]] contrast, just as in Finnish. This is a rough equivalent of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect opposition.&lt;!-- Most books I've seen don't use an accusative case, although I suppose the grammar would make more sense with one. However, when the verb is imperative, the opposition is between nominative and partitive. --&gt;

The verbal system lacks a distinctive future tense&lt;ref name="apj"&gt;{{Cite journal|work=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |title=Language Shapes People's Time Perspective and Support for Future-Oriented Policies |last1=Pérez |first1=Efrén O. |last2=Tavits |first2=Margit |doi=10.1111/ajps.12290 |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher=[[Midwest Political Science Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (the "impersonal").

==Vocabulary==

{{main article|Estonian vocabulary}}

Although the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Often 'b' &amp; 'p' are interchangeable, for example 'baggage' becomes 'pagas', 'lob' (to throw) becomes 'loopima'. The initial letter 's' before another consonant is often dropped, for example 'skool' becomes 'kool', 'stool' becomes 'tool'.

===''Ex nihilo'' lexical enrichment===
Estonian [[language planning|language planners]] such as [[Ado Grenzstein]] (a journalist active in Estonia in the 1870s–90s) tried to use formation ''[[ex nihilo]]'', [[Urschöpfung]];&lt;ref name="Zuckermann 2003 p149"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |title-link=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |date=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |location=New York, N.Y. |pages=149 |author-link=Ghil'ad Zuckermann}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. they created new words out of nothing.

The most famous reformer of Estonian, [[Johannes Aavik]] (1880–1973), used creations ''ex nihilo'' (cf. ‘free constructions’, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf. Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). In Aavik’s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ''ex nihilo'', many of which are in common use today. Examples are
* ''ese'' ‘object’,
* ''kolp'' ‘skull’,
* ''liibuma'' ‘to cling’,
* ''naasma'' ‘to return, come back’,
* ''nõme'' 'stupid, dull.'&lt;ref name="Zuckermann 2003 p149" /&gt;

Many of the coinages that have been considered (often by Aavik himself) as words concocted ''ex nihilo'' could well have been influenced by foreign lexical items, for example words from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Aavik had a broad classical education and knew [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Consider  ''roim'' ‘crime’ versus [[English language|English]] ''crime'' or ''taunima'' ‘to condemn, disapprove’ versus [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''tuomita'' ‘to condemn, to judge’ (these Aavikisms appear in Aavik’s 1921 dictionary). These words might be better regarded as a peculiar manifestation of morpho-phonemic adaptation of a foreign lexical item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |date=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |location=New York, N.Y. |pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample text==
Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Estonian:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Kõik inimesed sünnivad vabadena ja võrdsetena oma väärikuselt ja õigustelt. Neile on antud mõistus ja südametunnistus ja nende suhtumist üksteisesse peab kandma vendluse vaim.

(All people are born free and equal in their dignity and rights. They are given reason and conscience and they shall create their relationships to one another according to the spirit of brotherhood.)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Eva Furnari''' (born 15 November 1948) is an Italian–Brazilian children's book writer and illustrator. She won the [[Prize Jabuti|Prêmio Jabuti]] for children's literature seven times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Eva Furnari|url = http://jornadasliterarias.upf.br/15jornada/index.php/autores/389-eva-furnari.html|website = jornadasliterarias.upf.br|accessdate = 2015-07-26|first = |last = Webmaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Funari was born in Rome. Her family moved to Brazil in 1950, when she was two. She graduated in architecture at the [[University of São Paulo]], and from 1976, began to venture into the publication of picture books, with no text. Furnari has collaborated in the children's section ''Folhinha'' of the newspaper  ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', in which she created one of her better-known characters, "Bruxinha".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Fountain''' is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[plain text]] [[markup language]] that makes it possible to write a formatted screenplay in any text editor, on any device, using any software that edits text files.&lt;ref&gt;Echo Hub: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131108063515/http://echohub.com/posts/video/fountain-scriptwriting-made-easier/ Fountain: Scriptwriting Made Easier]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fountain (which got its name from ''Fountain Avenue'', the famous Hollywood shortcut&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnaugust.com/2012/introducing-fountain Introducing Fountain]: ''Asked for advice on the best way an aspiring starlet could get into Hollywood, [[Bette Davis]] supposedly replied, “Take Fountain.”''&lt;/ref&gt;) was inspired by [[John Gruber]]’s [[Markdown]], and has its origins in two different and non-related projects: ''Scrippets'', developed by [[John August]] and Nima Yousefi, and ''Screenplay Markdown,'' developed by [[Stu Maschwitz]].

==History==
In 2004, John August, who has written four screenplays for [[Tim Burton]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Big Fish]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was looking for a Markdown-like syntax for formatting text documents into screenplay form. In 2008, he and Yousefi released ''Scrippets'', a plug-in for [[WordPress]] and other platforms that allowed users to embed short sections of a screenplay in [[blog]] posts and forums, using formatting hinted from plain text.&lt;ref&gt;WordPress: ''[http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-scrippets WP Scrippets]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Maschwitz, software director of [[Red Giant Software]] and co-founder of [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], was working on a similar but more extensive project, ''Screenplay Markdown'', that allowed plain text to be interpreted into a screenplay format.&lt;ref&gt;prolost.com: ''[http://prolost.com/blog/2011/8/9/screenplay-markdown.html Screenplay Markdown]''&lt;/ref&gt;

When August and Maschwitz realized they were both working on similar text-based screenplay formats, they decided to merge their projects, and the result was ''Fountain. ''&lt;ref&gt;prolost.com: ''[http://prolost.com/fountain Fountain]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Next Web: ''[https://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/02/09/fountain-is-a-new-markup-language-for-writing-screenplays Fountain is a new markup language for writing screenplays]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NoFilmSchool: ''[http://nofilmschool.com/2012/02/john-august-stu-maschwitz-release-fountain John August and Stu Maschwitz Release 'Fountain,' a Handy Screenwriting Tool / Markup Language]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
Fountain has since been implemented in several popular [[text editor]]s, [[word processor]]s and [[Screenwriting software|screenwriting applications]], such as [[BBEdit]], [[Emacs]], [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x JotterPad], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fountain-mode on GitHub|url=https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scrivener (software)|Scrivener]], [[Slugline (software)|Slugline]], [[Storyist]], [[Sublime Text]], [[TextWrangler]], [[Trelby]], [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], [https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/writer/id1046973568?mt=12 Writer] and many others.

The small group of '''Hachijō''' or ''Hachijōjima'' dialects are the most divergent form of [[Japanese dialects|Japanese]]. They are spoken on the southern [[Izu Islands]] south of [[Tokyo]], [[Hachijō Island]] and the smaller [[Aogashima]], as well as on the [[Daitō Islands]] of [[Okinawa Prefecture]], which were settled from Hachijō in the [[Meiji period]]. Based on the criterion of [[mutual intelligibility]], Hachijō may be considered a distinct Japonic language.

Hachijō dialects retain ancient [[Eastern Japanese]] features, as recorded in the 8th-century ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. There are also lexical similarities with the dialects of Kyushu and even the [[Ryukyuan languages]]; it is not clear if these indicate the southern Izu islands were settled from that region, if they are loans brought by sailors traveling among the southern islands, or if they might be independent retentions of [[Old Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Masayoshi Shibatani, 1990. ''The Languages of Japan''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
The dialect of Aogashima is quite distinct. There are also numerous dialects on Hachijō Island, with the speech of nearly every village distinct. There may be a few speakers left of the dialect of [[Hachijō-kojima|Little Hachijō Island]], which was abandoned in 1969.

==Grammar==
Hachijō uses the be-verb ''aru'' with all subjects, without the animate–inanimate (''iru–aru'') distinction made on the mainland. It also distinguishes between the attributive form ({{lang|ja|連体形}} ''{{transl|ja|rentaikei}}'') and terminal form ({{lang|ja|終止形}} ''{{transl|ja|shūshikei}}'') of verbs and adjectives, a distinction that existed in [[Early Middle Japanese]] but has all but vanished from the modern language.

==Vocabulary==
Hachijō preserves a number of phrases that have been otherwise lost in the rest of Japan, such as まぐれる ''magureru'' for standard 気絶する ''kizetsu suru'' 'to faint, pass out'. There are also words which occur in standard Japanese, but with different meanings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www008.upp.so-net.ne.jp/ohwaki/hougen.htm|title=八丈島の方言|trans-title=The Hachijō-jima dialect|website=Ōwaki izakaya|accessdate=2013-08-23|publisher=居酒屋おおわき}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hanno the Navigator''' ({{lang-xpu|𐤇‬𐤍‬𐤀‬‬}}, {{sc|ḥnʾ}}){{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA565 565]}} was a [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] explorer of the sixth or fifth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Fage |editor1-first= J. D. |editor2-last= Roland |editor2-first= Anthony Oliver |editor3-last= Roberts |editor3-first= A. D. |title= The Cambridge History of Africa |year= 1979 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-21592-3 |page= 134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; best known for his supposed naval exploration of the western coast of Africa.
The only source of his voyage is a Greek ''[[periplus]]''.  According to some modern analyses of his route, Hanno's expedition could have reached as far south as [[Gabon]], however, others have taken him no further than southern Morocco.

== Expedition ==
Carthage dispatched Hanno at the head of a fleet of 60 ships to explore and [[colony|colonize]] the northwestern coast of [[Africa]].{{Sfn|Warmington|1964|pp=74–76}} He sailed through the [[straits of Gibraltar]], founded or repopulated seven colonies along the African coast of what is now Morocco, and explored significantly farther along the Atlantic coast of the continent.  Hanno encountered various [[indigenous people]]s on his journey and met with a variety of welcomes.

{{anchor|Gorillas}}
=== Gorillai ===

At the terminus of Hanno's voyage, the explorer found an island heavily populated with what were described as hirsute and savage people.  Attempts to capture the males failed, but three of the females were taken. These were so ferocious that they were killed, and their skins preserved for transport home to Carthage. The skins were kept in the Temple of Juno ([[Tanit]] or [[Astarte]]) on Hanno's return and, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], survived until the [[Destruction of Carthage|Roman destruction of Carthage]] in 146 BC, some 350 years after Hanno's expedition.&lt;ref name="Jona Lendering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/person/hanno-1-the-navigator/hanno-1-the-navigator-2/ |title=Hanno the Navigator |author=Jona Lendering |date= |website=Livius.org Articles on Ancient History |publisher= |access-date=16 May 2015 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319010921/http://www.livius.org/person/hanno-1-the-navigator/hanno-1-the-navigator-2/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hoyos |first=Dexter  |title=The Carthaginians  |publisher=Routledge |year=2010  |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=tx7GBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT109 |page=53 |isbn=978-0415436458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreters travelling with Hanno called the people ''Gorillai'' (in the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text {{lang|grc|Γόριλλαι}}). When the American physician and missionary [[Thomas S.

== Periplus account ==
[[File:HannoRouteMap.svg|thumb|The "Mount Cameroon" personnel interpretation of the route.]]
The primary source for Hanno's expedition is a Greek ''[[periplus]]'', supposedly a translation of a tablet Hanno is reported to have hung up on his return to Carthage in the temple of [[Baal Hammon|Ba'al Hammon]], whom Greek writers identified with [[Cronus|Kronos]]. The full title translated from Greek is ''The Voyage of Hanno, commander of the Carthaginians, round the parts of [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] beyond the [[Pillars of Heracles]], which he deposited in the Temple of Kronos''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In the fifth century, the text was translated into a rather mediocre Greek. It was not a complete rendering; several abridgments were made. The abridged translation was copied several times by Greek and [[Byzantine]] clerks. Currently, there are only two copies, dating back to the ninth and the fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Jona Lendering"/&gt;

The first of these manuscripts is known as the Palatinus Graecus 398 and can be studied in the [[University of Heidelberg|University Library of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpgraec398?sid=cfdcb7247b558798b9022a384f4c011c&amp;ui_lang=eng |title=Codex Palatinus Graecus 398 |date= |website=Heidelberger historische Bestände |publisher=University Library Heidelberg|access-date=16 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other text is in the Codex Vatopedinus 655, found in the [[Vatopedi monastery]] in [[Mount Athos]], Greece, and dated to the beginning of the 14th century; the codex is divided between the [[British Library]]&lt;ref name=bull&gt;British Library.

== Ancient authors' accounts ==
The text was known to [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Arrian of Nicomedia]].

=== Herodotus' account ===
The Greek historian Herodotus (ca.480–425 BC) gives a story based probably upon Hanno's original report.
{{quote|text=The Carthaginians tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya beyond the Pillars of Herakles. On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; and if they think it presents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away.|sign=Herodotus  of Halicarnassus|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/logoi.html |title=Histories 4.196 |author=Herodotus |others=translation Aubrey de Selincourt |date= |website=Livius.org |publisher= |access-date=16 May 2015 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504214024/http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/logoi.html |archivedate= 4 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Pliny the Elder's account ===
According to [[Pliny the Elder]], Hanno started his journey at the same time that [[Himilco]] started to explore the European Atlantic coast. Pliny reports that Hanno actually managed to circumnavigate the African continent, from [[Cadiz|Gades]] to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History 2.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrian's account ===
Arrian mentions Hanno's voyage at the end of his ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'' VIII (Indica):
{{quote|text=Moreover, Hanno the Libyan started out from [[Carthage]] and passed the [[Pillars of Heracles]] and sailed into the outer Ocean, with Libya on his port side, and he sailed on towards the east, five-and-thirty days all told. But when at last he turned southward, he fell in with every sort of difficulty, want of water, blazing heat, and fiery streams running into the sea.|sign=Arrian of Nicomedia|source=&lt;ref name="ArrianBrunt1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arrian|author2=P.

== Modern analysis of the route ==

A number of modern scholars have commented upon Hanno's voyage.  In many cases, the analysis has been to refine information and interpretation of the original account.  William Smith points out that the complement of personnel totalled 30,000, and that the core mission included the intent to found Carthaginian (or in the older parlance 'Libyophoenician') towns.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=William |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |year=2005 |origyear=First published 1870 |publisher=The Ancient Library |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1454.html |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |volume=2 |page=346 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026213757/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1454.html |archivedate=October 26, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have questioned whether this many people accompanied Hanno on his expedition, and suggest 5,000 is a more accurate number.&lt;ref name="Jona Lendering"/&gt; Robin Law notes that "It is a measure of the obscurity of the problem that while some commentators have argued that Hanno reached the Gabon area, others have taken him no further than southern Morocco."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.C.C. Law|editor1-last=Fage|editor1-first=J.D.|title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 2|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521215923|page=135|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTNTz3POoZUC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=hanno+gabon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW6fDW2obLAhUJfhoKHc39AMYQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=hanno%20gabon&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 February 2016|chapter=North Africa in the period of Phoenician and greek colonization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harden reports a general consensus that the expedition reached at least as far as [[Senegal]].{{Sfn|Harden|1971|p=168}} Some agree he could have reached [[Gambia]]. However, Harden mentions disagreement as to the farthest limit of Hanno's explorations: [[Sierra Leone]], [[Cameroon]], or [[Gabon]]. He notes the description of [[Mount Cameroon]], a {{convert|4040|m|ft|adj=on}} [[volcano]], more closely matches Hanno's description than Guinea's {{convert|890|m|ft|adj=on}} Mount Kakulima. Warmington prefers Mount Kakulima, considering [[Mount Cameroon]] too distant.{{Sfn|Warmington|1964|pp=79}}

Warmington suggests{{Sfn|Warmington|1964|p=76}} that difficulties in reconciling the account's specific details with present geographical understanding are consistent with classical reports of Carthaginian determination to maintain sole control of trade into the Atlantic.
{{quote|text=This report was the object of criticism by some ancient writers, including the [[Pliny the Elder]], and in modern times a whole literature of scholarship has grown up around it. The account is incoherent and at times certainly incorrect, and attempts to identify the various places mentioned on the basis of the sailing directions and distances almost all fail. Some scholars resort to textual emendations, justified in some cases; but it is probable that what we have before us is a report deliberately edited so that the places could not be identified by the competitors of Carthage. From everything we know about Carthaginian practice, the resolute determination to keep all knowledge of and access to the western markets from the Greeks, it is incredible that they would have allowed the publication of an accurate description of the voyage for all to read. What we have is an official version of the real report made by Hanno which conceals or falsifies vital information while at the same time gratifying the pride of the Carthaginians in their achievements. The very purpose of the voyage, the consolidation of the route to the gold market, is not even mentioned.}}The historian Raymond Mauny, in his 1955 article ''La navigation sur les côtes du Sahara pendant l'antiquité'', argued that the ancient navigators (Hannon, Euthymène, Scylax, etc ..) could not have sailed south in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] farther than [[Cape Bojador]]. He pointed out that antique geographers knew of the Canary Islands but nothing further south. Ships with square sails, without stern rudder, might navigate south, but the winds and currents throughout the year would prevent the return trip from Senegal to Morocco. Oared ships might be able to achieve the return northward, but only with very great difficulties. Mauny assumed that Hanno did not get farther than the [[Draa River|Drâa]]. He attributed artifacts found on [[Mogador island]] to the expedition described in the [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]] and notes that no evidence of Mediterranean trade further south had yet been found.

The '''Institute for the Languages of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Kotimaisten kielten keskus}}, abbreviated ''KOTUS'', {{lang-smn|Päikkieennâm kielâi tutkâmkuávdáš}}, {{lang-se|Ruovttueatnan gielaid guovddáš}}, {{lang-sms|Dommjânnmlaž ǩiõli kõõskõs}}, {{lang-rom|Finnosko tšimbengo instituutos}}, {{lang-sv|Institutet för de inhemska språken}}) is a governmental [[Linguistics|linguistic]] research institute of [[Finland]] geared at studies of [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (cf. [[Finland Swedish]]), the [[Sami languages]], [[Romani language]], and the [[Finnish Sign Language]].

The institute is charged with the standardization of languages used in Finland. In the Swedish language, the institute usually promotes the Swedish usage, with the key aim to prevent the Swedish spoken in Finland from straying too far from its counterpart in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073020/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?l=en&amp;s=205 Swedish]. Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. 12-14-2006. Retrieved 11-22-2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the institute is the foremost authority on Finnish [[language planning]] and its recommendations are considered to define the standard Finnish which is used in official communication. In addition to these tasks, the Institute also has an important consulting function in the shaping of Finnish language policy and in choosing [[toponyms of Finland|toponyms]].

'''Judeo-Persian''', or '''Jidi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|d|iː}}; also spelled ''Dzhidi'' or ''Djudi''), refers to both a group of [[Jewish dialects]] spoken by the [[Jew]]s living in [[Iran]] and Judeo-Persian texts (written in [[Hebrew alphabet]]). As a collective term, Dzhidi refers to a number of [[Judeo-Iranian languages]] spoken by Jewish communities throughout the formerly extensive [[Persian Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} On a more limited scale, Dzhidi refers to the Judeo-Persian dialect spoken by the Jewish communities of the area around [[Tehran]] and [[Mashhad]].

==Persian words in Hebrew and Aramaic==
The earliest evidence of the entrance of Persian words into the language of the [[Israelites]] is found in the [[Bible]]. The post-[[Babylonian captivity|exilic]] portions, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], contain besides many [[Persian language|Persian]] proper names and titles, a number of nouns (as "dat" or "daad" in current Persian = "law"; "genez" or "Ganj" in current Persian = "treasure"; "pardes" or "Pardis" or "ferdos" in current Persian= "park, which is the main root of English word "Paradise") which came into permanent use at the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

More than five hundred years after the end of that [[dynasty]] the Jews of the Babylonian diaspora again came under the dominion of the Persians; and among such Jews the Persian language held a position similar to that held by the [[Greek language]] among the Jews of the West. Persian became to a great extent the language of everyday life among the Jews of Babylonia; and a hundred years after the conquest of that country by the [[Sassanids]] an [[Amoraim|amora]] of [[Pumbedita]], Rab Joseph (d. 323), declared that the Babylonian Jews had no right to speak Aramaic, and should instead use either Hebrew or Persian. Aramaic, however, remained the language of the Jews in Israel as well as of those in [[Babylonia]], although in the latter country a large number of Persian words found their way into the language of daily intercourse and into that of the schools, a fact which is attested by the numerous Persian derivatives in the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]. But in the [[Aramaic]] [[Targum]] there are very few Persian words, because after the middle of the third century the Targumim on the [[Pentateuch]] and the [[Prophet]]s were accepted as authoritative and received a fixed textual form in the Babylonian schools. In this way they were protected from the introduction of Persian elements.

==Literature==
There is an extensive Judeo-Persian poetic religious literature, closely modeled on classical Persian poetry.  The most famous poet was [[Shahin Shirazi | Mowlānā Shāhin-i Shirāzi]] ([[14th century CE]]), who composed epic versifications of parts of the Bible, such as the ''Musā-nāmah'' (an epic poem recounting the story of Moses); later poets composed lyric poetry of a [[Sufi]] cast.  Much of this literature was collected around the beginning of the twentieth century by the ּּBukharian rabbi [[Shimon Hakham]], who founded a printing press in Israel.

[[File:Polskie Morawy.png|thumb|right|300px|Former Lach speaking places in modern-day Poland (yellow, percentage as of 1910)]]
The '''Lachian dialects''' ('''Lach dialects''', {{lang-cs|lašská nářečí, lašstina}}, {{lang-pl|gwary laskie}}, not to be confused with the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic language]] group) are a group of [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] [[dialect]]s that form a transition between the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language]]. They are spoken in parts of [[Czech Silesia]], the [[Hlučín Region]], and northeastern [[Moravia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hannan 1996, 726.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some adjacent villages in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannan 1996, 730.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Czech researchers consider Lach a dialect of Czech, whereas Polish dialectologists tend to ascribe Polish origins to Lach.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bąk, ''Mowa polska na Śląsku'', Wrocław and Warsaw 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lachian, which is close to the [[Polish language]], is divided into numerous subdialects (Western, Eastern and Southern), it can therefore also be regarded as a [[dialect continuum]], with limited [[mutual intelligibility]] between the eastern and western dialects. This dialectal differentiation is not typical for the Czech Republic, where there is a good deal of [[dialect leveling]], especially in the west of the republic.

Most Lachs, especially younger speakers, now speak Czech, and use it as a written language, while Lach remains the language of everyday speech. Lachian contains many German [[loanword]]s, according to some sources,{{which?|date=July 2017}} up to 8% of the vocabulary.

The poet [[Óndra Łysohorsky]] is probably the best-known writer in a Lachian dialect. Łysohorsky was notable for refusing to write in Standard Czech, instead writing in the local dialect of Upper Silesia.  In doing so, he contributed significantly to the development of the Lach literary language.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan 1996, 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinguished from the Czech language in the west and the Slovak language in the south chiefly by the stress on the penultimate syllable, from the Polish language in the east chiefly by the absence of nasal vowels.

'''Middle Frisian''' evolved from [[Old Frisian]] from the 16th century and was spoken until c. 1820, considered the beginning of the Modern period of the [[Frisian languages]].

Up until the 15th century [[Old Frisian]] was a language widely spoken and written in what are now the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] province of [[Friesland]] (Fryslân), in 1498 - when Duke [[Albert of Saxony]] replaced Frisian as the language of government with [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. As late as 1599, the London dramatist [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] could introduce whole scenes in the mixed Frisian-Dutch argot of the coast in ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'', in confidence that his English-speaking audience could follow it.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards this practice was continued under the [[Habsburg]] rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his son, the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of [[Holland]] as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.

In this period the great Frisian poet [[Gysbert Japix]] (1603–1666), a [[schoolmaster]] and [[Cantus|cantor]] from the city of [[Bolsward|Boalsert]], seen as the father of modern [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] literature and spelling, was an exception to the trend. His example was not followed until the 19th century, when new generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared.

This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of ''Súdwesthoeksk''. Therefore, the Modern Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.

'''Nomatsiguenga''' (Matsigenka) is an [[Arawakan language]] of [[Peru]]. It is close enough to [[Machiguenga language|Machiguenga]] to sometimes be considered dialects of a single language, especially given that both are spoken by the [[Machiguenga people]]. Most speakers are monolingual.

==Grammar==
Nomatsiguenga is one of the few languages in the world that has two different [[causative]] mechanisms to denote whether the causer was involved in the activity with the causee or not. The prefix ''ogi-'' is used to express the idea that the causer was ''not'' involved in the activity, while the suffix ''-hag'' is used when the causer ''is'' involved.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, M.R. (1986).

[[File:Faroe stamp 514 vagar - midvagur.jpg|thumb|This 2005 stamp of the [[Faroe Islands]] is a typical example of modern stamp design: minimal text, intense color, artistic rendering of a country-specific subject.]]

'''Postage stamp design''' is the activity of [[graphic design]] as applied to [[postage stamp]]s. Many thousands of designs have been created since a profile bust of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was adopted for the [[Penny Black]] in 1840; some designs have been considered very successful, others
less so.

A stamp design includes several elements required for it to accomplish its purpose satisfactorily. Most important is the denomination indicating its monetary value, while international agreements require a country name on almost all types of stamps.  A graphic design is very nearly universal; in addition to making [[counterfeit]]s harder to produce and aiding clerks in quick recognition of appropriate postage, postal customers simply expect stamps to carry a design.

== Denomination ==
[[File:Stamp China 1949 1000 gold engr.jpg|upright|thumb|A prominent denomination on a 1949 stamp of China.]]
The fundamental purpose of a stamp is to indicate the prepayment of postage. Since different kinds and sizes of mail normally pay different amounts of postage, the stamps need to carry a value. In a very few cases, the [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]] has been omitted; for instance, during the tumults of 1949 China, undenominated stamps were issued, so as to allow the price of a stamp to fluctuate on a daily basis depending on the value of the [[gold yuan]].

The usual form of the denomination is a number, optionally preceded or followed by a currency symbol. Many early stamps wrote the denomination out in words, but the [[Universal Postal Union]] later required that stamps on international mail use [[Arabic numerals]], for the benefit of clerks in foreign countries.  A number of recent stamps have substituted a textual description of the rate being charged, such as "1st" for [[first-class letter]]s, or "presorted ZIP+4" to indicate a particular type of [[bulk mail]].  Another form of nonnumerical denomination is that used for [[rate change stamp]]s, in which the timing and politics of the rate-setting process is such that the stamps must be printed before the rate is known. In such cases, the preprinted stamps simply state "A", "B", etc., with the equivalent rate being announced just before they go on sale.

Canada also uses a non-numerical denomination, the mark "P" printed over a maple leaf, on its domestic postage rate stamps. The letter "P" stands for "Permanent" which indicates that the stamp is always accepted regardless of the current domestic postal rate.  Anytime the domestic rate changes, the permanent value stamps already in circulation continue to be accepted and the new rate applies to the purchase of new permanent value stamps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadapost.ca/web/en/kb/details.page?article=what_are_permanent_s&amp;cattype=kb&amp;cat=sending&amp;subcat=generalinformationps&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Semi-postal stamp]]s are usually denominated with two values, with a "+" between, the first indicating the actual rate, and the second the additional amount to be given to a charity. In a very few cases a country has had a [[dual currency]], and the stamps may depict a value in both currencies.

== Country name ==
[[File:Penny black.jpg|thumb|upright|A British [[Penny Black]] with no country name designation.]]
The second required element, at least for stamps intended to be used on international mail, is the name of the country. The first postage stamps, those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], had no name. In 1874 the Universal Postal Union exempted Great Britain from its rule which stated that a country's name had to appear on their postage stamps, so a profile of the reigning monarch was all that was required for identification of Britain's stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce&amp;nbsp;Petersen |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2040510 |title=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |publisher=Arago.si.edu |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day the UK remains the only country not required to name itself on its stamps.  For all other UPU members, the name must appear in [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]].
[[File:Stamp Ubangi-Shari 1924 1c.jpg|right|thumb|A 1924 French Colony stamp with no less than four country names.]] Many countries using non-Latin alphabets used only those on their early stamps, and they remain difficult for most collectors to identify today.

The name chosen is typically the country's own name for itself, with a modern trend towards using simpler and shorter forms, or abbreviations.  For instance, the [[Republic of South Africa]] inscribes with "RSA", while [[Jordan]] originally used "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan", and now just "Jordan".  Some countries have multiple allowed forms, from which the designer may choose the most suitable. The name may appear in an adjectival form, as in ''Posta Romana'' ("Romanian Post") for Romania. Dependent territories may or may not include the name of the parent country.

== Graphic design ==
The graphic element of a stamp design falls into one of four major categories:

* Portrait bust - profile or full-face
* Emblem - coat of arms, flag, national symbol, posthorn, etc.
* Numeric - a design built around the numeral of value
* Pictorial

The use of portrait busts (of the ruler or other significant person) or emblems was typical of the first stamps, by extension from [[currency]], which was the closest model available to the early stamp designers.

Usage pattern has varied considerably; for 60 years, from 1840 to 1900, all British stamps used exactly the same portrait bust of Victoria, enclosed in a dizzying variety of frames, while Spain periodically updated the image of [[Alfonso XIII]] as he grew from child to adult. Norway has issued stamps with the same posthorn motif for over a century, changing only the details from time to time as printing technology improves, while the US has placed the [[flag of the United States]] into a wide variety of settings since first using it on a stamp in the 1950s.

[[File:Stamp Netherlands Antilles 1915 2.5c.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A 2½-cent numeral design from 1915 [[Netherlands Antilles]].]]

While numeral designs are eminently practical, in that they emphasize the most important element of the stamp, they are the exception rather than the rule.

By far the greatest variety of stamp design seen today is in pictorial issues. The choice of image is nearly unlimited, ranging from plants and animals, to figures from history, to landscapes, to original artwork. Images may represent real-world objects, or be allegories or abstract designs.

[[File:Stamp DK 1975 130o.jpg|upright|thumb|135 years after the Penny Black, this Danish stamp depicting [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe]] has the same general layout.]]
The choice of pictorial designs is governed by a combination of anniversaries, required annual issues (such as [[Christmas stamp]]s), postal rate changes, exhaustion of existing stamp stocks, and popular demand. Since postal administrations are either a branch of government or an official monopoly under governmental supervision, the government has ultimate control over the choice of designs. This means that the designs tend to depict a country as the government would like it to be perceived, rather than as it really is. The [[Soviet Union]] issued thousands of stamps extolling the successes of communism, even as it was falling apart, while in the US the only contemporary stamp hinting at the unrest of the 1960s is an issue exhorting Americans to support their local police.

In some cases, overt political pressure has resulted in a backlash; a famous example is that of the US in the late 1940s, when the US Congress had direct authority over stamp design, and a large number of issues were put out merely to please a representative's constituency or industry lobbyists. The resulting uproar resulted in the formation of an independent 
[[Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee]] that reviews and chooses from hundreds of proposals received each year. Occasionally the public is polled for its choice of design, as with the US [[Elvis stamp]] of 1993, or some issues of the Celebrate the Century series.

Many countries have specific rules governing the choice of designs or design elements.  Stamps of the UK must depict the sovereign (typically as a silhouette), while stamps of the US may not visibly depict any person who has been dead for less than 10 years, except for ex-Presidents, who may appear on a stamp one year after their demise. The choice of [[postage stamp color]] may be specified, acting as a sort of [[color code]] to different rates.

Most countries issue [[commemorative stamps|commemorative issues]] from time to time, perhaps to celebrate some special event, with designs relating to the event. While they are legitimate postage stamps, and often used for routine post, they are intended to appeal particularly to 
[[stamp collecting|stamp collectors]]. Stamps that are collected without being used are paid for, but the purchaser chooses not to use the postal service purchased, leaving 100% clear profit. [[first day of issue|First day covers]], often containing more stamps than are required for postage, are an additional source of revenue. This source of money is not inexhaustible, as excessive stamp issues go unpurchased.

Some countries, usually poorer ones, produce many special issues intended purely for collectors from other countries. These stamps are designed for visual appeal, with attractive brightly coloured designs on interesting topics, often large and of unusual shape. Themes have included space-related subjects from a country with no space program, polar animals from a country on the equator, Western rock stars from a conservative Muslim country, and so forth. International organizations of philatelists discourage the practice, not wanting collectors to be discouraged by floods of stamps which will never have any rarity value. See [[stamp program]] for more detail.

== Textual elements ==
[[File:Rabbi Bar-Ilan (Berlin) Israel stamp.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Textual elements written in a variety of scripts on a stamp of Israel.]]

Nearly all stamps have some amount of text embedded in their design. In addition to the expected denomination and country name, textual elements may include a statement of purpose ("postage", "official mail", etc.), a [[plate number]], the name of a person being portrayed, the occasion being commemorated, the year of stamp issue, and national mottoes.

Occasionally designs use text as their primary design element; for instance, a series of US stamps from the 1970s featured quotations from the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. In general however, text has come to be used more sparingly in recent years.

Countries with multiple languages and multiple scripts may need to write the material multiple times. [[Labuan]] is an early example; more recently, stamps of Israel include its name in Hebrew, Latin, and Arabic characters.

In addition to text woven into the description, stamps may also have inscriptions in the outside margin. These are almost always at the bottom, and are usually the name of the printer and/or designer. Occasionally a textual description of the design is found in the margin, while in recent years, the lower left margin has become a common place to include the year of issue. Philatelists count changes in these marginal inscriptions as distinct types of stamps.

== Hidden elements and "secret marks" ==
Sometimes designers include tiny elements into a design, sometimes at the request of the stamp-issuing authority, sometimes on their own. Stamps may have a year or name worked into a design, while the US stamp honoring Rabbi [[Bernard Revel]] has a minute [[Star of David]] visible in his beard.

[[Secret mark]]s are small design alterations added to distinguish printings unambiguously. These usually take the form of small lines or marks added to clear areas of a design. Chinese stamps of the 1940s have secret marks in the form of slightly altered characters, where two arms might be changed to touch, when previously they were separate.

== Shape and size ==
[[File:Stamp shapes.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps of various shapes and sizes, from Italy, [[Yemen Arab Republic]], France, and Hungary.]]
The usual shape of a postage stamp is a [[rectangle]], this being an efficient way to pack stamps on a sheet. A rectangle wider than tall is called a "horizontal design", while taller than wide is a "vertical design".

A number of additional shapes have been used, including [[triangle]]s, [[rhombus]]es, [[octagon]]s, [[circle]]s, and various freeform shapes including heart shapes, and even a banana shaped stamp issued by [[Tonga]] from 1969 to 1985.

The usual size ranges from 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;mm in each direction, experience having shown this to be the easiest to handle. Many countries use only a limited selection of dimensions, to simplify automated machinery that handles stamps.

The smallest postage stamp on record was issued by [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] in 1856, and was a square, with sides measuring 10 millimeters.

The biggest stamps in history were used in the United States from 1865 and measured 52 by 95 millimeters, but were used exclusively for mailing newspapers.

== Design evolution ==
Stamp design has undergone a gradual process of evolution, traceable both to advances in printing technology and general changes in taste. Design "fads" may also be observed, where a number of countries tend to imitate each other. This may be driven by printing houses, many of which design and print stamps for multiple countries.

[[File:Stamp French PO Alexandria 1927 250m.jpg|right|thumb|This classic [[Art Nouveau]] design of 1900s France and her colonies continued in use into the 1920s.]]

For instance, although multi-color printing was always possible, and may be seen on the earliest stamps of Switzerland, the process was slow and expensive, and most stamps were in one or two colors until the 1960s.

From time to time postal administrations also try experiments.  For instance, the US tried issuing very small stamps during the 1970s, as a cost savings measure. They were extremely unpopular, and the experiment was abandoned.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stamp CA 1973 8c Xmas.jpg|left|upright|thumb|"Posterization" on a Canadian Christmas stamp of 1973.]] --&gt;
While modern tastes tend to favor simpler designs, some countries have also put out "retro" designs, using modern techniques to mimic the more elaborate designs of the past, perhaps even with anachronistic elements. A 2004 example is the Lewis and Clark stamps of the US, whose frames are classic 19th-century, surrounding full-color portraits of a quality not available until the latter half of the 20th century.

== Design process ==
Once a general subject has been chosen, the postal administration typically contracts an outside artist to produce a design.

In working up a design, the artist must take into account the rules and constraints as mentioned above, and perhaps additional requirements, such as membership in a series of related designs.

[[File:Stamp Peru 1970 1.20s Xmas.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Even as a large-format design, this painting on a stamp of [[Peru]] looks like a muddle, and magnification
merely shows the physical limitations of the printing process.]]

In addition, the artist must consider the consequence of working on a small "canvas"; for instance, traditional paintings often reduce into an amorphous blur, and so the stamp designer will opt to pick a single interesting and/or characteristic detail as the center of the design. Similarly, a stamp consisting of simply a portrait will mean little to many users, and the artist may opt to include a visual element suggesting the person's accomplishments, such as an architect's most famous building, or simply add the word "architect" somewhere in the design.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Stamp CA 1981 17c Acadia.jpg|thumb|This painting representing [[Acadia]] works because of its strong lines, strong colors, and reduction to motifs most evocative of that part of Canada. (Note the bilingual inscription.)]] --&gt;

The artist then submits one or more designs for the postal administration's approval. The accepted design may undergo several rounds of modification before entering the [[postage stamp production|production process]]. The design may also be abandoned, perhaps if circumstances have changed, such as a change of government.

Designs may also be modified as a result of other considerations; for instance, the design of a US stamp honoring Jackson Pollock was based on a photograph showing him smoking a cigarette, but not desiring to be promoting, the cigarette was removed from the design. In general, stamps are not photographic reproductions of the subjects they depict.

== Design successes and failures ==
In the end, successful stamp designs receive relatively little notice from the general public, but considerable praise from the philatelic press.  Publications such as ''[[Linn's Stamp News]]'' will headline the most interesting new stamps on their front page, and report the results of popularity polls.

On the other side, design errors regularly get through the multiple stages of review and checking. Errors have ranged from minute points of rendition (such as the subtly reversed ears on an Austrian stamp of the 1930s), to misrepresentations of disputed territory in maps, to mistaken text ("Sir Codrington" on 1920s Greece), to the truly spectacular, such as the US "[[Legends of the West]]" sheet using the picture of the wrong person. See [[stamp design error]] for further detail.

Another category of failure includes designs that are simply rejected by the stamp-buying public. The [[:ru:Алкоголизм (марка США)|1981 anti-alcoholism stamp]] of the US is a well-known example; it consists merely of the slogan "Alcoholism: You Can Beat It!", which must have looked good during the design process, but affixed to the corner of an envelope it suggests that the recipient is an alcoholic in need of public encouragement, and few people ever used this stamp on their mail.

'''Pramodkumar Bhagubhai Patel''' ({{lang-gu|પ્રમોદકુમાર ભગુભાઈ પટેલ}}; 1933–1996) was [[Gujarati language]] critic from [[Gujarat]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wptKAQAAIAAJ|title=Indian Horizons|publisher=Indian Council for Cultural Relations.|year=1999|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Patel  was born on 20 September 1933 at Khara-Abrahma village (now in [[Valsad district]], Gujarat, India). His family belonged to Moti Karod village. He completed his schooling from Khara-Abhrama. He completed B. A. with Gujarati in 1957 and M. A. in 1959 from  [[University of Bombay]]. He also completed Ph.D in Gujarati in 1969 from the same university. His subject of thesis was ''Gujaratima Kavyatatvavichar: Narmad, Navalram, Ramanbhai Nilkanth, Narsinhrao Divetia ane Manilal Dwivedina Kavyavicharnu Samikshatmak Adhyayan''. He taught at the arts college in [[Bardoli]] initially and later at [[Sardar Patel University]], [[Vallabh Vidyanagar]]. He died on 24 May 1996.&lt;ref name="AGSI"&gt;{{cite book|title=અર્વાચીન ગુજરાતી સાહિત્યનો ઈતિહાસ - આધુનિક અને અનુઆધુનિક યુગ|last=Brahmabhatt|first=Prasad|publisher=Parshwa Publication|year=2010|isbn=978-93-5108-247-7|location=Ahmedabad|pages=315–317|language=gu|trans-title=History of Modern Gujarati Literature – Modern and Postmodern Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | title=પ્રમોદકુમાર પટેલ|trans-title=Pramodkumar Patel | website=[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Pramodkumar-Patel.html| language=gu | accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His critical focus was on modern literature. Along with [[theoretical criticism]], he also critically examined Gujarati poetry, short stories and novels.&lt;ref name="Desai2011"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Desai|editor-first=Rakesh|title=Society and Literature: Narmad in Critical Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWqnjwEACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=[[Veer Narmad South Gujarat University]]|location=Surat|isbn=978-81-921045-0-8|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rasasiddhant – Ek Parichay'' (1980), ''Pannalal Patel'' (1984) and ''Gujaratima Vivechan Tatvavichar'' (1985) are his works of criticism. ''Rasasiddhant – Ek Parichay'' discusses India poetics and its tradition. ''Pannalal Patel'' was published under ''Gujarati Granthkar Shreni'' (Gujarati Writer Series) which throw light on personality, influences, creativity development and works of [[Pannalal Patel]]. ''Gujaratima Vivechan Tatvavichar'' focuses on history of criticism in Gujarati literature.&lt;ref name="AGSI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

'''Prelap''' is a [[screenwriting]] term that means the [[dialogue]] from the next [[Scene (film)|scene]] precedes the [[cut (transition)|cut]], and the beginning of the dialogue is heard in the outgoing scene . As an example:

 			ADRIAN (V.O., PRELAP)
 		Peter?  Peter, where are you?
 
 EXT. THE WOODS – DAY
 
 Adrian is out looking for Peter.  
 We see him wander around in the small forest.
 
 			ADRIAN
 		Peter?  Hello?  Are you there?

In this example, Adrian's voice precedes the scene out in the woods. The "V.O." means "[[Voiceover|Voice Over]]" and the "PRELAP" indicates that Adrian's dialogue should be heard before the next scene begins. Adrian, in this example, might not even be in the scene the other characters are in when the prelap occurs. ("O.S." or "Off Screen" would not be appropriate as the term should only be used for characters unseen but on set.)

''Prelaps'' can be of sound or dialogue, or anything non-visual, since a visual would indicate a direct cut to a new scene.

[[File:Situ aprmay91.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''Situ'' dated April–May 1991.]]
'''Prem Bahadur Kansakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: प्रेम बहादुर कंसकार) (1918–1991) was a Nepalese fighter for democracy and linguistic rights, author and scholar of [[Nepal Bhasa]]. He devoted himself to serving his mother tongue and collecting and preserving ancient manuscripts, and was the founder of Asa Archives, the only public archives in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal|title=The torch has been passed|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=4 October 1991}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

[[Kansakar]] (alternative name: Prem Bahadur Kasāh; Devanagari: प्रेम बहादुर कसाः) was born in [[Kathmandu]] to a family of merchants. He received his primary education in Kathmandu at [[Jagat Lal Master]]'s school, Masjid Imambara (where he learned [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]) and [[Durbar High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaidya, Karuna Kar (1976). ''Nepalese short stories.'' Gallery Press. Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; After passing Class 8 from Durbar High, he went to [[Patna]], India to join Class 9. In 1940, he passed the [[Matric]] exams and enrolled in [[Patna College]].

==Political career==

In Kathmandu during his college holidays, he came into contact with [[Ganga Lal Shrestha]] through [[Dharma Ratna Yami]], and was greatly impressed by the young revolutionary. Kansakar went back to Patna to continue his studies, and in 1941 was informed by Yami that Ganga Lal had been martyred. In 1942, moved by Ganga Lal's death, Kansakar became a member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] founded by Indian nationalist [[M. N. Roy]].

Returning to Kathmandu, he got involved in the underground struggle against the autocratic [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] to bring democracy in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=Ujjwal|title=An alternative historian|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/01/07/features/an-alternative-historian/216981/|accessdate=6 March 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaha, Rishikesh (1990). ''Modern Nepal: A Political History, 1769-1955.'' Riverdale Co Pub. {{ISBN|091321566X}}, 9780913215661. Page 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he formed the Nepal Democratic Association (नेपाल प्रजातन्त्र संघ) which organized a civil disobedience movement across the [[Kathmandu Valley]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Fukui, Haruhiro (1985). ''Political parties of Asia and the Pacific, Volume 2.'' Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|031321350X}}, 9780313213502. Page 806.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansakar also worked to develop education, and helped to establish a library Pradipta Pustakalaya in 1946, Shanti Nikunja School and Padmodaya School, where he also taught.

He left his teaching job to travel to [[Kolkata]], India to join other Nepalese democracy fighters, but was stopped on the way and confined to Kathmandu. In 1947, he slipped out of the country and went to [[Varanasi]] to attend a convention of the Nepal Rastriya Congress, a political party of Nepalese freedom fighters.

In 1948 in Kolkata, Mahendra Bikram Shah and Kansakar established the Nepali Democratic Congress as president and general secretary respectively. In 1950, the party merged with the Nepali Rastriya Congress founded by [[Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala]] to become the [[Nepali Congress]] which decided to launch an armed struggle against the Ranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarkar|first=Sudeshna|title=From Kolkata to Kathmandu|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=39904&amp;cat_id=7|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Rana regime was overthrown and democracy established in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Savada| first =Andrea Matles (ed.)| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://countrystudies.us/nepal/17.htm| title =The Return of the King| work = Nepal: A Country Study| publisher =Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress| year=1991| accessdate = 8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansakar became the leader of a new political party, Janavadi Prajatantra Sangh ("People's Democratic Union"), which was formed subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Bhuwan Lal and Rose, Leo E.

''Political parties of Asia and the Pacific, Volume 2.'' Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|031321350X}}, 9780313213502. Page 817.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ranas ruled Nepal from 1846 until 1951. During this time, the [[Shah dynasty|Shah king]] was reduced to a figurehead and the prime minister and other government positions were hereditary. [[Jang Bahadur Rana]] established the Rana dynasty in 1846 by masterminding the [[Kot massacre]] in which about 40 members of the nobility including the prime minister and a relative of the king were murdered. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Lal |first=C.

[[File:Prem bahadur statue.jpg|thumb|200px|Bust of Kansakar at Asa Archives]]
In 1950, Kansakar and a fellow writer Madan Lochan Singh established a literary society named Chwasa Pasa (meaning "Pen Friend") in Kolkata. Its objective was to bring together Nepal Bhasa writers living in exile in India and bring out publications in the language as it was forbidden to do so in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, after the [[Rana dynasty]] was overthrown and democracy established in Nepal, the ban on publishing in Nepal Bhasa ended and Kansakar returned to Kathmandu. Chwasa Pasa also moved to Kathmandu and devoted itself to publishing books and magazines in Nepal Bhasa.

In 1956, Kansakar helped to set up Nasa Khala, a cultural organization. Its objective was to research, present and preserve Nepal's classical and folk dance and music. Nasa Khala provided training in dance and music and performed stage shows.

He was also the founder of the Nepal Bhasa Dictionary Committee which started worked on a dictionary of the classical language in 1980. The dictionary was published in 2000, and the committee received the Nikkei Asia Prize in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matsuoka|first=Hiroki|title=Nikkei Asia Prize winners 2001: Nepal Bhasa Dictionary Committee|url=http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/forum/nap/2001/2001nepal.aspx|accessdate=6 March 2012|newspaper=Nikkei.com|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Asa Archives was established. Named after Kansakar's father Asha Man Singh Kansakar, it preserves ancient manuscripts, palm leaf documents and books collected from private sources. Kansakar donated his personal collection to the archives to which donations from other people were later added. Most of the collections are in Nepal Bhasa and [[Sanskrit]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Tracking the Past|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Travellers' Nepal|date=March–April 2004}} Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Kansakar was also a story writer and essayist. He has been credited with bringing a transformation in Nepal Bhasa essays. ''Nhupukhu'' (a collection of essays) and ''Swanma'' (children's  stories) are two of his notable works.&lt;ref&gt;Malla, Kamal Prakash (1964). ''Musah Nibandha ("Essay par excellence").'' Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

He collected old songs and ballads and has published ''Matenaya mye'' ("Love songs") and ''Bakham-mye'' ("Narrative Poems").&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Pages 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansakar was the chief editor of ''Situ'' ([[Devanagari]]: सितु) (meaning "Holy Grass"), a bimonthly literary magazine in Nepal Bhasa. It was published by Chwasa Pasa and was in publication from 1964-1991.

''Chicago Manual of Style''. University of Chicago Press (2010). page 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Scare quotes may indicate that the author is using someone else's term, similar to preceding a phrase with the expression "[[wikt:so-called|so-called]]";&lt;ref name="Trask1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/quotes/scare|title=Scare Quotes|work=University of Sussex Guide to Punctuation|publisher=University of Sussex|first=Larry|last=Trask|authorlink=Larry Trask|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may imply skepticism or disagreement, belief that the words are misused, or that the writer intends a meaning opposite to the words enclosed in quotes.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, Allan M. ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''. Three Rivers Press (1999). {{ISBN|9780812963892}}. page 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] coined the term ''scare quotes'' as it refers to punctuation marks in 1956, in an essay entitled "Aristotle and the Sea Battle", published in ''[[Mind (journal) | Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, G. E. M. "Aristotle and the Sea Battle". ''Mind; a Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy''.  Volume lxv. No. 257. January 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a graphic symbol on an expression to indicate irony or dubiousness goes back much further: Authors of ancient Greece used a mark called a ''[[Diple (textual symbol)|diple periestigmene]]'' for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, Ruth. ''Why Do We Quote?: The Culture and History of Quotation''. Open Book Publishers (2011). {{ISBN|9781906924331}}. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1990s, the use of scare quotes suddenly became very widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Howells, Richard, editor. ''Outrage: Art, Controversy, and Society''. Palgrave Macmillan. (2012) {{ISBN|9780230350168}}, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haack, Susan 2000 page 202"&gt;Haack, Susan, editor. ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays''. University of Chicago Press (2000) {{ISBN|9780226311371}}, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perlman, Merrill. {{"'}}Scare' Tactics". ''Columbia Journalism Review''. 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernist authors in particular have theorized about bracketing punctuation, including scare quotes, and have found reasons for their frequent use in their writings.&lt;ref name="Pinker, Steven 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Writers use scare quotes for a variety of reasons. They can imply doubt or ambiguity in words or ideas within the marks,&lt;ref&gt;Stove, David C. ''Against the Idols of the Age''. Transaction Publishers (1999) {{ISBN|9781412816649}} page xxv — xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; or even outright contempt.&lt;ref name="Trask, Robert Lawrence 2005 page 228"&gt;Trask, Robert Lawrence. ''Say what You Mean!: A Troubleshooter's Guide to English Style and Usage''. David R. Godine Publisher (2005) {{ISBN|9781567922639}} page 228&lt;/ref&gt; They can indicate that a writer is purposely misusing a word or phrase&lt;ref&gt;Gibaldi, Joseph. ''MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers''. The Modern Language Association of America (1995) {{ISBN|0-87352-565-5}} page 56&lt;/ref&gt; or that the writer is unpersuaded by the text in quotes,&lt;ref&gt;Fogarty, Mignon. ''The Grammar Devotional: Daily Tips for Successful Writing from Grammar Girl.'' Macmillan (2009) {{ISBN|9781429964401}} page 207&lt;/ref&gt; and they can help the writer deny responsibility for the quote.&lt;ref name="Trask, Robert Lawrence 2005 page 228"/&gt; In general, they express distance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote         = quote: &lt;&lt; The 'RF modulator' use is the 'neutral distancing' one on the Wikipedia page (special terminology).  &gt;&gt;; note that the reference to "the Wikipedia page" inside that quoted quote, there, is ... apparently intended to direct the reader to [what is now] an old "non-latest" version of the "Scare quotes" article on the English Wikipedia, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scare_quotes&amp;oldid=498658294 the "oldid=498658294" version, dated "05:52, 21 June 2012"] ... when (or, "as of" which) [that version of] the article did contain a section called "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scare_quotes&amp;oldid=498658294#Neutral_distancing Neutral distancing]".  
}}&lt;/ref&gt; between writer and quote.&lt;ref name=Trask1/&gt;

For example: {{quote|Some "groupies" were following the band.}} The scare quotes could indicate that the word is not one the writer would normally use, or that the writer thinks there is something dubious about the word ''groupies'' or its application to these people.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Thomas Burns. McArthur, Roshan. ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language''. Oxford University Press (2005) {{ISBN|9780192806376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact meaning of the scare quotes is not clear without further context.

The term ''scare quotes'' may be confusing because of the word ''scare''. An author may use scare quotes not to convey alarm, but to signal a [[semantic]] quibble. Scare quotes may suggest or create a [[problematization]] with the words set in quotes.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Arnold. I. ''The Emergence of Sexuality: Historical Epistemology and the Formation of Concepts''. Harvard University Press (2004) {{ISBN|9780674013704}} page 87 — 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Nandita Rani. ''Home Economics: Nationalism and the Making of 'Migrant Workers' in Canada''. University of Toronto Press (2006) {{ISBN|9781551930589}} page 169&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some experts encourage writers to avoid scare quotes because they can distance the writer and confuse the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Gary. ''What is this thing called Philosophy of Language?'' Routledge (2013) {{ISBN|9781135084851}} page xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor [[Greil Marcus]], in a talk at Case Western Reserve University, described scare quotes as "the enemy," adding that they "...kill narrative, they kill story-telling ... They are a writer’s assault on his or her own words."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Greil (10 May 2010). [http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2010/05/greil-marcus-notes-on-the-making-of-a-new-literary-history-of-america-part-1.html "Greil Marcus - Notes on the Making of ''A New Literary History of America''"]. Adapted from a talk given at Case Western Reserve University on April 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Scare quotes have been described as ubiquitous, and the use of them as expressing distrust in truth, reality, facts, reason and objectivity.&lt;ref name="Haack, Susan 2000 page 202"/&gt;
Political commentator [[Jonathan Chait]] wrote in ''The New Republic'' that, "The scare quote is the perfect device for making an insinuation without proving it, or even necessarily making clear what you're insinuating."&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Jonathan Chait, [http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/scared-yet "Scared Yet?], ''The New Republic'', Dec. 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Stove]] examined the recent trend of using scare quotes in philosophy as a means of neutralizing or suspending words that imply cognitive achievement, such as ''knowledge'' or ''discovery''.&lt;ref&gt;Stove, David (1982). "Part 1, Chapter 1". [https://web.archive.org/web/20150202193614/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/stove/chapter-01.htm ''Popper and After: Four Modern Irrationalists'']. Oxford: Pergamon Press. Archived from [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/stove/chapter-01.htm the original] on 2015-02-02. Reprinted as ''Anything Goes: Origins of the Cult of Scientific Irrationalism'' (1998). Macleay Press. {{ISBN|1 876492 01 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In speech ==

In spoken conversation, a stand-in for scare quotes is a hand gesture known as ''[[air quotes]]'' or ''finger quotes'', which mimics quotation marks.

A speaker may alternatively say "quote" before and "unquote" after quoted words, or say "[[wikt:quote unquote|quote unquote]]" before or after the quoted words,&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/quote.html |title=Quote, Unquote.|author=John M. Lawler, Prof. Emeritus of Linguistics|publisher=Univ. of Michigan|accessdate=2010-10-09|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply pause before and emphasize the parts in quotes. This spoken method is also used for literal and conventional quotes.

'''Seneca the Younger''' {{nowrap|(c. 4 BC –}} AD{{nbsp}}65), fully '''Lucius Annaeus Seneca''' and also known simply as '''Seneca''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|ə}}), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, statesman, [[dramatist]], and—in one work—[[satirist]] of the [[Silver Age of Latin literature]].

Seneca was born in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] in [[Hispania]], and raised in [[Rome]], where he was trained in rhetoric and philosophy. He was a tutor and later advisor to emperor [[Nero]].  He was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to assassinate Nero, in which he was likely to have been innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bunson, Matthew| title= A Dictionary of the Roman Empire| page = 382| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|date= 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fitch | first = John | title = Seneca | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | location = City | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-19-928208-1 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Seneca the Elder]], his elder brother was [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus]], and his nephew was the poet [[Lucan]]. His stoic and calm suicide has become the subject of numerous paintings. As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays which are all tragedies. His philosophical writings include a dozen philosophical essays, and one hundred and twenty-four [[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|letters]] dealing with moral issues. As a tragedian, he is best known for his ''[[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]]'' and ''[[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]]''.

==Life==
===Early life, family and adulthood===
Seneca was born at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in the Roman province of [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] in [[Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Seneca the Elder|Lucius Annaeus Seneca the elder]], a Spanish-born [[Equites|Roman knight]] who had gained fame as a writer and teacher of rhetoric in Rome.&lt;ref name="dandy"&gt;{{Cite book|author-first=Stephen|author-last=Dando-Collins|title=Blood of the Caesars: How the Murder of Germanicus Led to the Fall of Rome|year=2008|page=47|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=047013741X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's mother, Helvia, was from a prominent Baetician family.&lt;ref name="habby7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca was the second of three brothers; the others were [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Lucius Annaeus Novatus]] (later known as Junius Gallio), and [[Annaeus Mela]], the father of the poet [[Lucan]].&lt;ref name="rgm92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miriam Griffin]] says in her biography of Seneca that "the evidence for Seneca's life before his exile in 41 is so slight, and the potential interest of these years, for social history as well as for biography, is so great that few writers on Seneca have resisted the temptation to eke out knowledge with imagination."&lt;ref name="thegriff"&gt;Miriam T. Griffin. ''Seneca: A Philosopher in Politics'', Oxford 1976. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin also infers from the ancient sources that Seneca was born in either 8, 4, or 1 BC. She thinks he was born between 4 and 1 BC and was resident in Rome by AD 5.&lt;ref name="thegriff"/&gt;

Seneca tells us that he was taken to [[Rome]] in the "arms" of his aunt (his mother's stepsister) at a young age, probably when he was about five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=48}} citing ''De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem'' 19.2&lt;/ref&gt; His father resided for much of his life in the city.&lt;ref name="asmi7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of high-born Romans.&lt;ref name="habby8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still young he received philosophical training from [[Attalus (Stoic)|Attalus]] the [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and from [[Sotion (Pythagorean)|Sotion]] and [[Papirius Fabianus]], both of whom belonged to the short-lived [[School of the Sextii]] which combined Stoicism with [[Pythagoreanism]].&lt;ref name="rgm92"/&gt; Sotion persuaded Seneca when he was a young man (in his early twenties) to become a [[vegetarian]], which he practised for around a year before his father urged him to desist because the practice was associated with "some foreign rites".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca often had breathing difficulties throughout his life, probably [[asthma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point in his mid-twenties (c. 20 AD) he appears to have been struck down with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] to live with his aunt (the same aunt who had brought him to Rome), whose husband [[Gaius Galerius]] had become [[Prefect of Egypt]].&lt;ref name="habby7"/&gt; She nursed him through a period of ill-health which lasted up to ten years.&lt;ref name="wilko62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 31 AD he returned to Rome with his aunt, his uncle dying en route in a shipwreck.&lt;ref name="wilko62"/&gt; It was his aunt's influence which allowed Seneca to be elected [[quaestor]] (probably after 37 AD&lt;ref name="habby8"/&gt;) which also earned him the right to sit in the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref name="wilko62"/&gt;

===Politics and exile===
Seneca's early career as a senator seems to have been successful and he was praised for his oratory.&lt;ref name="brauny24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] relates a story that [[Caligula]] was so offended by Seneca's oratorical success in the Senate that he ordered him to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="brauny24"/&gt; Seneca only survived because he was seriously ill and Caligula was told that he would soon die anyway.&lt;ref name="brauny24"/&gt; In his writings Seneca has nothing good to say about Caligula and frequently depicts him as a monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca explains his own survival as down to his patience and his devotion to his friends: "I wanted to avoid the impression that all I could do for loyalty was die."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=67}} citing ''Naturales Quaestiones, 4.17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 41 AD, [[Claudius]] became emperor, and Seneca was accused by the new empress [[Messalina]] of adultery with [[Julia Livilla]], sister to Caligula and [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]].&lt;ref name="habby9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair has been doubted by some historians, since Messalina had clear political motives for getting rid of Julia Livilla and her supporters.&lt;ref name="asmi7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilko79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate pronounced a death sentence on Seneca which Claudius commuted to exile, and Seneca spent the next eight years on the island of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref name="brauny23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Seneca's earliest surviving works date from the period of his exile&amp;mdash;both [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]].&lt;ref name="habby9"/&gt; In his ''Consolation to Helvia'', his mother, Seneca comforts her as a bereaved mother for losing her son to exile.&lt;ref name="brauny23"/&gt; Seneca incidentally mentions the death of his only son, a few weeks before his exile.&lt;ref name="brauny23"/&gt; Later in life Seneca was married to a woman younger than himself, [[Pompeia Paulina]].&lt;ref name="rgm92"/&gt; It has been thought that the infant son may have been from an earlier marriage,&lt;ref name="brauny23"/&gt; but the evidence is "tenuous".&lt;ref name="rgm92"/&gt; Seneca's other work of this period, his ''Consolation to [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]]'', one of Claudius' freedmen, focused on consoling Polybius on the death of his brother. It is noted for its flattery of Claudius, and Seneca expresses his hope that the emperor will recall him from exile.&lt;ref name="brauny23"/&gt; In 49 AD Agrippina married her uncle Claudius, and through her influence Seneca was recalled to Rome.&lt;ref name="habby9"/&gt; Agrippina gained the [[praetor]]ship for Seneca and appointed him tutor to her son, the future emperor [[Nero]].&lt;ref name="brauny22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial advisor===
[[File:Nerón y Séneca (Barrón).JPG|thumb|right|Nero and Seneca, by Eduardo Barrón (1904). [[Museo del Prado]]]]
From AD 54 to 62, Seneca acted as Nero's advisor, together with the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. One byproduct of his new position was that Seneca was appointed [[suffect consul]] in 56.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Senatus Consultum Trebellianum'' was dated to 25 August in his consulate, which he shared with Trebellius Maximus. ''Digest'' 36.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's influence was said to have been especially strong in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] claims Seneca and Burrus "took the rule entirely into their own hands," but "after the death of Britannicus, Seneca and Burrus no longer gave any careful attention to the public business" in 55 (Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXI.3–7)&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca composed Nero's accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate.&lt;ref name="brauny22"/&gt; He also composed the eulogy for Claudius that Nero delivered at the funeral.&lt;ref name="brauny22"/&gt; Seneca's satirical skit ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' which lampoons the deification of Claudius and praises Nero dates from the earliest period of Nero's reign.&lt;ref name="brauny22"/&gt; In 55 AD Seneca wrote his ''[[De Clementia|On Clemency]]'' which was written following Nero's murder of [[Britannicus]], perhaps as a means of assuring the citizenry that the murder would be the end, not the beginning of bloodshed.&lt;ref name="habby10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Clemency'' is a work which, although it flatters Nero, was intended to show the correct (Stoic) path of virtue for a ruler.&lt;ref name="brauny22"/&gt; [[Tacitus]] and Dio suggest that Nero's early rule, during which time he listened to Seneca and Burrus, was quite competent. However, the ancient sources suggest, over time, Seneca and Burrus lost their influence over the emperor. In 59 they had reluctantly agreed to Agrippina's murder, and afterward Tacitus reports that Seneca had to write a letter justifying the murder to the Senate.&lt;ref name="habby10"/&gt;

In 58 AD the senator [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] made a series of public attacks on Seneca.&lt;ref name="brauny21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks, reported by [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annuals'' xiii.42; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' lxi.33.9.&lt;/ref&gt; included charges that, in a mere four years of service to Nero, Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million [[Sestertius|sestertii]] by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces.&lt;ref name="asmi9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suillius' attacks included claims of sexual corruption, with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina.&lt;ref name="wilko130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus, though, reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced: he had been a favourite of Claudius,&lt;ref name="brauny21"/&gt; and had been an embezzler and informant.&lt;ref name="asmi9"/&gt; In response, Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius: half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile.&lt;ref name="wilko131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca which was made at the time and continued through later ages.&lt;ref name="brauny21"/&gt; Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich: he had properties at [[Baiae]] and [[Nomentum]], an [[Alba Longa|Alban]] villa, and Egyptian estates.&lt;ref name="brauny21"/&gt; Cassius Dio even reports that the [[Boudica]] uprising in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius's [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]], and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively.&lt;ref name="brauny21"/&gt; Seneca was sensitive to such accusations: his ''[[De Vita Beata]]'' ("On the Happy Life") dates from around this time and includes a defense of wealth along Stoic lines, arguing that wealth which is properly gained and spent is appropriate behaviour for a philosopher.&lt;ref name="asmi9"/&gt;

===Retirement===
After Burrus's death in 62, Seneca's influence declined rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that Seneca tried to retire twice, in 62 and 64 AD, but Nero refused him on both occasions.&lt;ref name="asmi9"/&gt; Nevertheless, Seneca was increasingly absent from the court.&lt;ref name="asmi9"/&gt; He adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates, concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome. It was during these final few years that he composed two of his greatest works: ''[[Naturales quaestiones]]''&amp;mdash;an encyclopedia of the natural world; and his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]''&amp;mdash;which document his philosophical thoughts.&lt;ref name="habby14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Manuel Domínguez Sánchez - El suicidio de Séneca.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Manuel Domínguez Sánchez, ''The suicide of Seneca'' (1871), [[Museo del Prado]]]]
In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]], a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself.&lt;ref name="asmi9"/&gt; Seneca followed tradition by severing several [[vein]]s in order to [[exsanguination|bleed to death]], and his wife [[Pompeia Paulina]] attempted to share his fate. Cassius Dio, who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero, focused on how Seneca had attended to his last-minute letters, and how his death was hastened by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=16}} citing Cassius Dio ii.25&lt;/ref&gt;  A generation after the Julio-Claudian emperors, Tacitus wrote an account of the suicide, which, in view of his Republican sympathies, is perhaps somewhat romanticized.&lt;ref name="brodby"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Church|author1-first=Alfred John|author2-last=Brodribb|author2-first=William Jackson|title=Tacitus: The Annals of Imperial Rome''|chapter=xv| location=New York|publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |date=2007|page=341}} citing Tacitus ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', xv. 60-64&lt;/ref&gt; According to this account, Nero ordered Seneca's wife to be saved. Her wounds were bound up and she made no further attempt to kill herself. As for Seneca himself, his age and diet were blamed for slow loss of blood and extended pain rather than a quick death; he also took poison, which was also not fatal. After dictating his last words to a scribe, and with a circle of friends attending him in his home, he immersed himself in a warm bath, which was expected to speed blood flow and ease his pain. Tacitus wrote, "He was then carried into a bath, with the steam of which he was suffocated, and he was burnt without any of the usual funeral rites.  So he had directed in a codicil of his will, even when in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of life’s close."&lt;ref name="brodby"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===As a humanist saint===
[[File:Plato Seneca Aristotle medieval.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Plato]], Seneca, and [[Aristotle]] in a medieval manuscript illustration (c. 1325–35)]]

Seneca's writings were well known in the later Roman period, and [[Quintilian]], writing thirty years after Seneca's death, remarked on the popularity of his works amongst the youth.&lt;ref name="lars54a"/&gt; While he found much to admire, Quintillian criticised Seneca for what he regarded as a degenerate literary style&amp;mdash;a criticism echoed by [[Aulus Gellius]] in the middle of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name="lars54a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=54}} citing Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'', x.1.126f; Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', xii.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christian Church was very favorably disposed towards Seneca and his writings, and the church leader [[Tertullian]] possessively referred to him as "our Seneca."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Hadas. ''The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca'', 1958. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century an apocryphal correspondence with [[Paul the Apostle]] had been created linking Seneca into the Christian tradition.&lt;ref name="lars54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters are mentioned by [[Jerome]] who also included Seneca among a list of Christian writers, and Seneca is similarly mentioned by [[Augustine]].&lt;ref name="lars54"/&gt; In the 6th century [[Martin of Braga]] synthesised Seneca's thought into a couple of treatises which became very popular in their own right.&lt;ref name="lars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise Seneca was mainly known through a large number of quotes and extracts in the ''[[florilegium|florilegia]]'' which were popular throughout the medieval period.&lt;ref name="lars55"/&gt; When his writings were read in the later Middle Ages, it was mostly his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]''—the longer essays and plays being relatively unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers and works continued to link him to Christianity because of his alleged association with Paul.&lt;ref name="wilko219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Golden Legend]]'', a 13th-century [[hagiography|hagiographical]] account of famous saints which was widely read, included an account of Seneca's death scene, and erroneously presented Nero as a witness to Seneca's suicide.&lt;ref name="wilko219"/&gt; [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Seneca (alongside [[Cicero]]) among the "great spirits" in the [[Inferno (Dante)#First Circle (Limbo)|First Circle of Hell]], or [[Limbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|p=197}} citing Dante, ''Inf.'', 4.141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boccaccio]], who in 1370 came across the works of Tacitus whilst browsing the library at [[Montecassino]], wrote an account of Seneca's suicide hinting that it was a kind of disguised baptism, or a ''de facto'' baptism in spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|pp=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as [[Albertino Mussato]] and [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295–1348)|Giovanni Colonna]], went even further and concluded that Seneca must have been a Christian convert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seneca.JPG|thumb|The "[[Pseudo-Seneca]]" a Roman bust found at [[Herculaneum]], one of a series of similar sculptures known since the Renaissance, once identified as Seneca. Now commonly identified as [[Hesiod]]]]

===An improving reputation===
Seneca remains one of the few popular Roman philosophers from the period. He appears not only in Dante, but also in [[Chaucer]] and to a large degree in [[Petrarch]], who adopted his style in his own essays and who quotes him more than any other authority except [[Virgil]]. In the Renaissance, printed editions and translations of his works became common, including an edition by [[Erasmus]] and a commentary by [[John Calvin]].&lt;ref name="Gummere"&gt;Richard Mott Gummere, ''Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message'', p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John of Salisbury]], Erasmus and others celebrated his works. French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], who gave a spirited defense of Seneca and [[Plutarch]] in his ''Essays'', was himself considered by [[Pasquier]] a "French Seneca."&lt;ref&gt;Gummere, ''Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message'', p.106.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Thomas Fuller]] praised [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] as "our English Seneca." Many who have considered his ideas not to be particularly original, still argued he was important in making the Greek philosophers presentable and intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Hadas. ''The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca'', 1958. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His suicide has also been a popular subject in art, from [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1773 painting ''[[The Death of Seneca (David)|The Death of Seneca]]'' to the 1951 film ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]''.

Even with the admiration of an earlier group of intellectual stalwarts, Seneca has never been without his detractors. In his own time, he was accused of hypocrisy or, at least, a less than "Stoic" lifestyle. While banished to Corsica, he wrote a plea for restoration rather incompatible with his advocacy of a simple life and the acceptance of fate. In his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' he ridiculed the behaviors and policies of Claudius, and flattered Nero—such as proclaiming that Nero would live longer and be wiser than the legendary [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]. The claims of [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] that Seneca acquired some "three hundred million ''[[sesterces]]''" through Nero's favor, are highly partisan, but they reflect the reality that Seneca was both powerful and wealthy.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|1969|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Campbell, a translator of Seneca's letters, writes that the "stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries [has been]...the apparent contrast between his philosophical teachings and his practice."&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;

In 1562 [[Gerolamo Cardano]] wrote an ''apology'' praising Nero in his ''Encomium Neronis'', printed in Basel.&lt;ref&gt;Available in English as Girolamo Cardano, ''Nero: an Exemplary Life'' Inkstone, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This was likely intended as a mock ''[[encomium]]'', inverting the portrayal of Nero and Seneca which appears in Tacitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Siraisi|first=Nancy G.|year=2007|title=History, Medicine, and the Traditions of Renaissance Learning|pages=157–8|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work Cardano portrayed Seneca as a crook of the worst kind, an empty rhetorician who was only thinking to grab money and power, after having poisoned the mind of the young emperor. Cardano stated that Seneca well deserved death.

Among the historians who have sought to reappraise Seneca is the scholar Anna Lydia Motto who in 1966 argued that the negative image has been based almost entirely on Suillius's account, while many others who might have lauded him have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Motto, Anna Seneca on Trial: The Case of the Opulent Stoic ''The Classic Journal'', Vol. 61, No. 6 (1966) pp. 254–258&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are therefore left with no contemporary record of Seneca's life, save for the desperate opinion of Publius Suillius. Think of the barren image we should have of [[Socrates]], had the works of [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] not come down to us and were we wholly dependent upon [[Aristophanes]]' description of this Athenian philosopher. To be sure, we should have a highly distorted, misconstrued view. Such is the view left to us of Seneca, if we were to rely upon Suillius alone."&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Motto, Anna Seneca on Trial: The Case of the Opulent Stoic ''The Classic Journal'', Vol. 61, No. 6 (1966) pp. 257&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recent work is changing the dominant perception of Seneca as a mere conduit for pre-existing ideas showing originality in Seneca's contribution to the [[history of ideas]].  Examination of Seneca's life and thought in relation to contemporary education and to the psychology of emotions is revealing the relevance of his thought. For example, [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her discussion of desire and emotion includes Seneca among the Stoics who offered important insights and perspectives on emotions and their role in our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, M. (1996), ''The Therapy of Desire''. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management, she shows Seneca's appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger, and its pathological connections. Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca's contribution to [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, M. (1999) Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics, education and notions of global citizenship and finding a basis for reform-minded education in Seneca's ideas that allows her to propose a mode of modern education which steers clear of both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition. Elsewhere Seneca has been noted as the first great Western thinker on the complex nature and role of gratitude in human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Harpham, E.

==Philosophy==
[[File:SènecaQuestionibusNaturalibus.jpg|thumb|right|First page of the ''Naturales Quaestiones'', made for the Catalan-Aragonese court]]
Seneca was a prolific writer of philosophical works on [[Stoicism]], mostly on ethics, with one work (''[[Naturales quaestiones|Naturales Quaestiones]]'') on the physical world.&lt;ref name="gill34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoicism was a popular philosophy in this period, and many upper-class Romans found in it a guiding ethical framework for political involvement.&lt;ref name="gill34"/&gt; It was once popular to regard Seneca as being very [[Eclectic philosophy|eclectic]] in his Stoicism,&lt;ref&gt;"His philosophy, so far as he adopted a system, was the stoical, but it was rather an eclecticism of stoicism than pure stoicism" {{Cite DGRBM|author=GL|title=Seneca, L. Annaeus|volume=3|page=782|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RR5SAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA782|short=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern scholarship views him as a fairly orthodox Stoic, albeit a free-minded one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He knew the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], [[Cleanthes]], and [[Chrysippus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he frequently cites [[Posidonius]], with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works contain many references to other ancient philosophers, and it has often been noted that he frequently quotes [[Epicurus]], especially in his ''[[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Seneca's interest in Epicurus is mainly limited to using him as a source of ethical maxims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Seneca shows some interest in [[Platonism|Platonist]] metaphysics, but never with any clear commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2013|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; His surviving moral essays are based on Stoic doctrines,&lt;ref name="gill37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are formulated in [[Latin]] and usually in a non-technical language,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making them accessible to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="gill37"/&gt; His works discuss both ethical theory and practical advice, and Seneca stresses that both parts are distinct but interdependent.&lt;ref name="gill43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'' remain one of his most popular works: by offering ethical guidance, they showcase Seneca's search for ethical perfection.&lt;ref name="gill43"/&gt;

Seneca generally employs a pointed rhetorical style in his prose.&lt;ref name="rgm93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings focus on traditional themes of Stoic philosophy. The universe is governed for the best by a rational providence,&lt;ref name="asmi16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has to be reconciled with adversity.&lt;ref name="asmi15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life.&lt;ref name="colly14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Colish|1985|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive passions, especially anger and grief, must be uprooted,&lt;ref name="asmi15"/&gt; although sometimes he offers advice for moderating them according to reason.&lt;ref name="colly49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Colish|1985|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life,&lt;ref name="colly14"/&gt; and he considers it important to confront one's own mortality and be able to face death.&lt;ref name="asmi15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colly49"/&gt; One must be willing to practice poverty and use wealth properly,&lt;ref name="asmi16"/&gt; and he writes about favours, clemency, the importance of friendship, and the need to benefit others.&lt;ref name="asmi16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colly14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Colish|1985|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==

[[File:Woodcut illustration of the suicide of Seneca and the attempted suicide of his wife Pompeia Paulina - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|[[Woodcut]] illustration of the suicide of Seneca and the attempted suicide of his wife [[Pompeia Paulina]]]]

Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him.&lt;ref name="asmi23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca's Stoic beliefs.&lt;ref name="asmi20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions which generate madness, ruination and self-destruction.&lt;ref name="gill58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.&lt;ref name="gill58"/&gt;

Many scholars have thought, following the ideas of the 19th-century German scholar [[Friedrich Leo]], that Seneca's tragedies were written for recitation only.&lt;ref name="asmi23"/&gt; Other scholars think that they were written for performance and that it is possible that actual performance had taken place in Seneca's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;George W.M. Harrison (ed.), ''Seneca in performance'', London: Duckworth, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this issue cannot be resolved on the basis of our existing knowledge.&lt;ref name="asmi23"/&gt; The tragedies of Seneca have been successfully staged in modern times.

The dating of the tragedies is highly problematic in the absence of any ancient references.&lt;ref name="rgm94"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of a lament from ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]]'' appears in the ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' which implies a date before 54 AD for that play.&lt;ref name="rgm94"/&gt; A relative chronology has been suggested on metrical grounds but scholars remain divided. The plays are not all based on the Greek pattern; they have a five-act form and differ in many respects from extant [[theatre of Ancient Greece|Attic drama]], and while the influence of [[Euripides]] on some of these works is considerable, so is the influence of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref name="rgm94"/&gt;

Seneca's plays were widely read in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]]an [[university|universities]] and strongly influenced [[tragedy|tragic drama]] in that time, such as [[Elizabethan England]] ([[William Shakespeare]] and other playwrights), France ([[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]), and the Netherlands ([[Joost van den Vondel]]). English translations of Seneca's tragedies appeared in print in the mid-16th century, with all ten published collectively in 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, Lucius Annaeus. ''His Tenne Tragedies''. Thomas Newton, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1966, p. xlv. ASIN B000N3NP6K&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as the source and inspiration for what is known as "Revenge Tragedy," starting with [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' and continuing well into the [[Jacobean era]]. ''Thyestes'' is considered to be Seneca's masterpiece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srvNDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Thyestes&amp;f=false|title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives|page=192|author1-last=Francis|author1-first=Jane E.|author2-last=Kouremenos|author2-first=Anna|publisher=Oxbow Books|date=2016|isbn=1785700987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6cjAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Thyestes|title=Masterpieces of World Literature|page=vii|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Limited|date=1989|isbn=0060161442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described by scholar Dana Gioia as "one of the most influential plays ever written."&lt;ref name="JHU"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpD1vAkr76gC|title=Seneca: The Tragedies|page=xli|publisher=JHU Press|date=1994|isbn=0801849322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Medea'' is also highly regarded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jqOAgAAQBAJ|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|page=594|author1-last=Heil|author1-first=Andreas|author2-last=Damschen|author2-first=Gregor|publisher=BRILL|date=2013|isbn=9004217088}} "''Medea'' is often considered the masterpiece of Seneca's earlier plays, [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlXKM1jBhswC|title=Aesthetic Value in Classical Antiquity|page=399|author1-last=Sluiter|author1-first=Ineke|author2-last=Rosen|author2-first=Ralph M.|publisher=BRILL|date=2012|isbn=9004231676}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was praised along with ''Phaedra'' by [[T. S. Eliot]].&lt;ref name="JHU"/&gt;

==Works==
Works attributed to Seneca include a dozen philosophical essays, one hundred and twenty-four [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|letters]] dealing with [[moral]] issues, nine [[tragedy|tragedies]], and a [[satire]], the attribution of which is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, O. (2003), History of the Theatre: Ninth Ed. Allyn and Bacon. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; His authorship of ''Hercules on Oeta'' has also been questioned.

===Seneca's tragedies===
''[[Fabulae crepidatae]]'' (tragedies with Greek subjects):
* ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules]]'' or ''Hercules furens'' (''The Madness of Hercules'')
* ''[[Troades (Seneca)|Troades]]'' (''The Trojan Women'')
* ''[[Phoenissae (Seneca)|Phoenissae]]'' (''The Phoenician Women'')

* ''[[Agamemnon (Seneca)|Agamemnon]]''
* ''[[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]]''
* ''[[Hercules Oetaeus]]'' (''Hercules on Oeta''): generally considered not to be written by Seneca. First rejected by [[Daniel Heinsius|Heinsius]].

''[[Fabula praetexta]]'' (tragedy in Roman setting):
* ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'': likely not written by Seneca (at least in its final form);{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} this play closely resembles Seneca's plays in style, but was probably completed a short time after Seneca's death (perhaps between 70-80 A.D.), by someone with a keen knowledge of Seneca's plays and philosophical works.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} First rejected by [[Justus Lipsius|Lipsius]].

====Spurious====

* (58–62/370?) ''[[Epistle to Seneca the Younger|Cujus etiam ad Paulum apostolum leguntur epistolae]]:'' These letters, allegedly between Seneca and St Paul, were revered by early authorities, but modern scholarship rejects their authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/tixeront/section1-3.html#epistles |title=Apocryphal epistles |work=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (1892) [http://www.biblestudytools.com/classics/lightfoot-dissertations-on-the-apostolic-age/st-paul-and-seneca.html St Paul and Seneca] ''Dissertations on the Apostolic Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Pseudo-Seneca"===
"Pseudo-Seneca" is the name used for the uncertain authors of various antique and medieval texts such as ''De remediis fortuitorum'', which purport to be by the Roman author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bml.firenze.sbn.it/Seneca/eng/pseudo_seneca_contenuto.html "A large corpus of apocrypha - viz. falsifications, false attributions and extracts - compiled during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages has been connected to Seneca..."]&lt;/ref&gt;  At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content, for example, Saint [[Martin of Braga]]'s (d. c. 580) ''Formula vitae honestae'', or ''De differentiis quatuor virtutumvitae honestae'' ("Rules for an Honest Life", or "On the Four Cardinal Virtues").  Early manuscripts preserve Martin's preface, where he makes it clear that this was his adaptation, but in later copies this was omitted, and the work was later thought fully Seneca's work.&lt;ref&gt;István Pieter Bejczy, ''The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century'', BRILL, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgPRu0CJ_sQC&amp;pg=PA55 pp. 55-5] 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable fictional portrayals==
Seneca is a character in [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s 1642 opera ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' (''The Coronation of Poppea''), which is based on the pseudo-Senecan play, ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1-last=Gioia|author1-first=Dana|contribution=Introduction|title=Seneca: The Tragedies|editor1-last=Slavitt|editor1-first=David R.|year=1992|page=xviii|publisher=JHU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s 1675 play ''Nero, Emperor of Rome'', Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans, but is dragged off to prison, dying off-stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears in [[Robert Bridges]]' verse drama ''Nero'', the second part of which (published 1894) culminates in Seneca's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=Robert|title=Nero, Part II. From the death of Burrus to the death of Seneca, comprising the conspiracy of Piso|url=https://archive.org/details/nerofromdeathofb02bridrich|year=1894|publisher=George Bell and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca appears in a fairly minor role in [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s 1896 novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' and was played by [[Nicholas Hannen (actor)|Nicholas Hannen]] in [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|the 1951 film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rome, season one: History makes television|first=Monica Silveira|last=Cyrino|page=195|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Robert Graves' 1934 book ''[[Claudius the God]]'', the sequel novel to ''[[I, Claudius]]'', Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Citti|2015|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius' own ideology. The "Pumpkinification" (''Apocolocyntosis'') to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero mocking a man that Seneca groveled to for years.

{{Western Ganga kings}}
'''Shivamara II''' was the son of Sripurusha and ruled the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] from 788 &amp;ndash; 816 C.E. He was also a noted scholar in [[Kannada]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]]. He succeeded to the Ganga throne during a time when the [[Rashtrakuta]] were the empire on the rise in South India and the Deccan.

==Conflict with Rashtrakuta==
The Rashtrakuta monarch [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]] defeated Shivamara in Mudagunduru and took the Ganga king captive. The Rashtrakuta then took direct control of the Gangavadi with the appointment of Kambharasa, son of Dhruva Dharavarsha as its governor. He was later released, only to be imprisoned again during the rule of [[Govinda III]] when he refused to pay the Rashtrakuta tribute. Shivamara II again was released only to defy the Rashtrakuta yoke by waging wars. He died fighting them in 816. Manne near Bangalore was one of his capitals during this time.

In spite of being imprisoned on multiple occasions and being at constant war he found the time to write literary works, including ''Gajashtaka'' in [[Kannada]], ''Gajamathakalpana'' in [[Sanskrit]] and ''Sethubandha'' in [[Prakrit]].

According to historian Kamath, he is considered to be one of the famous kings of the dynasty.

'''Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan''' ({{Audio|Ml-തുഞ്ചത്ത് രാമാനുജൻ എഴുത്തച്ഛൻ.oga|pronunciation|help=no}}, {{lang-ml|തുഞ്ചത്ത് രാമാനുജൻ എഴുത്തച്ഛൻ}}, ''{{transl|ml|ISO|Tuñcattŭ Rāmānujan Eḻuttacchan}}'') was a [[Malayalam]] devotional poet and linguist from around the 16th century. Today he is known as the father of modern [[Malayalam language]] – the principal language of the Indian state [[Kerala]] and the union territory of [[Lakshadweep]] – and its literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.

Ezhuthachan was born in Trikkandiyoor, near the present day [[Tirur]] municipality. After the birth of his daughter, Ezhuthachan became a monk and wandered throughout southern India before finally building his monastery at modern day [[Chittur|Chittoor]], [[Palghat]].&lt;ref name="ref003"&gt;

Ezhuthachan's contribution to the Malayalam language is widely considered as unparalleled. He brought massive changes and standardisation in the language through his works. He translated the two Hindu epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', to Malayalam for the common man with the mingling of the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref name="ref004"&gt;G. PRABHAKARAN ''Ezhuthachan’s abode needs a prop'' CHITTUR (PALAKKAD), 19 October 2013 ''The Hindu [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ezhuthachans-abode-needs-a-prop/article5250232.ece]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historians and linguists, Ezhuthachan refined the "style" of Malayalam language and it was during his period that Malayalam literature attained its "individuality" and Malayalam became a "fully fledged" independent language. He also brought the language to the level of the non-Brahmins's understanding. Ezhuthachan used Malayalam language to challenge the prevailing social conditions. He is known for using his literary works as a powerful tool against the rule of privileged.&lt;ref name="Ezhuthachan's contribution"&gt;{{cite news

Ezhuthachan's other major contribution has been in establishing an (51 character) alphabet system equivalent to Sanskrit instead of [[Vattezhuthu]], the 30-letter script of Malayalam.&lt;ref name="ref002" /&gt;

The highest literary honour awarded presented by the [[Government of Kerala]] is known as the "[[Ezhuthachan Puraskaram]]".&lt;ref&gt;''M.K.

== Birth and life ==
Ezhuthachan is generally believed to have lived around 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burnell, Arthur Coke. ''Elements of South-Indian Palæography from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century AD''. 1874. p. 35-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thunchathu Ezhuthachan|publisher=Information and Public Relations Department, [[Government of Kerala]]|url=http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/thunchathuezhuthachhan.htm|accessdate=29 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108121423/http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/thunchathuezhuthachhan.htm|archivedate=8 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although poet and turned historian [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer|Ulloor S Parameshwara Iyer]] has argued that he was born in 1495 AD and lived up to 1575 AD, a time frame similar to that later proposed by [[C. Radhakrishnan]], other scholars are not sure about it.&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt; 

Ezhuthachan was born at Trikkandiyoor, near the modern-day municipal town of [[Tirur]], in Malappuram. His precise birthplace is now known as [[Thunjan Parambu|Thunchan Parambu]]. His parent's names are not known clearly and there is some confusion about Ezhuthachan's actual name as well. After completing his education, he got married, but embraced [[sannyasa]] after the birth of a daughter.  But at the same time another group believe he was a [[Celibacy|celebate]] throughout his life.&lt;ref name="K.B.K.V" /&gt; Leaving house he travelled to various places in the Andhra region and Tamil Nadu, and learnt [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Some scholars surmise that his ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'' were adopted from the Telugu versions of these Sanskrit epics.&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt; 

It is believed that Ezhuthachan on his way back from a pilgrimage to Tamil Nadu had a stopover at [[Chittur]] (in [[Palghat]]) and settled down at Thekke Gramam near Anikkode with his disciples. A monastery, then called "Ramananda ashrama" and now known as the Chittur Gurumadhom, was constructed by him on a piece of land bought from the landlord of [[Chittur]].&lt;ref name = "K. S.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the madhom, some of the instruments used by Ezhuthachan are still preserved. A Sri Chakra and a few idols worshipped by him, the [[stylus]], the wooden slippers, and a few old manuscripts are exhibited for visitors.&lt;ref name="ref004" /&gt; Ezhuthachan's samadhi is also situated there.&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt;

[[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], the author of famous ''Narayaneeyam'', was a friend of Ezhuthachan. It is said that when he sought the advice of Ezhuthachan about how to start his intended book, he gave him a cryptic advice to "start with fish", meaning to start with Matsya avatara - the fish avatar of god Vishnu. Bhattathiri understood the enigmatic message and started composing his poem in the Guruvayur Temple.&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt;

[[File:Thunchan Smarakam1.jpg|thumb|right|The present-day entrance to Thunchan Parambu in Trikkantiyur]]

=== Caste of Ezhuthachan ===

Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is thought to have belonged to the [[Ezhuthachan (caste)|Ezhuthachan caste]], a socioeconomic caste of village school teachers. Modern era historians still differ on their speculations and opinions about it. Following the period of Thunchaththu Ezuthachan, learned people from various other castes adopted and were known by this title, as they had been engaged with the vocation of village school teaching.

Ezhuthachan - although he lived around 16th century AD - is considered as the father of modern Malayalam language and Malayalam literature. No original compositions are attributed to Ezhuthachan. However, his contribution to the Malayalam language through ''[[Adhyathmaramayanam|Adhyatma Ramayanam]]'' is considered unparalleled.

''Adhyatma Ramayanam'', written in [[Kilippattu]] style, is considered as a landmark of Malayalam literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Works of Dr. Ezhuthachan'' (Volume I &amp; II). [[K. N. Ezhuthachan]] Kerala Sahithya Akademi, Thrissur.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezhuthachan used different Dravidian metres in the cantos of his poems: "Keka" for Bala Kanda and Aranya Kanda; "Kakali" for Ayodhya, Kishkindha and Yuddha Kanda; and "Kalakanchi" for Sundara Kanda.&lt;ref name="ref002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt; Throughout the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam, ''Adhyatma Ramayanam'' is still recited - as a religious practice - in Hindu homes in Kerala. According to critic K. Ayyappa Panicker, those who see ''Adhyatma Ramayanam'' merely as a devotional work "belittle" Ezhuthachan.&lt;ref name="ref002" /&gt;

''Adhyatma Ramayanam'', his other major work ''Sri Mahabharatam'' (translation of Hindu epic poem ''[[Mahabharata]]''), and shorter pieces ''Irupathinalu Vrittam'' and ''Harinama Kirtanam'' mark the confluence of Sanskrit and Dravidian linguistic streams.&lt;ref name="ref002" /&gt; However, there is no unanimity of opinion among the scholars about the authorship of certain other works generally attributed to him (such as ''Devi Bhagavatam'').&lt;ref name="ref003" /&gt;

''Adhyatma Ramayanam''(അദ്ധ്യാത്മരാമായണം) is also a spiritual text that gave momentum to the [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti cult]] in Kerala.&lt;ref name="ref002" /&gt; Ezhuthachan, along with [[Poonthanam|Poonthanam Nambuthiri]], was one of the prominent Bhakti devotional poets in Kerala.

Beyond the poetry values Ezhuthachan's works became famous for it's cultural and moral values. This specialty of his works gave him the role of a cultural leader in history.&lt;ref name="Ezhuthachan opposed social evils: Vysakhan"&gt;{{cite news

'''Transcription into Chinese''' is the use of [[traditional characters|traditional]] or [[simplified characters|simplified]] [[Chinese character|character]]s to [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] ''[[phonetics|phonetically]]'' the sound of terms and names foreign to the [[Chinese language]].  Transcription is distinct from [[translation into Chinese]] whereby the ''meaning'' of a foreign word is communicated in Chinese.  Since, in [[mainland China]] and often in [[Taiwan]], [[Hanyu Pinyin]] is now used to transcribe Chinese into a modified [[Latin alphabet]] and since [[English language|English]] classes are now [[English education in China|standard in most secondary schools]], it is increasingly common to see foreign names and terms left in their original form in Chinese texts. However, for mass media and marketing within China and for non-European languages, particularly those of the [[Chinese minorities]], transcription into characters remains very common.

Despite the importance of [[Cantonese]] and other southern coastal [[varieties of Chinese]] to foreign contact during the 19th century (as seen, for instance, in the number of [[list of English words of Chinese origin|Cantonese loanwords in English]]), the northern [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|capital dialect]] has been formally sanctioned within the country for centuries. This status continued under the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic]], which retained the importance of the "[[Standard Chinese|National Language]]" ({{lang|zh|國語}},&amp;nbsp;''Guóyǔ'') despite moving its capital to [[Nanking]], [[Chungking]], and [[Taipei]], none of which natively spoke it. Similarly, "[[Standard Chinese|Standard&amp;nbsp;Chinese]]" ({{lang|zh|普通话}},&amp;nbsp;''Pǔtōnghuà'') has been mandatory for most media and education throughout the [[People's Republic of China]] since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Lam S.L., Agnes. ''Language Education in China: Policy and Experience from 1949'', p. 39. Hong Kong Univ. Press (Hong Kong), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guo Zhenzhi. ''Mapping Media in China: Region, Province, and Locality''. "Dialects and Local Media: The Cases of Kunming and Yunnan TV", [https://books.google.com/books?id=INTUWgUpL3kC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49]. Accessed 6 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a handful of traditional exceptions, modern transcription therefore uses the standardized Mandarin pronunciations exclusively.

==Official standards==
Modern [[Standard Chinese|Han Chinese]] consists of about 412 [[syllable]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:wikt:Wiktionary:汉语拼音索引|Chinese Wiktionary's pinyin index]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 5 tones, so [[homophone]]s abound and most non Han words have multiple possible transcriptions. This is particularly true since Chinese is written as monosyllabic [[logogram]]s, and [[consonant cluster]]s foreign to Chinese must be broken into their constituent sounds (or omitted), despite being thought of as a single unit in their original language. Since there are so many characters to choose from when transcribing a word, a translator can manipulate the transcription to add additional meaning.

In the [[People's Republic of China]], the process has been standardized by the Proper Names and Translation Service of the [[Xinhua News Agency]]. Xinhua publishes an official reference guide, the ''Names of the World's Peoples: a Comprehensive Dictionary of Names in Roman-Chinese'' ({{lang|zh|世界人名翻译大辞典}}, ''Shìjiè Rénmíng Fānyì Dà Cídiǎn''), which controls most transcription for official media and publication in mainland China. As the name implies, the work consists of a dictionary of common names. It also includes transcription tables for names and terms which are not included. The English table is reproduced [[#Transcription table|below]]; those for a number of other languages are available at the [[:zh:Category:外語譯音表|Chinese Wikipedia]].

The Basic Laws of the [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] provide that "Chinese" will be the official languages of those territories, in addition to English and Portuguese, respectively, leaving ambiguous the relative preference for [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. In practice, transcriptions based on both Cantonese and Mandarin pronunciations have been used.

In [[Singapore]], transcription standards are established by the Translation Standardisation Committee for the Chinese Media.

Increasingly,  other countries are setting their own official standards for Chinese transcription
and do not necessarily follow Xinhua's versions, just as Xinhua's version differs from Wade–Giles and other international standards.
For example, the United States embassy in China recommends rendering "Obama" as “欧巴马” (''Ōubāmǎ''), while Xinhua uses “奥巴马” (''Àobāmǎ'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/china/2009/11/091114_us_obama_translation&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Transcription of foreign terms may date to the earliest surviving written records in China, the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] [[oracle bones]]. As the [[Huaxia]] spread from their initial settlements near the confluence of the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] [[rivers of China|rivers]], they were surrounded on all sides by [[Hua–Yi distinction|other peoples]]. The Chinese characters developed to describe them may have originally transcribed local names, such as the proposed connection between the original "[[Dongyi|Eastern Yi]]" people ({{lang|zh|東夷}}) and an [[Austroasiatic]] word for "sea".&lt;ref name=axl&gt;Schuessler, Axel. ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', p. 563. University of Hawaii Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tendency within China was to fit new groups into the existing structure, so that, for example, "Yi" eventually became a word for ''any'' "[[Four Barbarians|barbarian]]" and the name "[[Baiyue#Name|Yue]]" ({{lang|zh|戉}} &amp; {{lang|zh|越}}), originally applied to a people northwest of the Shang,&lt;ref name=meachulpa&gt;{{cite journal| title = Defining the Hundred Yue| first = William| last = Meacham| journal = Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association| volume = 15| year = 1996| pages = 93–100| url = http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/view/405/394| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140228202613/http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/view/405/394| archivedate = 2014-02-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was later applied to a [[Yue (state)|people south of the Yangtze]] and then to [[Baiyue|many cultures]] as far south as [[Vietnam]]. Interaction with the states of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wu (state)|Wu]], and [[Yue (state)|Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s of the later [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] brings the first certain evidence of transcription: most famously, the word ''jiāng'' ({{lang|zh|江}}), originally ''krong'',&lt;ref name=bajiang&gt;Baxter, Wm. H. &amp; Sagart, Laurent. ''{{cite web |url= http://crlao.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1207 |title= Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927141238/http://crlao.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1207 |archivedate= 2013-09-27 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.93&amp;nbsp;MB)}}'', p. 56. 2011.

Besides proper names, a small number of [[List of loanwords in Chinese|loanwords]] also found their way into Chinese during the [[Han Dynasty]] after [[Zhang Qian]]'s exploration of the [[Western Regions]].&lt;ref name=shryo&gt;{{lang|zh|史有为}} [Shi Youwei]. {{lang|zh|《汉语外来词》}} ["''Hànyǔ Wàiláicí''", "Chinese Loanwords"]. Commercial Press (Beijing), 2000. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Western Han Dynasty|Western Han]] also saw [[Liu Xiang (author)|Liu Xiang]]'s transcription and translation of the "[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]" in his ''[[Garden of Stories]]''. Some scholars have tried to use it to reconstruct an original version of the otherwise unrecorded language of the Yangtze's Yue people before their incorporation into the [[Han Chinese|Han]].&lt;ref name=shafa&gt;[[Zhengzhang Shangfang]]. "Decipherment of Yue-Ren-Ge (Song of the Yue Boatman)".

The expansion of [[Buddhism]] within China during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty|later Han]] and [[Three Kingdoms period]] required the transcription of a great many [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali language|Pali]] terms. According to the [[Song Dynasty|Song]]-era scholar [[Zhou Dunyi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|周敦頤}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhou Dunyi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ，《[http://www.suttaworld.org/big5-txt/sutra/lon/other54/2131/2131-01.htm {{lang|zh|翻譯名義序}}]》 ["''Fānyì Míngyì Xù''", "Preface to the 'Explanation of Buddhist terms'"]. Accessed 6 November 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the monk and translator [[Xuanzang]] (of ''[[Journey to the West]]'' fame) handed down guidelines of "Five Kinds of Words Not to Translate" (&lt;small&gt;t&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|五種不翻}}, &lt;small&gt;s&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|五种不翻}}). He directed that transcription should be used instead of translation when the words are:
#Arcane, such as [[incantations]]
#[[polysemy|Polysemous]]
#Not found in China
#Traditionally transcribed, not translated
#Lofty and subtle, which a translation might devalue or obscure
These ancient transcription into Chinese characters provide clues to the reconstruction of [[Middle Chinese]]. In [[historical Chinese phonology]], this information is called ''duiyin'' (&lt;small&gt;t&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|對音}}, &lt;small&gt;s&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|对音}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"corresponding sounds"); in Western [[Sinology]], [[Baron Alexander von Staël-Holstein]] was the first to emphasize its importance in reconstructing the sounds of Middle Chinese. The transcriptions made during the [[Tang Dynasty]] are particularly valuable, as the then-popular [[Tantra]] sect required its [[mantra]]s to be rendered very carefully into Chinese characters, since they were thought to lose their efficacy if their exact sounds were not properly uttered.

In the [[Ming dynasty]], the [[Hanlin Academy#Bureau of Translators|Chinese government's Bureau of Translators]] (四夷馆, ''Siyi Guan'') and the Bureau of Interpreters (会同馆, ''Huitong Guan'') published bilingual dictionaries/vocabularies of foreign languages like the Bureau of Translators' multilingual dictionary (华夷译语, ''Hua-Yi yiyu'', 'Sino-Barbarian Dictionary'), using Chinese characters to phonetically transcribe the words of the foreign languages such as [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Old Uyghur language|Old Uyghur]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Cham language|Cham]], [[Tai Nüa language|Dai]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]], and [[Sanskrit]].

During the [[Qing dynasty]] some bilingual Chinese-Manchu dictionaries had the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] words phonetically transcribed with Chinese characters. The book 御製增訂清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Revised and Enlarged mirror of Qing") in Manchu and Chinese, used both Manchu script to transcribe Chinese words and Chinese characters to transcribe Manchu words with [[fanqie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|issue=|first1=Heming|last1=Yong|first2=Jing|last2=Peng|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA397|page=397|isbn=0191561673|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the promotion of [[Kaozheng]] studies in the [[philological]] field, Qianlong decided that the Chinese character transcriptions of names and words of the [[Khitan language]] in the [[History of Liao]], the [[Jurchen language]] in the [[History of Jin]], and the [[Mongolian language]] in the [[History of Yuan]] were not phonetically accurate and true to the original pronunciation. The histories were in fact hastily compiled and suffered from inaccurate and inconsistent phonetic transcriptions of the same names.

Qianlong identified the [[Solon language]] with the Khitan, the [[Manchu language]] with the Jurchen, and the Mongolian language with the Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crossley |first= Pamela Kyle |last2= Rawski |first2= Evelyn S. |date= Jun 1993 |title= A Profile of The Manchu Language in Ch'ing History |jstor= 2719468|journal= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |publisher= Harvard-Yenching Institute |volume=  53|issue= 1 |page=99 |doi= 10.2307/2719468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solon, Mongolian, and Manchu speakers were consulted with on the "correct" pronunciations of the names and words and their Chinese transcriptions were accordingly changed. However the Khitan language has now been found by modern linguists to be a Mongolic language and is unrelated to the Solon language. The project was part of the Siku Quanshu. Qianlong also promulgated a theory that the [[Daur people]] were descended from a Khitan clan, changing the Khitan clan name 大賀 dàhè, found in the History of Liao, to 達呼爾 dáhūěr. The Chinese transcription of the Manchu clan name Niohuru 鈕祜祿  (Niuhulu) was edited and inserted in place of the Jurchen clan name 女奚烈 (Nüxilie).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Materials for a Genealogy of the Niohuru Clan: With Introductory Remarks on Manchu Onomastics|first=Hoong Teik|last=Toh|others=|volume=Volume 10 of Aetas Manjurica | ISSN =0931-282X|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|date=|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSNMGosP0cAC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|isbn=3447051965|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"2. A learned committee, consisting of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, western Mohammedans, etc. was appointed by the emperor K'ien-lung to revise the Yüan shi, and especially the foreign names of men, places etc. occurring so frequently in that book. These savants in their reformatory zeal, proceeded on the idea, that all the proper names had been incorrectly rendered in the official documents of the Mongols, and had to be changed. They pronounced the same verdict with respect to the histories of the Liao and the Kin. Thus in the new editions of the histories of the Liao, Kin and Yüan, all the original proper names without exception disappeared, and were replaced by names of a new invention, which generally have little resemblance to the original. For further particulars, compare my Notes on Chinese Mediaeval Travellers, p. 58, note 1. By this way of corrupting the names of the original historios, which have generally rendered foreign sounds as correctly as the Chinese language permits, the K'ien-lung editions of these works have become completely unserviceable for historical and geographical investigations. K'ien-lung was very proud of the happy idea of metamorphosing the ancient proper names, and issued an edict, that in future no Chinese scholar should dare to use the ancient names.

After the three histories had been corrupted, K'ien-lung ordered the same committee to explain the meanings of the new names; and this gave rise to a new work entitled: 遼金元史語解 Liao kin yüan shi yü kai, or "Explanation of words (proper names) found in the histories of the Liao, Kin and Yüan." In this vocabulary, all the names of men, countries, places, mountains, rivers etc.—of the three histories have been systematically arranged, but according to the new spelling. The original spelling of the name however is always given, and the chapters are indicated where the name occurs. This renders the vocabulary very useful for reference, and we may lay aside the fact, that the principal object in view of the learned committee, was the absurd explanation of the meaning of the newly-invented names. I may give a few examples of the sagacity these savants displayed in their etymological commentaries. The city of Derbend (the name means "gate" in Persian), situated on the western shore of the Caspian sea, is mentioned in the Yuan shi, as a city of Persia, and the name is written 打耳班 Da-r-ban. The committee changed the name into 都爾本 Du-r-ben, and explain that durben in Mongol means, "four." The name of Bardaa, a city of Armenia, is rendered in the original Yuan shi by 巴耳打阿 Ba-r-da-a. The committee will have the name to be 巴勒塔哈 Ba-le-t'a-ha, and comment that this name in Manchu means "the neck part of a sable skin." By 别失八里 Bie-shi-ba-li in theuncorrupted Yuan shi, Bishbalik is to be understood. The meaning of this name in Turkish, is " Five cities," and the term 五城 Wu-ch'eng, meaning also "Five cities," occurs repeatedly in the Yuan shi, as a synonym of Bie-shi-ba-li. The committee however transformed the name into 巴實伯里 Ba-shi-bo-li, and state that Ba-shi in the language of the Mohammedans means "head" and bo-li "kidneys."

The most recent edition of the Yüan shi (also with corrupted proper names) is dated 1824, but Archimandrite Palladius has noticed that it was only finished about twenty years later. This edition is not difficult of purchase, and I fancy it is the only edition of the Yuan shi found in European libraries. The numerous translations from the "Mongol history," found in Pauthier's M. Polo, have all been made from this corrupted text. At the time Klaproth and Rémusat wrote, the Yuan shi was unknown in Europe, and it seems, that even the old Catholic missionaries in Peking had not seen it. The old sinologues knew only an extract of the great "Mongol History"." - [[Emil Bretschneider|E.

Marshall Broomhall commented that ''Though a great soldier and a great litterateur, K'ien-lung did not escape some serious errors. At one time he appointed a learned committee of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, and Western Mohammedans to revise the foreign names of men and places which occur in the Yüan Records. So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Yüan histories are practically useless. The title Kalif rendered Ha-li-fu was changed by the Committee into Farkha and is explained as being "a village in Manchuria."''&lt;ref name="Broomhall1910"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan &amp; Scott, Limited|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill (Leiden), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence was particularly marked in dialects near the major ports, like [[Shanghainese]]. Many of these phonemic loans proved to be fads, however, and popular usage and linguistic reformers subsequently favored [[calque]]s or [[neologism]]s in their place.

==Sound and meaning==
{{See also|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
A transcription into Chinese characters can sometimes be a [[phono-semantic matching]], i.e. it reflects both the sound and the meaning of the transcribed word. For example, "[[Modern Standard Chinese]] {{lang|zh-hans|声纳}} ''shēngnà'' "[[sonar]]", uses the characters 声 ''shēng'' "sound" and 纳 ''nà'' "receive, accept". 声 ''shēng'' is a phonetically imperfect rendering of the English initial syllable (although ''peng'', for instance, would have been much worse). Chinese has a large number of homo/heterotonal homophonous morphemes, which would have been much better phonetically (but not nearly as good semantically){{snd}} consider the syllable ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|song}}'' (cf. 送 ''sòng'' ‘deliver, carry, give (as a present)’, 松 ''sōng'' ‘pine; loose, slack’, 耸 ''sǒng'' ‘tower; alarm, attract’ etc.), ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|sou}}'' (cf. 搜 ''sōu'' ‘search’, 叟 ''sŏu'' ‘old man’, 馊 ''sōu'' ‘sour, spoiled’ and many others) or ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|shou}}'' (cf. 收 ''shōu'' ‘receive, accept’, 受 ''shòu'' ‘receive, accept’, 手 ''shǒu'' ‘hand’, 首 ''shǒu'' ‘head’, 兽 ''shòu'' ‘beast’, 瘦 ''shòu'' ‘thin’ and so forth)."&lt;ref&gt;P. 57 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, G.]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], {{ISBN|978-1-4039-3869-5}} / {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Belarus]] (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"White Russia") is transcribed in Chinese as {{lang|zh|白俄罗斯}} (''Bái'èluósī''), with {{lang|zh|白}} (''bái'' "white") and {{lang|zh-hans|俄罗斯}} (''Èluósī'', "Russia") preserving the meaning of the original name. Similarly, the common ending ''-va'' in [[Russian language|Russian]] female surnames is usually transcribed as {{lang|zh|娃}} (''wā''), meaning "baby" or "girl", and the corresponding masculine suffix ''—[o]v'' is rendered as {{lang|zh|夫}} (''fū''), meaning "man". In literary translations, [[Utopia]] was famously transcribed by [[Yan Fu]] as {{lang|zh|烏托邦}} or {{lang|zh|乌托邦}} (''Wūtuōbāng'', "fabricated country") and [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] was written as {{lang|zh|龐大固埃}} or {{lang|zh|庞大固埃}} (''Pángdàgù'āi''), from {{lang|zh|龐大}} or {{lang|zh|庞大}} ("gigantic") and {{lang|zh|固}} ("solid", "hefty"). More recently, one translation of [[World Wide Web]] is {{lang|zh|萬維網}} or {{lang|zh|万维网}} (''Wànwéi Wǎng''), meaning "[[myriad]]-dimensional net". Sometimes the transcription reflects ''[[chengyu]]'' or other Chinese sayings and idioms. For example, the [[Beatles]] are known in Mainland China as {{lang|zh|披頭士}} ({{lang|zh|披头士}}, ''Pītóushì''), "the mop-headed", and in Taiwan and Hong Kong, {{lang|zh|披頭四}} ({{lang|zh|披头四}}, ''Pītóusì''), "the mop-head four", reflecting the ''[[chengyu]]'' {{lang|zh|披頭散髮}} or {{lang|zh|披头散发}} (''pītóu sànfǎ'') concerning disheveled hair. They can also reflect subjective opinions or advertising. [[Esperanto]], now known as "the international language" or literally "language of the world" ({{lang|zh|世界語}} or {{lang|zh|世界语}}, ''Shìjièyǔ''), was first introduced to China as {{lang|zh|愛斯不難讀}} or {{lang|zh|爱斯不难读}} (''Àisībùnándú''), meaning "[We] love this [because it's] not difficult to read".

Given that a Chinese neologism can be a phono-semantic matching (i.e. in accordance with both the meaning and the sound of the foreign lexical item), an "innocent" transcription may be unwittingly interpreted as reflecting the meaning of the original. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], some Chinese scholars were unhappy to find China was located on a continent called 亞細亞 (亚细亚 ''Yàxìyà''), i.e. [[Asia]], as 亞 means "secondary" and 細 "small", believing that the Europeans were deliberately belittling the East.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qian Zhongshu]] 錢鍾書, ''Guan Zhui Bian'' (管錐編 "Limited Views"), Beijing: Chung Hwa Book Company, 1999[1979], vol.4, pp.1458-1462. Cf. Zhang Shaoqi 张绍麒, ''Hanyu Liusu Ciyuan Yanjiu'' (汉语流俗词源硏究 "A study of Chinese [[folk etymology]]"), Beijing: Yuwen Chubanshe, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Japanese, or the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] people were upset by their name being represented by the character [[Wikt:倭|倭]] ''wō'' ("small, short, servile") by the Chinese, and replaced it with [[wikt:和|和]] ''hé'' ("peace, harmony").&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Michael Carr, "Wa 倭 Wa 和 Lexicography", ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 1992, 5(1):1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Africans have accused the Chinese of racism, as "Africa" is written as [[Wikt:非洲|非洲]] ''fēizhōu'' ("negative, wrong continent") in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;David Wright, ''Translating Science: The Transmission of Western Chemistry into Late Imperial China, 1840-1900'', Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2000, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these accusations were justified is controversial.

Cultural differences and personal preference about negative meaning is subjective. However, some translations are generally held to be inappropriate and are usually not used in today’s transcriptions:

*[[Mozambique]] as 莫三鼻給 (莫三鼻给, ''Mòsānbígěi''), with 鼻 meaning "nose" and 三鼻 "three noses". Today the country is more often transcribed as 莫桑比克 (''Mòsāngbǐkè'').
*[[Aberdeen]] is a common name for places and people, rendered as 鴨巴甸 (''Yābādiàn''), with 鴨 (鸭) meaning duck. However a place in Hong Kong, [[Aberdeen Harbour]], was originally called 香港仔 (''Xiānggǎngzǐ''), meaning "Hong Kong minor"; that is now the official name, but 鴨巴甸 is still used colloquially.  Moreover, today the place is more often transcribed as 阿伯丁 (''Ābódīng'').
[[File:Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida.png|thumb|Sign for the Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida.]]
*A street in [[Macau]] is called ''Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida'', after the official Ferreira de Almeida. Ferreira was transcribed as 肥利喇 (''Féilìlǎ''), as shown on the name of the street, with 肥 meaning "fat" ([[adjective|adj.]]).
*A street in [[Macau]] is called ''Avenida de Demetrio Cinatti''. It has been transcribed as 爹美刁施拿地大馬路, with 刁 meaning cunning or wicked.

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], phono-semantic matching in Chinese is common in four semantic domains: brand names, computer [[jargon]], technological terms and [[toponyms]].&lt;ref&gt;P. 59 of Zuckermann, G. (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], {{ISBN|978-1-4039-3869-5}} / {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transcriptions are meant to have, or happen to have, positive connotations:
*United Kingdom is called 英國/英国 ''Yīngguó'', literally "hero country". The first character, 英, is abbreviated from 英吉利 ''Yīngjílì'', the early Chinese transcription of "English", but subsequently applied to the UK after it was formed from the union of England and Scotland.
*[[Germany]] is abbreviated as 德國/德国 ''Déguó'', literally "moral country". The first character, 德, is abbreviated from 德意志 ''Déyìzhì'' (the Chinese transcription of "[[Deutsch (disambiguation)|Deutsch]]", the German word for "German").
*United States of America is abbreviated 美國/美国 ''Měiguó'', literally "beautiful country". It is abbreviated from 美利堅合眾國 Meǐlìjiān Hézhòngguó, 美利堅 is an early phonetic transcription of "America".
*[[Philippines]] as 菲律宾/菲律賓 ''Fēilǜbīn'' through transliteration. However [[Filipino-Chinese]] in the Philippines uses 菲國 Fēi guó meaning "Fragrant Lands".
*[[Athens]] as 雅典 ''Yǎdiǎn'', literally "elegant" and "classical".
*[[Champs-Élysées]] as 香榭麗舍/香榭丽舍 ''Xiāngxièlìshè'', meaning "fragrant pavilion (and) beautiful house".
*[[Dublin]] as 都柏林 ''Dūbólín'', meaning "[[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] forest [[capital city|capital]]."
*[[Florence|Firenze]] as 翡冷翠 ''Fěilěngcuì'' (by the poet [[Xu Zhimo]]), 翡翠 meaning "[[jadeite]]" and 冷 "cold". Today the city is usually known as 佛羅倫薩/佛罗伦萨 ''Fóluólúnsà'' or 佛羅倫斯 ''Fóluólúnsī'', transcriptions based on the Anglo-French ''Florence'' rather than the endonym.
*[[Fontainebleau]] as 楓丹白露/枫丹白露, meaning "red maple (and) white dew".
*[[Ithaca]] as 綺色佳/绮色佳 ''Qǐsèjiā'', literally "gorgeous colour wonderful".
*[[Yosemite]] as 優山美地/优山美地 ''Yōushānměidì'' (also 優仙美地/优仙美地 ''Yōuxiānměidì'', 優聖美地/优圣美地 ''Yōushèngměidì'', 優詩美地/优诗美地 ''Yōushīměidì'', or 優勝美地/优胜美地 ''Yōushèngměidì''), meaning "elegant mountain / excellent and holy / elegant poem / superior (and) beautiful land".
*[[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] as 香檳 (香槟, ''xiāng bīn'') meaning "fragrant areca"
*[[Wikipedia]] is 維基百科/维基百科 ''Wéijī Bǎikē'', it means "Wiki Encyclopedia". The Chinese transcription of "Wiki" is composed of two characters: 維/维, whose ancient sense refers to 'ropes or webs connecting objects', and alludes to the 'Internet'; and 基, meaning 'foundations'. The name can be interpreted as 'the encyclopedia that connects the fundamental knowledge of humanity'.

Foreign companies are able to choose representations of their names which serve advertising purposes:
*[[Coca-Cola]] as 可口可樂/可口可乐 ''Kěkǒu Kělè'', meaning "delicious (and) fun"
*[[Revlon]] as 露華濃/露华浓, literally "revealing bright spring dew", excerpted from [[Li Bai]]'s ''A Song of Pure Happiness'' (清平調).
*[[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotels]] as 喜來登/喜来登 ''Xǐláidēng'', "love to visit"
*[[Best Buy]] as 百思買/百思买 ''Bǎisīmǎi'', "buy (after) thinking a hundred times"
*[[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]] as 賽百味/赛百味 ''Sàibǎiwèi'', "competing (with) a hundred tastes"
*[[IKEA]] as 宜家 ''Yíjiā'', "suitable/proper for a home"
*[[Costco]] as 好市多 ''Hǎoshìduō'', "market of many great things"

*[[Pizza Hut]] as 必胜客/必勝客 Bìshèngkè, "the guest must win"
*[[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] as 必应/必應 Bìyìng, "must respond"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuicool.com/articles/yaeAZz2|title=The worst (and best) Chinese names for foreign tech companies - 推酷|website=www.tuicool.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional differences==
Mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia use [[simplified character]]s in its transcriptions, while Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau typically uses [[traditional character]]s. In addition, transcriptions used in Chinese speaking regions sometimes differ from official transcriptions. For example "Hawaii" ( 哈瓦伊） is rendered as 夏威夷 in most Chinese language media while New Zealand ({{lang|zh|新西兰}}) is transcribed by Taiwan media as 紐西蘭.

In general, mainland China tends to preserve the pronunciation of names deriving from their language of origin while Taiwan often transcribes them according to the English pronunciation. For example, the Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] is known as ''Pǔjīng'' ({{lang|zh|普京}}) in mainland sources after the native [[Russian language|Russian]] pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈputʲɪn]}}, whereas the name is rendered as ''Pǔdīng'' ({{lang|zh|普丁}}) in Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau, meanwhile, formerly transcribed names using their Cantonese pronunciations, although that practice has become less common following their handovers. Chinese transcriptions are now frequently cribbed from the mainland, even if the local pronunciation then becomes more remote from the original. For example, Cantonese sources copy the mainland transcription {{lang|zh|普京}}, despite its local pronunciation being the rather infelicitous ''Póugīng''.

Recently, a controversy arose in Hong Kong when protestors petitioned Nintendo to reverse its decision of converting the Hong Kong names of over 100 [[Pokémon]] into the mainland Chinese equivalents of their names, including its most famous character [[Pikachu]]. In the first half of 2016, Nintendo announced that it would change Pikachu's name from its original Cantonese name, ''Béikāchīu'' 比卡超, to ''Pèikāyāu'' in favor of fitting the Mandarin pronunciation, ''Píkǎqiū'' 皮卡丘, in the most recent series of Pokémon games, [[Pokémon Sun and Moon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36414978|title=Why the plan to rename Pikachu has made Hong Kong angry|date=2016-05-31|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to standardize marketing in the [[Greater China]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/05/31/pokemon-politics-proposed-pikachu-name-change-sparks-protests-in-hong-kong-%e3%80%90video%e3%80%91/|title=Pokémon politics: Proposed Pikachu name-change sparks protests in Hong Kong 【Video】|date=2016-05-31|website=RocketNews24|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription table==
The table below is the English-into-Chinese transcription table from [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]'s ''Names of the World's Peoples''. This table uses the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] for English vowels (rows) and consonants (columns). The usage notes and [[pinyin]] version can be seen [[Template:Transcription into Chinese|here]].
{{Transcription into Chinese}}

==Exceptions==

===Translating names===
The characters now employed in standardized transcription are often deliberately meaningless, so that their phonetic use is apparent. Therefore, in many cases, the Chinese names non-Chinese people adopt for themselves are not those that are phonetically equivalent but are instead "adapted" from or "inspired" by (i.e., translations of) the original. See, for instance, the [[:zh:香港总督|Chinese names of the Hong Kong governors]].

===New characters===
Very rarely, characters are specially made for the transcribed terms. This was formerly more common: by adding the appropriate semantic [[radical (Chinese)|radical]], existing characters could be used to give a sense of the sound of the new word. {{lang|zh|江}}, for instance, was formed out of {{lang|zh|[[radical 85|氵]]}} (the water radical) + {{lang|zh|工}}, which at the time had the sound value ''khong'',&lt;ref name=bajiang/&gt; to approximate the [[Baiyue|Yue]] name ''*Krong''. Similarly, the addition of {{lang|zh|[[radical 140|艹]]}} (the grass radical) produced {{lang|zh|茉莉}} (''mòlì'') to translate the [[Sanskrit]] name for [[jasmine]] ({{lang|sa-Latn|malli}}) and {{lang|zh|[[radical 145|衣]]}} (clothes) was added to other characters to permit {{lang|zh|袈裟}} (''jiāshā''), the Chinese version of Sanskrit [[kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]]. Another such example is 乒乓 (''pīngpāng'') the Chinese word for [[ping pong]], in which both characters are formed by removing a stroke from the similar sounding character 兵 (''bīng''), and at the same time, the two characters look like a net and a paddle. The most general radical for transcription is the mouth radical, which is not only used to transcribe certain foreign terms (such as {{lang|zh|咖啡}} (''kāfēi'', "coffee")), but also terms for which no Chinese characters exist in non-Mandarin [[varieties of Chinese]] (such as [[Written Cantonese#Marked phonetic loans|in Cantonese]]). Such [[phono-semantic compound]]s make up the majority of Chinese characters, but new ones coined to communicate foreign words only infrequently reach common use today. Notable exceptions are the [[Chinese characters for chemical elements]], which mostly consist of combining pre-existing characters with the appropriate radicals, such as {{lang|zh|[[radical 84|气]]}} for gases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1023">The '''vocal-auditory channel''' describes the way vocal signals can be used to produce language.  The speaker uses a [[vocal tract]] (containing most of the speech organs) to produce speech sounds, and the hearer employs an auditory apparatus (the sense of hearing) to receive and process the speech sounds.  This is why human language is said to be based on speech sounds produced by the articulatory system and received through the [[auditory system]]. The vocal channel is a particularly excellent means through which speech sounds can be accompanied or substituted by [[gestures]], facial expressions, body movement, and way of dressing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5968">'''William Hirstein''' is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] primarily interested in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[analytic philosophy]]. He is a professor of philosophy at [[Elmhurst College]].

==Training==
William Hirstein received his [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy at the [[University of California, Davis]] under the direction of [[Richard Wollheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/grad/phds.html UC Davis Philosophy Department PhDs]&lt;/ref&gt; He then did post-doctoral work under the supervision of [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], exploring [[neurological]] syndromes that lead to [[confabulation]], such as in [[split-brain]] patients, and patients with [[anosognosia]] or [[Capgras delusion]].

==Theory of confabulation==
Hirstein draws heavily on the interaction between his philosophical training and his clinical experience in his 2005 book ''Brain Fiction'' to develop a comprehensive epistemic theory of the neural basis of confabulation, and argues that [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] executive processes fail to correct false memories or perceptions, resulting in a confabulation. Thus confabulation is a result of two errors, which may be caused by two separate brain lesions. First there is an error in memory or perception, and second, prefrontal executive processes fail to correct the error.

==Mindmelding hypothesis==
[[File:Mindmelding experiment.jpg|thumb|right|Mindmelding hypothesis.]]
In his 2012 book, ''Mindmelding: Consciousness, Neuroscience, and the Mind's Privacy'', Hirstein argues that a significant block to solving the [[mind–body problem]] can be removed if we allow that it is possible for one person to directly experience the conscious mind of another. The vast majority of philosophers and scientists writing about [[consciousness]] believe that this is impossible, but this would mean that conscious brain states are different from all other physical states, which can be known about by multiple persons. This creates a block to understanding our minds as physical systems. Hirstein describes how "mindmelding" could be achieved by connecting person A's prefrontal lobes to person B's posterior cortex, which would in effect connect person A's sense of self to person B's conscious thoughts and sensations.

{{wiktionary|z-variant}}
In [[Unicode]], two [[glyph]]s are said to be '''Z-variants''' (often spelled '''zVariants''') if they share the same etymology but have slightly different appearances and different Unicode [[code point]]s. For example, the Unicode characters U+8AAA 說 and U+8AAC 説 are Z-variants. The notion of Z-variance is only applicable to the “[[CJKV]] scripts” &amp;mdash; Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese &amp;mdash; and is a subtopic of [[Han unification]].

==Differences on the Z-axis==
The Unicode philosophy of code point allocation for CJK languages is organized along three “[[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]].” The X-axis represents differences in semantics; for example, the Latin capital A (U+0041 A) and the Greek capital alpha (U+0391 Α) are represented by two distinct code points in Unicode, and might be termed “X-variants” (though this term is not common). The Y-axis represents significant differences in appearance though not in semantics; for example, the traditional Chinese character ''māo'' “cat” (U+8C93 貓) and the simplified Chinese character (U+732B 猫) are Y-variants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/glossary/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Z-axis represents minor typographical differences. For example, the Chinese characters (U+838A 莊) and (U+8358 荘) are Z-variants, as are (U+8AAA 說) and (U+8AAC 説). The glossary at ''Unicode.org''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/glossary/]&lt;/ref&gt; defines “Z-variant” as “Two CJK unified ideographs with identical semantics and unifiable shapes,” where “unifiable” is taken in the sense of Han unification.

Thus, were Han unification perfectly successful, Z-variants would not exist. They exist in Unicode because it was deemed useful to be able to “round-trip” documents between Unicode and other CJK encodings such as [[Big5]] and [[Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange|CCCII]]. For example, the character 莊 has CCCII encoding 21552D, while its Z-variant 荘 has CCCII encoding 2D552D. Therefore, these two variants were given distinct Unicode code points, so that converting a CCCII document to Unicode and back would be a [[lossless]] operation.

==Confusion==
There is some confusion over the exact definition of “Z-variant.” For example, in an [[Internet draft]] (of RFC 3743) dated 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jseng-idn-admin-02]&lt;/ref&gt; one finds ''bù'' “no” (U+4E0D [[wikt:不|不]]) and (U+F967 [[wikt:不|不]]) described as “font variants,” the term “Z-variant” being apparently reserved for interlanguage pairs such as the [[Mandarin Chinese]] ''tù'' “rabbit” (U+5154 [[wikt:兔|兔]]) and the Japanese ''to'' “rabbit” (U+514E [[wikt:兎|兎]]). However, the [[Unicode Consortium]]'s [[Unihan]] database &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html]&lt;/ref&gt; treats both pairs as Z-variants.
