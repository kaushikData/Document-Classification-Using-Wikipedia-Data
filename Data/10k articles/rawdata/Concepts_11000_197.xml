'''Association Najdeh''' (AN) ('''جمعية النجدة الاجتماعية''' in Arabic, Arabic najdeh="relief" or "aid") is an [[NGO]] involved with [[Community development|development]] and [[educational]] projects in [[Palestinian refugee camps]] in [[Lebanon]]. It operates more exactly in and around the [[refugee camps]]. It defends the [[Palestinian refugee]] women who are often victims of [[discrimination]]s and also participates in different campaigns, in coalitions of local and international organizations, for the right to work in Lebanon and the right of return to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].

==History==
The association Najdeh was founded in 1976 by a group of independent Lebanese women and men to secure immediate income to [[Palestinian refugee]] women in particular after the movement of Palestinian family to the camp of Tel-Za'atar. An initial work of embroidery was organized and generated an income, then a day-care center and a workplace for the women was created. Finally, in 1978, the Najdeh association was registered to the Ministry of the Interior as the independent Lebanese social and non-governmental organization ([[NGO]]) with headquarters in [[Beirut]]. Between 2005 in 2006, the association Najdeh elaborated a Code of conduct, intended to strengthen the role of the [[civil society]] institutions. It opposes to the proposition in 2006, of an Islamic constitution in [[Burj el-Barajneh]] camp, by institutions with Islamic trend. It has been recently mobilized during the conflict in [[Nahr el-Bared]] camps of May, 2007 to bring relief and assistance to residents of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/lebanon/crisis/Lebanon_Crisis_Health_Cluster_Bulletin_15%20August%2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108034055/http://www.emro.who.int/lebanon/crisis/Lebanon_Crisis_Health_Cluster_Bulletin_15%20August%2007.pdf |date=November 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association Najdeh organized [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in all the regions of the Lebanon, on April 30, 2009, for "the right to work campaign of the Palestinian refugees in the Lebanon", in particular with Palestinian-Lebanese coalition's commissions, after having published a report on the contribution of the [[Palestinian refugees]] to the Lebanese economy, in January, 2009, thanks to funding from aid agencies (Diakonia and Christian Aid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutterpoetry.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/palestinians-pump-up-lebanese-economy-study/ |title=Palestinians pump up Lebanese economy – study &amp;#124; Gutter Poetry in the Arab World |publisher=Gutterpoetry.wordpress.com |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The main purpose of the association Najdeh is to empower women in the Palestinian community because they are a most severely disadvantage component of the [[Palestinian refugee]] community. The improvement of the role of the women in the Palestinian community also concerns their economic, social and educational role.

==Profile==
The association Najdeh organs consists of: a General assembly, an Administrative Bureau elected by this Assembly, members of the Executive Board assigned by this Administrative Bureau.
The General assembly is 70% of women and 30% of men. The administrative board has progressed over the last few years from only female members to a fifty-fifty female/male division (6 members). The staff is primarily women and members of the [[Palestinian refugee]] community. Eighty percent of the beneficiaries are women and Palestinians, while the remaining 20% are men and individuals of other nationalities.
The association Najdeh operates on 26 centers in and around [[refugee camps]]. Its programs focus directly on the women and include: [[vocational training]] Program, Popular Education and Tutorial Program, Mother and Child Program, Social Affairs, [[Domestic Violence]] Program, [[microcredit]] Project, and Embroidery.
It also defends the rights of the Palestinians by activities of raising awareness on subjects such as the health of the reproduction, the rights of the woman and the rights of the child. The programs of the association would touch up to 10 000 refugees, in all [[palestinian refugee camps]], including camps [[Burj el-Barajneh]], [[Nahr el-Bared]], [[Shatila refugee camp|Shatila]], [[Beddawi]], etc.

==Core values==
The association Najdeh has personal core values that it intend to promote: a community committed to the Palestinian [[nation]], a belief in the importance of [[human rights]], of [[social justice]] and of [[gender equality]]. As a member of the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]](HAP International) since August 2009, she believes in the values of PAHs based on transparency and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hapinternational.org/members/our-members.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618121714/http://www.hapinternational.org/members/our-members.aspx |date=June 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The association Najdeh has several sources of funding. The [[donations]] are a big part, their origins are multiple: mainly funds from donor organizations and individuals from [[Europe]], and from some partners present in [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The other sources of income are: incomes from the production of embroidery, fees for students in professional training program and those for program of women and children.

Refusing to "'''bite the cartridge'''" was a turn of phrase used by the British in India of native Indian soldiers ([[sepoy]]s) who had mutinied in 1857.

It derives from the act of biting open a [[paper cartridge]] containing [[gunpowder]] and musket ball in order to load contemporary [[rifle]]s, especially the new [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] [[rifled musket]]. The phrase is thought by some to have later spawned the more familiar idiom "[[bite the bullet]]".

One of the alleged causes of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] were rumours that the grease on these cartridges designed to keep them dry was, variously, pork or beef fat (pork being abhorrent to the [[Muslim]]s, cows being sacred to the [[Hindu]]s), thus their refusal to bite them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/asbab/bijnor/app05_letter1869.html 1869 letter] by Sir [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] on the origins of the Mutiny of 1857&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''cardinal utility''' function or scale is a utility index that preserves [[Preference (economics)|preference]] orderings uniquely up to positive [[affine transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="Ellsberg, Daniel 1954"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel |title=Classic and Current Notions of 'Measurable Utility' |journal=Economic Journal |year=1954 |volume=64 |issue=255 |pages=528–556 |doi=10.2307/2227744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strotz |first1=Robert |year=1953 |title=Cardinal Utility |journal=American Economic Review |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=384–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two utility indices are related by an affine transformation if for the value &lt;math&gt;u(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; of one index ''u'', occurring at any quantity &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; of the goods bundle being evaluated, the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;v(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; of the other index ''v'' satisfies a relationship of the form

:&lt;math&gt;v(x_i) = au(x_i) + b\!&lt;/math&gt;,

for fixed constants ''a'' and ''b''. Thus the utility functions themselves are related by

:&lt;math&gt;v(x) = au(x) + b.&lt;/math&gt;

The two indices differ only with respect to scale and origin.&lt;ref name="Ellsberg, Daniel 1954"/&gt; Thus if one is concave, so is the other, in which case there is often said to be [[diminishing marginal utility]].

Thus the use of cardinal utility imposes the assumption that levels of absolute satisfaction exist, so that the magnitudes of increments to satisfaction can be compared across different situations.

The idea of cardinal utility is considered outdated except for specific contexts such as [[expected utility theory|decision making under risk]], [[social welfare function|utilitarian welfare evaluations]], and [[discounted utility|discounted utilities]] for [[intertemporal choice|intertemporal evaluations]] where it is still applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Köbberling |first=Veronika |date=February 2006 |title=Strength of Preference and Cardinal Utility |work=Economic Theory |volume=27 |issue=2 |p=375 |jstor=25056023 |doi=10.1007/s00199-005-0598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, such as in general [[Consumer choice|consumer theory]], [[ordinal utility]] with its weaker assumptions is preferred because results that are just as strong can be derived.

== History ==
The first one to theorize about the marginal value of money was [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. He assumed that the value of an additional amount is inversely proportional to the pecuniary possessions which a person already owns. Since Bernoulli tacitly assumed that an interpersonal measure for the utility reaction of different persons can be discovered, he was then inadvertedly using an early conception of cardinality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kauder |first1=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory: From Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=Economic Journal |date=1953 |volume=63 |issue=251 |page=648 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli's imaginary [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] utility function and Gabriel Cramer's {{math|''U''{{=}}''W&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''}} function were conceived at the time not for a theory of demand but to solve the [[St. Petersburg paradox|St. Petersburg's game]]. Bernoulli assumed that "a poor man generally obtains more utility than a rich man from an equal gain"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samuelson |first1=Paul |title=St. Petersburg Paradoxes: Defanged, Dissected, and Historically Described |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=1977 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=38 |jstor=2722712}}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach that is more profound that the simple mathematical expectation of money as it involves a law of ''moral expectation''.

Early theorists of [[utility]] considered that it had physically quantifiable attributes. They thought that utility behaved like the magnitudes of distance or time, in which the simple use of a ruler or stopwatch resulted in a distinguishable measure. "Utils" was the name actually given to the units in a utility scale.

In the [[Victorian era]] many aspects of life were succumbing to quantification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Peter |date=1996 |title=Against the Gods. The Remarkable Story of Risk |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |p=191 |isbn=978-0-4711-2104-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5TKA6B0pyEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of utility soon began to be applied to moral-philosophy discussions. The essential idea in [[utilitarianism]] is to judge people's decisions by looking at their change in utils and measure whether they are better off. The main forerunner of the utilitarian principles since the end of the 18th century was [[Jeremy Bentham]], who believed utility could be measured by some complex introspective examination and that it should guide the design of social policies and laws. For Bentham a scale of pleasure has as a unit of intensity "the degree of intensity possessed by that pleasure which is the faintest of any that can be distinguished to be pleasure";&lt;ref name="Stigler, George 1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=George |date=August 1950 |url=http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/GIACOMO/arquivos/eco02277/stigler-1950.pdf |title=The Development of Utility Theory. I |work=Journal of Political Economy |volume=58 |issue=4 |pp=307–327 |jstor=1828885 |doi=10.1086/256962}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also stated that, as these pleasures increase in intensity higher and higher numbers could represent them.&lt;ref name="Stigler, George 1950"/&gt; In the 18th and 19th centuries utility's measurability received plenty of attention from European schools of political economy, most notably through the work of [[Marginalism|marginalists]] (e.g. [[William Jevons|William Stanley Jevons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jevons |first1=William Stanley |title=Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society |date=1862 |volume=29 |pages=282–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léon Walras]], [[Alfred Marshall]]). However, neither of them offered solid arguments to support the assumption of measurability. In Jevon's case he added to the later editions of his work a note on the difficulty of estimating utility with accuracy.&lt;ref name="Stigler, George 1950"/&gt; Walras, too, struggled for many years before he could even attempt to formalize the assumption of measurability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaffé |first1=William |title=The Walras-Poincaré Correspondence on the Cardinal Measurability of Utility |journal=Canadian Journal of Economics |date=1977 |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=300 |doi=10.2307/134447 |jstor=134447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was ambiguous about the measurability of hedonism because he adhered to its psychological-hedonistic properties but he also argued that it was "unrealistical" to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinoia |first1=Rozenn |title=That Which is Desired, Which Pleases, and Which Satisfies: Utility According to Alfred Marshall |journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=350 |url=http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Lee/courses/502/reading/mad2.pdf |accessdate=21 May 2015 |doi=10.1080/1042771032000114764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of cardinal utility theory in the 19th century suggested that market prices reflect utility, although they did not say much about their compatibility (i.e., prices being objective while utility is subjective). Accurately measuring subjective [[pleasure]] (or [[pain]]) seemed awkward, as the thinkers of the time were surely aware. They renamed utility in imaginative ways such as ''subjective wealth'', ''overall happiness'', ''moral worth'', ''psychic satisfaction'', or ''ophélimité''. During the second half of the 19th century many studies related to this fictional magnitude&amp;mdash;utility&amp;mdash;were conducted, but the conclusion was always the same: it proved impossible to definitively say whether a good is worth 50, 75, or 125 utils to a person, or to two different people. Moreover, the mere dependence of utility on notions of [[hedonism]] led academic circles to be skeptical of this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=George |date=October 1950 |title=The Development of Utility Theory. II |work=Journal of Political Economy |volume=58 |issue=5 |p=373–396 |jstor=1825710 |doi=10.1086/256980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Edgeworth]] was also aware of the need to ground the theory of utility into the real world. He discussed the quantitative estimates that a person can make of his own pleasure or the pleasure of others, borrowing methods developed in psychology to study hedonic measurement: [[psychophysics]]. This field of psychology was built on work by [[Ernst H. Weber]], but around the time of World War I, psychologists grew discouraged of it.&lt;ref name="Collander, David 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colander |first1=David |date=Spring 2007 |title=Retrospectives: Edgeworth's Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=215–226 |jstor=30033725 |doi=10.1257/jep.21.2.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N. |title=Happyism |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103952/happyism-deirdre-mccloskey-economics-happiness |work=New Republic |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Carl Menger]] and his followers from the [[Austrian school|Austrian school of economics]] undertook the first successful departure from measurable utility, in the clever form of a theory of ranked uses. Despite abandoning the thought of quantifiable utility (i.e. psychological satisfaction mapped into the set of real numbers) Menger managed to establish a body of hypothesis about decision-making, resting solely on a few axioms of ranked preferences over the possible uses of goods and services. His numerical examples are "illustrative of ordinal, not cardinal, relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stigler |first1=George |title=The Economics of Carl Menger |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=April 1937 |volume=45 |issue=2 |page=240 |jstor=1824519 |doi=10.1086/255042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the 19th century [[neoclassical school of economics|neoclassical economists]] started to embrace alternative ways to deal with the measurability issue. By 1900, [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] was hesitant about accurately measuring pleasure or pain because he thought that such a self-reported subjective magnitude lacked scientific validity. He wanted to find an alternative way to treat utility that did not rely on erratic perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref name="teaching.ust.hk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewin |first1=Shira B. |year=September 1996 |title=Economics and Psychology: Lessons for our Own Day from the Early Twentieth Century |url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~mark329y/EconPsy/Economics%20and%20Psychology%20-%20Lessons%20for%20Our%20Own%20Day%20From%20the%20Early%20Twentieth%20Century.pdf |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=1293–1323 |jstor=2729503 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011071242/http://teaching.ust.hk/~mark329y/EconPsy/Economics%20and%20Psychology%20-%20Lessons%20for%20Our%20Own%20Day%20From%20the%20Early%20Twentieth%20Century.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto's main contribution to ordinal utility was to assume that higher indifference curves have greater utility, but how much greater does not need to be specified to obtain the result of increasing marginal rates of substitution.

The works and manuals of Vilfredo Pareto, Francis Edgeworth, [[Irving Fischer]], and [[Eugene Slutsky]] departed from cardinal utility and served as pivots for others to continue the trend on ordinality. According to Viner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viner |first1=Jacob |year=August 1925 |title=The Utility Concept in Value Theory and its Critics |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=369–387 |doi=10.1086/253690 |jstor=1822522}}&lt;/ref&gt; these economic thinkers came up with a theory that explained the negative slopes of demand curves. Their method avoided the measurability of utility by constructing some abstract [[Indifference curve#Map and properties of indifference curves|indifference curve map]].

During the first three decades of the 20th century, economists from Italy and Russia became familiar with the Paretian idea that utility does not need to be cardinal. According to Schultz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schultz |first1=Henry |title=The Italian School of Mathematical Economics |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 1931 |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=77 |jstor=1821749 |doi=10.1086/254172}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1931 the idea of ordinal utility was not yet embraced by American economists. The breakthrough occurred when a theory of [[ordinal utility]] was put together by [[John Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen|Roy Allen]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=John |last2=Allen |first2=Roy |year=February 1934 |title=A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value |journal=Economica |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=52–76 |doi=10.2307/2548574 |jstor=2548574}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact pages 54–55 from this paper contain the first use ever of the term 'cardinal utility'.&lt;ref name=Mos&gt;{{cite web |last=Moscati |first=Ivan |title=How Cardinal Utility Entered Economic Analysis During the Ordinal Revolution |url=http://eco.uninsubria.it/dipeco/quaderni/files/QF2012_05.pdf |work=Working Paper |publisher=Universita Dell'Insubria Facolta di Economia |date=2012 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatment of a class of utility functions preserved by affine transformations, though, was made in 1934 by Oskar Lange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Oskar |title=The Determinateness of the Utility Function |journal=Review of Economic Studies |date=1934 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=218–225 |doi=10.2307/2967485 |jstor=2967485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Frank Knight argued extensively for cardinal utility. In the decade of 1960 Parducci studied human judgements of magnitudes and suggested a range-frequency theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kornienko |first=Tatiana |date=April 2013 |title=Nature’s Measuring Tape: A Cognitive Basis for Cardinal Utility |publisher=University of Edinburgh |p=3 |url=http://www.gtcenter.org/Archive/2013/Conf/Kornienko1637.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century economists are having a renewed interest in the measurement issues of [[Happiness economics|happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel |last2=Wakker |first2=Peter |last3=Sarin |first3=Rakesh |year=1997 |title=Back to Bentham?

Several properties of Cardinal utility functions can be derived using tools from [[measure theory]] and [[set theory]].

=== Measurability ===
A utility function is considered to be measurable, if the strength of preference or intensity of liking of a good or service is determined with precision by the use of some objective criteria. For example, suppose that eating an apple gives to a person exactly half the pleasure of that of eating an orange. This would be a measurable utility if and only if the test employed for its direct measurement is based on an objective criterion that could let any external observer repeat the results accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernadelli |first1=H. |date=May 1938 |title=The End of the Marginal Utility Theory? |journal=Economica |volume=5 |issue=18 |page=196 |doi=10.2307/2549021 |jstor=2549021}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothetical way to achieve this would be by the use of an [[hedonometer]], which was the instrument suggested by Edgeworth to be capable of registering the height of pleasure experienced by people, diverging according to a law of errors.&lt;ref name="Collander, David 2007"/&gt;

Before the 1930s, the measurability of utility functions was erroneously labeled as cardinality by economists. A different meaning of cardinality was used by economists who followed the formulation of Hicks-Allen. Under this usage, the cardinality of a utility function is simply the mathematical property of uniqueness up to a linear transformation. Around the end of the 1940s, some economists even rushed to argue that von Neumann-Morgenstern axiomatization of expected utility had resurrected measurability.&lt;ref name="teaching.ust.hk"/&gt;

The confusion between cardinality and measurability was not to be solved until the works of Armen Alchian,&lt;ref name="www2.uah.es"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alchian |first1=Armen A. |date=March 1953 |title=The Meaning of Utility Measurement |url=http://www2.uah.es/econ/MicroDoct/Alchian-Utility%20Measurement_1953.pdf |journal=American Economic Review |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=26–50 |jstor=1810289}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Baumol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baumol |first1=William |date=December 1958 |title=The Cardinal Utility Which is Ordinal |journal=Economic Journal |volume=68 |issue=272 |pages=665–672 |doi=10.2307/2227278 |jstor=2227278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Chipman.&lt;ref name="Chipman, John 1960"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chipman |first1=John |date=April 1960 |title=The Foundations of Utility |journal=Econometrica |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=215–216 |doi=10.2307/1907717 |jstor=1907717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of Baumol's paper, "The cardinal utility which is ordinal", expressed well the semantic mess of the literature at the time.

It is helpful to consider the same problem as it appears in the construction of [[level of measurement|scales of measurement]] in the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Roy |date=February 1935 |title=A Note on the Determinateness of the Utility Function |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=155–158 |doi=10.2307/2967563 |jstor=2967563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[temperature]] there are two ''degrees of freedom'' for its measurement - the choice of unit and the zero. Different temperature scales map its intensity in different ways. In the [[celsius scale]] the zero is chosen to be the point where water freezes, and likewise, in cardinal utility theory one would be tempted to think that the choice of zero would correspond to a good or service that brings exactly 0 utils. However this is not necessarily true. The mathematical index remains cardinal, even if the zero gets moved arbitrarily to another point, or if the choice of scale is changed, or if both the scale and the zero are changed. Every measurable entity maps into a cardinal function but not every cardinal function is the result of the mapping of a measurable entity. The point of this example was used to prove that (as with temperature) it is still possible to predict something about the combination of two values of some utility function, even if the utils get transformed into entirely different numbers, as long as it remains a linear transformation.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern stated that the question of measurability of physical quantities was dynamic. For instance, temperature was originally a number only up to any monotone transformation, but the development of the ideal-gas-thermometry led to transformations in which the absolute zero and absolute unit were missing. Subsequent developments of thermodynamics even fixed the absolute zero so that the transformation system in thermodynamics consists only of the multiplication by constants. According to Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944, p.&amp;nbsp;23) "For utility the situation seems to be of a similar nature [to temperature]".

The following quote from Alchian served to clarify once and for all{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the real nature of utility functions, emphasizing that they no longer need to be measurable:

{{quote |text=Can we assign a set of numbers (measures) to the various entities and predict that the entity with the largest assigned number (measure) will be chosen? If so, we could christen this measure "utility" and then assert that choices are made so as to maximize utility. It is an easy step to the statement that "you are maximizing your utility", which says no more than that your choice is predictable according to the size of some assigned numbers. For analytical convenience it is customary to postulate that an individual seeks to maximize something subject to some constraints. The thing -or numerical measure of the "thing"- which he seeks to maximize is called "utility". Whether or not utility is of some kind glow or warmth, or happiness, is here irrelevant; all that counts is that we can assign numbers to entities or conditions which a person can strive to realize. Then we say the individual seeks to maximize some function of those numbers. Unfortunately, the term "utility" has by now acquired so many connotations, that it is difficult to realize that for present purposes utility has no more meaning than this. |author=[[Armen Alchian]] |source=The meaning of utility measurement&lt;ref name="www2.uah.es"/&gt;}}

=== Order of preference ===
{{Details|Preference (economics)}}

In 1955 [[Patrick Suppes]] and Muriel Winet solved the issue of the representability of preferences by a cardinal utility function, and derived the set of axioms and primitive characteristics required for this utility index to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppes |first1=Patrick |first2=Muriel |last2=Winet |date=April 1955 |url=http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/article.html?id=11 |title=An Axiomatization of Utility Based on the Notion of Utility Differences |work=Management Science |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |pp=259–270 |jstor=2627164 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1.3-4.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose an agent is asked to rank his preferences of {{math|''A'' relative to ''B''}} and his preferences of {{math|''B'' relative to ''C''}}. If he finds that he can state, for example, that his degree of preference of {{math|''A'' to ''B''}} exceeds his degree of preference of {{math|''B'' to ''C''}}, we could summarize this information by any triplet of numbers satisfying the two inequalities: {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} were sums of money, the agent could vary the sum of money represented by {{math|''B''}} until he could tell us that he found his degree of preference of {{math|''A''}} over the revised amount {{math|''B' ''}} equal to his degree of preference of {{math|''B' ''}} over {{math|''C''}}. If he finds such a {{math|''B'''}}, then the results of this last operation would be expressed by any triplet of numbers satisfying the relationships: (a) {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, and (b) {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;''}} = {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Any two triplets obeying these relationships must be related by a linear transformation; they represent utility indices differing only by scale and origin. In this case, "cardinality" means nothing more being able to give consistent answers to these particular questions. Note that this experiment does not require measurability of utility. [[Itzhak Gilboa]] gives a sound explanation of why measurability can never be attained solely by [[introspection]]:

{{quote |text=It might have happened to you that you were carrying a pile of papers, or clothes, and didn't notice that you dropped a few. The decrease in the total weight you were carrying was probably not large enough for you to notice. Two objects may be too close in terms of weight for us to notice the difference between them. This problem is common to perception in all our senses. If I ask whether two rods are of the same length or not, there are differences that will be too small for you to notice. The same would apply to your perception of sound (volume, pitch), light, temperature, and so forth... |author=Itzhak Gilboa |source=Theory of decision under uncertainty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilboa |first=Itzhak |date=2009 |url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~kmkj/uncertainty/Gilboa_Lecture_Notes.pdf |title=Theory of Decision under Uncertainty |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-1077-8251-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this view, those situations where a person just cannot tell the difference between {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} will lead to indifference not because of a consistency of preferences, but because of a misperception of the senses. Moreover, human senses adapt to a given level of stimulation and then register changes from that baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poundstone |first=William |date=2010 |title=Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It) |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |p=39 |isbn=978-1-4299-4393-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWjTZhw1MiUC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Suppose a certain agent has a preference ordering over random outcomes (lotteries). If the agent can be queried about his preferences, it is possible to construct a cardinal utility function that represents these preferences. This is the core of the [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem#construction|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]].

== Applications ==

===Welfare economics===
Among welfare economists of the utilitarist school it has been the general tendency to take satisfaction (in some cases, pleasure) as the unit of welfare. If the function of welfare economics is to contribute data which will serve the social philosopher or the statesman in the making of welfare judgements, this tendency leads perhaps, to a hedonistic ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viner |first1=Jacob |date=December 1925 |title=The Utility Concept in Value Theory and Its Critics II |work=Journal of Political Economy |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=638–659 |doi=10.1086/253725 |jstor=1822261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this framework, actions (including production of goods and provision of services) are judged by their contributions to the subjective wealth of people. In other words, it provides a way of judging the "greatest good to the greatest number of persons". An act that reduces one person's utility by 75 utils while increasing two others' by 50 utils each has increased overall utility by 25 utils and is thus a positive contribution; one that costs the first person 125 utils while giving the same 50 each to two other people has resulted in a net loss of 25 utils.

If a class of utility functions is cardinal, intrapersonal comparisons of utility differences are allowed. If, in addition, some comparisons of utility are meaningful interpersonally, the linear transformations used to produce the class of utility functions must be restricted across people. An example is cardinal unit comparability. In that information environment, admissible transformations are increasing affine functions and, in addition, the scaling factor must be the same for everyone. This information assumption allows for interpersonal comparisons of utility differences, but utility levels cannot be compared interpersonally because the intercept of the affine transformations may differ across people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackorby |first1=Charles |last2=Bossert |first2=Walter |last3=Donaldson |first3=David |title=Utilitarianism and the Theory of Justice |editor1-last=Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth |editor2-last=Sen |editor2-first=Amartya |editor3-last=Suzumura |editor3-first=Kotaru |work=Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare |date=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-82914-6 |page=552 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rh10cOpltLsC&amp;pg=PA552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marginalism ===
{{Details|Marginal utility}} 
*Under cardinal utility theory, the ''sign'' of the marginal utility of a good is the same for all the numerical representations of a particular preference structure.
*The ''magnitude'' of the marginal utility is not the same for all cardinal utility indices representing the same specific preference structure.
*The ''sign'' of the second [[derivative]] of a differentiable utility function that is cardinal, is the same for all the numerical representations of a particular preference structure. Given that this is usually a negative sign, there is room for a ''law of diminishing marginal utility'' in cardinal utility theory.
*The ''magnitude'' of the second derivative of a differentiable utility function is not the same for all cardinal utility indices representing the same specific preference structure.

=== Expected utility theory ===
{{Details|Expected utility theory}}
This type of indices involves choices under risk. In this case, {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}}, are [[Lottery (probability)|lotteries]] associated with outcomes. Unlike cardinal utility theory under certainty, in which the possibility of moving from preferences to quantified utility was almost trivial, here it is paramount to be able to map preferences into the set of real numbers, so that the operation of mathematical expectation can be executed. Once the mapping is done, the introduction of additional assumptions would result in a consistent behavior of people regarding fair bets. But fair bets are, by definition, the result of comparing a gamble with an expected value of zero to some other gamble. Although it is impossible to model attitudes toward risk if one doesn't quantify utility, the theory should not be interpreted as measuring strength of preference under certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoemaker |first=Paul |date=June 1982 |title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=529–563 |jstor=2724488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of the utility function===

Suppose that certain outcomes are associated with three states of nature, so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is preferred over ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which in turn is preferred over ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; this set of outcomes, {{math|''X''}}, can be assumed to be a calculable money-prize in a controlled game of chance, unique up to one positive proportionality factor depending on the currency unit.

Let {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be two lotteries with probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively being

:&lt;math&gt;L_1 =(0.6, 0, 0.4),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_2 =(0,1,0)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that someone has the following preference structure under risk:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1} \succ L_{2},&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is preferred over ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. By modifying the values of {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, eventually there will be some appropriate values ({{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1'&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) for which she is found to be indifferent between it and {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;mdash;for example

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1}' =(0.5, 0, 0.5).&lt;/math&gt;

Expected utility theory tells us that

:&lt;math&gt;EU(L_{1}') = EU(L_2)\!&lt;/math&gt;

and so

:&lt;math&gt;(0.5)*u(x_1)+(0.5)*u(x_{3})=1*u(x_{2}).&lt;/math&gt;

In this example from Majumdar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majumdar |first1=Tapas |date=February 1958 |title=Behaviourist Cardinalism in Utility Theory |journal=Economica |volume=25 |issue=97 |pages=26–33 |doi=10.2307/2550691 |jstor=2550691}}&lt;/ref&gt; fixing the zero value of the utility index such that the utility of {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is 0, and by choosing the scale so that the utility of {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} equals 1, gives

:&lt;math&gt;(0.5)*u(x_{3})=1.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x_{3}) = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Intertemporal utility===
{{Details|Intertemporal choice}}
Models of utility with several periods, in which people discount future values of utility, need to employ cardinalism in order to have well-behaved utility functions. According to Paul Samuelson the maximization of the discounted sum of future utilities implies that a person can rank utility differences.{{sfnp|Moscati|2012|p=20}}

==Controversies==
Some authors have commented on the misleading nature of the terms "cardinal utility" and "ordinal utility", as used in economic jargon:

{{quote |text=These terms, which seem to have been introduced by Hicks and Allen (1934), bear scant if any relation to the mathematicians' concept of ordinal and cardinal numbers; rather they are euphemisms for the concepts of order-homomorphism to the real numbers and group-homomorphism to the real numbers. |author=John Chipman |source=The foundations of utility&lt;ref name="Chipman, John 1960"/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There remain economists who believe that utility, if it cannot be measured, at least can be approximated somewhat to provide some form of measurement, similar to how prices, which have no uniform unit to provide an actual price level, could still be indexed to provide an "inflation rate" (which is actually a level of change in the prices of weighted indexed products). These measures are not perfect but can act as a proxy for the utility. Lancaster's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lancaster |first1=Kelvin |date=April 1966 |title=A New Approach to Consumer Theory |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=132–157 |doi=10.1086/259131 |jstor=1828835}}&lt;/ref&gt; characteristics approach to consumer demand illustrates this point.

Höller came to prominence in the 1990s alongside a group of artists including [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Douglas Gordon]],&lt;ref name="wmagazine.com"/&gt; [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]], and [[Andrea Zittel]] who worked across disciplines to reimagine the experience and the space of art.&lt;ref name="newmuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/449 Carsten Höller: Experience, 26 October 2011 – 15 January 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022114208/http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/449 |date=22 October 2011 }} [[New Museum]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Höller creates situations which question familiar forms of perception and allow exhibition visitors to experiment on themselves, often inviting the public's active participation in so-called "influential environments".&lt;ref&gt;Nazanin Lankarani (22 March 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartcongo23.html "Juxtaposing Works From Congo and Japan"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In their form, Höller's works are occasionally reminiscent of scientific laboratory arrangements, allowing the viewer to become the subject of an experiment.&lt;ref name="kunsthaus-bregenz.at"/&gt; His work since the early 1990s has encompassed buildings, vehicles, slides, toys, games, narcotics, animals, performances, lectures, 3D films, flashing lights, mirrors, eyewear and sensory deprivation tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Farquharson, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/before_and_after_science/ Before and After Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524051227/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/before_and_after_science/ |date=24 May 2011 }} ''Frieze Magazine'', Issue 85, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Höller's works is a series of corkscrewing tubular metal slides made from 1998 that is an ongoing project.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (25 October 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/arts/design/carsten-holler-exhibition-at-the-new-museum.html?ref=design Is It Art, Science or a Test of People?] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are slides a practical means of transportation, but the act of sliding down one produces a loss of control, inducing a particular state of mind related to freedom from constraint. His most famous slides include that made for the office of [[Miuccia Prada]] in Milan (2000) and the first slides made for the [[Berlin Biennale]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/pressoffice/pressreleases/2006/tm_carston_holler_16-01-06.htm "Carsten Höller to undertake next commission in The Unilever Series"], Tate Modern, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Höller's artistic practice reflects the interaction between work and public in various ways, sometimes chemically analyzing the nature of human emotions. His avid interest in the double harks back to the start of his career, when Höller designed a series of works with his then girlfriend,&lt;ref name="wmagazine.com"/&gt; the artist [[Rosemarie Trockel]], actually doubling himself up in another creator. Other examples include an exhibition in which Höller and [[Maurizio Cattelan]] presented a series of identical works at two different Paris galleries, removing all differences of style or ownership;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiliano Gioni]] (22 August 2011), [http://www.domusweb.it/en/art/my-africa/ My Africa] ''[[Domus (magazine)|Domus]]'' 949, July/August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and his exhibition "One Day One Day" (2003) at Färgfabriken in Stockholm, where two works were shown opposite each other and changed every day without the public’s knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Sansom (8 March 2011), [http://www.frieze.com/shows/review/japancongo/ JAPANCONGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514193822/http://www.frieze.com/shows/review/japancongo/ |date=14 May 2011 }} ''Frieze Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; His explorations often involve playful elements such as in ''Sliding Doors'' (2003), a series of electronic sliding doors with a mirrored surface through which the audience passes in a seemingly endless passage.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; In 2008, Höller installed ''The Revolving Hotel Room'', a hotel room for two, as part of an exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Martin (27 August 2008), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/27/museums "A room for two at the Guggenhei"m], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; At his 2010 show at the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]], visitors could pay 1,000 euros ($1,370) for a night on an exposed circular platform perched above 12 castrated reindeer, 24 canaries, eight mice and two flies.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hickley (25 November 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-25/magic-mushroom-reindeer-bored-by-couples-at-1-370-museum-slumber-parties.html Magic-Mushroom Reindeer Bored by $1,370 Museum Slumber Parties] ''Bloomberg''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Psycho Tank'', which can be used alone or with others, visitors float weightlessly on the surface of a sensory deprivation pool, providing a strange out-of-body experience&lt;ref name="newmuseum.org"/&gt; Equally encouraging visitors' participation, ''Pill Clock'' (2011) is an aperture which emits a white pill into a growing pile of the same every 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle Chayka (26 October 2011), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38961/take-a-virtual-tour-of-carsten-hollers-art-amusement-park-at-the-new-museum/ Take a Virtual Tour of Carsten Holler's Art Amusement Park at the New Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028172108/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38961/take-a-virtual-tour-of-carsten-hollers-art-amusement-park-at-the-new-museum/ |date=28 October 2011 }} ''ARTINFO''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushrooms became a regular feature of Höller's work from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Cripps (10 February 2010), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/j-g-ballard-high-impact-on-artists-1894377.html?action=Gallery&amp;ino=6 J G Ballard: High impact on artists] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since realized several works with the [[Amanita muscaria|fly-agaric mushroom]], including the ''Mushroom Suitcase'' series (2001/2008) and the ''Upside Down Mushroom Room'' (2000), which was shown in 2000 at Fondazione Prada in Milan and in 2005 at [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|MOCA]] in Los Angeles. His fly-agaric replicas are large-scale and often spin or hang upside down from the ceiling. The artist has also created photographic works based on the fly-agaric, entitled ''Mushroom Print'' (2003) and ''Soma Series'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garageccc.ru/eng/exhibitions/13619.phtml Giant Triple Mushrooms - Carsten Höller, 29 May – 10 October 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233431/http://www.garageccc.ru/eng/exhibitions/13619.phtml |date=11 October 2011 }} Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of giant sculptures of funghi – ''Giant Triple Mushrooms'' (2010) –, two quarters of each sculpture replicate the looks of two random fungi; half, a very specific species: the large red-and-white fly agaric fungus, [[Amanita muscaria]], occurring wild in Eurasia. A fungus with psychoactive, hallucinogenic properties, it was used, it is thought, by Siberian shamans as an intoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins (25 October 2011), [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2011/oct/25/art-museums?newsfeed=true "Carsten Höller in New York: all the fun of the fair"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals have figured largely in Höller’s work, most prominently at his exhibition ''Soma'' at the Hamburger Bahnhof, where two herds of reindeer were housed in the large main exhibition hall, along with canaries, mice and flies. The project was modeled after a scientific experiment. Other works that include animals include ''House for Pigs and People'', a construction Höller made with [[Rosemarie Trockel]] that was exhibited in [[documenta|documenta X]], which Höller described as a "monument of incomprehensibility. The amazement that comes back every time we observe an animal… the pigs are so similar to us, they set off strong biophile sentiments, mainly among children…." In a conversation with [[Daniel Birnbaum]], Höller continues, "…It is difficult for us to believe that our consciousness—my consciousness—can correspond to an other’s. Only if others behave like me, am I prepared to accept it—and still consider my own being unique, as do all other humans. Perhaps it is only this uniqueness that a bird doesn’t believe in. Is it missing the process of a feedback with its ‹own›". Other animal works include ''Loverfinches'' (1992-1994), ''Aquarium'' (1996), ''The Belgian Problem'' (2007), ''Singing Canaries Mobile'' (2009), and, with Rosemarie Trockel, ''Mosquito Bus'' (1996), ''Addina'' (1997), ''Bee House'' (1999), ''Silverfish House'' (1999) and ''Eyeball: a House for Pigeons, People, and Rats'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Holler, Carsten, and Daniel Birnbaum.

==Notable works, projects, and exhibitions==
'''Slides'''&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Carsten holler tate.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''Test Site'' at the Tate Modern]]
For the seventh commission in The Unilever Series, in [[Tate Modern|Tate Modern's]] Turbine Hall, Höller created ''Test Site'', an installment in his ongoing series of slide works which started in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-carsten-holler-test-site|title=The Unilever Series: Carsten Höller: Test site|website=www.tate.org.uk|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Höller’s interest in slides ranges from their use as a practical and alternative means of transportation and the effect of sliding itself, which involves a loss of control, vertigo and an emotional response from the sliders, often delight. He is also interested in the shape of slides as a counterpoint to rectangular architecture, as in the Turbine Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller: Test Site. London: Tate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier slide works include ''Valerio I'' and ''Valerio II'', which were installed at Kunst-Werke in Berlin in 1998 and 1999. Höller described their title, "The Valerio Phenomenon…supposedly originated at a rock concert in Italy. It’s an interesting example of mass hysteria.  A sound technician at a concert disappeared, and someone in the audience, pretending to know his name, shouted 'Valerio!', and  more and more people joined in.  It was apparently infectious, and it spread from Brindisi to Rimini and other cities.  There is something about the sound of this name that makes you want to shout it loud.  You feel a little better after you’ve done it, just like after having traveled down a slide."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller in Daniel Birnbaum and Carsten Höller, Tuotanto/Production, exh. cat., Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki 2000, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay about ''Test Site'', Dorothea von Hantelmann compares Höller’s slides to Nietzsche’s ideas regarding art and science as two different powers that inform culture in distinct ways. "When Nietzsche speaks of art’s potential to create intensities and vital energies, for him these creations are extraordinary—but they need not be true.  While the scientist deals with truth and its cognition, the artist, after Nietzche, creates and transforms reality."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller: Test Site. London: Tate, 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exhibition ''Experience'' at the New Museum in New York in 2011/2012, a slide was installed inside, spiraling straight through the third and fourth floors of the museum, ejecting the sliders on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. "Is It Art, Science or a Test of People?" ''The New York Times'', 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''House for Pigs and People'''&lt;br /&gt;
The project ''House for Pigs and People'', for documenta X in Kassel in 1997, was one of several collaborations realized by Höller in cooperation with the artist [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. It consisted of a box-like house structure with a concrete surface.  Inside, the space was divided by a sheet of glass, separating two sections of the house—one side for pigs, the other side for people.  The partition was one-way mirror glass, enabling the people to see the pigs, but not the other way around. The piece is a metaphor of ecological and social division, as well as an epistemological critique.&lt;ref&gt;Höller, Carsten, and Trockel, Rosemarie. ''A House for Pigs and People = Ein Haus für Schweine und Menschen''. Köln: Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther König, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book produced for the project, Höller and Trockel contribute a text that consists of a series of questions involving the relationship between humans and animals.  Some of the questions ask: "Does not human consciousness originate primarily as a project of the sociological conditions of its coming into being?  Doesn’t animal consciousness have to be something quite different, something we cannot imagine?  Or is there a basic measure of consciousness, which is part of man’s biological makeup and also occurs in animals?"&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, Daniel. "Mice And Man - Carsten Höller and Rosemarie Trockel", ''[[Artforum International]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Double Club'''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Double Club'' was a project in the form of a bar, restaurant and nightclub produced in collaboration with [[Fondazione Prada]].  It was installed in a warehouse in Islington, London, and was open from 20 November 2008 – 12 July 2009.  The club was divided into equal amounts of floor space representing the "Congo" and the "West".  Each division contained exclusively elements from each culture, including the furnishings, wall decors and food.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Jennifer, ''Frieze'', 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(London location), Collard, James, ''The Times of London'', 18 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wallpaper.com/travel/the-double-club-london&lt;/ref&gt;

Höller’s interaction with the culture of the Congo began when he started making regular visits to Kinshasa since 2001, interested in the role of music on public opinion and in turn in effecting politics. In an interview with [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]] in 2009, Höller also explains that the impetus for the ''Double Club'' was also drawn from a fascination with the phi phenomenon, "…phi was of course interesting in a double sense…the jumping to and fro between two points, the eternal back and forth.  And in that way this third form arises, which is an illusion and which moves, while the two other forms, by contrast, are fixed."&lt;ref&gt;''The Double Club''. Milan: Fondazione Prada, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phi phenomenon]] was explored earlier in Höller’s ''Flicker Films'', (2004 and 2005) which took footage from Congolese musicians and dancers presented on overlapping projections, which created a sculptural, quasi-holographic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Höller, Carsten and Barbara-Brigitte Mak. ''Höller 2001-2010: 184 Objects, Experiments, Events''. Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of Double Club took place at Miami Art Basel this year where the artist exposes his on going concept on duality and oppositions in the shape of two installations where one side is monochromatic and other, full of neon colours. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/06/prada-double-club-miami-wynwood-carsten-holler-art-basel/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carsten Holler Soma Hamburger Bahnhof Reindeer closeup.jpg|thumb|left|''Soma'' at Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin 2010. Photo credit: Tomislav Medak]]
'''SOMA'''&lt;br /&gt;
The exhibition ''Soma'' was installed at the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin in 2010.  Its main element were 12 reindeer in two pens running the length of the former railway station. Half of the reindeer were fed the [[Amanita muscaria|fly agaric mushrooms]] in their food, which are part of their customary diet in the wild, and turn their urine into a hallucinogen. The reindeer urine was collected by handlers and then stored in on-site refrigerators for use. The experiment was extended to canaries, which were housed in two hanging cage pieces, to mice, and to flies. A mushroom-shaped ''Elevator Bed'' was installed in the middle of the space, and visitors could spend the night on the premise for a fee.

The title ''Soma'' comes from the name of the sacred libation drunk by the Indo-European followers of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], Hinduism's 5,000-year-old parent. Its ancient text, the [[Rigveda]], contains 114 hymns to "creative juice", supposed to offer immortality. The recipe was lost, but in the 1960s researcher Robert Wasson hypothesised that soma was based on the fly agaric mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Williams (20 December 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/21/carsten-holler-soma "Carsten Höller: deer of perception"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Killing Children'''&lt;br /&gt;
Höller’s ''Killing Children'' works are discreet objects made between 1990 and 1994.  Some consist of such things as a comforter containing a piece of dried fly agaric titled ''Sucette aux Fausses Oranges'', a trap made from an upside-down playpen baited with a [[Kinder Chocolate|Kinder Schokolade]] egg attached to fishing wire titled ''Komm Kleines, kriegst was Feines'', a bicycle for children rigged with a fuse, match, and petrol titled ''Bicycle Bomb'', a piece titled ''220 Volt'' consisting of plugs, connecting cable and candy. ''Three Venomous Frogs from [[Costa Rica]] in a Bottle'' is a piece that is just that: dangerous frogs submerged in water in a baby’s bottle. The works in this series have been usually installed on bright bubble-gum pink carpet.&lt;ref name="Höller, Carsten 2000"&gt;Höller, Carsten, and Germano Celant. Carsten Höller - Register: [in Occasion of Carsten Höller's Exhibition "Synchro System" at the Fondazione Prada, 22.XI.2000 - 7.I.2001]. Milano, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carousels'''&lt;br /&gt;
Höller’s carousels (sometimes spelled carrousel, with two R’s, intentionally like the original word in French) and amusement park works, are some of his most well-known projects.  Dating back to 1998, the key feature with Höller’s carousels are that they are modified in some way than what we expect from an amusement park ride, either most often through speed, or sometimes rotational direction, or surface material, as is the case with his ''Mirror Carousel'' (2005). In his exhibition ''Amusement Park'' at [[MASS MoCA]] in North Adams, 2006, the degree of slowness and direction changed every day.  A local fairground operator, Art Gillette, engineered the changes.

In a catalogue essay for Höller’s 2008 exhibition at [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]], Carl Roitmeister writes of the carrousel works, "This is the age-old artistic ploy of defamiliarizing the commonplace in combination with the age-old artistic ploy represented by the Duchamp-style readymade.  But two age-old ploys do not add up to a new one…The title of the carrousel, ''R B Ride'', doesn’t get us anywhere, because R B merely stands for Robles Bouso, the name of the now-defunct Spanish company that made the fairground device.  The year of manufacture is 1969, the year of the failed revolution."  Roitmeister goes on to make comparisons of the failure of the revolution with the action of the carrousel, the revolution of a clock, or time passing, in relation to the fact that the carousels move at a reduced speed, another failure—the failure to produce amusement.  He goes further to say that "the carrousel resembles a huge clock—that is, a time-measuring device rather than a time-diverting machine…"&lt;ref&gt;Roitmeister, Carl, Eckhard Schneider, and Carsten Höller. Carsten Höller, Carrousel [anlässlich Der Ausstellung Carsten Höller - Carrousel, 12. April Bis 1. Juni 2008, Kunsthaus Bregenz]. Köln: König, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Höller’s exhibition in 2011 at [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome|MACRO]], he showed ''Double Carousel with Zöllner Stripes'' (2011). The pair of carousels anthropomorphically suggests a couple, "I thought it would be nice to have two [merry-go-rounds] interacting as if they were in love or something. To bring people together and then further away ... It is romantic and tragic at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Spence (16 December 2011), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c9b0b29e-2261-11e1-923d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1rX87CXAu Just Höller] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (29 January 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/arts/lowspeed-chase-on-carousel-of-the-mind.html "Directions - Low-Speed Chase On Carousel Of the Mind"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light Wall and Lichtraum'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Light Wall I'' (2000), ''Light Wall II'' (2001), ''Light Wall III'' (2002), ''Light Wall IV'' (2007), constitute a series of variable ''Light Walls'' consisting of at least nine panels.  Each panel holds a grid of light bulbs flickering at a frequency of between seven and twelve hertz, combined with a clicking stereo signal that continues back and forth between two audio speakers. This induces optic and acoustic [[hallucinations]]: viewers experience modulating fields of color with their eyes open or shut, or perceive themselves or what is said by others around them in altered ways. The incessant turning on and off of the lights—in contrast to strobe lights—primarily induces, due to the slow illumination rate of the filaments, an erratic state of mind caught "between" poles of light/dark, awake/asleep, I/other, etc. ''Lichtraum'' (2008), as installed at [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]], consisted of four walls of the exhibition space, each covered by thousands of [[LED lights]].  Since given the imposing scale of the surfaces, the lights are always seen out of the corner of the eye, one’s proprioception is affected so that one forms an "intuited" revolving.&lt;ref name="Höller, Carsten 2010"&gt;Höller, Carsten, Barbara-Brigitte Mak, and Erik Smith.

[[File:Germany-population-cartogram.png|thumb|Cartogram of [[Germany]], with the states and districts resized according to population]]

A '''cartogram''' is a [[map]] in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or [[Gross National Product|GNP]] – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted, sometimes extremely, in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as [[Nomography|nomographs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Two common types of cartograms are area and distance cartograms.  Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Area cartograms ==

An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a ''value-by-area map'' or an ''isodemographic map'', the latter particularly for a ''population cartogram'', which illustrates the relative sizes of the [[population]]s of the [[countries of the world]] by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are ''anamorphic map'', ''density-equalizing map'' and ''Gastner map''.&lt;ref name="GN-Diffusion"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Michael T. Gastner |author2=Mark E. J.

Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/11/02/opinion/20081102_OPCHART.html ''The New York Times''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.

A collection of contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldmapper.org/ Worldmapper: Rediscover the world as you've never seen it before]&lt;/ref&gt; which was started by a collaborative team of researchers at the [[University of Sheffield|Universities of Sheffield]] and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]].

One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was [[Waldo Tobler]] of [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]] in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]] located on the UCSB campus maintains an online [http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/Cartogram_Central/index.html Cartogram Central] with resources regarding cartograms.

A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other [[GIS software]] tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scapetoad.choros.ch/ ScapeToad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artofsoftware.org/2012/02/08/cartogram-crash-course/ The Art of Software: Cartogram Crash Course]&lt;/ref&gt; Cart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/ Cart: Computer software for making cartograms]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]'s [[ArcGIS]]), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d348614c97264ae19b0311019a5f2276 Cartogram Geoprocessing Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[R (programming language)#CRAN|CRAN]] package [https://cran.r-project.org/package=recmap recmap] provides an implementation of  a rectangular cartogram algorithm.&lt;ref name="recmap" /&gt;

Cartograms can also be constructed manually, either by hand or in a computer-assisted environment. Block cartograms are constructed by arranging geometrically regular equal-sized blocks, with the number of blocks allocated to each district proportional to the population variable. Several examples of block cartograms were published during the 2016 U.S. presidential election season by ''The Washington Post'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Redrawing the Electoral Map|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus&amp;electoral-map|website=Washington Post|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Election Forecast|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus&amp;electoral-map|website=FiveThirtyEight blog|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the ''Wall Street Journal'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draw the 2016 Electoral College Map|url=http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/2016-electoral-college-map-predictions/|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, among others.

==Girl child==
Conditions that increases the risk of girl-child sexual assault in Nigeria can be found in schools, [[Child harvesting|baby factories]] and the practice of child labour. Studies conducted in Nigeria disclose that young girls are victims in majority of reported assault cases in hospitals. A four-year review of sexual assault cases at [[Lagos University Teaching Hospital|LASUTH]] that began in 2008 and ended in December 2012, showed that out of a total 287 reported cases of sexual assault, 83% of the victims were below the age of 19.&lt;ref&gt;Akinlusi FM, Rabiu KA, Olawepo TA, Adewunmi AA, Ottun TA, Akinola OI.

In the Enugu survey, majority of the victims knew their perpetrators and the assault occurred inside uncompleted buildings and the victims or perpetrators residence.&lt;ref&gt;Ohayi, Robsam S. et al. Prevalence and pattern of rape among girls and women attending Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, southeast Nigeria International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics , Volume 130 , Issue 1 , 10 - 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child labour===
One of the traditional means of [[socialization]] of children is through trading.{{sfn|Ebigbo|2003|p=97}} However, the introduction of young girls into street trading increases the vulnerabilities of the girls to sexual harassment. Sexual abuse of young girls in Nigeria is linked [[Girl Child Labour in Nigeria|child labour]].{{sfn|Ebigbo|2003|p=104}}

===Baby factories===
Religious and communal stigma associated with surrogacy and adoption has created a rise in baby factories in Nigeria.&lt;ref name= "lekan"/&gt; A large number of female victims in the baby factories are young adolescents.&lt;ref name= "lekan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Makinde |first=Olusesan |last2=Olaleye |first2=Olalekan |date=2015 |title=Baby Factories in Nigeria Starting the Discussion Toward a National Prevention Policy |url= |journal=Trauma Violence Abuse |publisher= |issue= |pages= |doi= 10.1177/1524838015591588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operators of the baby factories mostly prey on pregnant young girls who are from lower income households, unmarried and are afraid of the public stigma associated with teenage pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Though, majority of the girls who enter the factory are pregnant some of girls in the factories were kidnapped or bartered to the operators. These girls are then raped solely for the purpose of procreation.&lt;ref name= "lekan"/&gt;

'''Constructive dilemma'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Patrick. A Concise Introduction to Logic With Ilrn Printed Access Card. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. It is the [[inference]] that, if ''P'' implies ''Q'' and ''R'' implies ''S'' and either ''P'' or ''R'' is true, then ''Q or S'' has to be true. In sum, if two [[material conditional|conditionals]] are true and at least one of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too. ''Constructive dilemma'' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] version of [[modus ponens]], whereas,
[[destructive dilemma]] is the disjunctive version of ''[[modus tollens]]''. The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(P \to Q) * (R \to S), P \lor R}{\therefore Q \lor S}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that whenever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;", "&lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;P \lor R&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''constructive dilemma'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (R \to S), (P \lor R) \vdash (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(((P \to Q) \land (R \to S)) \land (P \lor R)) \to (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

== Natural language example ==

:If I win a million dollars, I will donate it to an orphanage.
:If my friend wins a million dollars, he will donate it to a wildlife fund.
:Either I win a million dollars or my friend wins a million dollars.
:Therefore, either an orphanage will get a million dollars, or a wildlife fund will get a million dollars.

The dilemma derives its name because of the transfer of disjunctive operator.

'''Contour advection''' is a [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian method]] 
of simulating the evolution of one or more contours or isolines of
a tracer as it is stirred by a moving fluid.
Consider a blob of dye injected into a river or stream: to first order it could be modelled by tracking only the motion of its outlines. 
It is an excellent method for studying [[chaotic mixing]]:
even when advected by smooth or finitely-resolved velocity fields, 
through a continuous process of stretching and folding,
these contours often develop into intricate [[fractals]]. 
The [[flow tracer|tracer]] is typically passive as in &lt;ref name="Waugh_Plumb1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; representing a dynamical property of the fluid such as [[vorticity]].
At present, advection of contours is limited to two dimensions,
but generalizations to three dimensions are possible.

==Method==

First we need a set of points that accurately define the contour.
These points are [[advection|advected]] forward using a [[trajectory (meteorology)|trajectory]]
integration technique.
To maintain its integrity,
points must be added to or removed from the curve 
at regular intervals based on some criterion or metric.
The most obvious criterion is to maintain the distance between adjacent points
within a certain interval.
A better method is to use curvature since fewer points are required for
the same level of precision.
The [[curvature]] of a two-dimensional, Cartesian curve is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \sqrt{\left ( \frac{\mathrm d^2 x}{\mathrm d s^2}\right )^2 + 
              \left ( \frac{\mathrm d^2 y}{\mathrm d s^2} \right )^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature 
and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the path.
We need to keep the fraction of arc traced out between two adjacent points,
&lt;math&gt;
r \Delta s
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is the path difference between them,
roughly constant

In,&lt;ref name="Mills2009"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author = Peter Mills
 | title = Isoline retrieval: An optimal method for validation of advected contours

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[cubic spline]] fitting is used both to calculate the curvature
and interpolate new points into the contour.
The spline, which
is fitted [[parametric equation|parametrically]],
returns a set of second-order derivatives.

===Surgery===

A powerful refinement to the technique involves cutting out filaments that have become too
narrow to be significant.  
If the distance method of adding/removing points is used, 
then it is relatively straight forward 
to check the distances between all combinations of points.
If a distance between non-adjacent points is too small, 
then the two points are separated from their neighbours,
joined together and their neighbours joined also.
Points may then be removed if necessary.  
Once we allow surgery, we allow [[multiply connected]] domains inside the same contour.
A piece of the contour only one point in length would be removed from the simulation.
The most challenging part of the exercise is keeping track of all the points in order
to reduce the number of distance calculations---see [[nearest neighbour search]].
If the curvature method is used, 
then it may be difficult to recognize when two sections of the contour
are close enough to apply the surgery because of differing spacing
in strongly curved versus relatively straight sections.&lt;ref name="Dritschel1988"/&gt;

==Validation==

Advected contours, e.g. of trace gases (such as ozone) in the stratosphere,
can be validated with satellite remote sensing instruments using a method called [[isoline retrieval]].

S. |date=August 1985 |title=Judgmental accuracy in depression |series=The Meeting of the American Psychological Association |place=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] study of the brain, depressed patients were shown to be more accurate in their causal attributions of positive and negative social events than non-depressed participants who demonstrated a positive bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seidel|first1=Eva-Maria|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Theodore D.|last3=Eickhoff|first3=Simon B.|last4=Schneider|first4=Frank|last5=Gur|first5=Ruben C.|last6=Wolf|first6=Daniel H.|last7=Habel|first7=Ute|last8=Derntl|first8=Birgit|title=Neural correlates of depressive realism — An fMRI study on causal attribution in depression|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=2012|volume=138|issue=3|pages=268–276|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.041|pmid=22377511|pmc=3565123}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference was also reflected in the differential activation of the fronto-temporal network, higher activation for non self-serving attributions in non-depressed participants and for self-serving attributions in depressed patients, and reduced coupling of the dorsomedial [[prefrontal cortex]] seed region and the [[Limbic system|limbic]] areas when depressed patients made self-serving attributions.

==Evidence against==
When asked to rate both their performance and the performance of others, non-depressed individuals demonstrated positive bias when rating themselves but no bias when rating others.

==Criticism of the evidence==
Some have argued that the evidence is not more conclusive because no standard for reality exists, the diagnoses are dubious, and the results may not apply to the real world.&lt;ref name=Moore2012/&gt; Because many studies rely on [[self-report]] of depressive symptoms and self-reports are known to be biased, the diagnosis of depression in these studies may not be valid, necessitating the use of other objective measures. Due to most of these studies using designs that do not necessarily approximate real-world phenomena, the [[external validity]] of the depressive realism hypothesis is unclear.&lt;ref name=Moore2012/&gt;  There is also concern that the depressive realism effect is merely a byproduct of the depressed person being in a situation that agrees with their negative bias.&lt;ref name=AlloyAbramson1979&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.108.4.441 |author=Alloy, L.B. |author2=Abramson, L.Y. |year=1979 |title=Judgment of contingency in depressed and nondepressed students: Sadder but wiser? |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=108 |pages=441–485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Langer, E.J. |year=1975 |title=The illusion of control |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=32 |pages=311–328 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.2.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.1.10 |vauthors=Msetfi RM, Murphy RA, Simpson J, Kornbrot DE |year=2005 |title=Depressive realism and outcome density bias in contingency judgments: the effect of the context and intertrial interval |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology.

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - How They Met Themselves (1860-64 circa).jpg|thumb|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], ''How They Met Themselves'', watercolor, 1864|305px]]
A '''doppelgänger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|əl|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|əɹ|,_|-|g|æ|ŋ|əɹ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔpl̩ˌɡɛŋɐ|lang|De-doppelgaenger.ogg}}, literally "double-goer") is a non-biologically related [[look-alike]] or double of a living person, sometimes portrayed as a ghostly or [[paranormal]] phenomenon and usually seen as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an [[evil twin]]. In modern times, the term '''twin stranger''' is occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|title=See what happened when 3 friends set out to find their ‘twin stranger’|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906134813/https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|archivedate=2017-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3994274/Identical-strangers-brought-Finding-Twin-Stranger.html|title=Identical strangers are brought together|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20161202192206/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article%2D3994274/Identical%2Dstrangers%2Dbrought%2DFinding%2DTwin%2DStranger.html|archivedate=2016-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "doppelgänger" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person.

==Spelling==
The word ''doppelgänger'' is a [[loanword]] from the German ''Doppelgänger'', a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns ''Doppel'' (double) and ''Gänger'' (walker or goer).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger Doppelgänger; Orthography, Meaning Synonyms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120074951/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger |date=2012-11-20 }} http://www.duden.de {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AeW56Irr?url=http://www.duden.de/ |date=2012-09-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural "doppelgängers". The first known use, in the slightly different form ''Doppeltgänger'', occurs in the novel ''[[Siebenkäs]]'' (1796) by [[Jean Paul]], in which he explains his [[neologism|newly coined word]] by a [[footnote]] – while actually the word ''Doppelgänger'' also appears, but with a quite different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pleasures of Abandonment: Jean Paul and the Life of Humor |author=Paul Fleming |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-8260-3247-9 |page=126, footnote 13 |quote=In one of the stranger twists of fate in literary history, Jean Paul coins two terms in ''Siebenkäs'', "Doppelgänger" and "Doppeltgänger." The term Jean Paul uses to describe Siebenkäs and Leibgeber is "Doppeltgänger," which he defines in a footnote: "So heißen Leute, die sich selber sehen" ["the name for people who see themselves"] (2, 67). Earlier in ''Siebenkäs'' the neologism "Doppelgänger" also appears for the first time and means something quite different. In a description of the wedding banquet in the first chapter, the food is so delicious and abundant that "not only was one course [''Gang''] served but also a second, a {{italics correction|''Doppelgänger''}}" ["nicht bloß ''ein'' Gang aufgetragen wurde, sondern ein zweiter, ein Doppelgänger"] (2, 42). "Gang" in German has multiple meanings, ranging from a "walk" to the "course" of a meal; according to Jean Paul, when people "see themselves," when one "goes twice," one is a "Doppeltgänger"; when one has a meal of two courses, in which the second doesn't come second but together with the first, this is a "Doppelgänger."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[noun]]s in German, the word is written with an initial [[capital letter]]. ''Doppelgänger'' and ''Doppelgaenger'' are essentially equivalent spellings, and ''Doppelganger'' is different and would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title. It is further common to drop the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut]] on the letter "a", writing (and often pronouncing) "doppelganger".

==Mythology==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. [[Francis Grose]]'s, ''Provincial Glossary'' of 1787 used the term ''[[fetch (folklore)|fetch]]'' instead, defined as the "apparition of a person living." [[Catherine Crowe]]'s book on paranormal phenomena, ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of [[alter ego]]s and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian mythology]], a ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' was a tangible "spirit double" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. ''The Greek Princess'' presents an Egyptian view of the [[Trojan War]] in which a ''ka'' of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. This is depicted in [[Euripides]]' play [[Helen (play)|''Helen'']]. In [[Norse mythology]], a ''[[vardøger]]'' is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In [[Finnish mythology]], this is called having an ''[[etiäinen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ganander, Christfrid.

==Examples==



[[Izaak Walton]] claimed that English [[metaphysical poet]] [[John Donne]] saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Izaak. ''Life of Dr. John Donne.'' Fourth edition, 1675. Cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;

German playwright [[Goethe]] described an experience in his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' in which he and his double passed one another on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Wolfgang von Goethe.'' Translated by John Oxenford. Horizon Press, 1969. This example cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s drama ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' makes reference to a dead child who "met his own image walking in the garden".&lt;ref&gt;''Prometheus Unbound'', lines 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lord Byron]] uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.&lt;ref name="Burwick2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Burwick|title=Playing to the Crowd: London Popular Theatre, 1780-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37065-4|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Devil's Elixir]] (1815), a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. T. A., ''The Devil's Elixers (English Translation)''. London, T. Cadell, Publishers, 1829; url=https://archive.org/details/devilselixirfrom01hoffuoft/page/n3&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s early novels.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' (1846) presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams']] ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Williams, ''Descent into Hell'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Barker]]'s story "Human Remains" in his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of [[Gothic fiction]].

Criminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on [[eyewitness testimony]]. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Emily O'Hara.

[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.20|The formation of complex symmetrical and [[fractal]] [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in [[snowflake]]s exemplifies emergence in a physical system]]
[[File:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10|A [[termite]] "cathedral" mound produced by a [[termites|termite colony]] offers a classic example of emergence in [[nature]] ]]

In [[philosophy]], [[systems theory]], [[science]], and [[art]], '''emergence''' is the condition of an entity having properties its parts do not have, due to interactions among the parts.

Emergence plays a central role in theories of [[integrative level]]s and of [[complex system]]s.  For instance, the phenomenon of ''[[life]]'' as studied in [[biology]] is an emergent property of [[chemistry]], and [[psychology|psychological]] phenomena emerge from the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] phenomena of living things.

In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called [[emergentism]]. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of [[epistemic]] or [[ontological]] irreducibility to the lower levels.&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{Main|Emergentism}}

In philosophy, emergence is often understood to be a claim about the [[etiology]] of a system's properties.  An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. [[Nicolai Hartmann]], one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this ''categorial novum'' (new category).

===Definitions===
This idea of emergence has been around since at least the time of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book Η 1045a 8–10: "... the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts ...", i.e., the whole is other than the sum of the parts.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[John Stuart Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;"The chemical combination of two substances produces, as is well known, a third substance with properties different from those of either of the two substances separately, or of both of them taken together" {{Harv|Mill|1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley: "now and again there is a sudden rapid passage to a totally new and more comprehensive type of order or organization, with quite new emergent properties, and involving quite new methods of further evolution" {{Harv|Huxley|Huxley|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two of many scientists and philosophers who have written on the concept.

The term "emergent" was coined by philosopher [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]], who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same – their difference, when their directions are contrary.  Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are [[homogeneous]] and [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|commensurable]]. It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lewes|1875|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blitz|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist Jeffrey Goldstein provided a current definition of emergence in the journal ''Emergence''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jeffrey|title=Emergence as a Construct: History and Issues|journal=Emergence|date=March 1999|volume=1|issue=1|pages=49–72|doi=10.1207/s15327000em0101_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein initially defined emergence as: "the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of [[self-organization]] in complex systems".

Systems scientist Peter Corning described the qualities of Goldstein's definition in more detail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The common characteristics are: (1) radical novelty (features not previously observed in systems); (2) coherence or correlation (meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time); (3) A global or macro "level" (i.e. there is some property of "wholeness"); (4) it is the product of a dynamical process (it evolves); and (5) it is "ostensive" (it can be perceived).&lt;ref name="Corning"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1002/cplx.10043 | last = Corning | first = Peter A. | authorlink = Peter Corning | title = The Re-Emergence of "Emergence": A Venerable Concept in Search of a Theory | year = 2002 | journal = Complexity | volume = 7 | pages = 18–30 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | issue = 6 | bibcode = 2002Cmplx...7f..18C | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055002/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | archivedate = 2018-02-02 | df =  | citeseerx = 10.1.1.114.1724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Corning suggests a narrower definition, requiring that the components be unlike in kind (following Lewes), and that they involve [[division of labor]] between these components. He also says that living systems (like the game of [[chess]]), while emergent, cannot be reduced to underlying laws of emergence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span id="CorningDefn" class="citation"&gt;Rules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; they do not in fact “generate” anything. They serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates ... why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict “history” – i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game. Why? Because the “system” involves more than the rules of the game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by [[teleonomic]], [[cybernetic]], feedback-driven influences. It is not simply a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, “purposeful” activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name = Corning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Strong and weak emergence===

Usage of the notion "emergence" may generally be subdivided into two perspectives, that of "weak emergence" and "strong emergence".  In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation. This is opposed to the older notion of strong emergence, in which the emergent property cannot be simulated by a computer.

Some common points between the two notions are that emergence concerns new properties produced as the system grows, which is to say ones which are not shared with its components or prior states. Also, it is assumed that the properties are [[supervenient]] rather than metaphysically primitive {{Harv|Bedau|1997}}.

Weak emergence describes new properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level. However, it is stipulated that the properties can be determined only by observing or simulating the system, and not by any process of analysis.

Bedau notes that weak emergence is not a universal metaphysical solvent, as the hypothesis that consciousness is weakly emergent would not resolve the traditional philosophical questions about the physicality of consciousness. However, Bedau concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness, and second, the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

Strong emergence describes the direct causal action of a high-level system upon its components; qualities produced this way are [[irreducible (philosophy)|irreducible]] to the system's constituent parts  {{Harv|Laughlin|2005}}. The whole is other than the sum of its parts. An example from physics of such emergence is water, being seemingly unpredictable even after an exhaustive study of the properties of its constituent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luisi|first=Pier L.|title=The Emergence of Life: From Chemical Origins to Synthetic Biology|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521821177|page=119|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023700/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|archivedate=2015-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then that no simulation of the system can exist, for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

====Rejecting the distinction====

However, "the debate about whether or not the whole can be predicted from the properties of the parts misses the point. Wholes produce unique combined effects, but many of these effects may be co-determined by the context and the interactions between the whole and its environment(s)" {{Harv|Corning|2002}}. In accordance with his Synergism Hypothesis, {{Harv|Corning 1983|2005}} Corning also stated, "It is the [[synergistic]] effects produced by wholes that are the very cause of the evolution of complexity in nature." Novelist Arthur Koestler used the metaphor of [[Janus]] (a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open/shut, peace/war) to illustrate how the two perspectives (strong vs. weak or [[holistic]] vs. [[reductionistic]]) should be treated as non-exclusive, and should work together to address the issues of emergence.{{Harv|Koestler|1969}} Further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts.{{Harv|Anderson|1972}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Viability of strong emergence====

The plausibility of strong emergence is questioned by some as contravening our usual understanding of physics. Mark A. Bedau observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although strong emergence is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic. How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing.&lt;ref name = Bedau&gt;(Bedau 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strong emergence can be criticized for being causally [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]]. The canonical example concerns emergent mental states (M and M∗) that supervene on physical states (P and P∗) respectively. Let M and M∗ be emergent properties. Let M∗ supervene on base property P∗. What happens when M causes M∗? [[Jaegwon Kim]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our schematic example above, we concluded that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face a critical question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M as a cause of any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Jaegwon | year = 2016 | title = Emergence: Core ideas and issues | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 547–59 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-006-9025-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If M is the cause of M∗, then M∗ is overdetermined because M∗ can also be thought of as being determined by P. One escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny [[downward causation]]. However, this would remove the proposed reason that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states, which in turn would call [[physicalism]] into question, and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists.

Meanwhile, others have worked towards developing analytical evidence of strong emergence. In 2009, Gu et al. presented a class of physical systems that exhibits non-computable macroscopic properties.&lt;ref name="morereally"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = Mile | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = More really is different | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278909000852 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 238 | issue = 9| pages = 835–39 | doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.12.016| arxiv = 0809.0151 | bibcode = 2009PhyD..238..835G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="binder"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binder | first1 = P-M | year = 2009 | title = Computation: The edge of reductionism | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245| pages = 332–34 | doi=10.1038/459332a| bibcode = 2009Natur.459..332B}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, if one could compute certain macroscopic properties of these systems from the microscopic description of these systems, then one would be able to solve computational problems known to be undecidable in computer science. They concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although macroscopic concepts are essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics has been devoted to the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.&lt;ref name="morereally" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Emergence and interaction===

Emergent structures are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Meta" /&gt; that emergent structures are other than the sum of their parts on the assumption that the emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those who [[A New Kind of Science#Simple programs|disagree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm|title=A Designer Universe?|author=Steven Weinberg|accessdate=2008-07-14|quote=A version of the original quote from address at the Conference on Cosmic Design, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C. in April 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519145647/http://www.physlink.com/education/essay_weinberg.cfm|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular [[Renormalization group|renormalization]] are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=From bottom-up approaches to levels of organization and extended critical transitions|url=https://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|journal=Fractal Physiology|volume=3|page=232|doi=10.3389/fphys.2012.00232|pmc=3429021|pmid=22934001|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055001/http://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|archivedate=2018-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective or subjective quality===
The properties of complexity and organization of any system are considered by Crutchfield to be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] determined by the observer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.{{Harv|Crutchfield|1994}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, [[Peter Corning]] argues "Must the synergies be perceived/observed in order to qualify as emergent effects, as some theorists claim?  Most emphatically not.  The synergies associated with emergence are real and measurable, even if nobody is there to observe them."{{Harv|Corning|2002}}

==In religion, art and humanities==

In religion, emergence grounds expressions of [[religious naturalism]] and [[syntheism]] in which a sense of the [[sacred]] is perceived in the workings of entirely naturalistic processes by which more [[Complexity|complex]] forms arise or evolve from simpler forms. Examples are detailed in ''The Sacred Emergence of Nature'' by [[Ursula Goodenough]] &amp; [[Terrence Deacon]] and [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kauffman06/kauffman06_index.html ''Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred''] by [[Stuart Kauffman]], both from 2006, and in ''Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age'' by [[Alexander Bard]] &amp; [[Jan Söderqvist]] from 2014. An early argument (1904–05) for the emergence of social formations, in part stemming from religion, can be found in [[Max Weber]]'s most famous work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2010). 'Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism'. Sociological Theory, vol 28, no. 1, pp. 108–26.{{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, emergence is used to explore the origins of novelty, creativity, and authorship. Some art/literary theorists (Wheeler, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Wendy|title=The Whole Creature: Complexity, Biosemiotics and the Evolution of Culture|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London|isbn=1-905007-30-2|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Victoria N.|title=The Biologist's Mistress: Rethinking Self-Organization in Art, Literature, and Nature|year=2011|publisher=Emergent Publications|location=Litchfield Park, AZ|isbn=0-9842165-5-3|url=http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208050459/http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have proposed alternatives to postmodern understandings of "authorship" using the complexity sciences and emergence theory. They contend that artistic selfhood and meaning are emergent, relatively objective phenomena. [[Michael Pearce (artist)|Michael J. Pearce]] has used emergence to describe the experience of works of art in relation to contemporary neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Michael J.|title=Art in the Age of Emergence|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Manchester, England|isbn=1443870579|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021953/http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practicing artist [[Leonel Moura]], in turn, attrbutes to his "artbots" a real, if nonetheless rudimentary, creativity based on emergent principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/3/28|author=Leonel Moura|date=16 July 2018|title=Robot Art: An Interview with Leonel Moura|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7030028|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In international development, concepts of emergence have been used within a theory of social change termed [[SEED-SCALE]] to show how standard principles interact to bring forward socio-economic development fitted to cultural values, community economics, and natural environment (local solutions emerging from the larger socio-econo-biosphere). These principles can be implemented utilizing a sequence of standardized tasks that [[self-assemble]] in individually specific ways utilizing recursive evaluative criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ''Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In postcolonial studies, the term "Emerging Literature" refers to a contemporary body of texts that is gaining momentum in the global literary landscape (v. esp.: J.M. Grassin, ed. ''Emerging Literatures'', Bern, Berlin, etc. : Peter Lang, 1996). By opposition, "emergent literature" is rather a concept used in the theory of literature.

==Emergent properties and processes==
An emergent behavior or emergent property can appear when a number of simple [[entity|entities]] (agents) operate in an environment, forming more complex behaviors as a collective. If emergence happens over disparate size scales, then the reason is usually a causal relation across different scales. In other words, there is often a form of top-down feedback in systems with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Citation | last = Korotayev | first = A. | authorlink1 = Andrey Korotayev | last2 = Malkov | given2 = A. | last3 = Khaltourina | first3 = D. | title = Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth | place = Moscow | publisher = URSS | year = 2006 | isbn = 5-484-00414-4 | url = http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150814105834/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | archivedate = 2015-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes causing emergent properties may occur in either the observed or observing system, and are commonly identifiable by their patterns of accumulating change, generally called 'growth'. Emergent behaviours can occur because of intricate causal relations across different scales and feedback, known as [[interconnectivity]]. The emergent property itself may be either very predictable or unpredictable and unprecedented, and represent a new level of the system's evolution. The complex behaviour or properties are not a property of any single such entity, nor can they easily be predicted or deduced from behaviour in the lower-level entities, and might in fact be irreducible to such behavior.  The shape and behaviour of a flock of birds [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11679-flying-in-vformation-gives-best-view-for-least-effort.html] or school of fish are good examples of emergent properties.

One reason emergent behaviour is hard to predict is that the number of [[interaction]]s between a system components increases exponentially with the number of components, thus allowing for many new and subtle types of behaviour to emerge. Emergence is often a product of particular patterns of interaction. [[Negative feedback]] introduces constraints that serve to fix structures or behaviours. In contrast, [[positive feedback]] promotes change, allowing local variations to grow into global patterns. Another way in which interactions leads to emergent properties is [[dual-phase evolution]]. This occurs where interactions are applied intermittently, leading to two phases: one in which patterns form or grow, the other in which they are refined or removed.

On the other hand, merely having a large number of interactions is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out.  In some cases, a large number of interactions can in fact hinder the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of "noise" to drown out any emerging "signal"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to self-support. Thus it is not just the sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised.  A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from that of the individual humans in that bureaucracy); but emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace.  In some cases, the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.

[[Unintended consequence]]s and side effects are closely related to emergent properties. [[Luc Steels]] writes: "A component has a particular functionality but this is not recognizable as a subfunction of the global functionality. Instead a component implements a behaviour whose side effect contributes to the global functionality [...] Each behaviour has a side effect and the sum of the side effects gives the desired functionality".{{Harv|Steels|1990}} In other words, the global or macroscopic functionality of a system with "emergent functionality" is the sum of all "side effects", of all emergent properties and functionalities.

Systems with emergent properties or emergent structures may appear to defy [[entropy|entropic]] principles and the second law of [[thermodynamics]], because they form and increase order despite the lack of command and central control. This is possible because open systems can extract information and order out of the environment.

Emergence helps to explain why the [[fallacy of division]] is a fallacy.

==Emergent structures in nature==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Ripple patterns in a [[sand dune]] created by wind or water is an example of an emergent structure in nature.]]
[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland is an example of a complex emergent structure.]]

Emergent structures can be found in many natural phenomena, from the physical to the biological domain. For example, the shape of weather phenomena such as [[hurricane]]s are emergent structures.  The development and growth of complex, orderly [[crystal]]s, as driven by the [[random motion]] of water molecules within a conducive natural environment, is another example of an emergent process, where [[randomness]] can give rise to complex and deeply attractive, orderly structures.
[[File:Water Crystals on Mercury 20Feb2010 CU1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Water crystals forming on glass demonstrate an emergent, [[fractal]] process occurring under appropriate conditions of temperature and humidity.]]  However, crystalline structure and hurricanes are said to have a self-organizing phase.

It is useful to distinguish three forms of emergent structures. A ''first-order'' emergent structure occurs as a result of shape interactions (for example, [[hydrogen bond]]s in water molecules lead to [[surface tension]]). A ''second-order'' emergent structure involves shape interactions played out sequentially over time (for example, changing atmospheric conditions as a snowflake falls to the ground build upon and alter its form). Finally, a ''third-order'' emergent structure is a consequence of shape, time, and heritable instructions. For example, an organism's [[genetic code]] affects the form of the organism's systems in space and time.

===Nonliving, physical systems===
In [[physics]], emergence is used to describe a property, law, or phenomenon which occurs at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales, despite the fact that a macroscopic system can be viewed as a very large ensemble of microscopic systems.

An emergent property need not be more complicated than the underlying non-emergent properties which generate it.  For instance, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] are remarkably simple, even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex.  The term emergence in physics is thus used not to signify complexity, but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales, and which ones apply to microscopic scales. 

However, another, perhaps more broadly applicable way to conceive of the emergent divide does involve a dose of complexity insofar as the computational feasibility of going from the microscopic to the macroscopic property tells the 'strength' of the emergence. This is better understood given the following definition of emergence that comes from physics:

"An emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kivelson |first1=Sophia |last2=Kivelson |first2=Steve |title=Defining Emergence in Physics |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/npjquantmats201624 |website=njp: Quantum Materials |publisher=Nature Research |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are no actually infinite systems in the real world, there is no obvious naturally occurring notion of a hard separation between the properties of the constituents of a system and those of the emergent whole. As discussed below, classical mechanics is thought to be emergent from quantum mechanics, though in principal, quantum dynamics fully describes everything happening at a classical level. However, it would take a computer larger then the size of the universe with more computing time then life time of the universe to describe the motion of a falling apple in terms of the locations of its electrons {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}; thus we can take this to be a "strong" emergent divide. 

Some examples include:
* [[Classical mechanics]]:  The laws of classical mechanics can be said to emerge as a limiting case from the rules of [[quantum mechanics]] applied to large enough masses. This is particularly strange since quantum mechanics is generally thought of as ''more'' complicated than classical mechanics.
* [[Friction]]:  Forces between elementary particles are conservative.  However, friction emerges when considering more complex structures of matter, whose surfaces can convert mechanical energy into heat energy when rubbed against each other.  Similar considerations apply to other emergent concepts in [[continuum mechanics]] such as [[viscosity]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[tensile strength]], etc.
* [[Patterned ground]]: the distinct, and often symmetrical geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions.
* [[Statistical mechanics]] was initially derived using the concept of a large enough [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] that fluctuations about the most likely distribution can be all but ignored.  However, small clusters do not exhibit sharp first order [[phase transition]]s such as melting, and at the boundary it is not possible to completely categorize the cluster as a liquid or solid, since these concepts are (without extra definitions) only applicable to macroscopic systems.  Describing a system using statistical mechanics methods is much simpler than using a low-level atomistic approach.
* [[Electrical networks]]: The bulk conductive response of binary (RC) electrical networks with random arrangements, known as the [[Universal dielectric response | Universal Dielectric Response (UDR)]], can be seen as emergent properties of such physical systems. Such arrangements can be used as simple physical prototypes for deriving mathematical formulae for the emergent responses of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437112009363 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2012.10.035 | volume=392 | title=The origin of power-law emergent scaling in large binary networks | year=2013 | journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | pages=1004–1027 | last1 = Almond | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Budd | first2 = C.J. | last3 = Freitag | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Hunt | first4 = G.W. | last5 = McCullen | first5 = N.J. | last6 = Smith | first6 = N.D.| arxiv=1204.5601 | bibcode=2013PhyA..392.1004A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Weather]]

[[Temperature]] is sometimes used as an example of an emergent macroscopic behaviour.  In classical dynamics, a ''snapshot'' of the instantaneous momenta of a large number of particles at equilibrium is sufficient to find the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom which is proportional to the temperature.  For a small number of particles the instantaneous momenta at a given time are not statistically sufficient to determine the temperature of the system.  However, using the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the temperature can still be obtained to arbitrary precision by further averaging the momenta over a long enough time.

[[Convection]] in a liquid or gas is another example of emergent macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature. [[Convection cells]], particularly [[Bénard cells]], are an example of a [[self-organizing]] system (more specifically, a [[dissipative system]]) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of [[symmetry breaking]]).

In some theories of particle physics, even such basic structures as [[mass]], [[space]], and [[time]] are viewed as emergent phenomena, arising from more fundamental concepts such as the [[Higgs boson]] or [[string theory|strings]].  In some interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]], the perception of a [[deterministic]] reality, in which all objects have a definite position, momentum, and so forth, is actually an emergent phenomenon, with the true state of matter being described instead by a [[wavefunction]] which need not have a single position or momentum.
Most of the laws of [[physics]] themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe{{According to whom|date=September 2016}} and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged. [[Chemistry]] can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics. [[Biology]] (including biological [[evolution]]) can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry.  Similarly, [[psychology]] could be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws. Finally, free-market theories understand [[economy]] as an emergent feature of psychology.

According to Laughlin (2005), for many particle systems, nothing can be calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This does not mean that the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply that you do not see them anymore&amp;nbsp;— you only see a renormalized effect of them. Laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist: if you cannot, possibly ever, calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations, then what is the point of talking about reducibility?

===Living, biological systems===

====Emergence and evolution====
{{see also|Abiogenesis}}
[[Life]] is a major source of complexity, and [[evolution]] is the major process behind the varying forms of life. In this view, evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in speaking of the emergence of complex living beings and life-forms, this view refers therefore to processes of sudden changes in evolution.

[[Life]] is thought to have emerged in the early [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]] when [[RNA]] chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = H | last2 = Byerly | first2 = HC | last3 = Hopf | first3 = FA | last4 = Michod | first4 = RA | last5 = Vemulapalli | first5 = GK | year = 1983 | title = The Darwinian Dynamic | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2828805?uid=3739568&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102790068637 | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 185–207 | doi=10.1086/413216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;Michod RE. (2000) Darwinian Dynamics: Evolutionary Transitions in Fitness and Individuality.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0691050112}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;  The three primary adaptive capacities may have been (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type); (2) the capacity to avoid decay; and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources.&lt;ref name=Bernstein /&gt;&lt;ref name =Michod /&gt;  These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators (see “[[Ribozyme]]”) that, in turn, would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences. Competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities.

Regarding [[causality]] in evolution [[Peter Corning]] observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synergistic effects of various kinds have played a major causal role in the evolutionary process generally and in the evolution of cooperation and complexity in particular... Natural selection is often portrayed as a “mechanism”, or is personified as a causal agency... In reality, the differential “selection” of a trait, or an adaptation, is a consequence of the functional effects it produces in relation to the survival and reproductive success of a given organism in a given environment. It is these functional effects that are ultimately responsible for the trans-generational continuities and changes in nature.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Per his [[#CorningDefn|definition of emergence]], Corning also addresses emergence and evolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] evolutionary processes, causation is iterative; effects are also causes. And this is equally true of the synergistic effects produced by emergent systems. In other words, emergence itself... has been the underlying cause of the evolution of emergent phenomena in biological evolution; it is the synergies produced by organized systems that are the key.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Swarming]] is a well-known behaviour in many animal species from [[marching locusts]] to [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling fish]] to [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking birds]]. Emergent structures are a common strategy found in many animal groups: colonies of ants, mounds built by termites, swarms of bees, shoals/schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds/packs of mammals.

An example to consider in detail is an [[ant colony]]. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even demonstrated the ability to solve geometric problems.  For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Johnson. 2001. [[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that environmental factors may play a role in influencing emergence. Research suggests induced emergence of the bee species [[Macrotera portalis]]. In this species, the bees emerge in a pattern consistent with rainfall. Specifically, the pattern of emergence is consistent with southwestern deserts' late summer rains and lack of activity in the spring.&lt;ref name="Danforth2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Bryan|title=Female Foraging and Intranest Behavior of a Communal Bee, Perdita portalis (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|date=1991|volume=84|issue=5|pages=537–48|doi= 10.1093/aesa/84.5.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organization of life====
A broader example of emergent properties in biology is viewed in the [[biological organisation]] of life, ranging from the [[subatomic]] level to the entire [[biosphere]]. For example, individual [[atom]]s can be combined to form [[molecule]]s such as [[polypeptide]] chains, which in turn [[Protein folding|fold]] and refold to form [[protein]]s, which in turn create even more complex structures. These proteins, assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation, interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an [[organism]]. Another example is how cascade [[phenotype]] reactions, as detailed in [[chaos theory]], arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Campbell]], Neil A., and Jane B. Reece. ''Biology''. 6th ed. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level, all the [[biocoenosis|biological communities]] in the world form the biosphere, where its human participants form societies, and the complex interactions of meta-social systems such as the stock market.

====Emergence of mind====
Among the considered phenomena in the evolutionary account of life, as a continuous history, marked by stages at which fundamentally new forms have appeared - the origin of sapiens intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence // Encyclopædia Britannica, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of mind and its evolution is researched and considered as a separate phenomenon in a special system knowledge [[noogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390703_Eryomin_A.L._Noogenesis_and_Theory_of_Intellect._Krasnodar_2005.__356_p.__._.____.___2005.__356_ Eryomin A.L. '''Noogenesis and Theory of Intellect'''. Krasnodar, 2005.  356 pp.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031233209/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390703_Eryomin_A.L._Noogenesis_and_Theory_of_Intellect._Krasnodar_2005.__356_p.__._.____.___2005.__356_ |date=2014-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humanity==

===Spontaneous order===
{{see also|Spontaneous order|Self-organization}}
Groups of human beings, left free to each regulate themselves, tend to produce [[spontaneous order]], rather than the meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]] in ancient China. A classic [[traffic]] [[roundabout]] is a good example, with cars moving in and out with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles [http://www.terrain.org/articles/2/siegman.htm], and getting better results. [[Open-source software]] and [[Wiki]] projects form an even more compelling illustration.

Emergent processes or behaviors can be seen in many other places, such as cities, [[cabal]] and [[market-dominant minority]] phenomena in economics, organizational phenomena in [[computer simulation]]s and [[cellular automata]].  Whenever there is a multitude of individuals interacting, an order emerges from disorder; a pattern, a decision, a structure, or a change in direction occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Peter.  2010.  The Smart Swarm: How understanding flocks, schools, and colonies can make us better at communicating, decision making, and getting things done.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics====
The [[stock market]] (or any market for that matter) is an example of emergence on a grand scale.  As a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world, yet it has no leader; when no [[Economic planning|central planning]] is in place, there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market.  Agents, or investors, have knowledge of only a limited number of companies within their portfolio, and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings.  Trends and patterns emerge which are studied intensively by [[technical analysis|technical analysts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

====World Wide Web and the Internet====
The [[World Wide Web]] is a popular example of a decentralized system exhibiting emergent properties.  There is no central organization rationing the number of links, yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a [[power law]] in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to.  A related property of the network of links in the World Wide Web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links.  Although relatively well known now, this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network.  It is shared with many other types of networks called [[small-world network]]s.{{Harv|Barabasi, Jeong, &amp; Albert|1999|pp=130–31}}

Internet traffic can also exhibit some seemingly emergent properties. In the congestion control mechanism, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] flows can become globally synchronized at bottlenecks, simultaneously increasing and then decreasing throughput in coordination. Congestion, widely regarded as a nuisance, is possibly an emergent property of the spreading of bottlenecks across a network in high traffic flows which can be considered as a phase transition [see review of related research in {{Harv|Smith|2008|pp=1–31}}].

Another important example of emergence in web-based systems is [[social bookmarking]] (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, even in the absence of a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Architecture and cities====
[[File:Bangkok skytrain sunset.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Traffic patterns in cities can be seen as an example of [[spontaneous order]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}]]
Emergent structures appear at many different [[integrative level|levels of organization]] or as [[spontaneous order]]. Emergent [[self-organization]] appears frequently in [[city|cities]] where no planning or zoning entity predetermines the layout of the city.{{Harv|Krugman|1996|pp=9–29}} The interdisciplinary study of emergent behaviors is not generally considered a [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] field, but divided across its application or problem [[function domain|domains]].

Architects may not design all the pathways of a complex of buildings. Instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn, such as a [[desire path]].

The on-course action and vehicle progression of the [[DARPA Grand Challenge#2007 Urban Challenge|2007 Urban Challenge]] could possibly be regarded as an example of [[cybernetic]] emergence. Patterns of road use, indeterministic obstacle clearance times, etc. will work together to form a complex emergent pattern that can not be deterministically planned in advance.

The architectural school of [[Christopher Alexander]] takes a deeper approach to emergence, attempting to rewrite the process of urban growth itself in order to affect form, establishing a new methodology of planning and design tied to traditional practices, an [http://emergenturbanism.com/2009/03/23/the-journey-to-emergence/ Emergent Urbanism]. Urban emergence has also been linked to theories of urban complexity {{Harv|Batty|2005}} and urban evolution.{{Harv|Marshall|2009}}

Building ecology is a conceptual framework for understanding architecture and the built environment as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment. Rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects, building ecologist Hal Levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non-living systems.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203182235/http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microbial ecology of the indoor environment is strongly dependent on the building materials, occupants, contents, environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate.  The strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors. The chemicals may be nutrients, neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms. The microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being. Humans manipulate the ventilation, temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbe.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210118/http://www.microbe.net/ |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://buildingecology.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808024931/http://www.buildingecology.com/ |date=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Bonabeau's attempt to define emergent phenomena is through traffic: "traffic jams are actually very complicated and mysterious. On an individual level, each driver is trying to get somewhere and is following (or breaking) certain rules, some legal (the speed limit) and others societal or personal (slow down to let another driver change into your lane). But a traffic jam is a separate and distinct entity that emerges from those individual behaviors. [[Gridlock]] on a highway, for example, can travel backward for no apparent reason, even as the cars are moving forward." He has also likened emergent phenomena to the analysis of market trends and employee behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bonabeau E. Predicting the Unpredictable. Harvard Business Review [serial online]. March 2002. 80(3):109–16. Available from: Business Source Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational emergent phenomena have also been utilized in architectural design processes, for example for formal explorations and experiments in digital materiality.&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav and Gwyllim Jahn (2012). 'Emergent Materiality though an Embedded Multi-Agent System', in 15th Generative Art Conference, ed. by Celestino Soddu (Lucca, Italy: Domus Argenia), pp. 348–63

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer AI===
Some artificially intelligent (AI) computer applications utilize emergent behavior for animation. One example is [[Boids]], which mimics the [[swarming behavior]] of birds.

=== Language ===
It has been argued that the structure and regularity of [[language]] [[grammar]], or at least [[language change]], is an emergent phenomenon {{Harv|Hopper|1998}}. While each speaker merely tries to reach his or her own communicative goals, he or she uses language in a particular way. If enough speakers behave in that way, language is changed {{Harv|Keller|1994}}. In a wider sense, the norms of a language, i.e. the linguistic conventions of its speech society, can be seen as a system emerging from long-time participation in communicative problem-solving in various social circumstances {{Harv|Määttä|2000}}.

===Emergent change processes===
Within the field of group facilitation and organization development, there have been a number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and self-organization, by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions. Examples of these processes include [[SEED-SCALE]], [[Appreciative Inquiry]], Future Search, the World Cafe or [[Knowledge Cafe]], [[Open Space Technology]], and others (Holman, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Peggy|date=December 2010 – January 2011|title=Engaging Emergence: Turning Upheaval into Opportunity|url=http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|journal=Pegasus Communication: The Systems Thinker|volume=21|pages=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418075443/http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[category theory]], an '''essential monomorphism''' is a [[monomorphism]] ''f'' in a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' such that for a morphism ''g'' in ''C'', &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism only when ''g'' is a monomorphism. Essential monomorphisms in a [[category of modules]] are those whose image is an [[essential submodule]] of the [[codomain]]. An injective hull of an object ''X'' is an essential monomorphism from ''X'' to an [[injective object]].

In the fields of [[dynamical system]]s and [[control theory]], a '''fractional-order system''' is a dynamical system that can be modeled by a [[fractional differential equation]] containing [[fractional derivative|derivatives of non-integer order]].&lt;ref name=Monje2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Monje|first=Concepción A.|title=Fractional-Order Systems and Controls: Fundamentals and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781849963350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are said to have ''fractional dynamics''. [[Differintegral|Derivatives and integrals of fractional orders]] are used to describe objects that can be characterized by [[Power law|power-law]] nonlocality&lt;ref name="Cattani2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cattani|first1=Carlo|last2=Srivastava|first2=Hari M.|last3=Yang|first3=Xiao-Jun|title=Fractional Dynamics|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110472097|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iNhaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=power+law+nonlocality#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20law%20nonlocality&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Power law|power-law]] [[long-range dependence]] or [[fractal]] properties. Fractional-order systems are useful in studying the anomalous behavior of dynamical systems in physics, [[electrochemistry]], biology, [[viscoelasticity]] and [[chaotic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Monje2010 /&gt;

== Definition ==

A general dynamical system of fractional order can be written in the form&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002&gt;{{cite web|author1=Blas M. Vinagre |author2=C. A. Monje |author3=Antonio J. Calderon |title=Fractional Order Systems and Fractional Order Control Actions|url=http://mechatronics.ece.usu.edu/foc/cdc02tw/cdrom/Lectures/Lecture3/l3.pdf|publisher=41st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H(D^{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m})(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_l) = G(D^{\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n})(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the [[fractional derivative]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time. A common special case of this is the [[linear time-invariant]] (LTI) system in one variable:

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\sum_{k=0}^m a_k D^{\alpha_k}\right) y(t) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^n b_k D^{\beta_k}\right) u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; are in general complex quantities, but two interesting cases are when the orders are ''commensurate''

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta \in R^+&lt;/math&gt;

and when they are also ''rational'':

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta = \frac{1}{q}, q \in Z^+&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;, the derivatives are of integer order and the system becomes an [[ordinary differential equation]]. Thus by increasing specialization, LTI systems can be of general order, commensurate order, rational order or integer order.

=== Transfer function ===

By applying a [[Laplace transform]] to the LTI system above, the [[transfer function]] becomes

: &lt;math&gt; G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^n b_k s^{\beta_k}}{\sum_{k=0}^m a_k s^{\alpha_k}}&lt;/math&gt;

For general orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; this is a non-rational transfer function. Non-rational transfer functions cannot be written as an expansion in a finite number of terms (e.g., a [[binomial expansion]] would have an infinite number of terms) and in this sense fractional orders systems can be said to have the potential for unlimited memory.&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002 /&gt;

==Motivation to study fractional-order systems==

Exponential laws are classical approach to study dynamics of population densities, but there are many systems where dynamics undergo faster or slower-than-exponential laws. In such case the anomalous changes in dynamics may be best described by [[Mittag-Leffler function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Anomalous diffusion]] is one more dynamic system where fractional-order systems play significant role to describe the anomalous flow in the diffusion process.

[[Viscoelasticity]]  is the property of material in which the material exhibits its nature between purely elastic and pure fluid. In case of real materials the relationship between stress and strain given by [[Hooke's law]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]] both have obvious disadvances. So [[G. W. Scott Blair]] introduced a new relationship between stress and strain given by

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma (t)=E{D_t^\alpha} \varepsilon(t), \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In [[chaos theory]], it has been observed that chaos occurs in [[dynamical system]]s of order 3 or more. With the introduction of fractional-order systems, some researchers study chaos in the system of total order less than 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347112|chapter = Fractional - order chaotic systems|title = 2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies &amp; Factory Automation|pages = 1–8|year = 2009|last1 = Petras|first1 = Ivo|last2 = Bednarova|first2 = Dagmar|isbn = 978-1-4244-2727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of fractional differential equations==
Consider a fractional-order [[initial value problem]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {_0^C D_t^\alpha} x(t)=f(t,x(t)) , \quad t\in [0,T], \quad  x(0)=x_0, \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;

===Existence and uniqueness===
Here, under the continuity condition on function f, one can convert the above equation into corresponding integral equation.

:&lt;math&gt; x(t)=x_0 + {_0^C D_t^{-\alpha}}f(t,x(t)) = x_0 + \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{f(s,x(s))\,ds}{(t-s)^{1-\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

One can construct a solution space and define, by that equation, a continuous self-map on the solution space, then apply a [[fixed-point theorem]], to get a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]], which is the solution of above equation.

===Numerical simulation===
For numerical simulation of solution of the above equations, Kai Diethelm has suggested fractional linear multistep [[Linear_multistep_method#Families_of_multistep_methods|Adams–Bashforth method]] or [[Numerical integration#Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions|quadrature methods]].&lt;ref name="Diethelm2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diethelm|first1=Kai|title=A Survey of Numerical Methods in Fractional Calculus|url=http://www.lmssc.cnam.fr/sites/default/files/pdf/Colloque_Derivation_Fractionnaire_Cnam_2006_Diethelm.pdf|publisher=CNAM|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political philosophy]], the '''general will''' ({{lang-fr|volonté générale}}) is the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of the people as a whole. The term was made famous by 18th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

==Basic ideas==

The phrase "general will," as Rousseau used it, occurs in Article Six of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (French: ''Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen''), composed in 1789 during the [[French Revolution]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to contribute personally, or through their representatives, to its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, positions, and employments, according to their capacities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James Swenson, ''On Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Stanford University Press 2001), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Swenson writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;To my knowledge, the only time Rousseau actually uses the formulation "expression of the general will" is in a passage of the ''Discours sur l'économie politique'', whose content renders it little susceptible of celebrity. [...] But it is indeed a faithful summary of his doctrine, faithful enough that commentators frequently adopt it without any hesitation. Among Rousseau's definitions of law, the textually closest variant can be found in a passage of the ''Lettres écrites de la montagne'' summarizing the argument of ''Du contrat social'', in which law is defined as "a public and solemn declaration of the general will on an object of common interest."&lt;ref&gt;''Lettres de la montagne'', quoted in Swenson (2000), p. 164. See also: Patrick Riley, ''The General Will before Rousseau'' (Princeton University Press, 1988) and Mark Hulliung "Rousseau, Voltaire and the Revenge of Pascal" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Rousseau'', edited by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press: 2000), pp. 57-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As used by Rousseau, the "general will" is considered by some identical to the [[rule of law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Maurice Cranston's introduction to the ''Social Contract'', Penguin Classics, 1968, pp. 9-42.&lt;/ref&gt; and to Spinoza's ''mens una''.&lt;ref&gt;for Spinoza's ''mens una'', see Jonathan Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of [[political legitimacy]]. [...] It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau's meaning. This is clear from the ''Discourse on Political Economy'', where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;Entry, "Rousseau" in the ''Routelege Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward Craig, editor, Volume Eight, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
Early critics of Rousseau included [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  Hegel argued that, because it lacked any grounding in an objective ideal of reason, Rousseau's account of the general will ineluctably lead to the [[Reign of Terror]].  Constant also blamed Rousseau for the excesses of the French Revolution, and he rejected the total subordination of the citizen-subjects to the determinations of the general will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Theory |contribution=General Will |author=Joseph Reisert |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Bevir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gryvMfjg-zEC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=551–553 |year=2010 |isbn=1412958652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 [[Jacob Talmon]] characterized Rousseau's "general will" as leading to a [[totalitarian democracy]] because, Talmon argued, the state subjected its citizens to the supposedly infallible will of the [[tyranny of the majority|majority]]. Another writer of the period, liberal theorist [[Karl Popper]], also interpreted Rousseau in this way, while [[Bertrand Russell]] warned that "the doctrine of general will ... made possible the mystic identification of a leader with its people, which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballot box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_tGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rousseau's Social Contract: An Introduction |author= David Lay Williams |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0521124447 |pages=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent critics include [[Isaiah Berlin]] who argued that Rousseau's association of freedom with obedience to the General Will allowed totalitarian leaders to defend oppression in the name of freedom, and made Rousseau "one of the most sinister and formidable enemies of liberty in the whole history of human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dj-bMlq0V5QC&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Isaiah Berlin: Liberty, Pluralism and Liberalism |author= George Crowder |page=61 |publisher=Polity |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0745624778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense of Rousseau==
Some Rousseau scholars, however, such as his biographer and editor Maurice Cranston, and Ralph Leigh, editor of Rousseau's correspondence, do not consider Talmon's 1950s "totalitarian thesis" as sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;For a rejoinder to Talmon see R. A. Leigh, "Liberté et autorité dans le Contrat Social" in ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et son oeuvre'', (Paris, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Rousseau argued that Rousseau was not alone among republican political theorists in thinking that small, homogeneous states were best suited to maintaining the freedom of their citizens. [[Montesquieu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] were also of this opinion. Furthermore, Rousseau envisioned his ''[[Social Contract]]'' as part of a projected larger work on political philosophy, which would have dealt with issues in larger states. Some of his later writings, such as his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', his proposals for a Constitution of Poland, and his essay on maintaining perpetual peace, in which he recommends a federated [[European Union]], gave an idea of the future direction of his thought.

His defenders also argued Rousseau is one of the great prose stylists and because of his penchant for the paradoxical effect obtained by stating something strongly and then going on to qualify or negate it, it is easy to misrepresent his ideas by taking them out of context.

Rousseau was also a great synthesizer who was deeply engaged in a dialog with his contemporaries and with the writers of the past, such as the theorists of [[Natural Law]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]]. Like "the body politic", "the general will" was a term of art and was not invented by Rousseau, though admittedly Rousseau did not always go out of his way to explicitly  acknowledge his debt to the jurists and theologians who influenced him. Prior to Rousseau, the phrase "general will" referred explicitly to the general (as opposed to the particular) will or ''volition'' (as it is sometimes translated) of the Deity. It occurs in the theological writings of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche/ See the "Nicolas Malebranche" entry in the ''Stanford History of Philosophy'' (revised 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt; who had picked it up from [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and in the writings of Malebranche's pupil, [[Montesquieu]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riley, "The General Will Before Rousseau", ''Political Theory'' 6: 4: Special Issue: ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Nov., 1978): 485-516&lt;/ref&gt; who contrasted ''volonté particulière'' and ''volonté générale'' in a secular sense in his most celebrated chapter (Chapter XI) of [[The Spirit of the Laws|''De L'Esprit des Lois'']] (1748).&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau at one point, states that the most profound metaphysics are to be found in "Plato, Locke, or Malebranche" P [IV: III], quoted in Charles William Hendel, ''Rousseau Moralist'' [Oxford University Press, 1934], p. 169. See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybYLfAw_084C&amp;pg=PA742&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;dq=malebranche+general+volition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lsDW9D1Ynv&amp;sig=vLTOvg4jdzzpmeer3w1OXV4RIio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yAOTT97eI5OM6QGM2p2pBA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=general%20volition&amp;f=false  Nicolas Malebranche,  ''Malebranche: The Search After Truth: With Elucidations of The Search After Truth'', Thomas M. Lennon and Paul J. Olscamp, editors (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 742.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', Rousseau explicitly credits [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' article "''Droit Naturel''" as the source of "the luminous concept" of the general will, of which he maintains his own thoughts are simply a development. Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau's innovation was to use the term in a secular rather than theological sense.

==Quotations==
'''Diderot on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
EVERYTHING you conceive, everything you contemplate, will be good, great, elevated, sublime, if it accords with ''the general and common interest''. There is no quality essential to your species apart from that which you demand from all your fellow men to ensure your happiness and theirs . . . . [D]o not ever lose sight of it, or else you will find that your comprehension of the notions of goodness, justice, humanity and virtue grow dim. Say to yourself often, “I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable natural rights except those of humanity.”  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, you will ask, in what does this '''general will''' reside? Where can I consult it? [...] [The answer is:] In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations, in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions — indignation and resentment — which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retributions. --Denis Diderot, “''Droit Naturel''” article in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diderot: Political writings: Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought,'' edited by John Hope Mason and Robert Walker (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 20. Compare Rousseau: “Cast your eyes on all the nations of the world, go through all the histories. Among so many inhuman and bizarre cults, among this prodigious diversity of morals and character, you will find everywhere the same ideas of justice and decency, everywhere the same notions of good and bad” (''Emile'', 288, [IV 597-98]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Rousseau on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;AS long as several men assembled together consider themselves as a single body, they have only ''one will'' which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being. Then, all the animating forces of the state are vigorous and simple, and its principles are clear and luminous; it has no incompatible or conflicting interests; the ''common good'' makes itself so manifestly evident that only common sense is needed to discern it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political sophistication. Upright and simple men are difficult to deceive precisely because of their simplicity; stratagems and clever arguments do not prevail upon them, they are not indeed subtle enough to be dupes. When we see among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulating the affairs of state under an oak tree, and always acting wisely, can we help feeling a certain contempt for the refinements of other nations, which employ so much skill and effort to make themselves at once illustrious and wretched?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A state thus governed needs very few laws [...]&lt;ref&gt;''Of the Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraphs 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;However, when the social tie begins to slacken and the state to weaken, when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and sectional societies begin to exert an influence over the greater society, the ''common interest'' then becomes corrupted and meets opposition, voting is no longer unanimous; the '''general will''' is no longer the will of all; contradictions and disputes arise, and even the best opinion is not allowed to prevail unchallenged."&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For this reason the sensible rule for regulating public assemblies is one intended not so much to uphold the '''general will''' there, as to ensure that it is always questioned and always responds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''grammatical mood''' (also '''mode''') is a [[Grammar|grammatical]] feature of [[verb]]s, used for signaling [[Linguistic modality|modality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank R. Palmer|Palmer, F. R.]], ''Mood and Modality'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986 (second edition 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan; Perkins, Revere; and Pagliuca, William.

That is, it is the use of verbal [[inflection]]s that allow speakers to express their attitude toward what they are saying (e.g. a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). The term is also used more broadly to describe the [[Syntax|syntactic]] expression of modality; that is, the use of verb phrases that do not involve inflexion of the verb itself.

Mood is distinct from [[grammatical tense]] or [[grammatical aspect]], although the same word patterns are used for expressing more than one of these meanings at the same time in many languages, including English and most other modern [[Indo-European language]]s. (See [[tense–aspect–mood]] for a discussion of this.)

Some examples of moods are [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]], [[Optative mood|optative]], and [[Potential mood|potential]]. These are all [[Finite verb|finite]] forms of the verb. [[Infinitive]]s, [[gerund]]s, and [[participle]]s, which are non-finite forms of the verb, are not considered to be examples of moods.

Some [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] languages have more than ten moods; [[Nenets languages|Nenets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/sketch.html|title=Tundra Nenets grammatical sketch|author=|date=|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; has as many as sixteen. The original [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] inventory of moods consisted of indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative. Not every Indo-European language has all of these moods, but the most conservative ones such as [[Avestan]], [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]] have them all. English has indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; other moods, such as the conditional, do not appear as morphologically distinct forms.

Not all of the moods listed below are clearly conceptually distinct.  Individual terminology varies from language to language, and the coverage of (e.g.) the "conditional" mood in one language may largely overlap with that of the "hypothetical" or "potential" mood in another. Even when two different moods exist in the same language, their respective usages may blur, or may be defined by syntactic rather than semantic criteria. For example, the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[optative mood|optative]] moods in [[Ancient Greek]] alternate syntactically in many subordinate clauses, depending on the tense of the main verb. The usage of the [[indicative]], subjunctive, and [[jussive mood]]s in [[Classical Arabic]] is almost completely controlled by syntactic context. The only possible alternation in the same context is between indicative and jussive following the negative particle ''lā''.

==Realis moods==
{{main article|Realis mood}}
Realis moods are a category of grammatical moods that indicate that something is actually the case or actually not the case. The most common realis mood is the indicative mood. Some languages have a distinct generic mood for expressing general truths. For other realis moods, see the main [[Realis mood]] article.

=== Indicative ===
The indicative mood, or evidential mood, is used for factual statements and positive beliefs. It is the mood of reality. The indicative mood is the most commonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: "Paul is eating an apple" or "John eats apples". All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative.

==Irrealis moods==
{{main article|Irrealis mood}}

Irrealis moods are the set of grammatical moods that indicate that something is not actually the case or a certain situation or action is not known to have happened. They are any verb or sentence mood that are not ''realis'' moods. They may be part of expressions of necessity, possibility, requirement, wish or desire, fear, or as part of counterfactual reasonings, etc.

''Irrealis'' [[verb]] forms are used when speaking of an event which has not happened, is not likely to happen, or is otherwise far removed from the real course of events. For example, in the sentence "If you had done your homework, you wouldn't have failed the class", ''had done'' is an ''irrealis'' verb form. &lt;!--What if the speaker is not sure whether the statement is fact? I.e. "If he did his part, we should be seeing the results by now."--&gt;

Some languages have distinct grammatical forms that indicate that the event described by a specific verb is an ''irrealis verb''. Many of the [[Indo-European languages]] preserve a [[subjunctive mood]] that functions as an ''irrealis''. Some also preserve an [[optative mood]] that describes events that are wished for or hoped for but not factual.

Common ''irrealis'' moods are the imperative, the conditional, the subjunctive, the optative, the jussive, and the potential. For other examples, see the main article for each respective mood.

=== Subjunctive ===
{{main article|Subjunctive mood}}

The subjunctive mood, sometimes called conjunctive mood, has several uses in [[dependent clause]]s. Examples include discussing imaginary or hypothetical events and situations, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, though it is used in English much less than in many other Indo-European languages. In English, this mood has, for some uses, become something of a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|linguistic fossil]]. An example of the subjunctive mood is "I suggest that Paul ''eat'' an apple". The sentence refers to an event which may or may not take place. Contrast this with the indicative verb of the sentence "Paul will eat an apple", in which the verb "will eat" states an unambiguous fact. Another way of expressing the suggestion is "I suggest that Paul should eat an apple".

Other uses of the subjunctive in English are [[archaism]]s, as in "And '''if he be''' not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass..." ([[King James Version|KJV]] [[Leviticus]] 5:7). Statements such as "I will ensure that he leave immediately" often sound archaic or overly formal, and have been almost completely supplanted by constructions with the indicative, like "I will ensure that he leave'''s''' immediately".

Some Germanic languages distinguish between two types of subjunctive moods, for example, the ''Konjunktiv I'' and ''II'' in German or the ''present'' and ''past subjunctive'' in English. Note that the latter distinction is not about the actual time at which something happens (or does not happen).

The conditional version of “John eats if he is hungry” is (subjunctive part boldfaced):

: English: ''John would eat if he '''were''' hungry.'' 
: French:  ''Jean mangerait s’il '''eût''' faim.'' (note: in modern usage, the imperfect indicative usually replaces the imperfect subjunctive in this type of sentence.)
: German:  ''Johannes äße, wenn er hungrig '''wäre'''.''
: Italian: ''Giovanni mangerebbe se '''avesse''' fame.''
: Polish:  ''Jan jadłby, gdyby '''zgłodniał'''.''
: Portuguese: ''João comeria se '''tivesse''' fome.''
: Russian:    ''Иван поел бы, если бы '''был''' голоден.''
: Spanish: ''Juan comería si '''tuviera''' hambre.''
: Swedish: ''Johan skulle äta, om han '''vore''' hungrig''.

The subjunctive mood figures prominently in the [[grammar]] of the [[Romance languages]], which require this mood for certain types of dependent clauses. This point commonly causes difficulty for English speakers learning these languages.

In certain other languages, the dubitative or the conditional moods may be employed instead of the subjunctive in referring to doubtful or unlikely events (see the main article).

=== Conditional ===
{{main article|Conditional mood}}

The conditional mood is used for speaking of an event whose realization is dependent upon another condition, particularly, but not exclusively, in [[conditional sentence]]s. In Modern English, this type of modality is expressed via a [[compound verb|periphrastic construction]], with the form ''would'' + infinitive, (e.g. ''I would buy''), and thus is a mood only in the broad sense and not in the more common narrow sense of the term "mood".{{clarify|date=November 2015}} In other languages, verbs have a specific conditional [[inflection]]. In German, the conditional mood is identical to one of the two subjunctive moods ''(Konjunktiv II,'' see above).

The conditional version of "John eats if he is hungry" is (conditional part boldfaced):

: English:    ''John '''would eat''' if he were hungry.''
: Finnish:    ''Juha '''söisi''', jos hänellä olisi nälkä.''
: Estonian:  ''Juhan '''sööks''', kui tal oleks nälg.''
: Basque:  ''Jonek '''jango luke''', goserik balu.''
: French:     ''Jean '''mangerait''' s'il avait faim.''
: German:     ''Johannes '''äße''', wenn er hungrig wäre.'' (Also: ''Johannes '''würde essen''', wenn er hungrig wäre.'')
: Italian:    ''Giovanni '''mangerebbe''' se avesse fame.''
: Polish:     ''Jan '''jadłby''', gdyby zgłodniał.''
: Portuguese: '' João '''comeria''' se estivesse com fome.''
: Russian:    ''Иван '''поел бы''', если бы был голоден.''
: Spanish:    ''Juan '''comería''' si tuviera hambre.''
: Swedish:   ''Johan '''skulle äta''', om han vore hungrig.''

In the [[Romance languages]], the conditional form is used primarily in the [[Conditional sentence|apodosis]] (main clause) of conditional clauses, and in a few [[set phrase]]s where it expresses courtesy or doubt. The main verb in the [[protasis]] (dependent clause) is usually in the subjunctive or in the indicative mood. However, this is not a universal trait: among others in German (as above), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (even though the last is a Romance language), the conditional mood is used in both the apodosis and the protasis. A further example is the sentence "I would buy a house if I earned a lot of money", where in Finnish both clauses have the conditional marker ''-isi-'': ''Osta'''isi'''n talon, jos ansaits'''isi'''n paljon rahaa''. In Polish (as well as in eastern Slavic languages) the conditional marker ''-by'' also appears twice: ''Kupił'''by'''m dom, gdy'''by'''m zarabiał dużo pieniędzy''.

Because English is used as a lingua franca, a common error among second-language speakers is to use "would" in both clauses, e.g. *"I would buy if I would earn...". "Would" can, however, correctly be used after "if" in sentences such as "If you '''would''' only '''tell me''' what is troubling you, I might be able to help" (i.e. "if you were willing to tell me...").

=== Optative ===
{{main article|Optative mood}}
The optative mood expresses hopes, wishes or commands and has other uses that may overlap with the subjunctive mood. Few languages have an optative as a distinct mood; some that do are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and [[Sanskrit]].

=== Imperative===
{{main article|Imperative mood}}
The imperative mood expresses direct commands, prohibitions, and requests. In many circumstances, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, do your homework now".  An imperative is used for telling someone to do something without argument.  Many languages, including English, use the bare verb stem to form the imperative (such as "go", "run", "do"). Other languages, such as [[Seri language|Seri]] and [[Latin]], however, use special imperative forms.  In English, the second person is implied by the imperative except when first-person plural is specified, as in "Let's go" ("Let us go").  In Romance languages a first person plural exists in the imperative mood: Spanish: ''Vayamos a la playa''; French: ''Allons à la plage'' (both meaning: Let us go to the beach).  The prohibitive mood, the negative imperative may be grammatically or morphologically different from the imperative mood in some languages. It indicates that the action of the verb is not permitted, e.g. "Don't you go!"  In English, the imperative is sometimes used for forming a [[conditional sentence]]: e.g. "go eastwards a mile, and you'll see it" means "if you go eastwards a mile, you will see it".

===Jussive===
{{main article|Jussive mood}}
The jussive, similarly to the imperative, expresses orders, commands, exhortations, but particularly to a third person not present. An imperative, in contrast, generally applies to the listener. When a language is said to have a jussive, the jussive forms are different from the imperative ones, but may be the same as the forms called "subjunctive" in that language. Latin is an example where the jussive is simply about certain specific uses of the subjunctive. Arabic, however, is an example of a language with distinct subjunctive, imperative and jussive conjugations.

===Potential===

The potential mood is a mood of probability indicating that, in the opinion of the speaker, the action or occurrence is considered likely. It is used in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], in [[Sanskrit]], and in the [[Sami languages]]. (In Japanese it is often called something like '''tentative,''' since '''potential''' is used for referring to a [[grammatical voice|voice]] indicating capability to perform the action.)

In Finnish, it is mostly a literary device, as it has virtually disappeared from daily spoken language in most dialects. Its affix is ''-ne-'', as in *''men'' + ''ne'' + ''e'' → ''mennee''  "(she/he/it) will probably go". 
In English, it is formed by means of the auxiliaries ''may'', ''can'', ''ought'', and ''must'': ''"She may go.''".

===Hypothetical===
A few languages use a [[hypothetical mood]], which is used in sentences such as "you could have cut yourself", representing something that might have happened but did not.

=== Inferential ===
{{main article|Inferential mood}}The inferential mood is used to report unwitnessed events without confirming them. Often, there is no doubt as to the veracity of the statement (for example, if it were on the news), but simply the fact that the speaker was not personally present at the event forces them to use this mood.

In the [[Balkan languages]], the same forms used for the inferential mood also function as [[admirative]]s. When referring to Balkan languages, it is of&lt;dfn&gt;ten called&lt;/dfn&gt; '''renarrative mood'''; when referring to [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called '''oblique mood'''.

The inferential is usually impossible to be distinguishably translated into English. For instance, indicative Bulgarian ''той отиде (toy otide)'' and Turkish ''o gitti'' will be translated the same as inferential ''той отишъл (toy otishal)'' and ''o gitmiş'' — with the English indicative ''he went''.'''&lt;sup&gt;[[Inferential mood#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;''' Using the first pair, however, implies very strongly that the speaker either witnessed the event or is very sure that it took place. The second pair implies either that the speaker did not in fact witness it take place, that it occurred in the remote past or that there is considerable doubt as to whether it actually happened. If it were necessary to make the distinction, then the English constructions "he must have gone" or "he is said to have gone" would partly translate the inferential.

==Other moods==

=== Interrogative ===
{{main article|Interrogative mood}}
The interrogative (or interrogatory) mood is used for asking questions. In English, questions are considered interrogative. Most other languages do not have a special mood for asking questions, but exceptions include [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] and [[Eskimo languages]] such as [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]].

=== Deontic Mood vs. Epistemic Mood ===
Linguistics also differentiate moods into two parental categories that include deontic mood and epistemic mood. Deontic mood describes whether one could or should be able to do something. An example of deontic mood is: She should/may start. On the other hand, epistemic mood describes the chance or possibility of something happening. This would then change our example to: She may have started. To further explain modality, linguists introduce weak mood. A weak deontic mood describes how a course of action is not recommended or is frowned upon. A weak epistemic mood includes the terms perhaps and possibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Tokelauan syntax|last=Hooper|first=Robin|publisher=University Microfilms International|year=1994|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=283–284|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. ''e'' and ''ae'' are auxiliary verbs found in Pingelapese. Though seemingly interchangeable, e and ''ae'' are separate phonemes and have different uses. A Pingelapese speaker would choose to use ''e'' when they have a high degree of certainty in what they are saying and ''ae'' when they are less certain. This therefore illustrates that ''e'' and ''ae'' are mood indicators. They have no effect on the direct translation of a sentence, but they are used to alter the mood of the sentence spoken. The following example shows the difference between ''e'' and ''ae'' when applied in the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ngaei rong pwa Soahn e laid.''

‘I heard that John was fishing (I am certain about it).’

'' Ngaei rong pwa Soahn ae laid.''

‘I heard that John was fishing (but I am not certain about it).’

The use of ''ae'' instead of ''e'' can also indicate an interrogative sentence. This is a form of non-declarative speech that demonstrates the speaker has no commitment to the statement they are saying. The following sentence is an example.

Soahn ae laid?

‘Does John fish?’

=== Reo Rapa ===
The language we know as [[Rapa language|Reo Rapa]] was not created by the combination of 2 languages, but through the introduction of [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] to the Rapa monolingual community. Old Rapa words are still used for the grammar and structure of the sentence of phrase but most common context words were replaced with [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Landon|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reo Rapa language uses TAM (Tense - Aspect - Mood) in their sentence structure such as the Impertective TAM marker ''/e/'' and the Imperative TAM marker ''/a/''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Mary|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt; hina’aro &lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt; vau tō mei’a &lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;''
** ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'' (Imperfective TAM marker) + ''hina’aro'' (Like) + ''&lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt;'' ([[Deixis]]) + ''vau'' (Singular) + ''tō'' ([[Definiteness|Definite]]) + ''mei’a'' (Banana) ''&lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;'' (Deixis)
*** 'I would like those bananas (you mentioned).'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Mary|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortlockese ===
[[Mortlockese]] is an Austronesian language made up of eleven dialects over the eleven atolls that make up the [[Mortlock Islands (disambiguation)|Mortlock Islands]] in Micronesia. Various TAM markers are used in the language. Mood markers include the past tense [[hortative]] (marking encouragement or to urge) ''aa'', the hortative ''kɞ'' which denotes a polite tone, ''min'' or ''tin'' to stress the importance of something, and the word ''tɞ'' to denote warning or caution. Each of these markers is used in conjunction with the subject proclitics except for the ''aa'' marker. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odango|first1=Emerson Lopez|title=Afféú Fangani ‘Join Together’: A Morphophonemic Analysis of Possessive Suffix Paradigms and A Discourse-Based Ethnography of the Elicitation Session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|date=May 2015|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa Dissertation|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4130">'''Grasscycling''' refers to an aerobic (requires air) method &lt;ref name="O2 No O2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scoville|first1=Heather|title=Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Processes|url=http://evolution.about.com/od/Microevolution/a/Aerobic-Vs-Anaerobic-Respiration.htm|website=About Education|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=April 17, 2015|ref=O2NoO2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of handling [[grass]] clippings by leaving them on the [[lawn]] when [[mowing]].

[[File:CC500BAT.png|thumb|Electric lawn mower in grass-cycling mode]]

The term is a [[portmanteau]] combining "grass" and "recycling", and had come into use by at least 1990&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/grasscycling.asp|title=Grasscycling definition/etymology|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the push to reduce the huge quantities of clippings going into [[landfill]]s, up to half of some cities' summertime waste flow,&lt;ref name="denver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/recoth/GrassCycle/tabid/425972/Default.aspx|title=Denver Recycle Grasscycle|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 1,000 square feet (93 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of lawn can produce 200 to 500 pounds (90 to 225&amp;nbsp;kg) of clippings a year.&lt;ref name="rivanna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avenue.org/rswa/grasscycle.htm |title=Rivanna Solid Waste Authority Grasscycling Info |accessdate=2007-05-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930161007/http://avenue.org/rswa/grasscycle.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because grass consists largely of water (80% or more&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/GrassCycling/FAQ.htm|title=Grasscycling FAQ|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;), contains little [[lignin]],&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; and has high [[nitrogen]] content, grass clippings easily break down during an aerobic process &lt;ref name="O2 No O2"/&gt; (comparable to composting) and returns the decomposed clippings to the soil within one to two weeks,&lt;ref name="rivanna" /&gt; acting primarily as a [[fertilizer]] supplement and, to a much smaller degree, a [[mulch]]. Grasscycling can provide 15 to 20% or more of a lawn's yearly nitrogen requirements.&lt;ref name="reel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelmowersetc.com/grasscycle!.htm|title=Grasscycle!|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ciwmb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/GrassCycling/default.htm|title=California Integrated Waste Management Board -  What is grasscycling?|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also note that grasscycling reduces the use of plastic bags for collecting yard waste and reduces trips to the curb or landfill to haul waste.&lt;ref name="kings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrokc.gov/procure/green/rjcgrass.htm|title=King County Experience: Grasscycling|accessdate=2007-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991105152701/http://www.metrokc.gov/procure/green/rjcgrass.htm|archivedate=1999-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal grasscycle techniques include:&lt;ref name="rivanna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baydelta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/grass/grasstips.html|title=Bay Delta Grass Recycling Campaign|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cutting no more than 1/3 the length of the grass, this means when lawns are growing fast, mowing about twice a week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cutting when the grass is dry to the touch
* Cutting when the height is between 3 and 4 inches (7 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm), once per week.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Ensuring that the mower blade is sharp

Although a [[mulching mower]] can make grass clippings smaller, one is not necessary for grasscycling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36828">The '''just-world hypothesis''' or '''just-world fallacy''' is the [[cognitive bias]] (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring [[morality|morally]] [[justice|fair]] and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic [[justice]], [[destiny]], [[divine providence]], [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], [[Balance (metaphysics)|stability]], or [[cosmos|order]], and has high potential to result in [[informal fallacy|fallacy]], especially when used to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] people's misfortune on the grounds that they "deserve" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the [[English language]] in various [[figures of speech]] that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: "[[wikt:get what's coming to one|you got what was coming to you]]", "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]", "[[wikt:chickens come home to roost|chickens come home to roost]]", "everything happens for a reason", and "[[wikt:reap what one sows|you reap what you sow]]". This hypothesis has been widely studied by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] since [[Melvin J. Lerner]] conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="An Overview"&gt;Lerner, M.J. &amp; Montada, L. (1998). An Overview: Advances in Belief in a Just World Theory and Methods, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeiPBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World]'' (1–7). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has continued since then, examining the predictive capacity of the hypothesis in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade"&gt;Furnham, A. (2003). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727 Belief in a just world: research progress over the past decade]. ''Personality and Individual Differences''; 34: 795–817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
Many philosophers and social theorists have observed and considered the phenomenon of belief in a just world, going back to at least as early as the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] writing around 180 CE who argued against this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism", Book 1, Chapter 13, Section 32&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner's work made the just-world hypothesis a focus of research in the field of social psychology.

===Melvin Lerner===
Lerner was prompted to study [[justice]] beliefs and the just-world hypothesis in the context of social psychological inquiry into negative social and societal interactions.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface"&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M.J. (1998). Preface, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. vii–viii). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner saw his work as extending [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiments|work on obedience]]. He sought to answer the questions of how regimes that cause cruelty and suffering maintain popular support, and how people come to accept [[social norms]] and laws that produce misery and suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=M. |last2=Simmons |first2=C. H. |year=1966 |title=Observer's Reaction to the 'Innocent Victim': Compassion or Rejection? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1037/h0023562 |pmid=5969146 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerner's inquiry was influenced by repeatedly witnessing the tendency of observers to [[victim blaming|blame victims]] for their suffering. During his clinical training as a psychologist, he observed treatment of mentally ill persons by the health care practitioners with whom he worked. Although he knew them to be kindhearted, educated people, they often blamed patients for the patients' own suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental"&gt;Lerner (1980). ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''. Plenum: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner also describes his surprise at hearing his students [[wikt:derogate|derogate]] (disparage, belittle) the poor, seemingly oblivious to the [[structural violence|structural forces]] that contribute to poverty.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; In a study on rewards, he observed that when one of two men was chosen at random to receive a reward for a task, that caused him to be more favorably evaluated by observers, even when the observers had been informed that the recipient of the reward was chosen at random.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking"&gt;Lerner, M. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1978). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26009-001 Just world research and the attribution process: Looking back and ahead]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 85(5), 1030–1051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Existing social psychological theories, including [[cognitive dissonance]], could not fully explain these phenomena.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages"&gt;Maes, J. (1998) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_10 Eight Stages in the Development of Research on the Construct of BJW?], in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. 163–185). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.

==Early evidence==
In 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female subjects were made to watch a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, subjects were upset by observing the apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to derogate the victim. Derogation was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when subjects were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, subjects did not derogate the victim.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver" /&gt; Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

==Theory==
To explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of "contract" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt;

Lerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.{{citation needed|date = December 2011}}

There are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt; Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;

An additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Linden, M. &amp; Maercker, A. (2011) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives].'' Wien: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. (1984). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-04021-001 Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 47(3), 494–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Veridical judgment===
{{See also|Veridicality}}
Others have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, B. &amp; Lowe, C. (1975). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-26823-001 Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 31, 944–951.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay &amp; L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205–229). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt reduction===
Another alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. &amp; Jones, E. (1960). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Davis3/publication/9847296_Changes_in_Interpersonal_Perception_as_a_Means_of_Reducing_Cognitive_Dissonance/links/00b7d519bfb9563e9e000000.pdf Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance]. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 61, 402–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. (1964). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression]. ''Journal of Personality'', 1964, 32, 531–549.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Kenrick, D. T., &amp; Hoerig, J. H. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-26028-001 Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(6), 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

===Discomfort reduction===

Alternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169–170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.&lt;ref name="Hafer2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=Bègue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429–444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional evidence==
After Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character.&lt;ref&gt;Reichle, B., Schneider, A., &amp; Montada, L. (1998). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_4 How do observers of victimization preserve their belief in a just world cognitively or actionally?] In L. Montada &amp; M. J. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 55–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, social psychologists [[Zick Rubin]] and Letitia Anne Peplau developed a measure of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, A. (1973). [https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00104.x Belief in a just world and reactions to another's lot: A study of participants in the national draft lottery]. ''Journal of Social Issues'', 29, 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure and its revised form published in 1975 allowed for the study of individual differences in just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name = "RubinPeplau1975"&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, L.A. (1975). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073011/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Publications_files/Rubin%20%26%20Peplau%201975s.pdf Who believes in a just world?] ''Journal of Social Issues'', 31, 65–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the subsequent research on the just-world hypothesis used these [[psychometrics|measurement scales]].

===Violence===
Researchers have looked at how observers react to victims of [[rape]] and other [[violence]]. In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R., Timko, C., &amp; Carli, L. L. (1985). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Timko/publication/223081344_Cognitive_biases_in_blaming_the_victim/links/59dd3d88aca272b698e141ab/Cognitive-biases-in-blaming-the-victim.pdf Cognitive biases in blaming the victim]. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 21(2), 161–177.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carli, L. L. (1999). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.830.8628&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(8), 966–979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]]. One study found that observers' labels of blame of female victims of relationship violence increase with the intimacy of the relationship. Observers blamed the perpetrator only in the most significant case of violence, in which a male struck an acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, G., &amp; Feldman, N. S. (1984). [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1984.2.4.339 Blaming the victim versus blaming the perpetrator:An attributional analysis of spouse abuse]. ''Symposium A Quarterly Journal In Modern Foreign Literatures'', 2(4), 339–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
Researchers have employed the just-world hypothesis to understand [[bullying]]. Given other research on beliefs in a just world, it would be expected that observers would derogate and blame bullying victims, but the opposite has been found: individuals high in just-world belief have stronger anti-bullying [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, C. L., Elder, T., Gater, J., &amp; Johnson, E. (2010). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000709909X479105 The association between adolescents' beliefs in a just world and their attitudes to victims of bullying]. ''The British journal of educational psychology'', 80(Pt 2), 183–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that strong belief in a just world is associated with lower levels of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2008). School Bullying. ''European Psychologist'', 13(4), 248254.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in keeping with Lerner's understanding of belief in a just world as functioning as a "contract" that governs behavior.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt; There is additional evidence that belief in a just world is protective of the well-being of children and adolescents in the school environment,&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., Kamble, S. V., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2009). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615800902729242 Belief in a just world and well-being of bullies, victims and defenders: a study with Portuguese and Indian students]. Anxiety, stress, and coping, 22(5), 497–508.&lt;/ref&gt; as has been shown for the [[#Positive health effects|general population]].

===Illness===
Other researchers have found that observers judge sick people as responsible for their illnesses. One experiment showed that persons suffering from a variety of illnesses were derogated on a measure of attractiveness more than healthy individuals were. In comparison to healthy people, victim derogation was found for persons presenting with indigestion, pneumonia, and stomach cancer. Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruman, J. C., &amp; Sloan, R. P. (1983).

Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 4(1), 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of [[AIDS]] victims.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS"&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1992). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679204500303 Sphere-specific just world beliefs and attitudes to AIDS]. Human Relations, 45, 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
More recently, researchers have explored how people react to [[poverty]] through the lens of the just-world hypothesis. Strong belief in a just world is associated with blaming the poor, with weak belief in a just world associated with identifying external causes of poverty including world economic systems, [[war]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., Wagstaff, G. F., Newton, J. T., &amp; Harrison, K. R. (1990).

[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-29152-001 The Just World and the Third World: British explanations for poverty abroad]. ''The Journal of social psychology'', 6. Heldref Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self as victim===
{{See also|Psychological response to rape|Self blame}}
Some research on belief in a just world has examined how people react when they themselves are victimized. An early paper by Dr. Ronnie Janoff-Bulman found that rape victims often blame their own behavior, but not their own characteristics, for their [[victimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R. (1979). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22629118_Characterological_versus_behavioral_self-blame_Inquiries_into_depression_and_rape/links/54244b5b0cf238c6ea6eac09.pdf Characterological versus behavioral self-blame: inquiries into depression and rape]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 37(10), 1798–809.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that this may be because blaming one's own behavior makes an event more [[locus of control|controllable]].

These studies on victims of [[#Violence|violence]], [[#Illness|illness]], and [[#Poverty|poverty]] and others like them have provided consistent support for the link between observers' just-world beliefs and their tendency to blame victims for their suffering.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; As a result, the existence of the just-world hypothesis as a psychological phenomenon has become widely accepted.

==Theoretical refinement==
Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world,&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C., Lipkus, I. M., Sallay, H., &amp; Goch, I. (2001). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000556 A just and unjust world: Structure and validity of different world beliefs].

Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 43–53). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS" /&gt; An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with [[Just-world hypothesis#Positive mental health effects|positive mental health]].&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal" /&gt;

==Correlates==
Researchers have used measures of [[belief]] in a just world to look at correlates of high and low levels of belief in a just world.

Limited studies have examined ideological correlates of the belief in a just world. These studies have found sociopolitical correlates of just-world beliefs, including [[right-wing authoritarianism]] and the [[protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A. J., Burroughs, T., &amp; Nguyen, T. (1999). [https://sites.google.com/site/alambertpsychology/publications/Lambertetal-riskperception.pdf Perceptions of risk and the buffering hypothesis: The role of just world beliefs and right wing authoritarianism]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(6), 643–656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1989).

''British Journal of Social Psychology'', 28, 365–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of [[religiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002).

[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07654-003 Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events]. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of demographic differences, including [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]] differences, have not shown systematic differences, but do suggest racial differences, with blacks and African Americans having the lowest levels of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, L., &amp; Cann, A. (1994). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1994.9923011 Differences in assumptions about a just world: ethnicity and point of view].

The development of measures of just-world beliefs has also allowed researchers to assess cross-cultural differences in just-world beliefs. Much research conducted shows that beliefs in a just world are evident cross-culturally. One study tested beliefs in a just world of students in 12 countries. This study found that in countries where the majority of inhabitants are powerless, belief in a just world tends to be weaker than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1993).

''Journal of Social Psychology'', 133, 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the theory of the just-world hypothesis because the powerless have had more personal and societal experiences that provided evidence that the world is not just and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1992). Relationship knowledge and attitudes towards AIDS. ''Psychological Reports'', 71, 1149–1150.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=I assume you mean to say 'neither just nor predictable.'|date=February 2014}}

Belief in unjust world has been linked to increased self-handicapping, criminality, defensive coping, anger and perceived future risk. It may also serve as ego-protective belief for certain individuals by justifying maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lench|first1=Chang|title=Belief in an Unjust World: When Beliefs in a Just World Fail|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2007|volume=89|issue=2|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/00223890701468477|pmid=17764390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=Dariusz|title=The belief in an unjust world: An egotistic delusion|journal=Social Justice Research|date=1996|volume=9|issue=3|pages=213–221|doi=10.1007/BF02197248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

===Positive mental health effects===
Although much of the initial work on belief in a just world focused on its negative social effects, other research suggests that belief in a just world is good, and even necessary, for [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C. (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sbKCnhCPaSgC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20justice%20motive%20as%20a%20personal%20resource%3A%20dealing%20with%20challenges%20and%20critical%20life%20events%22 The justice motive as a personal resource: dealing with challenges and critical life events].'' New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a just world is associated with greater [[life satisfaction]] and well-being and less depressive affect.&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal"&gt;Lipkus, I. M., Dalbert, C., &amp; Siegler, I. C. (1996). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167296227002 The Importance of Distinguishing the Belief in a Just World for Self Versus for Others: Implications for Psychological Well-Being].

[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1389045 Belief in a just world and depression]. ''Sociological Perspective'', 25, 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are actively exploring the reasons why the belief in a just world might have this relationship to mental health; it has been suggested that such beliefs could be a personal resource or [[coping (psychology)|coping strategy]] that buffers [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with daily life and with [[psychological trauma|traumatic events]].&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner"&gt;Hafer, C., &amp; Olson, J. (1998). Individual differences in beliefs in a just world and responses to personal misfortune. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 65–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that belief in a just world can be understood as a [[positive illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., &amp; Brown, J. (1988). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c6/b13d227783a3466d7a0903d9ebb111904502.pdf Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies also show that beliefs in a just world are correlated with internal [[locus of control]].&lt;ref name="RubinPeplau1975" /&gt; Strong belief in a just world is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life.&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner" /&gt; This may be one way in which belief in a just world affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs in a just world for oneself. Beliefs in a just world for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R., &amp; Douglas, K. (2005). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690500070X Justice for all, or just for me? More evidence of the importance of the self-other distinction in just-world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39(3), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International research===
More than 40 years after Lerner's seminal work on belief in a just world, researchers continue to study the phenomenon. Work continues primarily in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Researchers in Germany have contributed disproportionately to recent research.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; Their work resulted in a volume edited by Lerner and German researcher Leo Montada titled ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World''.&lt;ref&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M. (Eds.) (1998) ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kripa''' (कृपा) is the concept of [[divine grace]] in [[Hinduism]]. It is the central tenet of [[Bhakti Yoga]] and [[Bhakti movement]]s, which are seen as reform movements in Hinduism as compared to the Hinduism which finds its origins in the [[Veda]]s;&lt;ref&gt;''The Embodiment of Bhakti'', by Karen Pechilis Prentiss, Oxford University Press US, 1999. {{ISBN|0-19-512813-3}}. ''Page 3-6.''&lt;/ref&gt; though variously it can mean "grace", "mercy", or "blessing", depending upon the context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/light/light_glo.html Glossary of Sanskrit Terms - Kripa] ''www.swami-krishnananda.org.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindi word Kirpala from Sanskrit Kripala means "kind" and is used as a given name for males, while "Kripa" (Kṛpā), is used as a female given name.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

== Significance of Kripa ==

Kripa is akin to similar beliefs prevalent in [[mysticism]] of all traditions. In Hinduism as well, the bestowal of divine grace or Kripa is considered an event which catapults a devotee or [[bhakta]] into a period of intense personal transformation leading to his [[Moksha]].

Devotional or [[Bhakti]] literature available throughout India is replete with references to Kripa as the ultimate key towards realizing the spiritual path of self-realization &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/30/stories/2005063000400900.htm Descent of divine grace] ''[[The Hindu]]'', June 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some like the ancient sage [[Vasistha]], in his classical work [[Yoga Vasistha]], considered it to be the only way to transcend the bondage of lifetimes of Karma. He states to [[Rama]] that divine grace or Kripa is the only way to help us go beyond the effects of [[Prarabdha karma]], or collection of all the past [[Karma]]s, [[Sanchita karma]] chosen to experience during a lifetime.

The [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]] [[Madhvacharya]] held that grace was not a gift from God, but rather must be earned.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal,Ian. ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World''. HarperResource, 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-06-270085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Krishna]] says to [[Arjuna]] in the final chapter of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], ''Verse 18.66'', "Setting aside all meritorious deeds ([[Dharma]]), just [[surrender (religion)|surrender]] completely to My will (with firm faith and loving contemplation). I shall liberate you from all sins. Do not fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | date = 
  | url = http://vedabase.net/bg/18/66
  | accessdate = 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] composes his famous verse [[Bhaja Govindam]] in 8th century, where he declares:
&lt;poem&gt;
:: "''Bhajagovindam bhajagovindam''
:: ''Govindam bhaja muudhamate''
:: ''Sampraapte sannihite kaale''
:: ''Nahi nahi rakshati dukrijnkarane.."''
:: Translation:
::Worship [[Govinda]], Worship Govinda,
:: Worship Govinda. Oh fool!
:: Rules of Grammar will not save you
:: At the time of your death.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Skanda Purana]] mentions the grace of a [[Guru]] in various places, especially in the Uttarakhand, section ''Guru Strotram'', known as [[Guru Gita]], in the form of a dialogue between [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati|Uma]] (Shakti):
&lt;poem&gt;
:: "Guru Brahma Guru Vishnu
:: Guru Devo Maheshwara
:: Guru Sakshat Param Brahma
:: Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah"

:: "Dhyana Moolam Guru Murti.
:: Puja Moolam Gurur Padam,
:: Mantra Moolam Gurur Vakyam,
:: Moksha Moolam Guru Kripa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1983/gjuly83/stotram.shtml Guru Strotram]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

== Bhakti movement ==
{{main|Bhakti movement}}
[[Bhakti]] or devotion has often remained an ignored aspect in [[Indian philosophy]], hence its significance was lost to majority of the populace. For some time it was considered befitting only to the lower classes and woman, as only the elite were considered able to comprehend the message of the [[Vedic]] tradition. Things changed with the revival and reform movements in Hinduism which brought this aspect of Kripa into a new light and made the divine accessible to all, and not just the preserve of the priestly class.&lt;ref&gt;''Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements'', by Jayant Lele. Published by Brill Archive, 1981. {{ISBN|90-04-06370-6}}. ''Page 6''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of Kripa ==

Kripa has been categorized in various ways as [[Ishwara]] kripa (grace of God), variously [[Hari]] Kripa, [[Shastra]] kripa (grace of the Scriptures), [[Guru]] kripa (grace of the Guru) and lastly [[Atma (Hinduism)|Atma]] kripa (grace of the Self).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26893">The following is a list of international standards that are relevant to the protection of children in migration and mobility. These standards are legally binding conventions, treaties and directives. The international legal framework concerning children in migration and mobility provides safeguards in relation to asylum and international protection, labour regulations, the prevention of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings, international standards for migrant workers, child victims of crime and the judiciary, as well as international private law for child protection and family matters.

==International==
International standards of the United Nations, once adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, are open to signature and ratification by UN Member States worldwide. When a national government ratifies a Convention, the standards afforded under the Convention have to be reflected in national law and policy and become thereby applicable law in the country. The same procedure of ratification applies to the Conventions of the Council of Europe and the Hague Conference of Private International Law. In addition to the Member States of these inter-governmental organisations, non-Member States can also accede to the Conventions.

===The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] defines the human rights of children and the correlated obligations of states. It provides also for obligations of parents and caregivers, public authorities, private service providers and the private sector. These rights and obligations can guide caseworkers and case officers in all measures, decisions and considerations for children on the move. The Convention supports caseworkers and officers in navigating the complex body of international, European and national laws. It provides the overarching framework and the strongest point of reference for safeguarding children.

The Convention is complemented by three Optional Protocols, one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]], another one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|involvement of children in armed conflict]], and a third and more recent Protocol on a communications procedure for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/CTC_4-11d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; States that have ratified the Convention report to the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the international Treaty Body mandated to monitor the implementation of the Convention by States Parties. The Committee reviews and comments on State Party reports on the implementation of the Convention and develops General Comments, in which it elaborates on specific articles of the Convention.

===The Hague Conference on Private International Law===
The [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] (HCCH) is a global inter-governmental organisation that has developed standards for the transnational cooperation on child protection and family matters. The key themes addressed by the Conventions of the Hague Conference include transnational child protection, inter-country adoption, cross-border parental child abduction as well as matters of parental responsibility and contact involving different countries.

The Hague Conventions in the area of transnational child protection and family law have several common characteristics. They ensure the automatic mutual recognition of official decisions taken by one Contracting State in other Contracting States. They enable and facilitate the cooperation between the Contracting States, including through the establishment of central authorities and the development of unified procedures. By facilitating practical matters, such as the translation of documents, information exchange and the use of standardised model forms, the Conventions aim to simplify and expedite cross-border procedures and the enforcement of official decisions.

The Hague Conventions are innovative as they work primarily with the concept of ‘habitual residence’ of the child, rather than ‘nationality’, in order to determine which state has the jurisdiction over a case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcch.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol ===
The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol regulate the right of persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special safeguards and have a right to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution need to be considered irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted a series of Directives regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner for Refugees, Guidelines on International Protection, Child Asylum Claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council of Europe ==

===The European Social Charter===
The [[European Social Charter]] sets out rights and freedoms and establishes a supervisory mechanism mandated to monitor how States Parties implement the Charter in practice. The rights afforded under the Charter concern all individuals in their daily lives as they relate, for instance, to housing, health, education, employment, legal and social protection, free movement of persons and non-discrimination. The Charter was first adopted in 1961 and was subsequently revised. The 1996 revised European Social Charter entered into force in 1999.

The European Committee of Social Rights issued in October 2015 a Statement of interpretation on the rights of refugees under the European Social Charter, which provides guidance on the application of the European Social Charter to refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Presentation/AboutCharter_en.asp#Les_droits_garantis_par_la_Charte&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] is the first instrument to establish the various forms of sexual abuse and exploitation of children as criminal offences, including abuse committed in the home or family, with the use of force, coercion or threats. Preventive measures outlined in the Convention include the screening, recruitment and training of persons working in contact with children, making children aware of the risks and teaching them to protect themselves, as well as monitoring measures for offenders and potential offenders.

The Convention also establishes programmes to support victims, encourages people to report suspected sexual exploitation and abuse, and sets up telephone and internet helplines for children. It ensures that certain types of conduct are classified as criminal offences, such as engaging in sexual activities with a child below the legal age and the sexual exploitation of children in prostitution and pornography. The Convention criminalises the solicitation of children for sexual purposes (grooming) and by travelling sex offenders who can be prosecuted for some offences even when the act is committed abroad. The Convention ensures that child victims are protected during judicial proceedings, for example with regard to their identity and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] is a comprehensive treaty mainly focused on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims at preventing trafficking as well as prosecuting traffickers. The Convention applies to all forms of trafficking; whether national or transnational, whether or not related to organised crime and whoever the victim, women, men or children and whatever the form of exploitation, sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, or other.

The Convention provides for the setting up of an independent monitoring mechanism (GRETA), which monitors the States Parties’ compliance with its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

===Directives – EU law===
Within the European Union, EU Directives are legally binding and constitute EU law that needs to be transposed into the national law of Member States within a prescribed period of time. When countries infringe against or violate European standards that are in force within the country, the European Courts offer the possibility to seek legal remedy and to claim the rights afforded under international or European law.

====Reception Conditions Directive====
The ''Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers'' sets out minimum reception standards for asylum applicants. The aim is to ensure that the applicants have a dignified standard of living and that comparable living conditions are afforded to them in all Member States. At the same time, the Directive also limits asylum applicants’ secondary movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asylum Procedures Directive====
The ''Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection'' repealed Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in European Union countries and sets up EU-wide procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (refugee status and the protection given to people who are not refugees but who would risk serious harm if returned to their country of origin).&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010502_1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qualification Directive====
The full name of the Qualification Directive is the ''Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted''.

The Qualification Directive establishes common grounds to grant international protection. Its provisions also foresee a series of rights on protection from non refoulement, residence permits, travel documents, access to employment, access to education, social welfare, healthcare, access to accommodation, access to integration facilities, as well as specific provisions for children and vulnerable persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32011L0095
&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Dublin Regulation|Dublin III Regulation]]====
With the full name [[Dublin Regulation|''Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person'']].

Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin III Council Regulation), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 (Dublin II Regulation), lays down the criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010503_1 
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return Directive====
The ''Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals'' establishes common standards and procedures for EU countries, whereby illegally staying non-EU nationals may be removed from their territories. It lays down provisions for terminating illegal stays, detaining non-EU nationals with the aim of removing them and procedural safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:jl0014
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family Reunification Directive====
The purpose of the ''Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification'' is to determine the conditions under which non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of EU countries may exercise the right to family reunification. The Directive aims to establish common rules of law relating to the right to family reunification. The intention is to enable family members of non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the European Union (EU) to join them in the EU country in which they are residing. The objective is to protect the family unit and to facilitate the integration of nationals of non-member countries. The Directive does not apply to Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In addition, it does not preclude any more favourable conditions recognised by national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33118
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service====
The aim of the ''Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service'' is to harmonise national legislation relating to the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33163a
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right of Union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States====
''European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States'' brings together the piecemeal measures found in the complex body of legislation that had previously governed this matter. The measures are designed, among other things, to encourage citizens to exercise their right to move and reside freely within EU countries, to cut back administrative formalities to the bare essentials, to provide a better definition of the status of family members, to limit the scope for refusing entry or terminating the right of residence and to introduce a new right of permanent residence.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33152&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brussels II bis Regulation====
[[Brussels II|''Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility'']] brings together in a single legal instrument the provisions on divorce and parental responsibility, with a view to facilitating the work of judges and legal practitioners and to regulating the exercise of cross-border rights of access.

==Conflicting mandates==
In the public debate on international migration, the mandates and interests of different agencies and disciplines can sometimes appear to be in conflict. International human rights standards provide the common basis for decision makers. In the context of children, the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] provides the basis for promoting the best interests of children in all contexts and situations.

==Non-legally binding standards==
In addition to legally binding conventions, treaties and directives, the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union have developed a large number of political recommendations, regulations and guidelines, which are not legally binding but have nonetheless an important value as they aid in the interpretation and implementation of legal standards.

'''Luck egalitarianism''' is a view about [[distributive justice]] espoused by a variety of [[egalitarian]] and other [[political philosopher]]s. According to this view, justice demands that variations in how well off people are should be wholly determined by the responsible choices people make and not to differences in their unchosen circumstances. This expresses the intuition that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own.

==Theory==
Luck egalitarians therefore distinguish between outcomes that are the result of brute luck (e.g. misfortunes in [[genetics|genetic makeup]], or being struck by a bolt of [[lightning]]) and those that are the consequence of conscious options (such as career choice or fair gambles). Luck egalitarianism is intended as a fundamental normative idea that might guide our thinking about justice rather than as an immediate policy prescription. The idea has its origin in [[John Rawls]]' thought that distributive shares should not be influenced by arbitrary factors. Luck egalitarians disagree among themselves about the proper way to measure how well off people are (for instance, whether we should measure [[material wealth]], psychological [[happiness]] or some other factor) and the related issue of how to assess the value of their resources.

Many philosophers think that the term "luck egalitarianism"&lt;!-- who? --&gt; is a misnomer, because many so-called "luck egalitarians" (of the 'resourcist' strand at least) do not in fact want to equalize luck or eliminate uncertainty, but instead believe that individuals should be equal in the amount of resources they have when facing luck or uncertainty.

==Criticism of theory==

The position is controversial within some currents of egalitarian thought, and the [[philosopher]] [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]] has been a vocal critic of it &amp;mdash; on the ground that, amongst other things, the fact that something is chosen does not necessarily make it acceptable. An example of this would be a robber offering someone the choice "Your [[money]] or your [[life]]," which choice some theorists, including Thomas Hobbes (''Leviathan'' XIV: "Covenants Extorted by Feare are Valide") have regarded as presumptively binding. She also claims that luck egalitarianism expresses a demeaning pity towards the disadvantaged, basing their claims to compensation not on equality but inferiority, and excludes many individuals from the social conditions of their freedom simply on the basis that it is judged to be their fault for losing them. Further, it involves the state making highly moralistic and intrusive judgements about the choices that individuals make, and seems to lead to very counter-intuitive conclusions: those who voluntarily enter jobs with higher-than-average risks, or who 'choose' to live in geographical locations prone to natural disasters may make no claim on others if they suffer as a result of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth S.|date=1999-01-01|title=What Is the Point of Equality?|jstor=10.1086/233897|journal=Ethics|volume=109|issue=2|pages=287–337|doi=10.1086/233897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hurley has argued that any attempt to ground egalitarianism in issues concerning luck and responsibility must fail, because there is no non-circular way of specifying an ''egalitarian'' baseline rather than any other baseline. For instance, a luck inegalitarian could believe that the baseline from which we should correct luck is one where huge inequalities exist. Without merely assuming equality, there seems to be no way of coming to prefer one approach over the other.

==Global luck egalitarianism==

Global luck egalitarianism is a view about distributive justice at the global level associated with cosmopolitan moral theory. It starts from the premise that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own and applies this intuition across borders. Global luck egalitarians characteristically believe that moral agents may have duties to mitigate the brute luck of distant others. Proponents of this school of thought are amongst others [[Simon Caney]] and arguably [[Charles Beitz]]; opponents, most of whom reject the above premise either in its entirety or with respect to inequalities in which one party's welfare is at least above some minimum level, include [[Robert Nozick]].

==Advocates of theory==
Prominent advocates of luck egalitarianism have included [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Richard Arneson]], [[Gerald Cohen]], [[John Roemer]], Eric Rakowski, and Kok-Chor Tan.

===Sound art and installations (2012-present)===
[[File:What Lies Beneath.jpg|thumb|left|What Lies Beneath, by Margaret Noble]]
Noble's installation ''44th and Landis'' opened in 2012 at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. The large-scale multimedia art piece combined [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]]-style paper dolls with 1980s urban influences based on her upbringing in San Diego's City Heights neighborhood, and included a performance by Noble.&lt;ref name="jchute032412"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=AnnaMaria|date=July 2012|title=The Exhibitionists|url=https://margaretnoble.net/wp-content/uploads/Riviera_Magazine_7_2012.pdf|journal=Riviera Magazine|publication-date=2 July 2012|pages=78–80|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's visual centerpiece was a hanging series of 100 paper dolls, along with paper-doll clothing, objects and architecture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-10/growing-city-heights|title=Growing up in City Heights|last=Carone|first=Angela|date=10 September 2012|work=PRI Arts, Culture &amp; Media|access-date=12 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015061647/https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-10/growing-city-heights|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her 2016 interactive piece "What Lies Beneath", she worked in sound sculpture, creating a tall wooden box with instructions next to it to raise the lid, which caused sounds of organ pipes, truck brakes and other dissonance to emit. The person interacting with it controlled the sound with the lid, with a "storm" inside the box.&lt;ref name="tlarson"/&gt;
[[File:I Long to be Free from Longing.jpg|thumb|I Long to Be Free from Longing, by Margaret Noble]]
Her "Head in the Sand" is a wooden box sitting on four legs with a head-sized hole in the top and instructions to visitors to place their heads in the hole and wait. Inside is a chambered light and sound show with soft pastoral sounds, the hole serving as a sanctuary from the art exhibit itself.&lt;ref name="tlarson" /&gt; "Head in the Sand" was included in her 2016 exhibition ''Resonating Object,'' an interactive mixture of sound, sculpture and videos, at [[South Puget Sound Community College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]]. The exhibition also included "I Long to Be Free From Longing" and "Material Shrine for the New Class", featuring dangling objects the visitor could squeeze to activate different sounds.&lt;ref name="mgilmore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theolympian.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article103548607.html|title=Visitors, sound part of the art in ‘Resonating Objects’|last=Gilmore|first=Molly|date=22 September 2016|work=[[The Olympian]]|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://archive.fo/2U1fY|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2014 interactive sound installation "I Long to Be Free From Longing" won first place in the 23rd annual Juried Exhibition at the [[Athenaeum Music &amp; Arts Library]] in San Diego.&lt;ref name="jchute081414"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-athenaeum-juried-exhibition-noble-2014aug14-story.html|title=Noble gets top prize in Athenaeum exhibition|last=Chute|first=James|date=14 August 2014|work=|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024023328/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-athenaeum-juried-exhibition-noble-2014aug14-story.htm|archive-date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Noble's 2016 sound art installation ''Time Strata'', a public art commission for the [[Port of San Diego]] at the [[César Chávez Park|Cesar Chavez Park]] pier, consisted of three sound sculptures made of materials including vintage buoys, hunks of bamboo, bells, stainless steel and harp strings, along with sounds of creatures like [[snapping shrimp]] in the water under the pier. Microphones placed around the pier fed the sound into a mixer and then into four digital consoles where participants could sample and alter the sounds.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-fall-arts-preview-visual-art-margaret-noble-2016sep13-htmlstory.html|title=Fall arts 2016: Up close with artist Margaret Noble|last=Myrland|first=Susan|date=13 September 2016|work=The San Diego Union-Times|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914225039/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-fall-arts-preview-visual-art-margaret-noble-2016sep13-htmlstory.html|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I Have Arrived.jpg|thumb|left|I Have Arrived, by Margaret Noble]]For ''The Collector'', Noble worked with puppeteers Animal Cracker Conspiracy and visual directors Bridget Rountree and Iain Gunn, creating a multi-layered soundscape that used animated video, live video projection and puppetry to tell a story of a debt collector.&lt;ref name="ljaniak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/09/10/occupy-fringe-theatre-2012-the-good-the-bad-and-the-glowy|title=Occupy Fringe Theatre 2012: The Good, the Bad, and the Glowy|last=Janiak|first=Lily|date=10 September 2012|work=SF Weekly|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024023914/https://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/09/10/occupy-fringe-theatre-2012-the-good-the-bad-and-the-glowy|archive-date=10 September 2012|dead-url=no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Righteous Exploits'', a 2013 experimental performance created with Justin Hudnall, used a combination of live audio and video multimedia and performance art.&lt;ref name="ccasares"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/11/weekend-preview-righteous-exploits-stay-strange-an/|title=Weekend Preview: Righteous Exploits, Stay Strange and The Big Read|last=Cavanaugh|first=Maureen|date=11 April 2013|work=|access-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817090545/https://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/11/weekend-preview-righteous-exploits-stay-strange-an/|archive-date=17 August 2013|dead-url=no|publisher=KPBS|last2=Casares|first2=Carissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her 2018 installations of ''Resonating Objects'' included "lawn sprinklers sitting on grass-covered pedestals, playing their percussive, shimmering, water-spraying sounds", entitled "I Have Arrived", which explores the use of expendable resources on lawns, or status symbols.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

[[File:A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds.jpg|thumb|A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure, by Margaret Noble]]Two other pieces are "Scaled Discords, 2015", with spinning tops representing "power structures, resource allocation and racial inequality in America", and "A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure" consisting of "mash-up of Lite Brite, a Ouija board, and an early Akai sampler".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Noble describes the exhibit as "a quiet and personal experience for the participant. The sounds work together with the gestures of touching the work, the physical materials of each sculpture’s design and the personal responses of the audience".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Noble's art has been presented on [[PBS]] and reviewed favorably in Art Ltd. Magazine, [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]], and [[SF Weekly|San Francisco Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/artpress/docs/peripheral_arteries_art_review_-_ma_91e58f951d8abb|title=Peripheral ARTeries Art Review|date=March 2015|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic wrote that "enlarging the sensorium of art with sound begins with disorder," but while visual art may be viewed with "one or one hundred other hushed-up viewers," sound art is more like "a Fourth-of-July picnic, [[Charles Ives|Charles-Ives]] [[polyphony]], a resolute disequilibrium".&lt;ref name="tlarson" /&gt;

Noble's exhibits may not be what people expect art to be. Nathan Barnes of the Gallery at Kenneth J. Minnaert Center for the Arts at South Puget Sound Community College said, "''What can art be?'' is a good question to pose to students — and to the larger community. If people are walking through the door thinking art is a drawing or a painting that's rectilinear, this is probably going to blow their minds." Molly Gilmore of [[The Olympian|''The Olympian'']] wrote that the exhibition "doesn't fit into a neat category of art." Reviewer Michael James Rocha said in 2016, "Artist Margaret Noble isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what's art."&lt;ref name="mgilmore" /&gt;

Susan Myrland of ''The San Diego Tribune'' asked, "So why does sonic art still seem unusual 100 years after [[Luigi Russolo]] built his first [[intonarumori]], or experimental noise instruments?"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Noble and two of her collaborators on ''Time Strata'' offered these reasons: "It's hard to exhibit properly. Curators might not know how to assess it, and there aren't many collectors rushing to buy work that they can't see. It's difficult for sound art to break away from the paradigm of musical performance. It requires time and space to fully appreciate. Art galleries are often bare rooms with concrete floors, which means poor acoustics and one sound art piece overlapping another."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Observing ''Frakture'', Jennie Punter of ''[[Musicworks]]'' wrote of Noble's "underground club DJ’s flair for performance and a conceptual artist's commitment to the rigorous investigation of ideas".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mark Jenkins of [[The Washington Post]] wrote, "Her primary goal is audience participation, whether that involves turning a crank or inserting one's head into a box to prompt whooshing sounds. Noble's work completes its circuit when the spectator is, literally or figuratively, inside it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/in-the-galleries-strangely-familiar-objects-for-the-eyes-and-ears/2017/01/26/2cacaf94-e191-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html|title=In the galleries: Strangely familiar objects for the eyes and ears|last=Jenkins|first=Mark|date=26 January 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015071805/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/in-the-galleries-strangely-familiar-objects-for-the-eyes-and-ears/2017/01/26/2cacaf94-e191-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1c0b21848f65|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the exhibit ''44th and Landis,'' Angela Carone of [[Public Radio International]] commented, "Look close and you'll see the ghosts of ''Ms. Pac-Man'', the labels from Animal Cracker boxes and Laffy Taffy, and, on the seedier side, signage from neighborhood massage parlors. The paper dolls are pint-sized mash-ups of '80s pop culture and Victoriana. They seem to emerge from Noble's childhood dreams as she tried to make sense of both a threatening and exciting environment."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Drew Snyder noted, "...there is an excess to the sound collage, a soft but persistent drone of spinning bottles or coins, rolling glass marbles, the eternal creak of a cabinet hinge, the rapt knocking on a door, or the sound of something falling over. These reverberations are strikingly material, a confluence and collision of metal, plastic, wood and glass that mash up and reconfigure what we can imagine as a neighborhood's aural life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Drew|date=Jan 2013|title=San Diego: Margaret Noble: ''44th and Landis'' at Museum of Contemporary Art|url=http://artltdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AL-01-JAN-2013.pdf|journal=Art Ltd.|pages=22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015072511/http://artltdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AL-01-JAN-2013.pdf|archive-date=15 October 2018|via=art ltd. archives 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Now Is Not a GoodTime.jpg|left|thumb|Now Is Not a Good Time, by Margaret Noble]]
Reviewing her exhibit titled, "Now Is Not A Good Time", Rebecca Romani of ''The Buzz'' wrote in 2018 of its "intriguing mix" of sewing and tatting materials and rattlesnake tails powered by tiny batteries. Romani commented, "It's tempting to read a cautionary tale of watching too much ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House On The Prairie]]'' and the nostalgia that lead us to these current times."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vanguardculture.com/the-buzz-the-art-of-the-cut/|title=THE BUZZ: The Art of the Cut - Vanguard Culture|last=Romani|first=Rebecca|date=4 June 2018|work=Vanguard Culture|access-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015073017/https://vanguardculture.com/the-buzz-the-art-of-the-cut/|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Andrew Nunes described "Head in the Sand", which Noble exhibited in ''Resonating Objects'', as a  "claustrophobic challenge", a wooden box with a hole for a viewer's head. Nunes went on to say Noble fused sculptural sound art and interactivity, "seeking to go deeper on conceptual levels about human experience and our relationships with technology and each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/ez5eqm/resonating-objects-sound-art-meditate-human-experience|title=Interactive 'Resonating Objects' Meditate on the Human Experience|last=Nunes|first=Andrew|date=27 October 2016|work=Creators|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015211711/https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/ez5eqm/resonating-objects-sound-art-meditate-human-experience|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yvonne Wise, director of waterfront arts and activation at the Port of San Diego, wrote of Noble's art installation ''Time Strata'', "Temporal works like Noble's prompt new opportunities and formats for engaging in public art, producing interactions that are flexible, dynamic, and socially conscious. In place of monumental permanence emerges a sustained program of placemaking and experiential learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pantheonstorage.blob.core.windows.net/experiences/timestrata_online_singlepages.pdf|title=TIME STRATA, An Interactive Sound Art Experience by Margaret Noble|last=Wise|first=Yvonne|date=22 October 2016|website=Port of San Diego|isbn=9780999853108|access-date=October 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015073323/https://pantheonstorage.blob.core.windows.net/experiences/timestrata_online_singlepages.pdf|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mirror stage''' ({{lang-fr|stade du miroir}}) is a concept in the [[psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]]. The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a [[mirror]] (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces [[apperception]] (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.

Initially, Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant's development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth International Psychoanalytical Congress at [[Marienbad]] in 1936. By the early 1950s, Lacan's concept of the mirror stage had evolved: he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the [[infant]], but as representing a permanent structure of [[subjectivity]], or as the [[paradigm]] of "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary order]]". This evolution in Lacan's thinking becomes clear in his later essay titled "The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire".

==History of development==
Lacan's concept of the mirror stage was strongly inspired by earlier work by psychologist [[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]], who speculated based on observations of animals and humans responding to their reflections in mirrors.&lt;ref name ="Webster"&gt;Webster, Richard. (2002) "[http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html The cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the mirror stage.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both ''seem'' to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images.&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"&gt;[[Dylan Evans|Evans, Dylan]] (2005). "[http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf From Lacan to Darwin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502205406/http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}," in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson,  Evanston: Northwestern University Press, pp38-55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later [[mirror test]] research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, and John Jaskir. "Individual Differences in Visual Self-recognition as a Function of Mother-infant Attachment Relationship." Developmental Psychobiology 21.6 (1985) 1181-87&lt;/ref&gt; leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N. Holland to declare that "there is no evidence whatsoever for Lacan's notion of a mirror stage".&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1998) [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nholland/lacan.htm The Trouble(s) With Lacan]".&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, physician [[Raymond Tallis]]&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond.
 (1988) ''Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory'', Macmillan, 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that a literal interpretation of the Lacanian mirror stage contradicts empirical observations about human identity and personality: "If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the [mirror stage] theory would predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be unable to enter language, society or the world at large. There is no evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is borne out in practice."

Wallon's ideas about mirrors in infant development were distinctly non-[[Freudian]] and little-known until revived in modified form a few years later by Lacan. As Evans&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; writes, "Lacan used this observation as a springboard to develop an account of the development of human subjectivity that was inherently, though often implicitly, comparative in nature." Lacan attempted to link Wallon's ideas to Freudian psychoanalysis, but was met with indifference from the larger community of Freudian psychoanalysts. Richard Webster&lt;ref name ="Webster"/&gt; explains how the "complex, and at times impenetrable paper ... appears to have made little or no lasting impression on the psychoanalysts who first heard it. It was not mentioned in [[Ernest Jones]]'s brief account of the congress and received no public discussion."

In the 1930s, Lacan attended seminars by [[Alexandre Kojève]], whose philosophy was heavily influenced by [[Hegel]]. The diachronic structure of the mirror stage theory is influenced by Kojève's interpretation of the [[Master-slave dialectic]]. Lacan continued to refine and modify the mirror stage concept through the remainder of his career; see below.

[[Dylan Evans]]&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; argues that Lacan's earliest versions of the mirror stage, while flawed, can be regarded as a bold pioneering in the field of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behavior) and a precursor of both [[cognitive psychology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1930s, zoologists were increasingly interested in the then-new field of ethology, but not until the 1960s would the larger scientific community believe that animal behavior offered any insights into human behavior.

However, Evans also notes that by the 1950s Lacan's mirror stage concept had become abstracted to the point that it no longer required a literal mirror, but could simply be the child's observation of observed behavior in the imitative gestures of another child or elder.&lt;ref name="Evans Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Dylan|title=An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis.|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-Alienation==

The child’s initiation into what Jacques Lacan would call the "mirror stage" entails a "libidinal dynamism" caused by the young child's identification with his own image and creation of what Lacan terms the "Ideal-I" or "Ideal ego." This reflexivity inherent in fantasy is apparent in the mirror stage, since to recognize oneself as "I" is like recognizing oneself as other ("yes, that person over there is me"); this act is thus fundamentally self-alienating. Indeed, for this reason feelings towards the image are mixed, caught between hatred ("I hate that version of myself because it is so much better than me") and love ("I want to be like that image"). A type of repetition compulsion develops from this vacillation as the attempt to locate a fixed subject proves ever elusive. "The mirror stage is a drama…which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality.” This misrecognition (seeing an ideal-I where there is a fragmented, chaotic body) subsequently "characterizes the ego in all its structures."

==As phenomenon==
{{quote|The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential [[libido|libidinal]] relationship with the [[body image]]. (Lacan, ''Some reflections on the Ego'', 1953)}}

As Lacan further develops the mirror stage concept, the stress falls less on its historical value and ever more on its structural value. "Historical value" refers to the mental development of the [[child]] and "structural value" to the libidinal relationship with the body image.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. 1996. ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''. {{ISBN|0-415-13523-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's fourth Seminar, ''La relation d'objet'', he states that "the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship". The dual relationship (''relation duelle'') refers not only to the relation between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Ego]] and the [[Human body|body]], which is always characterized by [[illusion]]s of similarity and reciprocity, but also to the relation between the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The visual identity given from the mirror supplies imaginary "wholeness" to the experience of a fragmentary real. See Lacan's paper, "The Mirror Stage as formative of the function of the ''I'' as revealed in psychoanalytic experience", the first of his ''Écrits.''

The mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of identification, the Ego being the result of identifying with one's own specular image. At six months the [[baby]] still lacks [[motor coordination|coordination]] (see [[Louis Bolk]]); however, Lacan hypothesized that the baby can recognize itself in the mirror before attaining control over its bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole, but this contrasts with the lack of coordination of the body and leads the child to perceive a fragmented body. This contrast, Lacan hypothesized, is first felt by the infant as a rivalry with its own image, because the wholeness of the image threatens it with fragmentation; thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the subject identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart is what forms the Ego. (Evans, 1996) The moment of identification is to Lacan a moment of jubilation since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery. (''Écrits'', "The Mirror Stage") Yet, the jubilation may also be accompanied by a depressive reaction, when the infant compares his own precarious sense of mastery with the [[omnipotence]] of the [[mother]]. (''La relation d'objet'') This identification also involves the ideal ego which functions as a promise of future wholeness sustaining the Ego in anticipation.

The mirror stage, Lacan also hypothesized, shows that the Ego is the product of misunderstanding – Lacan's term "méconnaissance" implies a false recognition. Additionally, the mirror stage is where the subject becomes [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from itself, and thus is introduced into the Imaginary order.

The Mirror Stage has also a significant [[symbol]]ic dimension. [[The Symbolic]] order is present in the figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as his own, he turns his head toward this adult who represents the big [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, "L'angoisse", 1962–1963)

'''Natural design''' is an approach to [[psychology]] and [[biology]] that holds that concepts such as "motivation", "emotion", "inner feeling", "development", "adaptation" refer not to down-reductive explanations of things but to up-reductive descriptions of patterns of which those things are part. It has its roots in philosophical behaviorism and the [[new realism]]. It also refers to an holistic approach to Design called for by Prof David W. Orr (Professor of Environmental Studies and Politics, Oberlin College USA) &lt;ref&gt;David W. Orr, (2002) "The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention". Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  and developed for research practice by Prof Seaton Baxter (Emeritus Professor for the Study of Natural Design, [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]], [[University of Dundee]]). &lt;ref&gt;Baxter, S. (2006), The Way to Natural Design: Learning to see and Confront the Bigger Design Questions, Enhancing Curricula, 3rd International CLTAD Conference, 6-7 April ‘06, Lisbon, Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Natural design has attribution to the process of natural selection. All species have been designed based on their life situation in order to have more offspring. This resulted as only better designed organisms can be found today because natural selection is only limited by the rapidity of environment change and the capacity of the genes to generate variation. Moreover, the theory of evolution by natural selection can some how explain the behavior of animals.&lt;ref&gt;N.S. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying of behavior==

Darwinism, psychologist who studies in behavior, stated two consequences of studying behavior.

#Conceptual consequence of breaking the mind and design. The presence of design was no longer evidence of an intending mind if Darwinism was correct. Therefore, design could exist by itself.

#Break down of the dualism and the partition that hitherto had existed between psychology and biology. Each discipline now could explain the preferred domain of the other such as instinct and natural selection can be used to human behavior and intentions are able to explain animal behavior.

These two results provided two competing systems for study of behavior and evolved into ethology and further evolved into comparative psychology.&lt;ref&gt;N.T. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nihoa millerbird''' (''Acrocephalus familiaris kingi'') is a subspecies of the [[millerbird]]. It gets its name from its preferred food, the Miller moth. The {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} long millerbird has dark, [[Sepia (color)|sepia]]-colored feathers, white belly, and dark beak. Its natural geographic range is limited to the tiny [[island]] of [[Nihoa]] in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], and it is hoped that birds translocated to [[Laysan]] will help to ensure the survival of the species. The Nihoa millerbird is one of the two endemic birds remaining on Nihoa, the other being the [[Nihoa finch]].

Only 200– 900 Nihoa millerbirds persist on the island, making the species seriously endangered. It is always at risk of extinction from environmental changes (droughts, fires, insect population irruptions), because flight away from the island would likely prove fatal. The [[Laysan millerbird]], now extinct, was closely related.[http://www.fws.gov/pacificislands/wesa/millerbirdniho.html#]

The trinomial commemorates [[Samuel Wilder King]], captain of the [[Tanager Expedition]] and later Governor of Hawaii.

[[File:Acrocephalus familiaris -Laysan, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, USA-8.jpg|right|thumb|A millerbird wearing coloured leg bands shortly after translocation from Nihoa to [[Laysan]]]]
24 Nihoa millerbirds were translocated by ship about {{convert|650|mi}} from Nihoa to [[Laysan]] in September 2011 after years of planning with the aim of establishing a second population of the species on Laysan. Mark MacDonald, a graduate student from the University of New Brunswick in Canada, lead a team that was working with the Service to collect information needed for translocations. From July through September 2007, MacDonald and his team captured and banded Nihoa millerbirds, collected body measurements, assessed body fat and breeding condition, identified individual territories and analyzed vocalizations, conducted feeding experiments, collected fecal samples, observed behavior to determine diet composition, noted the presence and abundance of non-native grasshoppers, and sampled the insect community on both Nihoa and Laysan to assess the millerbird’s potential prey base. MacDonald’s study estimated the Nihoa millerbird’s population at approximately 800 individuals – a relatively high number in 40 years of low and fluctuating numbers. He believes that this could be attributed not only to high numbers of birds present during the survey period but also a larger survey area, the use of more experienced observers, or (most likely) the greater visibility of the birds during the late summer, when vegetation cover is most limited.

Using mist nets, 85 Nihoa millerbirds (60 males and 25 females) were captured and banded. Banding permits identification of previously captured birds and reduces stress that can be caused by multiple captures. Most importantly, however, banding allows individual birds to be identified in the field and enables biologists to identify pairs, map their territories, and track individual survival from year to year through repeat sightings. Photographs and measurements of wing and tail feathers were taken from each individual, as well as small feather samples for genetic analysis. Growth bars visible on the tail feathers can help scientists determine the age of the bird, and comparison of photographs and measurements with results of lab analyses will aid in finding a way to sex Nihoa millerbirds in the field. Development of these methods will ensure that the right numbers of male and female birds are moved to Laysan.
Several Nihoa millerbirds were placed in a temporary enclosure and presented with a selection of island insects. The purpose was to identify millerbird dietary preferences and see if the birds would eat in captivity. Preliminary results showed that the birds fed readily from a plastic container of prey items. Of the choices offered, they left behind only lady bugs, sow-bugs, and ants. One bird was quick to chase down fast-moving cockroaches before taking smaller, slower insects such as spiders and beetles. Another test with a male and female showed that, after a brief adjustment period, the pair fed together without hesitation.
Using an iPod and a speaker, the team played millerbird songs within the territories of all 60 banded males and recorded the responses with a microphone. These recordings were used to determine the territories of 20 males and will also be analyzed to determine if differences exist in millerbird songs across Nihoa. Preliminary spectrograph analysis of the recordings shows variety among the songs of male millerbirds, but more research is needed to determine if these differences are significant. Identifying millerbird dialects on such a small spatial scale would be a novel finding and a major accomplishment of the expedition.

Thanks to MacDonald and his team, the Service is one step closer to establishing a second population and greatly reducing the risk of extinction for the Nihoa millerbird.

The birds were provided with different combinations of coloured leg bands to help identification of individual birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.vocuspr.com/Newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=FWS&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=128401&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;Cache=True |title=Release of Nihoa Millerbirds on Laysan Island Offers New Hope for Critically Endangered Species |publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife service |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nuclear physics}}
In [[nuclear physics]], '''nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic "[[binding energy]]" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or "[[main sequence]]" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.

A fusion process that produces a nucleus lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]], respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.

In 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on November 1, 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.

Research into developing controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]] for civil purposes began in earnest in the 1940s, and it continues to this day.

The release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer atomic length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.

Fusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.&lt;!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --&gt; The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name="bulletin1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99–104, 125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially "fall" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.

Energy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}—less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]–[[tritium]] (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion.

Research into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).

Workable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see [[ITER]]). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2020, but is not expected to begin full deuterium-tritium fusion until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |title=ITER – the way to new energy |year=2014 |website=ITER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922162049/http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fusion in stars==
[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[proton-proton chain reaction]], branch&amp;nbsp;I, dominates in stars the size of the Sun or smaller.]]

[[Image:CNO Cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[CNO cycle]] dominates in stars heavier than the Sun.]]

An important fusion process is the [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that powers [[star]]s and the Sun. In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |date=October 1920 |page=297-303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:

:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.
:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. 
:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.
:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)
:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the "crucible" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

The primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].

==Requirements==

A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.

When a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.

[[Image:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]

The net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium-tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus is 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.

[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&amp;nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

The reaction '''[[cross section (physics)|cross section]]''' σ is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted &lt;σv&gt;. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is &lt;σv&gt; times the product of the reactant number densities:

:&lt;math&gt;f = n_1 n_2 \langle \sigma v \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

If a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by &lt;math&gt;(1/2)n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]–[[1 E-14 J|100]]&amp;nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&amp;nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.

The significance of &lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.&lt;ref name=lawson&gt;[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods for achieving fusion ==
{{main article|Fusion power}}

=== Thermonuclear fusion ===
{{main article|Thermonuclear fusion}}
If matter is sufficiently heated (hence being [[plasma physics|plasma]]), fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles. Thermonuclear weapons produce what amounts to an uncontrolled release of [[fusion energy]]. Controlled thermonuclear fusion energy has yet to be achieved.

=== Inertial confinement fusion ===
{{main article|Inertial confinement fusion}}
[[Inertial confinement fusion]] ('''ICF''')  is a method aimed at releasing [[fusion energy]] by heating and compressing a fuel target, typically a pellet containing [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].

=== Inertial electrostatic confinement ===
{{main article|Inertial electrostatic confinement}}

[[Inertial electrostatic confinement]] is a set of devices that use an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions.  The most well known is the [[fusor]].  Starting in 1999, a number of amateurs have been able to do amateur fusion using these homemade devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusor.net/board/ |title=Fusor Forums • Index page |publisher=Fusor.net |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clhsonline.net/sciblog/index.php/2012/03/build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-no-problem/ |title=Build a Nuclear Fusion Reactor?

===Beam-beam or beam-target fusion===
If the energy to initiate the reaction comes from [[particle accelerator|accelerating]] one of the nuclei, the process is called ''beam-target'' fusion; if both nuclei are accelerated, it is ''beam-beam'' fusion.

Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.

===Muon-catalyzed fusion===
[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create [[muon]]s, their short 2.2&amp;nbsp;µs [[half-life]], and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new [[alpha particle]] and thus stop catalyzing fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, S.E. |title=Muon-Catalysed Fusion Revisited |journal=Nature |volume=321 |pages=127–133 |year=1986 |doi=10.1038/321127a0|bibcode = 1986Natur.321..127J |issue=6066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
[[File:TCV vue gen.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Tokamak à configuration variable]]'', research fusion reactor, at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (Switzerland).]]

Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

[[Antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion|Antimatter-initialized fusion]] uses small amounts of [[antimatter]] to trigger a tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied primarily in the context of making [[nuclear pulse propulsion]], and [[pure fusion bomb]]s feasible. This is not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of manufacturing antimatter alone.

[[Pyroelectric fusion]] was reported in April 2005 by a team at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The scientists used a [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] crystal heated from −34 to 7&amp;nbsp;°C (−29 to 45&amp;nbsp;°F), combined with a [[tungsten]] needle to produce an [[electric field]] of about 25&amp;nbsp;gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate [[deuterium]] nuclei into an [[erbium]] deuteride target.  At the estimated energy levels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/suppinfo/nature03575.html Supplementary methods for "Observation of nuclear fusion driven by a pyroelectric crystal"].

Although it makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power generation since it requires far more energy than it produces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rodan.physics.ucla.edu/pyrofusion/ UCLA Crystal Fusion].

[[Nuclear fusion-fission hybrid|Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission (hybrid nuclear power)]] is a proposed means of generating [[Electrical power industry|power]]  by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to the delays in the realization of pure fusion.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Project PACER]], carried out at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small [[H-bomb|hydrogen bomb]]s (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. However it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.

===Astrophysical reaction chains===
At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores the rates of fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (''T'' ≈ 15&amp;nbsp;MK) and density (160&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the energy release rate is only 276&amp;nbsp;μW/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/SunLayers.html FusEdWeb | Fusion Education]. Fusedweb.pppl.gov (1998-11-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-17. {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−''E''/''kT'')), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: ''T'' ≈ 0.1–1.0×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; K.

===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===
{{main article|Fusion power#Fuels}}
In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and [[tritium]] breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as [[Aneutronic fusion|''aneutronic'']].

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:

;Be [[exothermic]]: This limits the reactants to the low ''Z'' (number of protons) side of the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|curve of binding energy]]. It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.
;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse is directly related to the number of protons it contains - its atomic number.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=This implies a relationship between atomic number (Z) and activation energy (in addition to its relation to binding energy), which isn't established/cited here.}}
;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.
;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.
;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Nucleosynthesis}}

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to "breed" tritium in "dry" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo "Shrimp" had understood the usefulness of Lithium-6 in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that Lithium-7 fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While Li-7 has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.&lt;ref name=cross_section&gt;[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c]. Kayelaby.npl.co.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''τ required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is "ignited" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are "right". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.

===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===
[[Image:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The only man-made fusion device to achieve [[Fusion gain factor|ignition]] to date is the [[hydrogen bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The detonation of the first device, codenamed [[Ivy Mike]], occurred in 1952 and is shown here.]]
Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} → {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]],  ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&amp;nbsp;MeV, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&amp;nbsp;MeV.

For calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (3.27&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 12.5&amp;nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (0.82&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 4.2&amp;nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,&lt;ref&gt;A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;−(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25 to [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;+(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25. For E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=1.01&amp;nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&amp;nbsp;MeV to 6.73&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;/ref&gt; so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&amp;nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).

Another unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || ≈0.001
|}

The last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)/''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a "hot ion mode", the "penalty" would not apply.) There is at the same time a "bonus" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

|}

The maximum value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is taken from a previous table. The "penalty/bonus" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column "inverse reactivity" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column "[[Lawson criterion]]" weights these results with ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled "power density" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===
The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.
 
The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|-
|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57
|}

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma are considered—and rejected—in ''fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,

== Mathematical description of cross section ==

=== Fusion under classical physics ===
In a classical picture, nuclei can be understood as hard spheres that repel each other through the Coulomb force but fuse once the two spheres come close enough for contact. Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:

&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{thresh}}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \xrightarrow{\text{2 protons}} \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{1 \text{ fm}} \approx 1.4 \text{ MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

This would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is &lt;math&gt;10^{-290}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.

=== Parameterization of cross section ===
The probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \approx \sigma_{geometry} \times T \times R&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. 

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} \approx \lambda^2 = \bigg( \frac{\hbar^2}{m_r v} \bigg)^2 \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_r &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of the system and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon  &lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass energy of the system. 

{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: &lt;math&gt;T \approx e^ {- \sqrt{\epsilon_G /\epsilon} } &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_G = ( \pi \alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \times 2 m_r c^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. 

{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of &lt;math&gt;R(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], &lt;math&gt;S(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\epsilon) \approx \frac{S(\epsilon)}{\epsilon} e^{ - \sqrt{ \epsilon_G/\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;

More detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and R matrix theory.

[[File:Oceans of Climate Change.ogv|thumbnail|right|Oceanographer Josh Willis discusses the heat capacity of water, performs an experiment to demonstrate heat capacity using a water balloon and describes how water's ability to store heat affects Earth's climate.]]
[[File:The Ocean A Driving Force for Weather and Climate.webm|thumb|thumbtime=40|This animation uses Earth science data from a variety of sensors on NASA Earth observing satellites to measure physical oceanography parameters such as ocean currents, ocean winds, sea surface height and sea surface temperature. These measurements can help scientists understand the ocean's impact on weather and climate. (in HD)]]

'''Oceanic heat content''' (OHC) is the heat stored in the ocean. [[Oceanography]] and [[climatology]] are the science branches which study ocean heat content. Changes in the ocean heat content play an important role in the [[sea level rise]], because of [[thermal expansion]]. It is with high confidence that ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from [[global warming]] between 1971 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Summary for policymakers |year = 2013 |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |author = IPCC AR5 WG1 |website=www.climatechange2013.org |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one third of that extra heat has been estimated to propagate to depth below 700 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/ocean-depths-are-trapping-heat-19922|title=Study: Deep Ocean Waters Trapping Vast Store of Heat|year=2016|work=[[Climate Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and measurement==
The areal density of ocean heat content between two depth levels is defined using a [[definite integral]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dijkstra|first=Henk A.|title=Dynamical oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540763758|page=276|edition=[Corr. 2nd print.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H= \rho c_p \int_{h2}^{h1}  T(z) dz&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[seawater]] density, &lt;math&gt;c_p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] of sea water, h2 is the lower depth, h1 is the upper depth, and &lt;math&gt; T(z) &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature profile. In [[SI units]], &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has units of J&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Integrating this density over an ocean basin, or entire ocean, gives the total heat content, as indicated in the figure to right. Thus, the total heat content is the product of the density, specific heat capacity, and the [[volume integral]] of temperature over the three-dimensional region of the ocean in question.

Ocean heat content can be estimated using temperature measurements obtained by a [[Nansen bottle]], an [[Argo (oceanography)|ARGO float]], or [[ocean acoustic tomography]].  The [[World Ocean Database Project]] is the largest database for temperature profiles from all of the world’s oceans.

The upper Ocean heat content in most North Atlantic regions is dominated by heat transport convergence (a location where ocean currents meet), without large changes to temperature and salinity relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heat content variability in the North Atlantic Ocean in ocean reanalyses|doi=10.1002/2015GL063299|authors=Sirpa Häkkinen, Peter B Rhines, and Denise L Worthen|year=2015|pmc=4681455|pmid=26709321|volume=42|journal=Geophys Res Lett|pages=2901–2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent changes==
Several studies in recent years have found a [[multi-decadal oscillation]] increase in OHC of the deep and upper ocean regions and attribute the heat uptake to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A review of global ocean temperature observations: Implications for ocean heat content estimates and climate change |year = 2013 |author = Abraham|doi= 10.1002/rog.20022 |display-authors=etal |volume=51 |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |pages=450–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies based on ''ARGO'' indicate that ocean surface [[wind]]s, especially the [[subtropical ridge|subtropical trade winds]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], change ocean heat vertical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Distinctive climate signals in reanalysis of global ocean heat content |year = 2013 |author = Balmaseda, Trenberth &amp; Källén |doi=  10.1002/grl.50382 |volume=40 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |pages=1754–1759}} [http://www.rmets.org/weather-and-climate/climate/has-global-warming-stalled Essay]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in changes among [[ocean current]]s, and an increase of the [[thermohaline circulation#Movement of thermohaline circulation|subtropical overturning]], which is also related to the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomenon. Depending on stochastic natural variability fluctuations, during La Niña years around 30% more heat from the upper ocean layer is transported into the deeper ocean.
Model studies indicate that [[ocean currents]] transport more heat into deeper layers during La Niña years, following changes in wind circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Model-based evidence of deep-ocean heat uptake during surface-temperature hiatus periods |year = 2011 |url= http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n7/full/nclimate1229.html| author = Meehl|doi= 10.1038/nclimate1229 |display-authors=etal |volume=1 |journal=Nature Climate Change |pages=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalscience.com/The-Deep-Ocean-Warms-When-Global-Surface-Temperatures-Stall--.html |title= The Deep Ocean Warms When Global Surface Temperatures Stall |website=[[SkepticalScience.com]] |author=Rob Painting |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years with increased ocean heat uptake have been associated with negative phases of the [[Pacific decadal oscillation|interdecadal Pacific oscillation]] (IPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Looming Climate Shift: Will Ocean Heat Come Back to Haunt us? |date =24 June 2013 |url= http://www.skepticalscience.com/A-Looming-Climate-Shift-Will-Ocean-Heat-Come-Back-to-Haunt-us.html| website=SkepticalScience.com | author = Rob Painting |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is of particular interest to climate scientists who use the data to estimate the ''ocean heat uptake''.

A study in 2015 concluded that ocean heat content increases by the Pacific Ocean, were compensated by an abrupt distribution of OHC into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Geoscience|authors=Sang-Ki Lee, Wonsun Park, Molly O.

{{Property law}}
The '''open mines doctrine''' is a term of [[real property]]. Under the open mines doctrine, depletion of [[natural resources]] constitutes [[Waste (law)|waste]] unless consumption of such resources constitutes normal use of the land, as in the case of a [[life estate]] in [[coal mine]] or a granite [[quarry]]. 

The [[life tenant]] cannot open the land to search for [[minerals]] and other natural resources, but if the quarries or mines were open before the tenant took the life estate, then it is not waste for the life tenant to continue their use.  Where the [[life tenant]] opens the land for new mines (i.e., voluntary waste) a remainderman can enjoin such.

The sale of harvestable [[crops]] does not constitute waste.

'''Problem management''' is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems that happen or could happen in an IT service. The primary objectives of problem management are to prevent problems and resulting incidents from happening, to eliminate recurring incidents, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] defines a problem as the cause of one or more [[incident management|incidents]].

==Scope==
Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the [[root cause]] of incidents identified through the [[Incident Management]] process, and to determine the resolution to those problems. It is also responsible for ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the appropriate control procedures, especially [[Change_management_(ITSM)|Change Management]] and [[Release Management]].

Problem Management will also maintain information about problems and the appropriate workarounds and resolutions, so that the organization is able to reduce the number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect, Problem Management has a strong interface with [[Knowledge Management]], and tools such as the [[Known Error Database]] will be used for both. Although Incident Management and Problem Management are separate processes, they are closely related and will typically use the same tools, and may use similar categorization, impact and priority coding systems. This will ensure effective communication when dealing with related incidents and problems.

==Value to business==
Problem Management works together with Incident Management and Change Management to ensure that IT service availability and quality are increased. When incidents are resolved, information about the resolution is recorded. Over time, this information is used to speed up the resolution time and identify permanent solutions, reducing the number and resolution time of incidents. This results in less downtime and less disruption to business critical systems.

==Process activities, methods and techniques==
Problem Management consists of two major processes:
* Reactive Problem Management, which is generally executed as part of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Service operation|Service Operation]]
* Proactive Problem Management which is initiated in [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Service operation|Service Operation]], but generally driven as part of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Continual service improvement (CSI)|Continual service improvement (CSI)]].

==Problem detection==
*Suspicion or detection of a cause of one or more incidents by the [[Service Desk]], resulting in a [[Problem Record]] being raised – [[Service Desk]] may have resolved the incident but has not determined a definitive cause and suspects that it is likely to recur.
* Analysis of an incident by a technical support group which reveals that an underlying problem exists, or is likely to exist.
* Automated detection of an infrastructure or application fault, using event/alert tools automatically to raise an incident which may reveal the need for a [[Problem Record]].
* A notification from a supplier or contractor that a problem exists that has to be resolved.
* Analysis of incidents as part of proactive Problem Management: watch-bulletins, releases, relevant papers

==Problem logging==
All the relevant details of the problem must be recorded so that a full historic record exists. This must be date and time stamped to allow suitable control and escalation. A cross-reference must be made to the incident(s) which initiated the "Problem Record":
* Service details
* Equipment details
* Date/time initially logged
* Priority and categorization details
* Incident description
* Details for all diagnostic or attempted recovery actions taken.

==Problem Prioritization==
Problems may be categorized according to their severity and priority in the same way as incidents in order to facilitate their tracking, taking the impact of the associated incidents and their frequency of occurrence into account.
From an infrastructure point of view one may ask:
* Can the system be recovered, or does it need to be replaced?
* How much will it cost?
* How many people will be required to fix the problem?
* How long will it take to fix the problem?
* How many additional resources will be involved?
* What is the impact of '''not''' resolving the problem?

==Problem investigation and diagnosis==
The result of an investigation for a problem will be a root cause diagnosis or a RCA report. The resolution should be the sum of the appropriate level of resources and skills used to find it.
There are a number of useful problem solving techniques that can be used to help diagnosis and resolved problems.

*The '''CMS''' must be used to help determine the level of impact and to assist in pinpointing the point of failure. 
*The [[Known Error Database]] or KEDB should be accessed and checked in order to find out if the problem has occurred in the past, if so a resolution should be already in place.
*The Chronological analysis, the events that trigged the problem will be checked in chronological order in order to have a timeline of events. The purpose is to see which event trigger the next event and so on, or to rule out some possible events.

The '''Pain Value Analysis''' contains a broader view of the impact of an incident or a problem on the business. Rather than analysing the number of incidents/problems of a particular type in a particular time interval, the technique focus on in-depth analysis of what level of pain has been caused to the business by these incidents/problems. A formula to calculate the level of pain should take into account:
* the number of people affected
* the duration of the downtime caused
* the cost to the business

The '''Kepner and Tregoe''' method is used to investigate deeper-rooted problems. They defined the following stages:
* defining the problem
* describing the problem in terms of identity, location, time (duration) and size (impact)
* establishing possible causes
* testing the most probable cause
* verifying the true cause

'''Pareto Analysis''' or [[Pareto chart]] is a technique for separating important potential causes from trivial issues. The following steps should be taken:
# Form a table listing the causes and their frequency as a percentage
# Arrange the rows in the decreasing order of importance of the causes (the most important cause first)
# Add a cumulative percentage column to the table
# Create a bar chart with the causes, in order of their percentage of total
# Draw a line at 80% on the Y-axis, then drop the line at the point of intersection with the X-axis. From the chart you can see the primary causes for the network failures. These should be targeted first.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|+ Network failures
! Causes || Percentage of total || Computation %
|-
| Network Controller || 35 || 0+35% = 35%
|-
| File corruption || 26 || 35% + 26% = 61%
|-
| Server OS || 6|| 61%+6% = 67%
|-
|}

==Known Error Record==
After the investigation is complete and a workaround (or even a permanent solution) has been found, a Known Error Record must be raised and placed in the Known Error Database in order to identify and resolve further similar problems. The main purpose is to restore the affected service as soon as possible with a minimal impact on the business.

A good practice would be to raise a Known Error Record as early in the investigation as possible; once a workaround has been successfully tested or a root cause has been identified.

==Major Problem Review==
A good practice is to have a review for all major problems.
The review should examine:
*The correct steps taken
*The problems encountered during the implementation of the solution
*The need to improve
*Prevent the recurrence of further similar incidents
*Third-Party/Vendor/Supplier involved in the implementation

The knowledge learned from the review should be incorporated into a service review with the business customer to ensure that the customer is aware of the actions taken and the plans to prevent future similar incidents from occurring.This helps to improve customer satisfaction and assure the business that Service Operations is handling major incidents responsibly and actively working to prevent their future recurrence..

The [[War on Drugs]] is a term for the actions taken and legislation enacted by the [Federal government of the United States|United States government]], intended to reduce or eliminate the production, distribution, and use of illicit drugs. The War on Drugs began during the [[Nixon administration|Nixon Administration]with the goal of reducing the supply of and demand for illegal drugs, though an ulterior, racial motivation has been proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/|title=Legalize It All|last=Baum|first=Dan|date=2016-04-01|work=Harper's Magazine|access-date=2017-03-07|issn=0017-789X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War on Drugs has led to controversial legislation and policies, including [[mandatory minimum]] penalties and stop-and-frisk searches, which have been suggested to be carried out disproportionately against [[minorities]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The effects of the War on Drugs are contentious, with some suggesting that it has created racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, imprisonment and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2014/09/30/how-the-war-on-drugs-damages-black-social-mobility/|title=How the War on Drugs Damages Black Social Mobility {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-03-06|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-03-06|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Tonry|date=2015-01-01|title=Race and the War on Drugs|url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclf/vol1994/iss1/4/|journal=University of Chicago Legal Forum|language=en|volume=1994|issue=1|issn=0892-5593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized the methodology and conclusions of such studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=John P.|year=1994|title=Race and the War on Drugs|url=|journal=University of Chicago Legal Forum|volume=107|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to enforcement disparities, some claim that the collateral effects of the War on Drugs have established forms of [[structural violence]], especially for minority communities.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Motivation for the War on Drugs ==
The [[War on Drugs]] was declared by U.S. President [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] during a Special Message to Congress delivered on June 17, 1971, in response to increasing rates of death due to narcotics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During this announcement, Nixon distinguished between fighting the war on two fronts—the supply front and the demand front. To address the "supply" front, Nixon requested funding to train narcotics officers internationally, and proposed various legislation with the intent of disrupting illegal drug manufacturers. The "demand" front referred to enforcement and rehabilitation. To that end, Nixon proposed the creation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention, with the goal of coordinating various agencies in addressing demand for illegal drugs. He also requested an additional $105 million for treatment and rehabilitation programs, and additional funding to increase the size and technological capability of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3048|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative motivation ===
A former Nixon aide has suggested that the [[War on Drugs]] was racially and politically motivated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Quote|text=The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.|source=interview with Dan Baum|author=[[John Ehrlichman|John D. Ehrlichman]], former Nixon aide}} However, because he may have been disillusioned with the Nixon administration following the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] scandal, the validity of Ehrlichman's claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/30/opinion/gergen-nixon-demons/index.html|title=Opinion: The inner demons that drove Nixon - CNN.com|last=Analyst|first=By David Gergen, CNN Senior Political|website=CNN|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Nixon Aides Suggest Colleague Was Kidding About Drug War Being Designed To Target Black People|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-nixon-drug-war-john-ehrlichman_us_56f58be6e4b0a3721819ec61|last=Hanson|first=Hilary|newspaper=Huffington Post|access-date=2016-03-26|date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial policies ==
A number of policies introduced during the War on Drugs have been singled out as particularly racially disproportionate.

=== Mandatory minimums ===
The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]] established a 100:1 sentencing disparity for the possession of crack vs. powder cocaine. Whereas possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine triggered a 5-year [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentence]], possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine triggered the same mandatory minimum penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5484|title=H.R.5484 - Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|last=|first=|date=27 October 1986|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988]] established a 1-year mandatory minimum penalty for simple possession of crack cocaine, making crack cocaine the only controlled substance for which a first possession offense triggered a mandatory minimum penalty.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ussc.gov/research/congressional-reports/1995-report-congress-cocaine-and-federal-sentencing-policy|title=1995 Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy|date=2013-10-28|work=United States Sentencing Commission|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study found that, as a result of mandatory minimum sentencing, blacks and Hispanics received more severe sentences than their white counterparts from 1984 through 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=137258|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] delivered a report to Congress concluding that, because 80% of crack offenders were black, the 100:1 disparity disproportionately affected minorities. The Commission recommended that the crack-to-powder sentencing ratio be amended, and that other sentencing guidelines be re-evaluated.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These recommendations were rejected by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FS-Brief-History-of-Crack-Laws-4.13.pdf|title=A Brief History of Crack Cocaine Sentencing Laws|last=|first=|date=13 April 2012|website=Families Against Mandatory Minimums|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, certain authors have pointed out that the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] backed the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]], implying that that law could not be racist.&lt;ref name="aibw-2782"&gt;{{Citation|title=America in black and white: one nation, indivisible|year=1999|last1=Thernstrom|last2=Thernstrom|first1=Abigail|first2=Stephan|page=278|contribution=Crime|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780684844978|editor-last1=Thernstrom|editor-first1=Abigail|editor-last2=Thernstrom|editor-first2=Stephan}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=JTiJK0D18OoC&amp;pg=PA278 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="losing-race-142"&gt;{{Citation|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|title=Losing the race: self-sabotage in Black America|year=2000|page=14|contribution=The cult of victimology|publisher=Simon and Schuster|editor-last=McWhorter|editor-first=John H.|isbn=9780684836690}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UvMGxQrbQREC&amp;pg=PA14 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Congress passed the [[Fair Sentencing Act]], which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. The mandatory minimum penalty was amended to take effect for possession of crack cocaine in excess of 28 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/1789|title=Fair Sentencing Act of 2010|last=|first=|date=3 August 2010|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory minimum penalties have been criticized for failing to apply uniformly to all cases of illegal behavior.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=137258|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stop-and-frisk searches ===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Terry v. Ohio]] that a "stop-and-frisk" search does not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], so long as the officer executing the search bears a "reasonable suspicion" that the person being searched has committed, or is about to commit, a crime. As a result, "stop-and-frisk" searches became much more common during the [[War on Drugs]], and were generally conducted in minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Hannah LF|date=2015-01-01|title=War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|volume=50|issue=8–9|pages=1188–1194|doi=10.3109/10826084.2015.1007669|issn=1082-6084|pmc=4800748|pmid=25775311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Stop-and-frisk" searches have been criticized for being disproportionately carried out against minorities as a result of racial bias, though empirical literature on this count is inconclusive. Certain authors have found that, even after controlling for location and crime participation rates, African-Americans and Hispanics are stopped more frequently than whites.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelman|first=Andrew|last2=Fagan|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Kiss|first3=Alex|date=2007-09-01|title=An Analysis of the New York City Police Department's "Stop-and-Frisk" Policy in the Context of Claims of Racial Bias|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=102|issue=479|pages=813–823|doi=10.1198/016214506000001040|issn=0162-1459|citeseerx=10.1.1.300.2930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have found that no bias exists, on average, in an officer's decision to stop a citizen, though bias may exist in an officer's decision to frisk a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Analysis of Racial Disparities in the New York Police Department's Stop, Question, and Frisk Practices|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR534.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coviello|first=Decio|last2=Persico|first2=Nicola|date=2015-06-01|title=An Economic Analysis of Black-White Disparities in the New York Police Department's Stop-and-Frisk Program|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=44|issue=2|pages=315–360|doi=10.1086/684292|issn=0047-2530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stop-and-frisk searches in New York City have declined significantly since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data|title=Stop-and-Frisk Data|date=2012-01-02|work=New York Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:USA 2009.

Rates per 100,000 were converted to percentages.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Crime statistics ==

=== Stops and searches ===
A 2015 report conducted by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] found that blacks in Ferguson, Missouri were over twice as likely to be searched during vehicle stops, despite being found in possession of contraband 26% less often than white drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|last=|first=|date=4 March 2015|website=United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report conducted by the [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office]] concluded that racial disparities exist regarding stops, searches, and arrests by the San Francisco Police Department, and that these disparities were especially salient for the black population. Blacks made up almost 42% of all non-consensual searches after a stop, though they accounted for less than 15 percent of all stops in 2015. Blacks held the lowest search "hit rate", meaning that contraband was least likely to be found during a search.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfdistrictattorney.org/sites/default/files/Document/BRP_report.pdf|title=The Blue Ribbon Panel on Transparency, Accountability, and Fairness in Law Enforcement|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=SFDistrictAttorney.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 [[Chicago Police Accountability Task Force]] report found that black and Hispanic drivers were searched by the Chicago Police more than four times more frequently than white drivers, despite white drivers being found with contraband twice as often as black and Hispanic drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chicagopatf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PATF_Final_Report_Executive_Summary_4_13_16-1.pdf|title=Recommendations for Reform: Restoring Trust between the Chicago Police and the Communities they Serve|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrests ===
A 1995 [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] report found that from 1991 to 1993, 16% of those who sold drugs were black, but 49% of those arrested for doing so were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rdusda.pdf|title=The Racial Disparity in U.S. Drug Arrests|date=1 October 1995|work=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study concluded that blacks were significantly over-represented among those arrested for drug delivery offenses in [[Seattle]].

=== Sentencing ===
In 1998, there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-Americans, who only comprised 13% of regular drug users, made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-2472"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Celling of America: An Inside Look at the U.S. Prison Industry|publisher=Common Courage Press|year=1998|isbn=978-1567511406|editor-last=Burton-Rose|editor-first=Daniel|quote="possession of 500 grams of powdered cocaine--100 times the amount of crack--carries a 5 year minimum sentence" ... in reality a racist war being waged against poor Blacks"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than white men.&lt;ref name="hrw-race-key-findings2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/drugs/war/key-facts.htm|title=Key findings at a glance|publisher=Human Rights Watch|work=Racial disparities in the war on drugs|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajph2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Elkavich|first2=Amy|date=May 2008|title=Who's Using and Who's Doing Time: Incarceration, the War on Drugs, and Public Health|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=98|issue=5|pages=782–786|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.126284|pmid=18687610|last1=Moore|first1=Lisa D.|pmc=2518612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 paper stated that drug use rates among Blacks (7.4%) were comparable to those among Whites (7.2%), meaning that, since there are far more White Americans than Black Americans, 72% of illegal drug users in America are white, while only 15% are black.&lt;ref name="ajph2" /&gt;

According to [[Michelle Alexander]], the author of ''[[The New Jim Crow]]'' and a professor of law at Stanford Law School, even though drug trading is done at similar rates all over the U.S., most people arrested for it are colored. Together, African American and Hispanics comprised 58% of all prisoners in 2008, even though African Americans and Hispanics make up approximately one quarter of the US population &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=West|first=Michelle Alexander|title=The new Jim Crow: mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness|date=2012|pages=97–139|contribution=Chapter 3: The color of justice|others=Cornel (foreword)|edition=Rev.|location=New York|publisher=New Press|editor-last=West|editor-first=Michelle Alexander|isbn=9781595586438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of prisoners are arrested for drug related crime, and in at least 15 states, 3/4 of them are black or Latino people.

A 2012 report by the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] found that drug sentences for black men were 13.1 percent longer than drug sentences for white men between 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ussc.gov/research/congressional-reports/2012-report-congress-continuing-impact-united-states-v-booker-federal-sentencing|title=2012 Report to the Congress: Continuing Impact of United States v.

===  Rehabilitation  ===
Professor Cathy Schnieder of International Service at American University notes that in 1989, African Americans, representing 12-15 percent of all drug use in the United States, made up 41 percent of all arrests. That is a noted increase from 38 percent in 1988. Whites were 47 percent of those in state-funded treatment centers and made up less than 10 percent of those committed to prison.&lt;ref name="Racism, Drug Policy, and Aids2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnieder|first=C.|year=1998|title=Racism, Drug Policy, and Aids|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=113|issue=3|pages=427–446|doi=10.2307/2658075|jstor=2658075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==
Some have suggested that certain [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings related to the War on Drugs have reinforced racially disproportionate treatment.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Donna|date=2003-01-01|title=Foreword: Addressing the Real World of Racial Injustice in the Criminal Justice System|jstor=3491312|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=93|issue=4|pages=827–880|doi=10.2307/3491312|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7132&amp;context=jclc|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Armstrong'' (1996), the Supreme Court heard the case of Armstrong, a black man charged with conspiring to possess and distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine. Facing the District Court, Armstrong claimed that he was singled out for prosecution due to his race and filed a motion for discovery. The District Court granted the motion, and required the government to provide statistics from the prior 3 year on similar crimes, dismissing Armstrong's case when the government refused.

The government appealed the decision, and the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] affirmed the dismissal, holding that defendants in selective-prosecution claims need not demonstrate that the government failed to prosecute similarly situated individuals. The case was then sent to the Supreme Court, which reversed the decision and held that defendants must show that the government failed to prosecute similarly situated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/95-157|title=United States v. Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Bass'' (2002), the Supreme Court heard a similar case. John Bass was charged with two counts of homicide, and the government sought the death penalty. Bass filed for dismissal, along with a discovery request alleging that death sentences are racially motivated. When the government refused to comply with the discovery request, the District Court dismissed the death penalty notice. Upon appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, and the case was sent to the Supreme Court.

Reversing the decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a defendant in a selective prosecution case must make a "credible showing" of evidence that the prosecution policy in question was intentionally discriminatory. The court ruled that Bass did not do so because he failed to show that similarly situated individuals of different races were treated differently. Specifically, the Court rejected Bass' use of national statistics, holding that they were not representative of similarly situated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2001/01-1471|title=United States v. Bass|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both cases have been criticized for perpetuating racially motivated legal standards. It has been suggested that the current standard is impossible to meet for selective prosecution claims, because the relevant data may not exist, and if it does, because the prosecution may have sole access to it.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Effects of the War on Drugs ==

=== Negative health effects ===
Felony drug convictions often lead to circumstances that carry negative health-related consequences. Employment opportunities (and associated healthcare benefits), access to public housing and food stamps, and financial support for higher education are all jeopardized, if not eliminated, as a result of such a conviction.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iguchi|first=M.

=== Collateral consequences ===
Some authors have suggested that the [[collateral consequences of criminal conviction]] are more serious than the legal penalties. In many cases, statutes do not require that convicts are informed of these consequences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Many felons cannot be employed by the federal government or work in government jobs, as they do not meet the standards to gain security clearance. Felons convicted of distributing or selling drugs may not enlist in the military.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Certain states are financially incentivized to exclude criminals from access to public housing. All states receive less federal highway funding if they fail to revoke or suspend driver's licenses of drug-related felons.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Collateral consequences, and [[felon disenfranchisement]] in particular, have historically been at least partially racially motivated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Andrew L.|date=1993-01-01|title=Challenging Criminal Disenfranchisement under the Voting Rights Act: A New Strategy|jstor=797104|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=103|issue=2|pages=537–566|doi=10.2307/797104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|African American Communities}}African-American communities===
The War on Drugs has incarcerated high numbers of African-Americans. However, the damage has compounded beyond individuals to affect African-American communities as a whole, with some social scientists suggesting the War on Drugs could not be maintained without societal racism and the manipulation of racial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Provine|first=Doris Marie|date=2011-01-01|title=Race and Inequality in the War on Drugs|journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the high incarceration rate has led to the juvenile justice system and family courts to use race as a negative heuristic in trials, leading to a reinforcing effect: as more African-Americans are incarcerated, the more the heuristic is enforced in the eyes of the courts. This contributes to yet higher imprisonment rates among African-American children.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

High numbers of African American arrests and charges of possession show that although the majority of drug users in the United States are white, blacks are the largest group being targeted as the root of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Ojmarrh|last2=Caudy|first2=Michael S.|date=2015-03-04|title=Examining Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests|url=https://utsa.influuent.utsystem.edu/en/publications/examining-racial-disparities-in-drug-arrests|journal=Justice Quarterly|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=288–313|doi=10.1080/07418825.2012.761721|issn=0741-8825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study by Andrew Golub, Bruce Johnson, and Eloise Dunlap affirms the racial divide in drug arrests, notably marijuana arrests, where blacks with no prior arrests (0.9%) or one prior arrest (4.3%) were nearly twice as likely to be sentenced to jail as their white counterparts (0.4% and 2.3%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GOLUB|first=ANDREW|last2=JOHNSON|first2=BRUCE D.|last3=DUNLAP|first3=ELOISE|date=2007-01-01|title=THE RACE/ETHNICITY DISPARITY IN MISDEMEANOR MARIJUANA ARRESTS IN NEW YORK CITY|journal=Criminology &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=131–164|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2007.00426.x|pmc=2561263|pmid=18841246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harboring these emotions can lead to a lack of will to contact the police in case of an emergency by members of African-American communities, ultimately leaving many people unprotected.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Disproportionate arrests in African-American communities for drug-related offenses has not only spread fear but also perpetuated a deep distrust for government and what some call racist drug enforcement policy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Additionally, a black-white disparity can be seen in probation revocation, where black probationers were revoked at higher rates than white and Hispanic probationers in studies as published under [[Urban Institute|The Urban Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siddique|first=Julie A.|last2=Belshaw|first2=Scott H.|date=2016-07-01|title=Racial Disparity in Probationers' Views about Probation|journal=Race and Justice|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=222–235|doi=10.1177/2153368715602932|issn=2153-3687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women of color===
The War on Drugs also plays a negative role in the lives of women of color. The number of black women imprisoned in the United States increased at a rate more than twice that of black men, over 800% from 1986 to 1991. During that same period, the percentage of females incarcerated for drug-related offenses more than doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gd5yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=race+and+the+war+on+drugs#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)|title=Crime Control and Women: Feminist Implications of Criminal Justice Policy|last=Miller|first=Susan L.|date=1998-02-12|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452250489|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, black and white women had similar levels of drug use during [[pregnancy]]. In spite of this, black women were 10 times as likely as white women to be reported to a child welfare agency for [[prenatal]] drug use.&lt;ref name="prenatal-race-22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Landress|first2=Harvey J.|last3=Barrett|first3=Mark E.|year=1990|title=The prevalence of illicit-drug or alcohol use during pregnancy and discrepancies in mandatory reporting in Pinellas County, Florida|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=322|issue=17|pages=1202–1206|doi=10.1056/NEJM199004263221706|pmid=2325711|quote=During the six-month period in which we collected the urine samples, 133 women in Pinellas County were reported to health authorities after delivery for substance abuse during pregnancy.

Women of color who are implicated in drug crimes are "generally poor, uneducated, and unskilled; have impaired mental and physical health; are victims of physical and sexual abuse and mental cruelty; are single mothers with children; lack familial support; often have no prior convictions; and are convicted for a small quantity of drugs".&lt;ref name="NWSA2" /&gt;

Additionally, these women typically have an economic attachment to, or fear of, male drug traffickers, creating a power paradigm that sometimes forces their involvement in drug-related crimes.&lt;ref name="Journal of Black Studies2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Benoit|first2=Ellen|last3=Dunlap|first3=Eloise|year=2010|title=Dimensions of oppression in the lives of impoverished Black women who use drugs|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=41|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1177/0021934708326875|pmid=21113410|last1=Windsor|first1=Liliane C.|pmc=2992333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though there are programs to help them, women of color are usually unable to take advantage of social welfare institutions in America due to regulations. For example, women's access to methadone, which suppresses cravings for drugs such as heroin, is restricted by state clinics that set appointment times for women to receive their treatment. If they miss their appointment, (which is likely: drug-addicted women may not have access to transportation and lead chaotic lives), they are denied medical care critical to their recovery. Additionally, while women of color are offered jobs as a form of government support, these jobs often do not have childcare, rendering the job impractical for mothers, who cannot leave their children at home alone.&lt;ref name="Journal of Black Studies2" /&gt;

However, with respect to mandatory minimum sentencing, female offenders receive relief almost 20% more often than male offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ussc.gov/research/congressional-reports/2011-report-congress-mandatory-minimum-penalties-federal-criminal-justice-system|title=2011 Report to the Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System|date=2013-10-28|work=United States Sentencing Commission|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, female offenders, on average, receive lighter sentences than those who commit similar offenses.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov"/&gt;

[[File:AK-L-W-03-62-16A.jpg|thumb|Radar [[wind profiler]] and RASS at the [[Alaska North Slope]] site in [[Barrow, Alaska]]]]
A '''radio acoustic sounding system''' ('''RASS''') is a system for measuring the atmospheric [[lapse rate]] using [[backscatter]]ing of  [[radio]] waves from an [[Acoustics|acoustic]] wave front to measure the [[speed of sound]] at various heights above the ground. This is possible because the compression and rarefaction of air by an acoustic wave changes the [[dielectric]] properties, producing partial reflection of the transmitted [[radar]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avouris | first = Nicholas | title = Environmental Informatics | publisher = Kluwer Academic | location = City | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-7923-3445-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the speed of sound, the temperature of the air in the [[planetary boundary layer]] can be computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The maximum [[altitude]] range of RASS systems is typically 750 meters, although observations have been reported up to 1.2&amp;nbsp;km in moist air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaimal | first = J. | title = Atmospheric Boundary Layer Flows | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1994 |pages = 245 | isbn = 0-19-506239-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

The principle of operation behind RASS is as follows: [[Bragg's law|Bragg scattering]] occurs when [[Acoustics|acoustic]] energy (i.e., sound) is transmitted into the vertical beam of a [[radar]] such that the [[wavelength]] of the acoustic signal matches the half-wavelength of the radar. As the frequency of the acoustic signal is varied, strongly enhanced scattering of the radar signal occurs when the Bragg match takes place. 

When this occurs, the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] of the radar signal produced by the Bragg scattering can be determined, as well as the atmospheric vertical velocity. Thus, the speed of sound as a function of altitude can be measured, from which [[virtual temperature]] (TV) profiles can be calculated with appropriate corrections for vertical air motion. The virtual temperature of an air parcel is the temperature that dry air would have if its pressure and density were equal to
those of a sample of moist air. As a rule of thumb, an atmospheric vertical velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s can alter a TV observation by 1.6°C.

== Configurations ==

RASS can be added to a radar [[wind profiler]] or to a [[sodar]] system. In the former case, the necessary acoustic subsystems must be added to the radar wind profiler to generate the sound signals and to perform signal processing. When RASS is added to a radar profiler, three or four vertically pointing acoustic sources (equivalent to high quality stereo loud speakers) are placed around the radar wind profiler's antenna, and electronic subsystems are added that include the acoustic power amplifier and the signal generating circuit boards. The acoustic sources are used only to transmit sound into the vertical beam of the radar, and are usually encased in noise suppression enclosures to minimize nuisance effects that may bother nearby neighbors or others in the vicinity of the instrument.

When RASS is added to a sodar, the necessary radar subsystems are added to transmit and receive the radar signals and to process the radar reflectivity information. Since the wind data are obtained by the sodar, the radar only needs to sample along the vertical axis. The sodar transducers are used to transmit the acoustic signals that produce the Bragg scattering of the radar signals, which allows the speed of sound to be measured by the radar.

== Resolution ==

The vertical resolution of RASS data is determined by the pulse length(s) used by the radar. RASS sampling is usually performed with a 60 to 100 meter pulse length. Because of atmospheric attenuation of the acoustic signals at the RASS frequencies used by boundary layer radar wind profilers, the altitude range that can be sampled is usually 0.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;km, depending on atmospheric conditions (e.g., high wind velocities tend to limit RASS altitude coverage to a few hundred meters because the acoustic signals are blown out of the radar beam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Bailey

'''Reality tunnel''' is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from [[belief]]s and [[experience]]s, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "[[Truth]] is in the eye of the beholder".  It is similar to the idea of [[representative realism]], and was coined by [[Timothy Leary]] (1920–1996). It was further expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (1932-2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book ''Prometheus Rising''.

Wilson and Leary co-wrote a chapter in Leary's 1988 book ''Neuropolitique'' (a revised edition of the 1977 book ''Neuropolitics''), in which they explained further: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another's territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other's reality tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Neuropolitique, New Falcon Publications, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Considerations==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson&lt;ref name="youtube video"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Real Reality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZBDUJ0yiVg|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambud-raw&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Maybe Logic: The Lives And Ideas Of Robert Anton Wilson -- Illustrated Interview|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/maybelogictranscript.htm|publisher=American Buddha|year=2003|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no [[objective truth]]; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]], prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the [[fundamentalist Christian]] reality tunnel or the [[metaphysical naturalism|ontological naturalist]] reality tunnel.

A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of [[confirmation bias]]—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the "one true objective reality", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Wilson—like [[John C. Lilly]] and many others—relates that through various techniques one can break down old reality tunnels and impose new reality tunnels by removing old filters and replacing them with new ones, with new perspectives on reality—at will. This is attempted through various processes of deprogramming using [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[cybernetics]], [[hypnosis]], [[biofeedback]] devices, [[meditation]], controlled use of [[hallucinogens]], and forcibly acting out other reality tunnels. Thus, it is believed one's reality tunnel can be widened to take full advantage of human potential and experience reality on more positive levels. Robert Anton Wilson's ''[[Prometheus Rising]]''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anton Wilson, ''Prometheus Rising''. New Falcon Publications, 1983, 262pp. {{ISBN|1-56184-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is (among other things) a guidebook to the exploration of various reality tunnels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are. – [[Anaïs Nin]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] used the word ''gloss'' to describe how the mind perceives reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagualism.com/carlos-castaneda-interview-psychology-today.html Sam Keen, Castaneda interview, Psychology Today, Dec. 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; We are taught, he theorised, how to "put the world together" by others who subscribe to a [[consensus reality]]. "The curious world of Talcott Parsons was where society was a system, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} interactive subsystems adhering to a certain set of unwritten rules."&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Salerno, ''Beyond the enlightenment: lives and thoughts of social theorists''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, The Social System. New York: The Free Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[meme]] is another source of ''gloss''; it is "transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena." Because we're social creatures, there are reasons for us to adopt some [[social currency|social currencies]].

In line with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] thought,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Alper, ''The "God" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God''. Sourcebooks, Inc., 2008, p.50f.&lt;br/&gt;
"The human mind, Kant contended, must be born, not as a clean slate, but with built-in 'modes of perception' that work to organize the multitude of information our sense organs are constantly imparting to us. Without such built-in processing mechanisms, we would experience reality as an unintelligible jumble of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s."
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the work of [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], studies have indeed shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/how_do_brains_filter_data/ Seed, ''How do brains filter data?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nspc"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14096-party-chat-brain-filter-discovered.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;nsref=news7_head_dn14096 New Scientist: ''{{'}}Party chat' brain filter discovered'']

This "filtering" is largely unconscious and may be influenced—more-or-less in many ways, in societies and in individuals—by biology,&lt;ref&gt;Example, [[autism]]. Autistics are unable "to understand the social communication of neurotypicals", and "Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1792 Bryn Mawr: Serendip, ''Through Different Eyes: How People with Autism Experience the World'']

Tart likened normal waking consciousness to hypnotic trance. He discussed how each of us is from birth inducted to the trance of the society around us.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jeffrey Means, Mary Ann Nelson, ''Trauma &amp; evil: healing the wounded soul''. Fortress Press, 2000, p.30-32. {{ISBN|0-8006-3270-2}}.&lt;br/&gt;
"Awakening from the consensus trances in which we are stuck as a result of living in a violent society is rare."&lt;/ref&gt; Tart noted both similarities and differences between hypnotic trance induction and consensus trance induction. (See [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]).

Some disciplines—[[Zen]] for example, and monastic schools such as [[Sufism]]—seek to overcome such conditioned realities by returning to less thoughtful and channeled states of mind.

[[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] is a modern psychological response to reality-tunneling.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Eriksen, Garrett McAuliffe, ''Teaching counselors and therapists: constructivist and developmental course design''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. pp. 366. {{ISBN|0-89789-795-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Wilson, a fully functioning human ought to be aware of their reality tunnel, and be able to keep it flexible enough to accommodate, and to some degree empathize with, different reality tunnels, different "game rules", different cultures.... Constructivist thinking is the exercise of metacognition to become aware of our reality tunnels or labyrinths and the elements that "program" them. Constructivist thinking should, ideally, decrease the chance that we will confuse our map of the world with the actual world.... [This philosophy] is currently expressed in many Eastern consciousness-exploration techniques.&lt;ref&gt;R. Elliott Ingersoll and Cecile Brennan, in Eriksen, McAuliffe 2001, p.336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is Lacan's distinction between "[[The Real]]" and the "Symbolic". Lacan argued that the Real is the imminent unified reality which is mediated through symbols that allow it to be parsed into intelligible and differentiated segments. The symbolic, which is primarily subconscious, is further abstracted into the Imaginary (our actual beliefs and understandings of reality). These two orders ultimately shape the way we come to perceive reality.

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''risk aversion''' is the behavior of [[human]]s (especially [[consumer]]s and [[investor]]s), who, when exposed to [[uncertainty]], attempt to lower that uncertainty. It is the hesitation of a person to agree to a situation with an unknown payoff rather than another situation with a more predictable payoff but possibly lower [[expected value|expected payoff]]. For example, a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a [[bank]] account with a low but guaranteed interest rate, rather than into a [[stock]] that may have high expected returns, but also involves a chance of losing value.

A person is given the choice between two scenarios, one with a guaranteed payoff and one without. In the guaranteed scenario, the person receives $50. In the uncertain scenario, a coin is flipped to decide whether the person receives $100 or nothing. The expected payoff for both scenarios is $50, meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble. However, individuals may have different '''risk attitudes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mr Lev Virine|author2=Mr Michael Trumper|title=ProjectThink: Why Good Managers Make Poor Project Choices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NCjAgAAQBAJ|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hillson|author2=Ruth Murray-Webster|title=Understanding and Managing Risk Attitude|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeMdki1LYEUC|year=2007|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-566-08798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adhikari|first= Binay K|last2= Agrawal|first2= Anup |title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?|journal=[[Journal of Corporate Finance]] |volume=38|year=2016|pages=272–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person is said to be:

* '''risk averse''' (or '''risk avoiding''') - if they would accept a certain payment ([[certainty equivalent]]) of less than $50 (for example, $40), rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing.
* '''[[risk neutral]]''' - if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain $50 payment.
* '''[[risk loving]]''' (or '''risk seeking''') - if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than $50 (for example, $60).

The average payoff of the gamble, known as its [[expected value]], is $50. The smallest dollar amount that the individual would accept instead of the bet is called the [[certainty equivalent]], and the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent is called the [[risk premium]]. For risk-averse individuals, it is positive, for risk-neutral persons it is zero, and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative.

==Utility of money==
In [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] theory, an agent has a utility function ''u''(''c'') where ''c'' represents the value that he might receive in money or goods (in the above example ''c'' could be $0 or $40 or $100).

The utility function ''u''(''c'') is defined only [[up to]] positive [[affine transformation]] – in other words, a constant could be added to the value of ''u''(''c'') for all ''c'', and/or ''u''(''c'') could be multiplied by a positive constant factor, without affecting the conclusions.

An agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is [[concave function|concave]].  For instance ''u''(0) could be 0, ''u''(100) might be 10, ''u''(40) might be 5, and for comparison ''u''(50) might be 6.

The expected utility of the above bet (with a 50% chance of receiving 100 and a 50% chance of receiving 0) is

:&lt;math&gt;E(u)=(u(0)+u(100))/2&lt;/math&gt;,

and if the person has the utility function with ''u''(0)=0, ''u''(40)=5, and ''u''(100)=10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5, which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40.  Hence the certainty equivalent is 40.

The risk premium is ($50 minus $40)=$10, or in proportional terms

:&lt;math&gt;(\$50-\$40)/\$40&lt;/math&gt;

or 25% (where $50 is the expected value of the risky bet: (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} 0 + \tfrac{1}{2} 100&lt;/math&gt;).  This risk premium means that the person would be willing to sacrifice as much as $10 in expected value in order to achieve perfect certainty about how much money will be received.  In other words, the person would be indifferent between the bet and a guarantee of $40, and would prefer anything over $40 to the bet.

In the case of a wealthier individual, the risk of losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility function would be likely to be almost linear, for instance if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4.0001 and u(50) might be 5.0001.

The utility function for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope implies that the person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is [[stochastic dominance#First-order stochastic dominance|first-order stochastically dominant]] over an alternative bet (that is, if the probability mass of the second bet is pushed to the right to form the first bet, then the first bet is preferred).  (ii) The concavity of the utility function implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is a [[mean-preserving spread|mean-preserving contraction]] of an alternative bet (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first bet is spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first bet is preferred).

==&lt;span id="Measures of risk aversion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Measures of risk aversion under expected utility theory==
There are multiple measures of the risk aversion expressed by a given utility function. Several functional forms often used for utility functions are expressed in terms of these measures.

===Absolute risk aversion===
The higher the curvature of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;, the higher the risk aversion. However, since expected utility functions are not uniquely defined (are defined only up to [[affine transformations]]), a measure that stays constant with respect to these transformations is needed. One such measure is the '''Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion''' (ARA), after the economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]],&lt;ref name="Arrow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arrow |first=K. J. |year=1965 |title=The Theory of Risk Aversion|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnNEAAAAIAAJ|chapter=Aspects of the Theory of Risk Bearing |publisher=Yrjo Jahnssonin Saatio |location=Helsinki }} Reprinted in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkMoAQAAMAAJ ''Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing''], Markham Publ. Co., Chicago, 1971, 90–109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J. W. |title=Risk Aversion in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=32 |issue=1–2 |year=1964 |pages=122–136 |jstor=1913738 |doi=10.2307/1913738}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''coefficient of absolute risk aversion''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u'(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u''(c)&lt;/math&gt; denote the first and second derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

The following expressions relate to this term:
* [[Exponential utility]] of the form &lt;math&gt;u(c)=1-e^{-\alpha c}&lt;/math&gt; is unique in exhibiting ''constant absolute risk aversion'' (CARA): &lt;math&gt;A(c)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is constant with respect to ''c''.
* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]] (HARA) is the most general class of utility functions that are usually used in practice (specifically, CRRA (constant relative risk aversion, see below), CARA (constant absolute risk aversion), and quadratic utility all exhibit HARA and are often used because of their mathematical tractability). A utility function exhibits HARA if its absolute risk aversion is a [[hyperbolic function]], namely

:&lt;math&gt; A(c) = -\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}=\frac{1}{ac+b}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this differential equation (omitting additive and multiplicative constant terms, which do not affect the behavior implied by the utility function) is:

:&lt;math&gt; u(c) = \frac{(c-c_s)^{1-R}}{1-R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R=1/a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c_s = -b/a &lt;/math&gt;.
Note that when &lt;math&gt; a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CARA, as &lt;math&gt; A(c) = 1/b = const &lt;/math&gt;, and when &lt;math&gt; b=0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CRRA (see below), as &lt;math&gt; c A(c) = 1/a = const &lt;/math&gt;.
See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/zender/Fin7330/1-RiskAversion.doc |title=Zender's lecture notes |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Decreasing/increasing absolute risk aversion'' (DARA/IARA) is present if &lt;math&gt;A(c)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing/increasing. Using the above definition of ARA, the following inequality holds for DARA:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial A(c)}{\partial c} = -\frac{u'(c)u'''(c) - [u''(c)]^2}{[u'(c)]^2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

and this can hold only if &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, DARA implies that the utility function is positively skewed; that is, &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Haim |last=Levy |year=2006 |title=Stochastic Dominance: Investment Decision Making under Uncertainty |location=New York |publisher=Springer |edition=Second |isbn=0-387-29302-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, IARA can be derived with the opposite directions of inequalities, which permits but does not require a negatively skewed utility function (&lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;). An example of a DARA utility function is &lt;math&gt;u(c)=\log(c)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; A(c)=1/c&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;u(c)=c-\alpha c^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A(c)=2 \alpha/(1-2 \alpha c)&lt;/math&gt; would represent a quadratic utility function exhibiting IARA.
*Experimental and empirical evidence is mostly consistent with decreasing absolute risk aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friend |first=Irwin |last2=Blume |first2=Marshall |year=1975 |title=The Demand for Risky Assets |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=900–922 |jstor=1806628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contrary to what several empirical studies have assumed, wealth is not a good proxy for risk aversion when studying risk sharing in a principal-agent setting. Although &lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt; is monotonic in wealth under either DARA or IARA and constant in wealth under CARA, tests of contractual risk sharing relying on wealth as a proxy for absolute risk aversion are usually not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellemare |first=Marc F. |first2=Zachary S. |last2=Brown |title=On the (Mis)Use of Wealth as a Proxy for Risk Aversion |journal=[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]] |year=2010 |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=273–282 |doi=10.1093/ajae/aap006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative risk aversion===
The '''Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion''' (RRA) or '''coefficient of relative risk aversion''' is defined as&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon, Carl and Lawrence Blume|title=Mathematics for Economists|publisher=Viva Norton|isbn=978-81-309-1600-2|pages=363|edition=Student}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(c) = cA(c)=\frac{-cu''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Like for absolute risk aversion, the corresponding terms ''constant relative risk aversion'' (CRRA) and ''decreasing/increasing relative risk aversion'' (DRRA/IRRA) are used. This measure has the advantage that it is still a valid measure of risk aversion, even if the utility function changes from risk averse to risk loving as ''c'' varies, i.e. utility is not strictly convex/concave over all ''c''.  A constant RRA implies a decreasing ARA, but the reverse is not always true.  As a specific example of constant relative risk aversion, the utility function &lt;math&gt;u(c) = \log(c)&lt;/math&gt; implies RRA = 1.

In [[intertemporal choice]] problems, the [[elasticity of intertemporal substitution]] often cannot be disentangled from the coefficient of relative risk aversion.  The [[isoelastic utility]] function
:&lt;math&gt;u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\rho}-1}{1-\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits constant relative risk aversion with &lt;math&gt;R(c) = \rho &lt;/math&gt; and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{u(c)} = 1/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\rho = 1,&lt;/math&gt; using [[l'Hôpital's rule]] shows that this simplifies to the case of ''log utility,'' ''u''(''c'') = log ''c'', and the [[income effect]] and [[substitution effect]] on saving exactly offset.

A time-varying relative risk aversion can be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benchimol |first=J. |year=2014 |title=Risk aversion in the Eurozone |journal=[[Research in Economics]] |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=39–56 |doi=10.1016/j.rie.2013.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications of increasing/decreasing absolute and relative risk aversion===

The most straightforward implications of increasing or decreasing absolute or relative risk aversion, and the ones that motivate a focus on these concepts, occur in the context of forming a portfolio with one risky asset and one risk-free asset.&lt;ref name="Arrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;  If the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''number of dollars'' of the risky asset held in the portfolio if ''absolute'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).  Thus economists avoid using utility functions such as the quadratic, which exhibit increasing absolute risk aversion, because they have an unrealistic behavioral implication.

Similarly, if the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''fraction'' of the portfolio held in the risky asset if ''relative'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).

In one [[economic model|model]] in [[monetary economics]], an increase in relative risk aversion increases the impact of  households' money holdings on the overall economy. In other words, the more the relative risk aversion increases, the more money demand shocks will impact the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Benchimol, J., Fourçans, A. (2012), [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jmacro/v34y2012i1p95-111.html Money and risk in a DSGE framework : A Bayesian application to the Eurozone], [[Journal of Macroeconomics]], vol. 34, pp. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portfolio theory===

In [[modern portfolio theory]], risk aversion is measured as the additional expected reward an investor requires to accept additional risk. Here risk is measured as the [[standard deviation]] of the return on investment, i.e. the [[square root]] of its [[variance]]. In advanced portfolio theory, different kinds of risk are taken into consideration. They are measured as the [[n-th root]] of the n-th [[central moment]]. The symbol used for risk aversion is A or A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sqrt[n]{\mu_n}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion==
The notion of using expected utility theory to analyze risk aversion has come under criticism from [[behavioral economics]]. [[Matthew Rabin]] has showed that a risk-averse, expected-utility-maximizing individual who,

''from any initial wealth level [...] turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50% probability [...] will turn down 50-50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of money.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabin |first=Matthew |year=2000 |title=Risk Aversion and Expected-Utility Theory: A Calibration Theorem |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1281–1292 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility. One solution to the problem observed by Rabin is that proposed by [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]], where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than to consider only the final wealth.

Another limitation is the reflection effect which demonstrates the reversing of risk aversion. This effect was first presented by [[Kahneman]] and [[Tversky]] as a part of the [[prospect theory]], in the [[behavioral economics]] domain.
The reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative prospects as opposed to positive prospects. According to this effect, people tend to avoid risks under the gain domain, and to seek risks under the loss domain. Meaning, no risk aversion is expected under the loss domain.&lt;ref name="j1914185"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk|journal=Econometrica|date=1979|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|jstor=1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the gain domain, most people prefer a certain gain of 3000, than a gain of 4000 with a risk of 80 percent. When posing the same problem under the loss domain - with negative values, most people prefer a loss of 4000 with 80 percent chance, over a certain loss of 3000.

The reflection effect (as well as the [[certainty effect]]) is inconsistent with the expected utility hypothesis. It is assumed that the psychological principle which stands behind this kind of behavior is the overweighting of certainty. Meaning, options which are perceived as certain, are over-weighted relative to uncertain options. This pattern is an indication of a risk seeking behavior in negative prospects and eliminates other explanations for the certainty effect such as aversion for uncertainty or variability.&lt;ref name="j1914185"/&gt;

The initial findings regarding the reflection effect faced criticism regarding its validity, as it was claimed that there are insufficient evidence to support the effect on the individual level. Subsequently, an extensive investigation revealed its possible limitations, suggesting that the effect is most prevalent when either small or large amounts and extreme probabilities are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hershey|first1=J. C.|last2=Schoemaker|first2=P.

==In the brain==
{{Main|Risk aversion (psychology)}}

Attitudes towards risk have attracted the interest of the field of [[neuroeconomics]] and [[behavioral economics]].  A 2009 study by Christopoulos et al. suggested that the activity of a specific brain area (right inferior frontal gyrus) correlates with risk aversion, with more risk averse participants (i.e. those having higher risk premia) also having higher responses to safer options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2009 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469–6472 |title= Neural Correlates of Value, Risk, and Risk Aversion Contributing to Decision Making under Risk. |vauthors=Christopoulos GI, Tobler PN, Bossaerts P, Dolan RJ, Schultz W |pmid= 16775134 |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result coincides with other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2006 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469–6472

==Public understanding and risk in social activities==
In the real world, many government agencies, e.g. [[Health and Safety Executive]], are fundamentally risk-averse in their mandate. This often means that they demand (with the power of legal enforcement) that risks be minimized, even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity.
It is important to consider the [[opportunity cost]] when mitigating a risk; the cost of not taking the risky action. Writing laws focused on the risk without the  balance of the utility may misrepresent society's goals. The public understanding of risk, which influences political decisions, is an area which has recently been recognised as deserving focus. In 2007 [[Cambridge University]] initiated the [[Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk]], a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder, [[David Spiegelhalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=CAM - the Cambridge Alumni Magazine |publisher=The University of Cambridge Development Office |volume=58 | date=2009|url=http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |page=3 |title=Don's Diary |first=David |last=Spiegelhalter |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309004415/http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's services such as [[school]]s and [[playground]]s have become the focus of much risk-averse planning, meaning that children are often prevented from benefiting from activities that they would otherwise have had. Many playgrounds have been fitted with impact-absorbing matting surfaces. However, these are only designed to save children from death in the case of direct falls on their heads and do not achieve their main goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No fear: Growing up in a Risk Averse society|first=Tim|last=Gill|year=2007|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|page=81|isbn=9781903080085|url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306114126/http://gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are expensive, meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways (such as building a playground closer to the child's home, reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it), and—some argue—children may attempt more dangerous acts, with confidence in the artificial surface. Shiela Sage, an early years school advisor, observes "Children who are only ever kept in very safe places, are not the ones who are able to solve problems for themselves. Children need to have a certain amount of risk taking ... so they'll know how to get out of situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Early Years - The Outdoor Environment |publisher=Teachers TV |date=10 January 2006 |url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/214 |people=Sue Durant, Sheila Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[MMR vaccine|vaccine]] to protect children against the three common diseases measles, mumps and rubella was developed and recommended for all children in several countries including the UK. However, a [[MMR vaccine controversy|controversy]] arose around fraudulent allegations that it caused autism. This alleged causal link was thoroughly disproved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2002 |volume=347 |issue=19 |pages=1477–82 |title= A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism |vauthors=Madsen KM, Hviid A, Vestergaard M |pmid=12421889 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa021134 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the doctor who made the claims was expelled from the [[General Medical Council]]. Even years after the claims were disproved, some parents wanted to avert the risk of causing autism in their own children. They chose to spend significant amounts of their own money on alternatives from private doctors. These alternatives carried their own risks which were not balanced fairly, most often that the children were not properly immunized against the more common diseases of measles, mumps and rubella.

While most people would accept that unproven risk to gain the benefit of improved communication, others remain so risk averse that they do not. (The [[COSMOS cohort study]] continues to study the actual risks of mobile phones.)

One experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the TV show [[Deal or No Deal]] finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory.

The English phrase '''''rule of thumb''''' refers to a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It refers to an easily learned and easily applied procedure or standard, based on practical experience rather than theory. This usage of the phrase can be traced back to the seventeenth century.

A modern [[folk etymology]] holds that the phrase derives from the maximum width of a stick allowed for [[wife-beating]] under [[English law]]; this belief may have originated in a rumored statement by the eighteenth-century judge [[Sir Francis Buller]] that a man may beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. The rumor produced numerous jokes and satirical cartoons at Buller's expense; however, there is no record that he made such a statement.

The English jurist [[William Blackstone]] wrote in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' of an "old law" that once allowed "moderate" beatings by husbands, but did not mention thumbs or any specific implements. While wife beating has been officially outlawed for centuries in England and the United States, it continued in practice; several nineteenth-century American court rulings referred to an "ancient doctrine" that the judges believed had allowed husbands to physically punish their wives using implements no thicker than their thumbs.

The exact phrase ''rule of thumb'' first became associated with domestic abuse in the 1970s, after which the spurious legal definition was cited as factual in a number of law journals, and the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] published a report on domestic abuse titled "Under the Rule of Thumb" in 1982.

== Origin and usage ==

In English, ''rule of thumb'' refers to an approximate method for doing something, based on practical experience rather than theory.{{refn|name=OED}}{{refn|name=Wordsworth}}{{refn|name=Clapp}} The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain.{{refn|name=Martin}} Its earliest (1685) appearance in print comes from a posthumously published collection of sermons by Scottish preacher James Durham: "Many profest Christians are like to foolish builders, who build by guess, and by rule of thumb (as we use to speak), and not by Square and Rule".{{refn|name=OED}}{{refn|name=O'Conner}}

The phrase is also found in Sir William Hope's ''The Compleat Fencing Master'', 1692: "What he doth, he doth by rule of Thumb, and not by Art".{{refn|name=Safire}} James Kelly's ''The Complete Collection of Scottish Proverbs'', 1721, includes: "No Rule so good as Rule of Thumb, if it hit",{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=James Kelly}} meaning a practical approximation.{{refn|name=Safire}}

Historically, the width of the thumb, or "thumb's breadth", was used as the equivalent of an [[inch]] in the cloth trade; similar expressions existed in Latin and French as well.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} The thumb has also been used in [[brewing]] beer, to gauge the heat of the brewing vat.{{refn|name=Wordsworth}} [[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]] writes that ''rule of thumb'' means a "rough measurement". He says that "Ladies often measure [[yard]] lengths by their thumb. Indeed, the expression 'sixteen nails make a yard' seems to point to the thumb-nail as a standard" and that "Countrymen always measure by their thumb".{{refn|name=Brewer}} According to ''Phrasefinder'', "The phrase joins [[the whole nine yards]] as one that probably derives from some form of measurement but which is unlikely ever to be definitively pinned down".{{refn|name=Martin}}

== Folk etymology ==

[[File:Judge Thumb, or - patent sticks for family correction- warranted lawful! LCCN95508959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of Sir Francis Buller in judges' robes and powdered wig, carrying bundles of rods whose ends resemble thumbs; in the background, a man with a rod raised over his head is about to strike a woman who is running away from him|Cartoon by [[James Gillray]] satirizing [[Sir Francis Buller]], 1782: "Judge Thumb; or, Patent Sticks for Family Correction: Warranted Lawful!"]]

A modern [[folk etymology]]{{refn|name=Safire}}{{refn|name=Brunvand}} relates the phrase to [[domestic violence]] via an alleged rule under [[English law]] that allowed for wife beating provided the implement used was a rod or stick no thicker than a man's thumb. While [[wife beating]] has been officially outlawed in England (and later, the United States) for centuries, enforcement of the law was inconsistent, and wife beating did continue. However, such a ''rule of thumb'' was never codified in law.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

The English jurist [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the late 1700s in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' that by an "old law", a husband was justified in using "moderate correction" against his wife, but was barred from inflicting serious violence. According to Blackstone, by the late 1600s this custom was in doubt, and a woman was by then allowed "security of the peace" against an abusive husband{{efn|one of Blackstone's sources, the jurist [[Sir Matthew Hale]], ruled in 1674 that a husband may admonish his wife and confine her to the house, but not beat her.{{refn|name=Clapp}}}} (Blackstone did not mention either thumbs or sticks).{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} Citing Blackstone, the twentieth-century legal scholar [[William L. Prosser]] wrote that there was "probably no truth to the legend" that a husband was allowed to beat his wife "with a stick no thicker than his thumb".{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

The association between the thumb and implements of domestic violence can be traced to the year 1782, when the English judge [[Sir Francis Buller]] was ridiculed for purportedly stating that a husband could beat his wife, provided he used a stick no wider than his thumb.{{efn|Whether Buller was supposed to have meant his own thumb or the husband's is unknown. One history states, "A witty countess is said to have sent the next day to require the measurements of his thumb, that she might know the extent of her husband's right".{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}}}} There is no record of Buller making such a statement; however, the rumor generated much satirical press, with Buller being mocked as "Judge Thumb" in published jokes and cartoons.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Foyster}}

In the following century, several court rulings in the United States referred to a supposed common-law doctrine that the judges believed had once allowed wife beating with an implement smaller than a thumb.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}} None of these courts referred to such a doctrine as a ''rule of thumb'' or endorsed such a rule. However, all allowed for some degree of wife beating so long as it did not result in serious injury.{{refn|name=Clapp}}

An 1824 court ruling in [[Mississippi]] stated that a man was entitled to enforce "domestic discipline" by striking his wife with a whip or stick no wider than the judge's thumb. In a later case in [[North Carolina]] (''State v. Rhodes'', 1868), the defendant was found to have struck his wife "with a switch about the size of this fingers"; the judge found the man not guilty due to the switch being smaller than a thumb.{{refn|name=Wilton}} The judgement was upheld by the state supreme court, although the later judge stated:

{{quote|Nor is it true that a husband has a right to whip his wife. And if he had, it is not easily seen how {{em|the thumb}} is the standard of size for the instrument which he may use, as some of the old authorities have said [...] The standard is the {{em|effect produced}}, and not the manner of producing it, or the instrument used.{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}}}

In 1873, also in North Carolina, the judge in ''State v. Oliver'' ruled, "We assume that the old doctrine that a husband had the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not the law in North Carolina".{{refn|name=Wilton}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}} These latter two cases were cited by the legal scholar [[Beirne Stedman]] when he wrote in a 1917 law review article that an "old common law rule" had permitted a husband to use "moderate personal chastisement on his wife" so long as he used "a switch no larger than his thumb".{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

By the late 19th century, most American states had outlawed wife beating; some had severe penalties such as [[forty lashes]] or imprisonment for offenders. There was a common belief in parts of the United States that a man was permitted to beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb; however, this belief was not connected with the phrase ''rule of thumb'' until the 1970s.{{refn|name=Wilton}}

In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged in the 1970s along with the resurgent [[feminist movement]].{{refn|name=Clapp}} The first recorded link between wife beating and the phrase ''rule of thumb'' appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women's-rights advocate [[Del Martin]]: {{quote|For instance, the common-law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband 'the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb'{{emdash}}a rule of thumb, so to speak.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}}}

While Martin appears to have meant the phrase ''rule of thumb'' only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}} The following year, a book on battered women stated: {{quote|One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the 'rule of thumb'. Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating [...] The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only 'a rod not thicker than his thumb.' In other words, wifebeating was legal.{{refn|name=Davidson}}}}

Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the "rule of thumb" was soon mentioned in a number of law journals.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] on domestic abuse titled "Under the Rule of Thumb", as well as a later United States Senate report on the [[Violence Against Women Act]].{{refn|name=Clapp}}

In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase ''rule of thumb'',{{refn|name=Kelly}} which was seen as [[taboo]] owing to this false origin.{{refn|name=Clapp}} [[Patricia T. O'Conner]], former editor of the ''New York Times Book Review'', described it as "one of the most persistent myths of political correctness".{{refn|name=O'Conner}} During the 1990s, several authors, including the conservative social critic [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], wrote about the false etymology of ''rule of thumb''.{{refn|name=Clapp}} Sommers analyzed the history of the phrase and its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}} Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.{{refn|name=Clapp}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="921">'''Schematic driven layout''' is the concept in [[integrated circuit layout]] or [[Printed circuit board| PCB]] layout where the [[Electronic design automation| EDA software]] links the schematic and layout databases. It was one of the first big steps forward in layout software from the days when editing tools were simply handling drawn polygons. 

== Features ==
Schematic-driven layout allows for several features that make the layout designer's job easier and faster. One of the most important is that changes to the circuit schematic are easily translated to the layout. Another is that the connections between components in the schematic are graphically displayed in the layout ensuring work is correct by construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11836">In [[mathematics]], a '''semigroup with two elements''' is a [[semigroup]] for which the [[cardinality]] of the [[underlying set]] is [[two]]. There are exactly five [[distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] [[isomorphic|nonisomorphic]] semigroups having two elements:
* O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[null semigroup]] of order two,
* LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[left zero semigroup]] of order two and [[right zero semigroup]] of order two, respectively,
* ({0,1}, ∧) (where "∧" is the [[logical connective]] "[[Logical conjunction|and]]"), or equivalently the set {0,1} under multiplication: the only [[semilattice]] with two elements and the only non-null semigroup with [[Null semigroup#Zero element in a semigroup|zero]] of order two, also a [[monoid]], and ultimately the [[two-element Boolean algebra]], 
* (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (where Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1} and "+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" is "addition modulo 2"), or equivalently the set {−1,1} under multiplication: the only [[group (mathematics)|group]] of order two. 
The semigroups LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[antiisomorphic]]. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|({0,1}, ∧)}} and {{nowrap|(Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[commutativity|commutative]], LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are noncommutative. LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{nowrap|({0,1}, ∧)}} are [[band (algebra)|band]]s and also [[inverse semigroup]]s.



==Determination of semigroups with two elements==
Choosing the set {{nowrap begin}}''A'' = { 1, 2 }{{nowrap end}} as the underlying set having two elements, sixteen [[binary operation]]s can be defined in ''A''. These operations are shown in the table below. In the table, a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the form
&lt;center&gt;

|&amp;nbsp; ''x''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; ''y''&amp;nbsp;

|&amp;nbsp; ''z''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; ''t''&amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
indicates a binary operation on ''A'' having the following [[Cayley table]].

&lt;/center&gt;

In this table:
*The semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) denotes the two-element semigroup containing the [[Null semigroup#Zero element in a semigroup|zero element]] 0 and the [[unit element]] 1.  The two binary operations defined by matrices in a green background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;). Every element is [[idempotent]] in this semigroup, so it is a [[Band (mathematics)|band]]. Furthermore, it is commutative (abelian) and thus a [[semilattice]]. The [[Semilattice#Connection_between_both_definitions|order induced]] is a [[linear order]], and so it is in fact a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] and it is also a [[Distributive lattice|distributive]] and [[complemented lattice]], i.e. it is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]].
*The two binary operations defined by matrices in a blue background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the [[null semigroup]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two elements.
*The  binary operation defined by the matrix in an orange background is associative and pairing it with ''A'' creates a semigroup. This is the [[Null semigroup#Left zero semigroup|left zero semigroup]] LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is not commutative.
*The binary operation defined by the matrix in a purple background is associative and pairing it with ''A'' creates a semigroup. This is the [[Null semigroup#Right zero semigroup|right zero semigroup]] RO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also not commutative.
*The two binary operations defined by matrices in a red background are associative and pairing either with ''A'' creates a semigroup isomorphic to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*The remaining eight [[binary operation]]s defined by matrices in a white background are not [[associative]] and hence none of them create a semigroup when paired with ''A''.

==The two-element semigroup ({0,1}, ∧)==
The [[Cayley table]] for the semigroup ({0,1}, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) is given below:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;
!&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;
!&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''0'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''1'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
This is the simplest non-trivial example of a semigroup that is not a group. This semigroup has an identity element, 1, making it a [[monoid]]. It is also commutative. It is not a group because the element 0 does not have an inverse, and is not even a cancellative semigroup because we cannot cancel the 0 in the equation 1·0 = 0·0.

This semigroup arises in various contexts. For instance, if we choose 1 to be the [[truth value]] "[[Truth|true]]" and 0 to be the [[truth value]] "[[False (logic)|false]]" and the operation to be the [[logical connective]] "[[Logical conjunction|and]]", we obtain this semigroup in [[logic]]. It is isomorphic to the monoid {0,1} under multiplication. It is also isomorphic to the semigroup
:&lt;math&gt; 
S = \left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 
\end{pmatrix}, 
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
under [[matrix multiplication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PlanetMath reference|id=8498|title=Semigroup with two elements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two-element semigroup (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)==
The [[Cayley table]] for the semigroup (Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given below:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!+&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
!&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;
!&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''0'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; '''1'''&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

This group is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Semigroups of order 3==
{{main|Semigroup with three elements}}
Let ''A'' be the three-element set {1, 2, 3}. Altogether, a total of 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 19683 different binary operations can be defined on ''A''. 113 of the 19683 binary operations determine 24 nonisomorphic semigroups, or 18 non-equivalent semigroups (with equivalence being isomorphism or anti-isomorphism).

A '''Standard Cost Coding System''' is a system of cost classification that can be used for benchmarking cost and quantities data.  In the Norwegian oil and gas industry, NORSOK Z-014 developed as part of the [[NORSOK]] standards. [[ISO]] is also developing a Standard Cost coding System as an extension of NORSOK Z-014 under ISO 19008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=John|last2=Khan|first2=Mesbah|last3=Partridge|first3=Chris|title=NORSOK Z-014: A 21st Century Update|url=https://www.academia.edu/19712829/NORSOK_Z-014_A_21st_Century_Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a Cost Classification system would be used to classify, activities, resources and product structure.  In NORSOK Z-014, these classification taxonomies are called Standard Activity Breakdown (SAB), Code of Resources (COR) and Physical Breakdown Structure (PBS).&lt;ref name="Ontolog Presenation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borosolutions.co.uk/solutions/content/files/C5%20-%20ONTOBRAS-2013%20-%20Tutorial%20-%20NORSOK%20SCCS.ppsx/view|title=2013-09 - Tutorial - ONTOBRAS2013 - Case Study 5 - Modernising NORSOK SCCS — boro group|website=www.borosolutions.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10804">The term '''Stoic categories''' refers to [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ideas regarding [[category of being|categories of being]]: the most fundamental classes of being for all things. The Stoics believed there were four categories (substance, quality, disposition, relative disposition) which were the ultimate divisions. Since we do not now possess even a single complete work by [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Cleanthes]] or [[Chrysippus]] what we do know must be pieced together from a number of sources: [[Doxography|doxographies]] and the works of other [[philosophers]] who discuss the Stoics for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The present information comes from [[Plotinus]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], with additional evidence from [[Plutarch|Plutarch of Chaeronea]] and [[Sextus Empiricus]]. According to both Plotinus and Simplicius there were four Stoic categories, to wit:

* [[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον [''hypokeímenon'' "underlying"])
** The primary matter, formless substance (''ousia'') which makes up things.
* [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν [''poión'' "like what"])
** The way in which matter is organized to form an individual object. In Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath) which informs the matter.
* "somehow disposed" (πὼς ἔχον [''pós échon''])
** Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture.
* "somehow disposed in relation to something" (πρός τί πως ἔχον [''prós tí pos échon''])
** Characteristics which are related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects.

A simple example of the Stoic categories in use is provided by Jacques Brunschwig:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a certain lump of matter, and thereby a substance, an existent something (and thus far that is all); I am a man, and this individual man that I am, and thereby qualified by a common quality and a peculiar one; I am sitting or standing, disposed in a certain way; I am the father of my children, the fellow citizen of my fellow citizens, disposed in a certain way in relation to something else.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Brunschwig (2003), ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'', ed. Brad Inwood, page 228, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
[[Stoicism]], like [[Aristotelianism]] is derived from [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Socrates|Socratic]] traditions.  The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) — though not all things (τινά) — are [[Matter|corporeal]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] bodies and [[Abstract object|abstract]] ones, but rejected [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teaching that purely [[incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras|Anaxagoras']] idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

In addition, the Stoics differed from Aristotle in their sharp distinction between concrete and abstract terms. Technically speaking all four Stoic categories are of concrete bodies. For Aristotle ''white, whiteness, heat'', and ''hot'' were qualities. For the Stoics, however, quality refers to ''white'', but not ''whiteness; hot'', but not ''heat.'' Furthermore, they believed that there are concrete bodies with no corresponding abstraction, something that makes no sense in Aristotelian terms.

It was apparent that the mere distinction between concrete substance and concrete quality was not a sufficient basis for [[logic]]. [[Socrates]] in the [[Hippias Major]] had pointed out problems in Anaxagoras' approach, explaining all attributes through their presence in a body in the way one body may be contained in another. In that [[dialog]], Hippias tried to explain [[beauty]] to Socrates. Socrates finds fault with his explanations, that beauty is a beautiful maiden, that beauty is gold, that beauty is health, wealth and a long life.

Aristotle solved the problem in proposing that accidental attributes are non-substantial beings that [[Inherence|inhere]] in substances. He defines this presence saying ''"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject."'' (''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'' 1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 24–26)

Such incorporeal presence caused problems to the Stoics in saying that the [[Ousia|οὐσία]] of a thing is its [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]. It is easy to understand the problem. If there is an insubstantial being, ''in Athens'' somehow present in Socrates, causing him to be substantially present in Athens we seem to be faced with an infinite regression, for there would seem to be an insubstantial Socrates in the insubstantial Athens in Socrates, in Athens, etc. Ultimately, who is to say who is the real Socrates and what is the real Athens? Similar arguments can be made of Aristotle's other categories. Was there an insubstantial ''running'' in [[Archimedes]] causing him to run naked through the streets of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], shouting out his immortal "''[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]''"? Was there an insubstantial fist in Athena causing her to strike Aphrodite as the [[Iliad]] recounts?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once Hera spoke, Athena dashed off in pursuit,&lt;br /&gt;
delighted in her heart. Charging Aphrodite, &lt;br /&gt;
she struck her in the chest with her powerful fist.[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/homer/iliad21.htm] 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was the effort to solve the problems raised by the [[Platonists]] and [[Peripatetics]] that led the Stoics to develop their categories, ''somehow disposed'' and ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' The fact that Stoicism, rather than either Platonism or Aristotelianism became the prominent philosophy of the ancient world is due in part to the approach they took to the problem.

According to [[Stephen Menn]] the first two categories, substance and quality, were recognized by [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]. The fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' seems to have been developed by the time of [[Aristo of Chios|Aristo]]. The third category, ''somehow disposed'' is first seen in [[Chrysippus]].

The need for relative terms, seen in the fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' is more obvious than the need for the third category ''somehow disposed'' and so it seems to have arisen first.

Aristotle had used relative terms in a somewhat general way. ''"Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something else or related to something else, are explained by reference to that other thing."'' (''The Categories'' 6&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 37–38) Thus he says that ''knowledge'' and ''the thing known'' are relatives. One can certainly consider knowledge as something properly existing in its subject. Aristotle himself recognized a much different kind of relationship. ''"In respect of relation there is no proper change; for, without changing, a thing will be now greater and now less or equal, if that with which it is compared has changed in quantity."'' ([http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.14.xiv.html#95 ''Metaphysics'' 1088&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 33–35]) In the first case, a relative term can be said to be something ''in'' its subject. In the second case, it can not. Thus, the need for ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' to explain how one thing can be relative to another without the presence of anything corporeal in a subject.

According to Stephen Menn, the third category, ''somehow disposed'' probably was recognized first in relation to the virtues. According to Socrates, virtue was a sort of knowledge. The wise man will act virtuously, since he will see it as the right thing to do. But the ignorant man can not avoid vice. The Stoic position held that a sage will possess all the virtues in their fullness. Aristo had argued that there is really only one virtue differentiated as ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' This seemed to be too much like the [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarian]] position. Chrysippus thus came to see the virtues as distinct bodies, inseparable from each other ''somehow disposed'' in themselves and not in relation to something. Thus the need for the third category.

==Neoplatonic critique==
Plotinus criticized both Aristotle's Categories and those of the Stoics. His student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] however defended Aristotle's scheme. He justified this by arguing that they be interpreted strictly as expressions, rather than as metaphysical realities. The approach can be justified, at least in part, by Aristotle's own words in ''The Categories.'' [[Boethius]]' acceptance of Porphyry's interpretation led to their being accepted by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy.

The Stoic scheme did not fare as well. Plotinus wrote...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Besides, if they make life and soul no more than this "pneuma,"
what is the import of that repeated qualification of theirs "in a
certain state," their refuge when they are compelled to recognize some
acting principle apart from body? If not every pneuma is a soul, but
thousands of them soulless, and only the pneuma in this "certain
state" is soul, what follows? Either this "certain state," this
shaping or configuration of things, is a real being or it is nothing.

If it is nothing, only the pneuma exists, the "certain state"
being no more than a word; this leads imperatively to the assertion
that Matter alone exists, Soul and God mere words, the lowest alone
is.

If on the contrary this "configuration" is really existent-
something distinct from the underlie or Matter, something residing
in Matter but itself immaterial as not constructed out of Matter, then
it must be a Reason-Principle, incorporeal, a separate Nature.[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/plotinus]

A ''''''sustainable''' habitat''' is an [[ecosystem]] that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced.  Thus the habitat can continue into future tie without external infusions of resource. Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[habitat]] that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature, if it is to be successful. Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms, physical resources and functions. Organisms from many different [[biome]]s can be brought together to fulfill various ''ecological niches''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The term often refers to sustainable [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s, which typically involve some form of [[green building]] or [[environmental planning]].

==Overview==
In creating the sustainable habitats, [[environmental scientist]]s, designers, engineers and [[architecture|architects]] must consider no element as a [[waste]] product to be disposed of somewhere off site, but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on. Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing [[pollution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Suyat''' is the modern collective name of the indigenous scripts of various ethno-linguistic groups in the [[Philippines]] prior to [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization in the 16th century]] up to the independence era in the 21st century. The scripts are highly varied; nonetheless, the term was used by cultural organizations in the Philippines to denote a unified neutral terminology for Philippine indigenous scripts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/985669/protect-all-ph-writing-systems-heritage-advocates-urge-congress|title=Protect all PH writing systems, heritage advocates urge Congress|first=Tonette|last=Orejas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suyat includes the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], the [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] script of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, the [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] script of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, the [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] script of the [[Tagbanwa people]], the [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] script of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]], the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano language|Ilokano people]], and many other indigenous scripts in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"/&gt;

In 1999, four suyat scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)''. The four scripts, [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]], [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]], [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]], were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as the only existing suyat scripts still used by certain Philippine communities in their daily lives. [[UNESCO]] also recognized that the four scripts, along with thirteen other suyat scripts, have existed within the Philippine archipelago since the 10th century AD. The ''ambahan'' poetry made with the [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo script]] was also cited. The inscription of the four suyat scripts was the first documentary heritage of the Philippines to be inscribed in the Memory of the World Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of [[suyat]] scripts have also established various [[calligraphy]] techniques and styles in the Philippines. Each suyat script has its own suyat calligraphy, although all suyat calligraphy are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy for the sake of nationalism. Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy, however, are not considered as Filipino suyat calligraphy as the alphabets used did not develop indigenously. The variety of [[suyat]] scripts is due to four main factors: the alignment of the archipelagic culture with the [[Indosphere]]; the alignment of the archipelagic culture with the [[Sinosphere]]; the alignment of the archipelagic culture with both [[Indosphere]] and [[Sinosphere]]; and non-alignment of archipelagic culture to both [[Indosphere]] and [[Sinosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrxOs-33aM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"/&gt;

[[File:Inskripsyon sa Binatbat na Tanso ng Laguna.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The actual image of the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] found in Lumbang River, the oldest known artifact to have a [[suyat]] writing on it.]]
The ''"National Script Act"'' has been in Congress since 2011. The bill aims to revive the usage of all known indigenous scripts in the Philippines. The bill also mandates that each community should teach the script respective to the area's ethnic peoples. The bill does not mandate the government to teach a single specific suyat script for all citizens, as that would demean the other suyat scripts of various ethnic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;http://ical13.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Full_papers_and_ppts/July_21/P4-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to lack of congressional and senatorial sessions and support, the bill did not pass into law in the 16th Congress. It was refiled again in 2016 under the 17th Congress.

'''''The Camp of the Saints''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Camp des Saints}}) is a 1973 French novel by author and explorer [[Jean Raspail]].

== Inspiration ==
Raspail has said his inspiration came while at the French Riviera in 1971, as he was looking out at the Mediterranean.

{{Quote|What if ''they'' were to come? I did not know who "they" were, but it seemed inevitable to me that the numberless disinherited people of the South would, like a tidal wave, set sail one day for this opulent shore, our fortunate country’s wide-gaping frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Camp des Saints (Édition 2011)|last=Raspail|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1881780076|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name of the book comes from a passage in the [[Book of Revelation]] (Revelation 20:7–9) depicting the [[apocalypse]]. Satan influences most of the nations of the Earth to gather for one final battle against "the camp of the saints," before being defeated for eternity:

{{Quote|And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.20.esv|title=Revelation 20, English Standard Version (ESV) {{!}} Chapter 20 {{!}} The Bible App {{!}} Bible.com|website=www.bible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot ==
{{Long plot|section|date=February 2018}}

In [[Kolkata|Calcutta, India]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests promote the adoption of Indian children by those back in [[Belgium]] as a form of charity. When the Belgian government realizes that the number of Indian children raised in Belgium has reached 40,000 in just five years, an emergency policy attempts to halt the migration. Desperate for the chance to send their children to what they call a "land of plenty", a mob of desperate Indians swarms the [[consulate]]. As a Belgian aid worker works through the crowd, an Indian [[gong farmer]] begs him to take them back to Europe, to which the worker agrees.

The worker and farmer bring the crowd to the docks, where there are hundreds of ships once owned by European powers, now suited only for river traffic. Nevertheless, the crowd boards, and a hundred ships soon leave for Europe; conditions on board are cramped, unsanitary and miserable, with some passengers publicly fornicating. As the ships pass "the straits of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]", helicopters swarm overhead, capturing images of the refugees on board to be published in Europe. Meanwhile, on the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] Far East, the Soviet troops see masses of Chinese ready to enter [[Siberia]] but are reluctant to fight them.

As the fleet crosses the Indian Ocean, the political situation in France becomes more charged. At a press conference about the crisis, a French official who offers a speech in praise of the refugees is confronted by a journalist who claims he is merely trying to "feed the invaders" and demands to know if France will "have the courage to stand up to" the migrants when they reach France. The official decries this question as morally offensive and threatens to throw the journalist out when he continues to yell. Other journalists seek to inflame tensions between the French and Africans and Arabs already living in the country. Over time, these journalists begin to write that the migrant fleet is on a mission to "enrich, cleanse and redeem the Capitalist West". At the same time as the fleet is praised by those in Paris, the people of [[Southern France]], terrified of the migrants' arrival, flee to the north.

As the fleet approaches the [[Suez Canal]], [[Egypt|Egyptian]] forces fire a warning shot, causing the fleet to steer south, around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. To the surprise of observers, the [[apartheid]] regime of [[South Africa]] floats out barges of food and supplies, which the migrants throw overboard. The international press is thrilled, believing the rejection of these supplies to be a political statement against the apartheid South African regime. Western leaders, confident the refugees will accept supplies from their "more virtuous" nations, organize a supply mission, funded by governments, charities, rock stars and major churches, to meet the refugees off [[São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé]]. However, the fleet does not stop for these barges either, and when a worker from the [[Pope|Papal]] barge attempts to board one of the ships, he is strangled and thrown overboard. The press attempts to contain coverage of the disaster.

When the migrants pass through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[President of France|French president]] orders troops to the south and addresses the nation of his plan to repel the migrants. However, in the middle of the address, he breaks down, demands the troops simply follow their consciences instead. Most of the troops immediately desert their posts and join the civilians as they flee north, and the south is quickly overrun by the migrants. Some of the last troops to stand their ground take refuge in a small village, along with Calguès, an old man who has chosen to remain at his home, and Hamadura, a [[Westernization|Westernized]] Indian who is terrified of his "filthy, brutish" countrymen and prides himself on having more in common with whites than Indians. The troops in this village, total of nineteen Frenchmen and one Indian, surrounded by what they deem "occupied territory", remains the last defense of Western values and "Free France" against the immigrants.

The migrants make their way north, having no desire to assimilate to French culture, but continuing to demand a First World standard of living, even as they flout laws, do not produce, and murder French citizens, such as factory bosses and shopkeepers, as well as the ordinary people who do not welcome them. They are also joined by the immigrants who already reside in Europe, as well as various left-wing and anarchist groups. Across the West, more and more migrants arrive and have children, rapidly growing to outnumber whites. In a matter of months, the white West has been overrun and the pro-immigrant governments are established, while the white people are ordered to share their houses and flats with the immigrants. The village containing the troops is bombed flat by airplanes of the new French government, referred to only as the "Paris Multiracial Commune". Within a few years, most Western governments have surrendered. The mayor of [[New York City]] is made to share [[Gracie Mansion]] with three [[African-American]] families from [[Harlem]], migrants gather at coastal ports in West Africa and South Asia and swarm into [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], London is taken over by an organization of non-white residents known as the "Non-European Commonwealth Committee" which force the [[Elizabeth II|British queen]] to have her son marry a [[Pakistan]]i woman, millions of [[black Africans]] from around the continent gather at the [[Limpopo River]] and invade [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], and only one drunken [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldier stands in the way of hundreds of thousands of Chinese peasants as they overrun Siberia.

The epilogue reveals that the story was written in the last holdout of the Western world, [[Switzerland]], but international pressure from the new governments, isolating it as a [[rogue state]] for not opening its borders, and the internal pro-migrant elements, force it to capitulate as well. Mere hours from the border opening, the author dedicates the book to his grandchildren, in the hopes they will grow up in a world where they will not be ashamed of him for writing such a book.

In 2001, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] described it as "widely revered by American white supremacists and is a sort of anti-immigration analog to ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'',"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/racist-book-camp-saints-gains-popularity Racist Book, Camp of the Saints, Gains in Popularity], ''[[Intelligence Report]]'', March 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2015, condemned the novel as "the favorite racist fantasy of the anti-immigrant movement in the US."&lt;ref name="splc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=172|title=Intelligence Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Lenz of the SPLC notes that "[t]he premise of ''Camp of the Saints'' plays directly into that idea of white genocide. It is the idea that through immigration, if it's left unchecked, the racial character and content of a culture can be undermined to the point of oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/146925/notorious-book-ties-right-far-right|title=The Notorious Book that Ties the Right to the Far Right|last=Jones|first=Sarah|date=|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Lionel Shriver]] described the novel as "both prescient and appalling," certainly "racist" but "written with tremendous verbal energy and passion." Shriver writes that the book "gives bilious voice to an emotion whose expression is increasingly taboo in the West, but that can grow only more virulent when suppressed: the fierce resentment felt by majority populations when that status seems threatened."&lt;ref name="shriver"&gt;[[Lionel Shriver]]: [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/190781 "Population doomsday"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 10 June 2002, retrieved 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] praised the book in 2004 as "a great novel" that raised questions on how to respond to massive illegal immigration,&lt;ref name="nro"&gt;Buckley, Jr., William F. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070430112736/http://www.nationalreview.com/script/printpage.p?ref=%2Fbuckley%2Fwfb200407231332.asp No Irish Need Apply]." ''National Review Online''. July 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014, [[Mackubin Thomas Owens]] noted Buckley's praise of it, while remarking that "Raspail was ahead of his time in demonstrating that Western civilization had lost its sense of purpose and history—its 'exceptionalism'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/380211/camp-saints-2014-style-mackubin-thomas-owens|title=Camp of the Saints, 2014 Style? - National Review|date=13 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the conservative [[Chilton Williamson]] praised the book as "one of the most uncompromising works of literary reaction in the 20th century."&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williamson | first = Chilton | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Conservative Bookshelf: Essential Works That Impact Today's Conservative Thinkers | publisher = Citadel Press | year = 2005 | location =  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RIq6-S9cfMQC&amp;pg=PA279 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8065-2691-2 | page = 279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13216">The traditional '''[[potlatch]] among Athabaskan peoples''' was a gathering that combined aspects of competition, peacekeeping and a show of wealth.&lt;ref name="Laurence A. Goldin 1996"&gt;Laurence A. Goldin, ''The Land is Ours'', 1996, Auroroa Films&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The traditional [[Athabaskan]] potlatch had "social, religious and economic significance."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;William Simeone, ''A History of Alaskan Athapaskans'', 1982, Alaska Historical Commission&lt;/ref&gt; It was a gathering that combined aspects of competition, peacekeeping and a show of wealth.&lt;ref name="Laurence A. Goldin 1996"/&gt; During a potlatch, members of the society with a surplus of food and supplies provide these for all members of a [[clan]], and in situations with other clans this sharing of resources is either a competitive showing or one of creating loyalties, and sometimes both simultaneously.

Traditionally the village was centered on the chiefs' house, and this is where potlatches were held. This was because the chief had the biggest cache where the food was stored.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;A.E. Stephan, ''The First Athabascans of Alaska:Strawberries'', 1996, Dorrance Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8059-3883-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many different reasons to hold a potlatch in Athabaskan culture, including the birth of a child, a surplus of food, or a death in the clan. The most elaborate of Athabaskan potlatches was the mortuary or funeral potlatch.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This marked "the separation of the deceased from society and is the last public expression of grief." &lt;ref name="rifles"&gt;William Simeone, ''Rifles, Blankets, and Beads'', 1995, University of Oklahoma Press, {{ISBN|0-8061-2713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were slight variations in the funeral and mortuary potlatches depending on the status or role of the member of the clan who had died. Different songs and dances were performed for a warrior than for an elder. Because of the tight-knit manner of a group or clan, usually due to extended family ties,&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; the death of an elder, in particular, had a very large effect on the tribe. The [[cadaver|corpse]] would first be dressed by the women of the clan and be  prepared, while the mobilizing and putting together of the funeral would be taken care of by the closest male relative of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, Identity 183&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations would differ but the proceedings of the funerals themselves were generally similar.

The potlatch generally consisted of "the feast, dancing &amp; singing, oratory, and the distribution of gifts".&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, Identity 210&lt;/ref&gt; The feast was provided by a wealthier member of the group to communicate "sentiment, affection, familiarity and goodwill."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Dancing and singing were a reciprocation of the guests to the hosts for their generosity. Stories were told in the same manner, and for entertainment. The act of giving out gifts was possibly the most dynamic aspect of the traditional Athabaskan potlatch. This was a generous act of sharing one's wealth with the rest of the tribe, and simultaneously a show of the abundance and superiority of the host.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Modern potlatches still contain many of the traditional aspects of sharing food, giving gifts, singing, dancing and telling stories, but now the purpose has changed. Most modern potlatches can be held for similar reasons, such as a birth or a death, but now they are no longer so much a show of wealth, but a celebration to keep the tradition alive.

==Food==
As with other aspects of the potlatch, food plays a significant role in the social structure; providing large amounts of food for the guests is symbolic of the host's love and care for his guests, and also for the nourishment he symbolically provides to future generations.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Due to the overabundance of food, leftovers are distributed first to elders, then the remainder of the guests. According to Simeone, doing so is "a reminder of the host's generosity long after the event."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

=== Preparation ===
As the potlatch is attended by dozens to hundreds of people from neighboring villages, and is often hosted by one or two people, food and money are given as a gift to the host by family members, to help offset the cost of feeding so many.&lt;ref name="crow" &gt;Thomas Mishler, ''Crow is my Boss: the oral history of a Tanacross Athabaskan elder'', University of Oklahoma Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several men of the village are tasked with hunting moose specifically for a potlatch; it is not uncommon for three or more moose to be killed to feed the guests over the two or three days feasting. One account of a potlatch in the village of [[Tetlin, Alaska|Tetlin]] claimed 22 moose were killed and butchered in preparation of a particularly large feast.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; In addition to moose meat, many other types of wild food are harvested or donated, such as beaver, duck, salmon, and berries. Traditional [[subsistence]] foods provide a reminder of the relationship between the Athabaskan and the land which has historically sustained them.

=== Meals ===
Breakfast and lunch are served each day for potlatch attendees and are less formal than the evening meal. Breakfast is offered each morning; eggs, bacon, coffee, and potatoes are common fare. Lunch consists of soup, sandwiches, and tea.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; The evening meal is scheduled for a specific time and all potlatch attendees are expected to attend. It is the most significant spiritual and social event of the potlatch and is treated as such by the attendees. Large rolls of white butcher paper are rolled out on the floor to serve as place settings and many participants sit next to each other on the floor. Benches and chairs are provided for elders.

=== Types ===
Moose is normally cooked by the men of the potlatch. It is served roasted, fried, and as moose head stew, which consists of the meaty portions of the moose's head mixed with vegetables and rice in large stew pots. Grilled and smoked salmon is served, as is soup made from [[round whitefish]]. Wild cranberries and blueberries are incorporated into desserts.

The traditional wild food is supplemented by store-bought items, most notably black loose leaf tea, which was introduced to the Athabaskan by traders in the 1800s&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; and remains a staple among present day potlatches. [[Bannock (food)|Bannock]], also known as [[fry bread]], rolls, and salads are also served.

==Dance==
The celebration of dance for the Athabaskan people plays a vital role in the success of a potlatch.  Unlike many cultures that have changed their [[mourning]] over the course of many generations, the Athabaskan people have stayed strong and true to the old ways of song and dance.

Dancing is a very important part of Athabaskan culture, and it is often the focal point of the potlatch, particularly after the evening meal. During potlatches a variety of songs are sung; the first songs sung of the weeklong event are called the mourning songs.  Traditionally new songs are song first to give thanks to the hosts that are sponsoring the potlatch, followed by the singing of old songs.

[[Poldine Carlo]], an Athabaskan from Interior Alaska, noted that "The potlatch usually lasted for a week. The first night we would have a big potlatch at the community hall and then the mourning songs were sung, the new songs first for the ones the potlatch was being given for and then the old, old songs that we have been singing for a long time. The women would stand in line all across the hall and dance."&lt;ref name=nulato&gt;Poldine Carlo, ''Nulato: An Indian Life on the Yukon,'' Fairbanks, Alaska, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the book ''Rifles, Blankets, &amp; Beads'' tells of "sorry songs" that were sung at a potlatch that took place in [[Tanacross, Alaska|Tanacross]]:  "At one potlatch in Tonacross, for example, a sequence of sorry songs began with one made especially for the person that had just died.  It followed by songs for a young man who died in a house fire 10 years before; a boy who drowned in the river while attempting to draw water and for Elisha's father, who died in the 1960s."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;file:///home/chronos/u-15985fe980d04ec3ec881e482cd33c8a6e32a755/Downloads/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The grieving process within the Alaskan Native community is rather unusual, it is shared not just by the family but by both local and neighboring communities.  If one member of the family of the deceased does not show up or is late, this is considered to be such a great insult that tribal chiefs have been known to interrupt potlatches in order to publicly shame those who have arrived late or have not communicated with the rest of the community concerning their loss.  Grieving is expected to be shared, and thus the burden of grief is lifted from the individual to the group.

Dance is the outlet that allows potlatch attendees to vent their grief; "sorry songs" give way to "happy songs" and dances, such as the calico dance, where colorful bolts of cloth are passed among female participants, who dance in a large circle.  Such dances serve to restore harmony among the relationships within the tribe.

==Gifts==
A traditional Athabaskan potlatch is concluded with the giving of gifts.  Valuable trade items, traditionally [[Dentalium (anthropology)|dentalium]] shells, now largely replaced by rifles, [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|blankets]], cash, and beaded items, are collected by the host from members of their mother's [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moiety]] and are redistributed by the host to members of his father's moiety in exchange for their contributions of celebration and participation in the potlatch.  For instance, an exceptional dancer might be rewarded for her abilities, and likewise a grave digger or pallbearer would be compensated at a funeral potlatch.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

At the conclusion of a potlatch, gifts are piled high in the center of the meeting hall and distributed to guests.  By distributing guns and blankets to the assembled guests, the host demonstrates his relationship to and his feelings for his paternal relatives and potential marriage partners. Through these distributions the host gains prestige as he symbolically ensures his guests' existence by giving them guns to hunt with and blankets to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Beaded items are also commonly given as gifts at potlatches, including necklaces, [[moccasins]], gloves, vests, and gun cases.  Beads, like the dentalium they have come to replace, are symbolic of social relations that, when expressed in the form of necklaces or sashes, literally surround or embrace the individual. Today Tanacross people see dentalium shells not only as symbols of prestige but also as expressions of affection.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

While rifles, blankets and beaded items are traditional potlatch gifts, they are not the only ones.  Other gifts might include furs, afghans, quilts, moose hide jackets, calico, snowshoes, gloves, hats, coffeepots, enameled plates, snow shovels, suitcases, frying pans and many others both practical and symbolic.&lt;ref name="villagers"&gt;Claire Fejes, ''Villagers: Athabaskan Indian Life Along the Yukon River,'' Random House, 1981, {{ISBN|0-394-51673-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dentalium shells and moose hide jackets are often worn by the host while distributing gifts.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt; In some communities, gifts are given out while wearing gloves.  If the gloves are kept, it is believed that the wealth will be stored in them, and eventually return to the giver.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Often a potlatch host will fully deplete their savings and give away their entire material wealth.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt; The potlatch is an honorable ceremony, and in giving everything away, the host gains prestige.  A rich man who does not share his possessions is, to an Athabaskan, a stingy man who is to be pitied.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt;

The '''Tiger Mask donation phenomenon''' is a series of [[donation]]s of ''[[randoseru]]'' (school backpacks) and other items to [[orphanage]]s around [[Japan]]. The first donation happened when someone left ten 30,000-yen backpacks at a child guidance center in [[Gunma Prefecture]] on [[Christmas Day]] in 2010. A note attached to the bags was signed "Naoto Date", the real name of the titular character of ''[[Tiger Mask]]'', a popular 1960s and 70s [[manga]] about a [[wrestler]] who fought for orphans, being raised in an orphanage himself. Since the initial donation, copycat donations have appeared around Japan at various facilities for children, ranging from more backpacks to toys, food, and monetary gifts.

==Naoto Date/Tiger Mask background==
{{Main|Tiger Mask}}

Many of the donations have been made under the name of Naoto Date, a character in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Tiger Mask]]''. In the manga and anime, Tiger Mask (whose real name was Naoto Date) was a feared [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]] wrestler in America who was extremely vicious in the ring. However, he became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] after returning to Japan when a young boy said that he wanted to be a villain like Tiger Mask when he grew up. The boy lived in an orphanage, the same one that Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler and fights for the children in the orphanage.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-12-27/manga/anime-hero-leaves-gifts-on-christmas-morning |title = Interest: Manga/Anime Hero Leaves Gifts on Christmas Morning |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2010-12-27 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-06/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-another-gift-giver |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires Another Gift-Giver |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-06 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN3rdarticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-08/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-3-more-gift-givers |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires 4 More Gift-Givers (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-08 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN4tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-09/tiger-mask-manga/anime-inspires-7th-8th-donor |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Manga/Anime Inspires 7th, 8th Donor (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-09 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-10/tiger-mask-donors-strike-again-in-8-more-cities |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Donors Strike Again in 8 More Cities |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-10 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-11/100-tiger-mask-donors-now-reported-all-over-japan |title = Interest: 100 Tiger Mask Donors Now Reported All Over Japan |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/11/gifts-from-comic-heroes-help-japans-orphans/?hpt=Sbin |title = Gifts from 'comic heroes' help Japan's orphans |publisher = [[CNN]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations==

===First donation===
On 25 December 2010, in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a child guidance center was visited by someone leaving ten 30,000-yen (about US$360) backpacks: five black backpacks wrapped with blue ribbons, and five red backpacks wrapped with pink ribbons. A card attached to the bags simply said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Please use these backpacks for the children.

''(signed)'' Naoto Date &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The backpacks were to be distributed between six orphans from six different orphanages in Gunma.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===Second donation===
A second donation was found by a security guard at the [[Odawara]] Child Guidance Center in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] on 1 January 2011. Six backpacks, three black and three red, were left. A note left behind stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A New Year's gift&amp;nbsp;— Naoto Date
&lt;br&gt;
The donation of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking I might do something as well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the ten original backpacks in Gunma, they were left with a note signed by Naoto Date. The backpacks were to be distributed to new arrivals at the local orphanages and other children that Odawara Child Guidance center serves.&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"/&gt;

===Copycat donations===
Japan has around 580 children's centers that house around 30,000 children.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;

As of January 11, 2011, over 100 donations inspired by Tiger Mask have been reported across Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt; After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks. Some have also received toys, food, and money to help pay for new backpacks. In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also crept into the donation phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami===
Sometime during the night of March 17 - morning of March 18, three cars parked at an evacuation center in [[Yamada, Iwate|Yamadamachi]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] had their tanks filled up and two 20-liter containers of [[heating oil]] were left outside the center by an unknown person. An evacuee discovered the donation upon starting his car and noticing his fuel gauge go from nearly empty to full. The evacuee noted: "We had hardly any fuel left. We were in a real pinch. I'm so grateful for the donation. I reckon it was Tiger Mask." The evacuation center noted that they would use the heating oil during the night to conserve fuel due to [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the ongoing crisis]].&lt;ref name="TMTōhoku"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110322002426.htm |title = 'Tiger Mask' donates gas, oil for evacuees |publisher = [[The Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date = Mar 23, 2011 |accessdate = Mar 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other child welfare offices and agencies have reported increased, anonymous donations in the aftermath of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "March 11 catastrophe spurs return of mysterious 'Tiger Mast' philanthropic movement", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural aspects===
Because tax benefits for charitable donations are limited in Japan, a culture of charity donations has never really taken root.  For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US.  Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view.  Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing them to do so anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hiragana Times]]'', "How Japanese Culture Created the Tiger Mask Movement", March 2011, Volume No. 293, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several donators left notes purportedly from other fictional characters from franchises outside the Tiger Mask series. Notable characters who "donated" include Rei and Kaji from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', [[Haruhi Suzumiya (character)|Haruhi Suzumiya]], and [[Stitch (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Stitch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99094">[[Torture]], the infliction of severe physical or psychological pain upon an individual to extract information or a confession, or as an illicit [[extrajudicial punishment]], is prohibited by [[international law]] and is illegal in most countries. However, it is still used by many governments. The subject of this article is the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which prohibited it.

==Torture in modern society==

Torture is widely practiced worldwide: [[Amnesty International]] received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2000. These accusations concerned acts against [[political prisoner]]s in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 ''Combating torture – a manual for action''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202125125/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 |date=2 December 2012 }}, October 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at [[truth and reconciliation commission|collective memory and reconciliation]] in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture "is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim's personality and identity."&lt;ref name=Tizon2002&gt;Orlando Tizon, CovertAction Quarterly, Summer 2002. Tizon is assistant director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition (TASSC) in Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment.

While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including [[plausible deniability]], [[secret police]], "need to know", denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]], claim of "overriding need", the use of [[torture by proxy]], and so on.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 ''End impunity: Justice for the victims of torture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230012927/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 |date=30 December 2013 }}, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming [[hearsay]] and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity /&gt; UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir [[Nigel Rodley]], believes that "impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture."&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rodley, "Report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," UN Document A/54/426, 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many [[non-state actor]]s also engage in it. These include [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, criminal actors such as [[organized crime]] syndicates and [[kidnappers]].

A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as [[waterboarding]], sexual humiliation and [[sexual abuse]], and [[war dog#Use against prisoners|dogs]] to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of [[stun belt]]s and [[taser]]s have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to "control" prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture.

==Technology==

While methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years.  The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques.&lt;ref name=Weschler1990a&gt;[[Lawrence Weschler]], ''A Miracle, A Universe: Settling Accounts with Torturers'', 1990: 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the use of tasers and electro-shock devices now widely sold to prison authorities around the world. Minor refinements of ancient techniques--including tearing out fingernails and toenails with iron tools, burning the soles of the feet with clothes irons, and probing between the toes with electric wood-burning pencils--are also widely applied.  Some African nations employ an iron foot-squeezing device patterned after the medieval French boot.

Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the [[Phoenix Program]], the United States helped [[South Vietnam]] co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or [[Viet Cong]]. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on [[interrogation]] that extended to the use of torture (see [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals]]). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to "coercive techniques".

The southern cone governments of South America – Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil – involved in [[Operation Condor]] co-ordinated the [[forced disappearance|disappearance]], torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=JPMcSherry&gt;J. Patrice McSherry, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030316080744/http://larcdma.sdsu.edu/humanrights/rr/PLAarticles/mcsherry.html "Operation Condor: Clandestine Inter-American System"], ''Social Justice'', Winter 1999 v26 i4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government has, at least since the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], used the tactic of [[rendition (law)|legal rendition]] in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the "war on terror" this has evolved into [[extraordinary rendition]], the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to [[kidnapping]] for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the [[Washington Post]] reported —-  citing administration sources —- that such facilities are operated by the [[CIA]] in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=WPost2005&gt;Dana Priest, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644_pf.html "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons"], ''The Washington Post'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that planes associated with rendition have landed repeatedly in Poland and Romania.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/07/usint11995.htm "Statement on U.S. Secret Detention Facilities in Europe"], Human Rights Watch, 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of torture is geographically widespread. A review by [[Amnesty International]], which did not use the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as its definition of torture, of its case files found "reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000".

During the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" carried out in the 1970s, in particular, but not only, by the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] from 1976 to 1983, tens of thousands of Argentines were "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" by the junta, many never to be seen again. The [[CONADEP|National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the methodology of repression.

During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), the [[Military of France|French military]] used torture against the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered [[electrical generator]]s on suspects: this form of torture was called ''(la) gégène''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film ''Death Squadrons: The French School'' by [[Marie-Monique Robin|Monique Robin]].
The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture "universities" at ''Poulo Condor'' (now ''[[Côn Sơn Island|Côn Sơn]]'') – an island off Vietnam (then [[French Indo-China]], subsequently taken over by the United States) and at [[Skikda|Philippeville]] (now ''Skikda'') in Algeria.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Police abuse]] remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the [[French police|Inspector General of the National Police]] received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for "inhumane and degrading treatments" in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41681.htm "2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in France"], US [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the police station in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders.

===Guatemala===

During the [[Guatemalan civil war]] and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even [[genocide]]), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the [[CIA]], in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the [[Cold War]]). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, [[Dianna Ortiz]], an American nun who was teaching poor [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in [[Guatemala City]] in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, ''The Blindfold's Eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;Dianna Ortiz and Patricia Davis, ''The Blindfold's eyes: My journey from torture to truth'', Maryknoll, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57075-435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well", wrote Dianna Ortiz.

===India===
India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The [[Asian Centre for Human Rights]] released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi. The report stated that, taking 2000 as the base year, custodial deaths have decreased by 41.66%&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100319192605/http://www.achrweb.org/impact/achr-impact2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; government between 2004–2005 to 2007–2008.

Article 38 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution of the Islamic Republic]] forbids "all forms of [[torture]] for the purpose of extracting confession or acquiring information" and the "compulsion of individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath."

Nonetheless, human rights groups and observers, such as [[Amnesty International]], the United Nations, and [[Human Rights Watch]], have complained that torture is frequently used on political prisoners in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, ''Iran'' (London 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, ''Iran: Imprisonment, Torture, and Execution of Political Prisoners'' (New York, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (Economic and Social Council), ''Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran'' (New York, February 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (Economic and Social Council), ''Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran'' (New York, January 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''World Report: 1990'' (New York, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial number of Iranians have been tortured and imprisoned by the religious police. [[Arya Aramnejad]], a singer, was jailed for his song "Ali Barkhiz" where he denounces the Islamic regime's crimes during the [[2009 Ashura protests]]. During his time in prison, he was reportedly tortured (sexually humiliated – photographed naked, laughed at, obliged to walk barefooted on aids' patients blood).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=' + 'Posted by null null' + ' |url=http://features.kodoom.com/en/videos/arya-aramnejad-iranian-singer-imprisoned-tortured-because-of-songs/v/2250/ |title=Arya Aramnejad: Iranian singer imprisoned, tortured because of songs |publisher=Features.kodoom.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farzad Kamangar]] was repeatedly tortured in prison.

In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] included Iran along with "[[Stalinism|Stalinist Russia]], [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist China]], and early modern Europe" of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]], as societies that "can be considered to be in a league of their own" in the systematic use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' 1999, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] International, reports that the widespread practice of [[rape|raping]] women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students "less outspoken and less likely to take part" in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, "most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can't cope with that."&lt;ref&gt;1 August 2008,  "Among Scholars, Resistance and Resilience in Iran, Tradition of dissent survives despite government pressure" By AISHA LABI, ''Chronicle of Higher Education International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bills passed the [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian Parliament]] that would have had Iran joining the international convention on banning torture in 2003 when [[Iranian reform movement|reformists]] controlled Parliament, but were rejected by the [[Guardian Council]].&lt;ref name=PayvandGuarCou&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/03/aug/1073.html Iran: Guardian Council turns down Majlis bills on women's rights, torture ban], ''Payvand's Iran News'', 13 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2003-01-10"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4DF1F3EF933A25752C0A9659C8B63 Iran: Ban on Torture Rejected], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

The government headed by [[Baath Party|Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] made extensive use of torture, including at the notorious [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

The post-[[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] [[Iraqi Interim Government|Iraqi government]] holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, [[Human Rights Watch]] found that torture was "routine and commonplace." According to their report,

{{Quotation|Methods of torture or ill-treatment cited included routine beatings to the body using a variety of implements such as cables, hosepipes and metal rods.  Detainees reported kicking, slapping and punching; prolonged suspension from the wrists with the hands tied behind the back; electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body, including the earlobes and genitals; and being kept blindfolded and/or handcuffed continuously for several days.  In several cases, the detainees suffered what may be permanent physical disability.|[[Human Rights Watch]]|3=

Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into [[Saddam Hussein's alleged shredder|Saddam Hussein's plastic shredder]] (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had "thrown babies from incubators" during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the 'eye-witness testimony' of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, [[Nurse Nayirah]]. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of [[Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah]], Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Stauber, J., Rampton, S.}} (1995) ''Toxic Sludge Is Good for You ''.

===Israel===

After investigation of continued allegations of torture, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999&lt;ref name=SCR&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/94/000/051/A09/94051000.a09.htm Supreme Court ruling], (HCJ 5100/94)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://takdin.co.il/searchg/HCJ%20510094%20Public%20Committee%20Against%20Torture%20v.%20State_hd_0L34rDp8qN3KnC30kQ7Hj.html ''Public Committee Against Torture v. State of Israel''], 15 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; that all torture - even moderate physical pressure - was illegal. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, [[Amnesty International]] continues to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remains unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. [[Amnesty International]]  stated in 2002:

{{Quotation|...the Israeli HCJ in September 1999 banned a number of interrogation methods ...However the judgment left ... loopholes by which methods amounting to torture or other ill-treatment in detention may continue.|Amnesty International|3=&lt;ref name=AI_Israel&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/074/2002/en/ "Israel and the Occupied Territories: Mass detention in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Amnesty International Index: MDE 15/074/2002, 23 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The human rights group [[B'Tselem]] estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism are subject to prolonged [[sleep deprivation]]; prolonged sight deprivation or [[sensory deprivation]]; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].  In January 2000, B'Tselem claimed that the Israeli [[Shin Bet|General Security Service]]'s (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the [[five techniques]]: "[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus,... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971..."&lt;ref name=BTselem2000&gt;B'Tselem, ''Legislation allowing for the use of physical force'', January 2000, pp.32,48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mau Mau]] inflicted torture and death on 1,819 [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent.

===Lebanon===
Suspected [[Hezbollah]] guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) prison at [[Khiam]] in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.&lt;ref name=HRW_Israel&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1994/israel/ "Torture and ill-treatment: Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories"], Human Rights Watch, June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhchr_Israel&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/daf82ddcda36946e80256609004b7df9?OpenDocument "Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel. 18/05/98"] by [[UNHCR]] Committee Against Torture, Twentieth session, 4–22 May 1998, A/53/44, paras.232–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of [[Enugu]], [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]] routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.&lt;ref name=HRWNigeria2005&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/nigeria0705/ "Rest in Pieces: Police Torture and Deaths in Custody in Nigeria"], Human Rights Watch, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic torture was used in conjunction with military occupation in an attempt to quell anti-[[petroleum|oil]] protests by the [[Ogoni people]] in the [[Niger Delta]], according to a [[World Council of Churches]] report.&lt;ref name=WCC1997&gt;Deborah Robinson, [http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/dc_4897.html "Ogoni: The Struggle Continues"], World Council of Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian pastors in Nigeria have been involved in the torturing and killing of children accused of witchcraft. Church pastors, in an effort to distinguish from the competition, establish their credentials by accusing children of witchcraft.

===North Vietnam===
From 1961 to 1973, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong held hundreds of Americans captive. Hanoi's Ministry of Public Security's Medical Office (MPSMO) was responsible for "preparing studies and performing research on the most effective Soviet, French, Communist Chinese and other ...techniques..." of extracting information from POWs. The MPSMO "...supervised the use of torture and the use of drugs to induce [American] prisoners to cooperate." Its functions also "...included working with Soviet and Communist Chinese intelligence advisors who were qualified in the use of medical techniques for intelligence purposes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html "War Crimes: The Cuban-Vietnam Connection"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718102449/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html |date=18 July 2008 }}, National Alliance of Families.&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Con Son Island]] for accounts of US torture practices.

===Palestinian Territories===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] has reportedly practiced torture in the occupied territories over the years. Amnesty International found: "Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of [[detainee]]s remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Recent publications Highlighted research |url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |title=Library |publisher=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208141705/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |archivedate=8 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 cases of torture by Palestinian security services were reported in 2010. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: "The reports of torture by Palestinian security services keep rolling in. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are well aware of the situation. They need to reverse this rampant impunity and make sure that those responsible are prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;"West Bank: Reports of Torture in Palestinian Detention." UNHCR. 20 October 2010.

At least six Palestinians have died under torture in PA prisons. According to a report by the Arab Organization for Human Rights in Britain, the PA has used torture on a systematic basis for years. Methods include beatings with cables, pulling out nails, suspension from the ceiling, flogging, kicking, cursing, electric shocks, sexual harassment and the threat of rape. The report went on to say "Every one of those detainees has been subject to humiliating and degrading treatment and stayed in cells for more than 10 days. The analysis shows that an astonishing 95 percent of the detainees were subjected to severe torture, others feeling the detrimental effects on their health for varying periods."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Toameh, Khaled.

Human Rights Watch reported 147 cases of torture by Hamas in the West Bank during 2011 and that none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted "despite consistent allegations of severe abuse." It further stated that "Some men said they had needed medical care due to torture and sought to obtain medical records as evidence that they had been tortured, but that hospital officials refused to provide them. Hamas’s rival in the West Bank, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/03/gaza-arbitrary-arrests-torture-unfair-trials Gaza: Arbitrary Arrests, Torture, Unfair Trials]. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another report, Human Rights Watch "documents cases in which [Palestinian] security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment, and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza." HRW also reported an incident in which "the Hamas Ministry of Interior summoned a journalist who published an article on torture by Hamas authorities in secret detention facilities, threatened to take legal action against him if he did not publish an apology for the article, and warned him to correct his 'biased' reporting."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (6 April 2011).

Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of it.&lt;ref name="Ismailov"&gt;Vjacheslav Ismailov, [http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/51n/n51n-s11.shtml "Terrible dedovshchina in General Staff"], ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 10 July 2006. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International reported on allegations of Chechen locals, that Russian military forces in [[Chechnya]] rape and torture local women with [[electric shock]]s, when electric wires are connected to the straps of their bra on their chest.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur46/014/2006/en/?open&amp;of=ENG-385 "Russian Federation Preliminary briefing to the UN Committee against Torture"] , Amnesty International, 1 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, and raped by special police forces ("Red Terror"). Such incidents took place not only in Chechnya, but also in the Russian towns of Blagoveshensk, Bezetsk, and Nefteyugansk.&lt;ref name="Marat1"&gt;Marat Hayrullin, [http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/01n/n01n-s00.shtml "The entire city was beaten"], ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 10 January 2005. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marat2"&gt;Marat Hayrullin,  [http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/19n/n19n-s00.shtml "A profession: to mop up the Motherland"], ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 17 March 2005. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marat3"&gt;Marat Hayrullin, [http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/30n/n30n-s15.shtml "Welcome to Fairytale"], ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 25 April 2005. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia officially considers torture illegal under [[Islamic Law]]; however, it is widely practiced, as in the case of [[William Sampson (author)|William Sampson]]. According to a 2003 report by Amnesty International, "torture and ill-treatment remained rife."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng "AI Report 2003: Saudi Arabia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501215008/http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng |date=1 May 2006 }}, Amnesty International, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanny Megally, Executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, stated in 2002 "The practice of torture in Saudi Arabia is well documented",&lt;ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===

Torture was widely practiced by the brutal [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] during the [[Stalinism]] era to extract (often false) confessions from suspects often called [[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was [[sleep deprivation]], nicknamed "conveyor" due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn. "The Gulag Archipelago"&lt;/ref&gt; The use of torture was authorized by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and personally by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During the [[Doctor's Plot]], Stalin ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured "to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html "Stalin's torture: 'Beat them to death'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020110400/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html |date=20 October 2008 }}, ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 16 October 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was still used after Stalin by the [[KGB]] but not on the same extent and level.

===Spain===
The Spanish kingdom categorically denies the existence of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng ''AI Report 2004''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218023703/http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng |date=18 February 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern "about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints." It further indicated that "all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention" (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm#_ftnref4 |title=Fourth periodic report on Spain in the 29th session of the UN Committee Against Torture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301143523/http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm |archivedate=2005-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee for the Prevention of Torture, [http://cpt.coe.int/en/states/esp.htm "Spain"], Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim's arms and legs, and later holding him down.

===United Kingdom===

====Kenya====
During the [[Mau Mau uprising]] of the 1950s, British colonial forces rounded up more than a million of [[Kikuyu people]] — most of them innocent victims of [[collective punishment]] — and imprisoned them in [[concentration camps]] in order to flush out the Mau Mau insurgency. In order to extract information about the insurgency and terrorize the enemy, the British used brutal methods to force Kenyans to confess and repudiate the Mau Mau oath. Under slogans like "labor and freedom" and other variations on "[[Arbeit macht frei]]," inmates were worked to death as slave labor filling in mass graves under cruel conditions. Some men were anally raped with knives. Some women had their breasts mutilated and cut off. Eyes were gouged out and ears cut off and skin lacerated with coiled barbed wire. Interrogation involved stuffing a detainee’s mouth with mud and stamping on his throat until he passed out or died. Survivors were sometimes burned alive, while British guards and interrogators took joy and laughed. British troops denying access to medical aid to the detainees were widespread. A former British officer described a British detention camp in Kenya in 1954: "Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging — all in violation of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]." According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary, there was a "constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya |pages=124–145 |publisher=Pimlico |author=Caroline Elkins |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire |pages=150–154 |publisher=W.

Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was [[Hussein Onyango Obama]], the grandfather of [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title= Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One British settler described the typical British interrogation:

{{Quotation|We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.}}

On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to [[List of colonial governors of Kenya|Governor]] [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale|Evelyn Baring]] about the "inhumanity" of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing:

{{quotation|The other lamentable aspect of this case [i.e. Judgment of the East Africa Court of Appeal, Criminal Appeals 891 and 892 of 1954] is the horror of some of the so called Screening Camps which, in my judgment, now present a state of affairs so deplorable that they should be investigated without delay so that the ever increasing allegations of inhumanity and disregard of the rights of the African citizen are dealt with and so that Government will have no reason either to be embarrassed or ashamed of the acts which are done in its name by its own servants. As things are at present there is no one who can investigate such allegations and no independent authority who is responsible for the conduct at these camps. An African who is unfortunate enough to suffer from the brutalities which are clearly evident has no one to whom he can complain and no one to regard his interests since the local Administrative Officer is, himself, the authority for the camps. Moreover, the injured person is unlikely to appeal to the police for redress if they are to be regarded as subordinate to the Executive...I do not consider that in the present circumstances Government have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that in its Screening Camps the elementary principles of justice and humanity are observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Mau%20Mau/Historian%20witness%20statements/Prof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit-CE1-.pdf?ext=.pdf rof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the "beating up and roasting alive of one African". A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects "during screening operations". "I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals," wrote Baring.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13044974 |title= British Mau Mau abuse papers revealed|date=12 April 2011  |author=Dominic Casciani |work=BBC |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Baring's administration devised the "dilution technique" — a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya - and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a "rough way". Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use "overpowering" force, and the cabinet minister's approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the "Mau Mau moan" - a chant of defiance - were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the "third degree". "The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts."&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;

One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of "fanatical" detainees at the Mwea camps.

{{quotation|If they deny having taken an oath they are given summary punishment which usually consists of a good beating up. This treatment usually breaks a large proportion. If this treatment does not bear fruit the detainee is taken to the far end of the camp where buckets of stone are waiting. These buckets are placed on the detainee's head and he is made to run around in circles until he agrees to confess the oath.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;}}

In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is "distressingly reminiscent of conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]]". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, "vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys", and it was important that "those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate". He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that "If we are going to sin," he wrote, "we must sin quietly."&lt;ref name="MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |publisher=guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
During [[the Troubles]], members of the British Army and the British security forces had routinely used torture on [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) suspects in [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the United Kingdom.

In 1971, as part of [[Operation Demetrius]], fourteen arrested men were subjected to a program of "deep interrogation" at [[Shackleton Barracks|a secret interrogation centre]]. The interrogation methods involved [[sensory deprivation]] and were referred to as the "[[five techniques]]". The [[European Court of Human Rights]] defined them as ''wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink''. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept [[hooding|hooded]] and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteen so-called "Hooded Men" were the only detainees subjected to all five techniques together. Some other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques, along with other interrogation methods.&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt; These allegedly included [[waterboarding]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6862034/Prisoners-in-Northern-Ireland-subjected-to-waterboarding-by-British-army-officers.html "Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric shock#Torture|electric shocks]], burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, [[Foot whipping|whipping the soles of the feet]], and psychological abuse such as [[Russian roulette]].&lt;ref name=mcguffin9/&gt;

Details of the "deep interrogation" program became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] commissioned an inquiry, under [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]], to look into the five techniques. In 1972 the 'Parker Report' concluded that the five techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister, [[Edward Heath]], then announced that the five techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Tobias.

The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971. In 1976, the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] ruled that the program of deep interrogation, using the five techniques, amounted to "torture".&lt;ref name=bbcnov14&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30177715 "Amnesty calls on Irish government to reopen 'hooded men' case"]. BBC News. 24 November 2014. Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1978 it ruled that the program amounted to "inhuman and degrading treatment" which breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but did not amount to torture.&lt;ref name=bbcnov14/&gt; In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1202/664159-hooded-men/ "State to apply to have 'Hooded Men' judgment revised by ECHR"] (RTÉ News);[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-asks-european-court-to-revise-hooded-men-ruling-1.2022790 "Government asks European court to revise 'Hooded Men' ruling"] (Irish Times); [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30296397 "Hooded Men: Irish government bid to reopen 'torture' case"] (BBC News).

On 23 February 2005, British soldiers were found guilty of abuse of Iraqi prisoners arrested for looting at a [[British Army]] camp called Bread Basket, in [[Basra]], during May 2003. The judge at the military court, Judge Advocate Michael Hunter, said of photographs and the soldier's behaviour:

On 7 December 2005, the House of Lords reversed the deportations of Muslims convicted on "evidence procured by torture inflicted by foreign officials", and cited the 1978 case in ruling that centuries of common law and recent international conventions made torture anathema in the country's courts. Lord Bingham said it was "clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its face firmly against the use of torture"; Lord Nicholls said "Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country"; Lord Hoffman said "The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it."; Lord Hope said it was "one of most evil practices known to man"; Lord Rodgers said "the unacceptable nature of torture ... has long been unquestioned in this country."; Lord Carswell referred to the "abhorrence felt by civilised nations for the use of torture"; and Lord Brown said that "torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051208/aand.pdf House of Lords Session 2005–06] 2005 UKHL 71 on appeal from: [2004] EWCA Civ 1123.

Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] and [[USS Peleliu (LHA-5)|USS Peleliu]]. A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans.

{{Utilitarianism|expanded=Key concepts}}
Within [[economics]] the concept of '''utility''' is used to model worth or value, but its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of [[utilitarianism]] by moral philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. But the term has been adapted and reapplied within [[neoclassical economics]], which dominates modern economic theory, as a '''utility function''' that represents a consumer's preference ordering over a choice set. As such, it is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice.

== Utility function ==
Consider a set of alternatives facing an individual, and over which the individual has a preference ordering. A '''utility function''' is able to represent those preferences if it is possible to assign a [[real number]] to each alternative, in such a way that ''alternative a'' is assigned a number greater than ''alternative b'' if, and only if, the individual prefers ''alternative a'' to ''alternative b''.  In this situation an individual that selects the most preferred alternative available is necessarily also selecting the alternative that maximises the associated utility function.

[[Gérard Debreu]] precisely defined the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Debreu|first=Gérard|title=Decision processes|pages=159–167|year=1954|postscript=.|editor-last1=Thrall|editor-first1=Robert M.|contribution=Representation of a preference ordering by a numerical function|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|oclc=639321|ref=harv|editor-last2=Coombs|editor-first2=Clyde H.|editor-last3=Raiffa|editor-first3=Howard|editor-link2=Clyde H. Coombs|editor-link3=Howard Raiffa}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a finite set of alternatives these require only that the preference ordering is complete (so the individual is able to determine which of any two alternatives is preferred, or that they are equally preferred), and that the preference order is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].

==Applications==

Utility is usually applied by [[economist]]s in such constructs as the [[indifference curve]], which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Utility and indifference curves are used by economists to understand the underpinnings of [[demand curve]]s, which are half of the [[supply and demand]] analysis that is used to analyze the workings of [[good (economics)|goods]] markets.

Individual utility and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a [[social welfare function]] respectively.  When coupled with production or commodity constraints, under some assumptions these functions can be used to analyze [[Pareto efficiency]], such as illustrated by [[Edgeworth box]]es in [[contract curve]]s. Such efficiency is a central concept in [[welfare economics]].

In [[finance]], utility is applied to generate an individual's price for an [[asset]] called the [[indifference price]].  Utility functions are also related to [[risk measure]]s, with the most common example being the [[entropic risk measure]].

==Revealed preference==
It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice. These 'revealed preferences', as they were named by [[Paul Samuelson]], were revealed e.g. in people's willingness to pay: &lt;blockquote&gt;Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1920 |title=Principles of Economics. An introductory volume |edition=8th |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|78}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{Visible anchor|Functions|Utility functions}}==

There has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a [[commodity]] can be measured or not. At one time, it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today '''utility functions''', expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either ''cardinal'' or ''ordinal'', depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences.

===Cardinal===
{{Main|Cardinal utility}}

When cardinal utility is used, the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. Formally speaking, this means that if one has a cup of tea, she would be willing to take any bet with a probability, p, greater than .5 of getting a cup of juice, with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to  1-p. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds as good as the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the "zero" of utility. For example, if the "zero" of utility was located at -40, then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero.

[[Neoclassical economics]] has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior. A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice under conditions of risk (see [[#Expected utility|below]]).

Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons, to create a [[social welfare function]].

===Ordinal===
{{Main|Ordinal utility}}

When ordinal utilities are used, differences in utils (values taken on by the utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless:  the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related ''strength of preferences''. In the above example, it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water, but no more.

Ordinal utility functions are unique [[up to]] increasing [[Monotonic function#Monotonic transformation|monotone (or monotonic) transformations]]. For example, if a function &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as ordinal, it is equivalent to the function &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;, because taking the 3rd power is an increasing monotone transformation (or monotonic transformation). This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same (although they are two different functions). In contrast,  cardinal utilities are unique only up to increasing linear transformations, so if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as cardinal, it is not equivalent to &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Preferences===

Although [[Preference (economics)|preference]]s are the conventional foundation of [[microeconomics]], it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility [[Function (mathematics)|function]] and analyze human behavior indirectly with utility functions.  Let ''X'' be the '''consumption set''', the set of all mutually-exclusive baskets the consumer could conceivably consume.  The consumer's '''utility function''' &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; ranks each package in the consumption set.  If the consumer strictly prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between them, then &lt;math&gt;u(x)\geq u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, suppose a consumer's consumption set is ''X'' =&amp;nbsp;{nothing, 1&amp;nbsp;apple,1&amp;nbsp;orange, 1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange, 2&amp;nbsp;apples, 2&amp;nbsp;oranges}, and its utility function is ''u''(nothing)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;apples)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;oranges)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple, but prefers one of each to 2 oranges.

In micro-economic models, there are usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity.  This gives a consumption set of &lt;math&gt;\R^L_+&lt;/math&gt;, and each package &lt;math&gt;x \in \R^L_+&lt;/math&gt; is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity.  In the previous example, we might say there are two commodities: apples and oranges.  If we say apples is the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set &lt;math&gt;X =\R^2_+&lt;/math&gt; and ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''u''(2,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 as before.  Note that for ''u'' to be a utility function on&amp;nbsp;''X'', it must be defined for every package in&amp;nbsp;''X''.

A utility function &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; '''represents''' a preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; on X [[if and only if|iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(x)\leq u(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\preceq  y&lt;/math&gt;.  If u represents &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, then this implies &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is complete and transitive, and hence rational.

===Revealed preferences in finance===

In financial applications, e.g. [[portfolio optimization]], an investor chooses financial portfolio which maximizes his/her own utility function, or, equivalently, minimizes his/her [[risk measure]]. For example, [[modern portfolio theory]] selects variance as a measure of risk; other popular theories are [[expected utility theory]]&lt;ref name="exputility"&gt;Von Neumann, J., Morgenstern, O. (1953). Theory of games and economic behavior, 3rd ed., Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name="prosp"&gt;Kahneman, D., Tversky, A. (1979).
Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 47, 263-291.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine specific utility function for any given investor, one could design a questionnaire procedure with questions in the form: How much would you pay for ''x%'' chance of getting ''y''? Revealed preference theory suggests a more direct  approach: observe a portfolio ''X*'' which an investor currently holds, and then find a utility function/risk measure such that ''X*'' becomes an optimal portfolio.&lt;ref name="riskinverse"&gt;Grechuk, B., Zabarankin, M. (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283985485_Inverse_Portfolio_Problem_With_Coherent_Risk_Measures Inverse portfolio problem with coherent risk measures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903204155/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283985485_Inverse_Portfolio_Problem_With_Coherent_Risk_Measures |date=3 September 2017 }}, European Journal of Operational Research 249(2), 740-750.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

In order to simplify calculations, various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences, and these imply various alternative utility functions such as:

* [[constant elasticity of substitution|CES]] (''constant elasticity of substitution'', or ''[[isoelastic utility|isoelastic]]'') utility
* [[Isoelastic utility]]
* [[Exponential utility]]
* [[Quasilinear utility]]
* [[Homothetic preferences]]
* [[Stone–Geary utility function]]
* [[Gorman polar form]]
** [[Greenwood–Hercowitz–Huffman preferences]]
** [[King–Plosser–Rebelo preferences]]
* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]]

Most utility functions used in modeling or theory are '''well-behaved.''' They are usually monotonic and quasi-concave. However, it is possible for preferences not to be representable by a utility function. An example is [[lexicographic preferences]] which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan E., Jr. |last=Ingersoll |title=Theory of Financial Decision Making |location=Totowa |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=1987 |page=21 |isbn=0-8476-7359-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected==
{{Main|Expected utility hypothesis}}

The expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among '''risky''' projects with multiple (possibly multidimensional) outcomes.

The [[St. Petersburg paradox]] was first proposed by [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicholas Bernoulli]] in 1713 and solved by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. D. Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decision-makers displayed [[risk aversion]] and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function. (Analyses of international survey data in the 21st century have shown that insofar as utility represents happiness, as in [[utilitarianism]], it is indeed proportional to log income.)

The first important use of the expected utility theory was that of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]], who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of [[game theory]].

===von Neumann–Morgenstern===
{{Main|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem}}

Von Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty, but have probabilities attached to them.

A notation for a ''[[Lottery (probability)|lottery]]'' is as follows: if options A and B have probability ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' in the lottery, we write it as a linear combination:
:&lt;math&gt;
L = p A + (1-p) B
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for a lottery with many possible options:

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \sum_i p_i A_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i =1&lt;/math&gt;.

By making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave, von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries, then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be calculated as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts, with the weights being their probabilities of occurring.

This is called the ''expected utility theorem''. The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agent's [[preference relation]] over 'simple lotteries', which are lotteries with just two options. Writing &lt;math&gt;B\preceq A&lt;/math&gt; to mean 'A is weakly preferred to B' ('A is preferred at least as much as B'), the axioms are:

# completeness: For any two simple lotteries &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M\preceq L&lt;/math&gt; (or both, in which case they are viewed as equally desirable).
# transitivity: for any three lotteries &lt;math&gt;L,M,N&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;.
# convexity/continuity (Archimedean property): If &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 1 such that the lottery &lt;math&gt;pL + (1-p)N&lt;/math&gt; is equally desirable as &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
# independence: for any three lotteries &lt;math&gt;L,M,N&lt;/math&gt; and any probability ''p'', &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;pL+(1-p)N \preceq pM+(1-p)N&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, if the lottery formed by the probabilistic combination of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is no more preferable than the lottery formed by the same probabilistic combination of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N,&lt;/math&gt; then and only then &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M&lt;/math&gt;.

Axioms 3 and 4 enable us to decide about the relative utilities of two assets or lotteries.

In more formal language: A von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function is a function from choices to the real numbers:
:&lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt;
which assigns a real number to every outcome in a way that captures the agent's preferences over simple lotteries. Under the four assumptions mentioned above, the agent will prefer a lottery &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; to a lottery &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for the utility function characterizing that agent, the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;L_1\preceq L_2 \text{ iff } u(L_1)\leq u(L_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Of all the axioms, independence is the most often discarded. A variety of [[generalized expected utility]] theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.

===As probability of success===
Castagnoli and LiCalzi and Bordley and LiCalzi (2000) provided another interpretation for Von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory.  Specifically for any utility function, there exists a hypothetical reference lottery with the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery being its probability of performing no worse than the reference lottery. Suppose success is defined as getting an outcome no worse than the outcome of the reference lottery.  Then this mathematical equivalence means that maximizing expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the probability of success. In many contexts, this makes the concept of utility easier to justify and to apply. For example, a firm's utility might be the probability of meeting uncertain future customer expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Castagnoli, E. and M. LiCalzi. "Expected Utility Theory without Utility." Theory and Decision, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bordley, R. and M. LiCalzi.

Operations Research. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bordley |first=R. |first2=S. |last2=Pollock |title=A Decision-Analytic Approach to Reliability-Based Design Optimization |journal=Operations Research |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages= 1262–1270|year=2009 |doi=10.1287/opre.1080.0661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indirect==
{{Main|Indirect utility}}

An indirect utility function gives the optimal attainable value of a given utility function, which depends on the prices of the goods and the income or wealth level that the individual possesses.

===Money===

One use of the indirect utility concept is the notion of the utility of money.  The (indirect) utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is [[bounded function|bounded]] and asymmetric about the origin. The utility function is [[concave function|concave]] in the positive region, reflecting the phenomenon of [[diminishing marginal utility]].  The boundedness reflects the fact that beyond a certain point money ceases being useful at all, as the size of any economy at any point in time is itself bounded.  The asymmetry about the origin reflects the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses.  The non-linearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision making processes: in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility through gains or losses of money, which are the norm in most business settings, the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same time-period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. O. |last=Berger |title=Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer-Verlag |edition=2nd |year=1985 |chapter=Utility and Loss |isbn=3-540-96098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion and criticism==
Cambridge economist [[Joan Robinson]] famously criticized utility for being a circular concept: "Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Robinson |year=1962 |title=Economic Philosophy |location=Harmondsworth, Middle-sex, UK |publisher=Penguin Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} Robinson also pointed out that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption. This is so because if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=Joan Robinson’s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory |work=Fixing the Economists |date=17 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/joan-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112846/https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/joan-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory/ |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher [[Hans Albert]] who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=utility Hans Albert Expands Robinson’s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory to the Law of Demand |work=Fixing the Economists |date=27 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/hans-albert-expands-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory-to-the-law-of-demand/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719164628/https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/hans-albert-expands-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory-to-the-law-of-demand/ |archivedate=19 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, demand and supply curve (theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price) is purely ontological and could never been demonstrated empirically.

Another criticism comes from the assertion that neither cardinal nor ordinal utility is empirically observable in the real world. In the case of cardinal utility it is impossible to measure the level of satisfaction "quantitatively" when someone consumes or purchases an apple. In case of ordinal utility, it is impossible to determine what choices were made when someone purchases, for example, an orange. Any act would involve preference over a vast [[set (mathematics)|set]] of choices (such as apple, orange juice, other vegetable, vitamin C tablets, exercise, not purchasing, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cujif/ABSTRACT/980606.htm |title=Revealed Preference Theory |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090409/http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cujif/ABSTRACT/980606.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~botond/mistakeschicago.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015203300/http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~botond/mistakeschicago.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions of what arguments ought to enter into a utility function are difficult to answer, yet seem necessary to understanding utility. Whether people gain utility from coherence of wants, beliefs or a sense of duty is key to understanding their behavior in the utility organon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel|title=Professor|journal=Econ Journal Watch|date=May 2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=97–105|url=http://econjwatch.org/file_download/826/CompleteIssueMay2014.pdf|accessdate=November 15, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005153234/http://econjwatch.org/file_download/826/CompleteIssueMay2014.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, choosing between alternatives is itself a process of determining what to consider as alternatives, a question of choice within uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=Towards a Better Life|date=1932|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.:}}&lt;/ref&gt;
