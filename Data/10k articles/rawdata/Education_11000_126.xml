'''The Academy of Sciences''' of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] ({{lang-fa|فرهنگستان علوم جمهوری اسلامی ایران}}) was established in 1988. It is one of the four academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The other three are: [[Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences]], [[Iranian Academy of the Arts]] and [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]].

==Organization==
The academy consists of the president of the country as the director of the academy, a general body, the president of the academy (currently Professor [[Reza Davari-Ardakani]]), a scientific council, and the secretary of the academy.

The academy has six scientific departments including: Department of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Basic Sciences, Department of Engineering Sciences, Department of Humanities, Department of Islamic Studies, and Department of Veterinary Sciences.

==Objectives==
Among the major objectives of the Academy of Sciences of Iran are the attainment of scientific and cultural independence, promotion of science and technology, encouragement of the spirit of research, access to the latest scientific findings and innovations through teamwork, and absorbing, encouraging and supporting eminent researchers and scholars. In order to fulfil these objectives, the academy has a range of duties including survey and analysis of the status of science, technology, education and research at the national scale; studies on experiences of other countries on the development of science, technology and its application with respect to the available facilities and potential of the country; and material and spiritual support of scholars to create scientific works among, and other duties.

==Members==
The Academy has three types of members including Fellows, Associates and Honorary members. All members are elected by secret ballot and need the majority of votes. In 1990, the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council selected the first fifteen fellows of the Academy. There are requirements for any of these membership types, for example fellow members have to be full professors with outstanding publications and Iranian citizenship.

On the 100th anniversary of the murder of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], Archive of the Federation organized on June 28, 2014, an exhibition titled "Sarajevo Assassination". The exhibit was placed in front of the [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Sarajevo]], in the open, and seen by 30,000 people. This international exhibition was also organized in several capital cities around Europe.&lt;ref name='galsarajevoassasination'&gt;[http://rtv7.ba/arhive/7476 Gallery "Sarajevo Assassination" (in Bosnian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, two exhibitions on World Wars were presented to the public; an exhibition titled "The Great War (1914-1918)" &lt;ref name='galgreatwar'&gt;[http://ba.n1info.com/a7732/Vijesti/Kultura/Izlozba-u-Arhivu-FBiH-Dan-kada-je-okoncan-Prvi-svjetski-rat.html The gallery "Great War" (in Bosnian)]&lt;/ref&gt; which contained 35 billboards with images and information on World War I and was organized in Sarajevo and other cities; and on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of victory over fascism, Archives organized exhibition "Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II" &lt;ref name='galgreatwarII'&gt;[http://www.trt.net.tr/bosanski/kultura-turizam-i-umjetnost/2015/05/08/izlozba-bih-i-drugi-svjetski-rat-bez-bh-funkcionera-43873 The Gallery "Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II"(in Bosnian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Archives introduced integral Bosnian-Herzegovinian awards which are presented to the best archivists and individuals or institutions for their contribution to the memorialization of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian history, as well as affirmation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the country and abroad.

==Seat of the Archives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina==

The Archives of the Federation does not have its own building and it has been a tenant since it has been established in 1997. Initially, it was located in the building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but after the protests in February 2014 during which the administrative premises were set on fire,&lt;ref name='burningoffederal'&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/sarajevo-fire-may-have-destroyed-state-s-ottoman-archives-1.1685423 Sarajevo fire may have destroyed state’s Ottoman archives]&lt;/ref&gt; it has changed its address and now it is located at [https://www.google.ba/maps/place/Marka+Maruli%C4%87a+2,+Sarajevo+71000/@43.8561982,18.3805131,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4758c93e3ad9ea35:0x14a2c62c6ea079a8!8m2!3d43.8561944!4d18.3827018?hl=en2 Marka Marulića 2, Sarajevo] together with its depot.

An '''authoring system''' is a program that has pre-programmed elements for the development of interactive multimedia software titles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/85068/guide/the-best-elearning-authoring-tools-of-2016|title=The Best eLearning Tools|last=Martinez|first=Juan|date=27 October 2016|website=PC Mag|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoring systems can be defined as software that allows its user to create multimedia applications for manipulating multimedia objects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In the development of [[educational software]], an authoring system is a program that allows a non-programmer, usually an instructional designer or technologist, to easily create software with programming features. The programming features are built in but hidden behind buttons and other tools, so the author does not need to know how to program. Generally authoring systems provide lots of graphics, interaction, and other tools educational software needs.  The three main components of an authoring system are: content organization, control of content delivery, and type(s) of assessment.  Content Organization allows the user to structure and sequence the instructional content and media.  Control of content delivery refers to the ability for the user to set the pace in which the content is delivered, and how learners engage with the content.  Assessment refers to the ability to test learning outcomes within the system, usually in the form of tests, discussions, assignments, and other activities which can be evaluated. 

An authoring system usually includes an ''authoring language'', a programming language built (or extended) with functionality for representing the tutoring system. The functionality offered by the authoring language may be programming functionality for use by programmers or domain representation functionality for use by subject experts. There is overlap between authoring languages with domain representation functionality and [[domain-specific language]]s.

==Authoring language==

An ''authoring language'' is a [[programming language]] used to create [[tutorials]], [[computer-based training]] [[courseware]], [[website]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s and other interactive [[computer program]]s. Authoring systems (packages) generally provide [[High-level programming language|high-level]] visual tools that enable a complete system to be designed without writing any programming code, although the authoring language is there for more in-depth usage.

'''COMAL''' (''Common Algorithmic Language'') is a computer [[programming language]] developed in [[Denmark]] by Benedict Løfstedt and Børge R. Christensen in 1973. COMAL was one of the few [[structured programming]] languages that was available for and comfortably usable on 8-bit home computers.

The "COMAL Kernel Syntax &amp; Semantics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Kevin|title=COMAL Kernel Syntax &amp; Semantics|url=http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/COMAL/standardization#TeleNova.2C_Nyn.C3.A4shamn.2C_Sweden._March_13_to_16.2C_1985|website=DDHFwiki|publisher=Dansk Datahistorisk Forening|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains the formal definition of the language. Further extensions common to many implementations are described in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bain|first1=Richard|last2=Lindsay|first2=Len|title=Common COMAL Definition and Tests|journal=COMAL Today|issue=24|pages=21–46|url=https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/newsletters/comal-today/COMAL_Today_Issue_24.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Common COMAL -- Compatible keywords|journal=COMAL Today|issue=25|pages=28|url=https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/newsletters/comal-today/COMAL_Today_Issue_25.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Common COMAL -- Keyword syntax and examples|journal=COMAL Today|issue=25|pages=29-33|url=https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/newsletters/comal-today/COMAL_Today_Issue_25.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

COMAL was created as a mixture of the prevalent educational programming languages of the time, [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], and, at least in the Commodore and Compis versions, the [[turtle graphics]] of [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]].  The language was meant to introduce [[structured programming]] elements in an environment where BASIC would normally be used.

With the benefit of hindsight, COMAL looks like a [[BASIC#Structured BASIC|Structured BASIC]] that has reasonably well-written, vendor neutral, free, standards. It is never necessary to use GOTO, and line numbers are purely for editing purposes rather than flow control. Note, however, that the standardised language only supports control structuring, not data structuring such as records or structs (commercial implementations such as UniCOMAL 3 supported this as an extension).

== History ==

In the early 1980s, [[Apple Computer]] won a contract to supply [[Apple II]] computers running [[CP/M]] and COMAL to Irish secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Michael D.|title=COMAL coverage out of Ireland|journal=InfoWorld|date=8 August 1983|volume=5|issue=32|page=30|url=https://archive.org/stream/Infoworld-1983-08-08/#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular for education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Michael P.|title=The Design of a First Course in Programming|date=May 1986|publisher=Loughborough University of Technology|location=Loughborough, Leicester, UK|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/10392|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some textbooks were locally written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=Foundations in Computer Studies with COMAL|date=1984|publisher=The Educational Company|location=Dublin, Ireland|edition=Second|url=https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/manufacturers/computers/Commodore/books/commodore/Foundations_in_Computer_Studies_with_COMAL_Second_Edition.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LundyOSullivan1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lundy|first1=Thomas|last2=O'Sullivan|first2=Rory|title=Beginning structured programming in BASIC and COMAL|date=1990|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|location=Dublin, Ireland|isbn=978-0717116676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Acornsoft]] released a COMAL implementation, by David Christensen, Jim Warwick and David Evers, for their 8-bit BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers (with a manual by Paul Christensen and Roy Thornton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorton|first1=Roy|last2=Christensen|first2=Paul|title=Comal on the B. B. C. Microcomputer and Acorn ELECTRON SBD 19|date=1984|publisher=Acornsoft|isbn=978-0907876908}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)

Between 1984-1987 TeleNova, a subsidiary of the industrial arm of the Swedish Telecoms system, Teli industrier manufactured a desktop PC
called "[[Compis]]" for the educational sector. An enhanced version of COMAL was supplied as the standard programming language for this PC.
Versions were created for both CP/M86 and MS-DOS. The latter version is available for Windows XP.
The (Swedish) reference manual is {{ISBN|91-24-40022-X}}

In 1990 Thomas Lundy and Rory O'Sullivan produced the definitive text on COMAL Programming.&lt;ref name="LundyOSullivan1990" /&gt; They matched and compared COMAL with [[BBC BASIC|BBC Structured Basic]].

As of 2016 COMAL is still actively in use as an educational programming language.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Some high schools in the United Kingdom continue to use it to teach the subject of Computing.

'''Camino Nuevo Charter Academy'''('''CNCS''') is a group of [[charter school]]s serving the [[Westlake, Los Angeles, California|Westlake]]/[[MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, California|MacArthur Park]] area of [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Kathy A. "Camino Nuevo High School: Committed To Academics And Community." [http://www.losfelizledger.com/HealthNews.htm ''Los Feliz Ledger''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030221853/http://www.losfelizledger.com/HealthNews.htm |date=2006-10-30 }}, October 2006. Last accessed January 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Camino Nuevo Charter Academy was awarded the [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]] gold medal.&lt;ref name="Bruner Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/ |publisher=Bruner Foundation |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camino Nuevo Charter Academy operates two middle and two elementary schools in the same neighborhood. Students have a longer school day and year than students at traditional LAUSD schools, and smaller class sizes. Camino Nuevo schools are very involved with parents and the community at large; the school even operates a health clinic for family members.

'''Camino Nuevo High School''' ('''CNHS''') received a 751 on its [[Academic Performance Index|API]] score,&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.cde.ca.gov/APIBase2006/2006GrowthSch.aspx?allcds=19647330106435 2005-06 Accountability Progress Reporting (APR)]&lt;/ref&gt; significantly higher than any other high school in its neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.cde.ca.gov/APIBase2006/2006Grth_Dst.aspx?allcds=1964733 Local Educational Agency (LEA) List of Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; The school was awarded a 10 out of 10 from the state of California for its similar schools ranking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.cde.ca.gov/APIBase2006/2005BaseSchSS.aspx?allcds=19647330106435 Similar Schools Report: 2005 Academic Performance Index (API) Base Report]&lt;/ref&gt; 80 percent of sophomores passed the [[CAHSEE]] on their first attempt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cahsee.cde.ca.gov/ExitProf4.asp?cSelect=CAMINO^NUEVO^HIGH^SC--CAMINO^NUEVO^HI--1964733-0106435&amp;cYear=2005-06&amp;TestType=E&amp;cAdmin=C&amp;tDate=000000&amp;cGrade=10&amp;Pageno=1 California High School Exit Examination: Camino Nuevo High School]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to only 67 percent of [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cahsee.cde.ca.gov/ExitProg3.asp?cSelect=1964733^^--^Los^Angeles^Unified-000&amp;cYear=2005-06&amp;cChoice=ExitProg3&amp;cAdmin=C&amp;tDate=000000&amp;cGrade=10&amp;Pageno=1 California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) Results: Los Angeles Unified School District]&lt;/ref&gt;

Camino Nuevo's official mission statement is "to educate students in a college preparatory program to be literate, critical thinkers, and independent problem solvers who are agents of social justice with sensitivity toward the world around them."

==Student body==
Over ninety percent of students at CNHS qualify for free or reduced lunch, and nine percent are considered English learners. Although Camino Nuevo has a high graduation rate and a large percentage of students who get admitted into college, most of them are placed in remedial classes and are unprepared for college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.cde.ca.gov/APIBase2006/2006Grth_SchDem.aspx?allcds19-64733-0106435 2006 API School Demographic Characteristics]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the 2010-2011 school year, Camino Nuevo  enrolls 930 students.&lt;ref name="projects.latimes.com"&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/schools/school/los-angeles/camino-nuevo-charter-academy/ Los Angeles Times California Schools Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camino_Nuevo_HS.jpg|thumb|Camino Nuevo High School]]

===College Preparatory High School===
The school, opened in 2004, is located at the corners of West Temple Street and Silverlake Boulevard in Los Angeles. The school serves students from a variety of local areas, including [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]], Rampart, Westlake, [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], [[Pico-Union, Los Angeles, California|Pico-Union]], [[Silverlake, Los Angeles, California|Silverlake]], and [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]]. Some students also travel from suburban cities like Canoga Park or Van Nuys; also from places like Highland Park and Lincoln Heights. In association with the Teach for America program, Camino Nuevo hires teachers training to earn their credentials in order to further the initiative to aid underserved communities.

The school's distinctive yellow-and-grey building was designed by Kevin Daly of [[Santa Monica, CA|Santa Monica]]-based [[Kevin Daly Architects]].

===Early Childhood Education Center===
The early childhood education center opened in 2004.

===K-8 campuses===
Two K-8 campuses (Burlington and Harvard sites) were opened in 2000 and 2001.

==CNHS in the news==
Three students from the school were interviewed on [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5376035 NPR's Morning Edition] regarding the immigration debate in the U.S.

[[File:Cardiff Business School.jpg|thumb|right|Cardiff Business School.]]
'''Cardiff Business School''' ({{lang-cy|Ysgol Fusnes Caerdydd}}) is the [[business school]] of [[Cardiff University]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. It was created in its current form in 1987 and opened by [[Elizabeth II]]. Cardiff Business School currently serves 3,000 students a year, 700 of whom are postgraduate students. The school's research programme is [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) recognised and has 140 PhD students currently studying within the school. Its research informs organisations such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the [[United Nations]], the [[HM Treasury]], the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] and working on consultation projects for blue-chip, global firms.

Some notable staff include [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian Economist]] [[Huw Dixon]], [[Informatics (academic field)|Informaticist]] [[Paul Beynon-Davies]], and influential neoclassical economist [[Patrick Minford]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

==History==

===Economics at University College Cardiff (1899-1988)===
Economics is the oldest part of the business school,&lt;ref&gt;[http://huwdixon.org/archive/UCEconomics.pdf ECONOMICS at UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, CARDIFF ( UCC ) 1899-1988], K D George.&lt;/ref&gt; having been taught at Cardiff since the late 1890s as part of the Political Science department and corresponding degree. The "Department of Economics and Political Science" was set up in 1903 with one lecturer, Henry Jevons (the son of [[William Stanley Jevons]]) who was made Professor in his final year 1911. From 1911 to 1946 the head of department was W.J Roberts. In 1922, he was joined by Stanley Parris. In 1946, professor [[Brinley Thomas]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] became head of the department and there followed an expansion with the subjects covered to include statistics and accounting. By 1962, there were seven lecturers in the department, and in 1972 Sir [[Bryan Hopkin]] became the second professor among 11 lecturers. In 1973, Professor Ken D. George became the head of department and there was further expansion. In 1988, as a result of the merger of UCC with [[University of Wales|University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]], the economics department at University College Cardiff moved into the recently created Cardiff Business School.

===Research Assessment Exercise - RAE 2008===
Cardiff Business School was ranked fourth in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise - RAE in 'Business and Management Studies' subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-2008-business-and-management-studies|title=RAE 2008: business and management studies results|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70 percent of the School's research was judged to be either world-leading or internationally excellent.

===Research Excellence Framework - REF 2014===

Cardiff Business School was ranked sixth across the UK in the 2014 REF category "Business and Management Studies" on the basis of the overall grade point average (GPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/%28S%28nyhepztq4uljtlegnhf0az5b%29%29/Results/ByUoa/19|title=Results &amp; submissions : REF 2014 : View results and submissions by UOA|work=ref.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 86 percent of its research was judged to be either world-leading or internationally excellent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">[[Image:SSSLOGO SM.png|right|125px]]The '''Careers Scotland Space School''', also known as the '''Scottish Space School''', is an organisation set up by [[Careers Scotland]] and funded by the [[Scottish Government]]. This is a government programme, organised as a partnership initiative with [[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), to encourage young people to gain an interest in ''STEM'' subjects, [[Science]], [[Technology]], [[Engineering]] and [[Maths]].&lt;ref name=school&gt;[http://www.careers-scotland.org.uk/Initiatives/Spaceschool/SpaceSchool.asp "Space School"], Careers Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Initiatives==
The programme provides support teaching materials and includes provision for 120 pupils to attend a [[summer school]], which focuses on electronics and life sciences, at the [[University of Strathclyde]]. There is also a series of visits to schools by [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s and scientists. For example, in June 2007 staff from [[NASA]] attended an exhibition in [[Nairn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=149235&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=149218&amp;contentPK=17602405&amp;moduleName=InternalSearch&amp;formname=sidebarsearch "Top Astronauts Make Landing In Nairn"], [[Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]], 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 it is using a staged competition-like structure, with the top prize (for 52 [[student]]s) a 12-day trip to [[Johnson Space Center]], in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=school/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">'''Classroom Climate''' is the classroom environment, the social climate, the emotional and the physical aspects of the classroom.  It’s the idea that teachers influence student growth and behavior.  The student’s behavior affects [[peer group|peer]] interaction—the responsibility of influencing these behaviors is placed with the Instructor.  The way the instructor organizes the classroom should lead to a positive environment rather than a destructive and/or an environment that is not conducive to learning.  Dr. Karen L. Bierman, the Director of the [[PennState]] Child Study Center and Professor of Psychology, believed that a teacher needs to be "invisible hand" in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Karen L. Biermann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bierman|first=Karen L.|title=The promise and potential of studying the "invisible hand" of teacher influence on peer relations and student outcomes: A commentary|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|date=September–October 2011|volume=32|series=SI Teachers and Classroom Social Dynamics|issue=5|pages=297–303|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2011.04.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193397311000669|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classroom Climate|url=http://citl.indiana.edu/resources/teaching-resources1/classroom-climate.php|work=Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning|publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of a Positive Classroom Climate==
Teachers should learn to guide their students, not to alienate them.  The safety of the student’s well-being is paramount in their development of social ties with peers and their instructor. As education becomes more inclusive, teachers need to become more aware of how to organize groups of students and how the students are arranged can lead to a favorable environment.  Well-organized classrooms are an important component to classroom functions as it leads to more dialogue and [[formative assessment]]. Students with special education needs (SEN) tend to feel more excluded from the other students in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krull|first1=Johanna|last2=Wilbert|first2=Jurgen|last3=Hennemann|first3=Thomas|title=The Social and Emotional Situation of First Graders with Classroom Behavior Problems and Classroom Learning Difficulties in Inclusive Classes|journal=Learning Disabilities: A Contemporary Journal|date=2014|volume=12|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEN students include those with behavioral problems and those with learning difficulties.  Students who do not have disadvantages are more inclined to participate as they feel more like they belong and have a higher belief in their academic abilities.  Education becomes less of a chore and more enjoyable when students grow as a group which can lead to the reduction of students acting out destructively.  In order to affect students, a teacher needs to monitor and modify the influence students have on one another. Teachers are able to help students feel included by assigning groups and rearranging the seating chart so less cliques are formed in the classroom.  Combating bad behavior is a teacher's duty. Teachers need not only to take into consideration how the classroom is arranged, but also observe students' background, family life, grade, and many other complex issues surrounding life.

===Disinterest in use in the classroom===
Mara W. Allodi, Department of Special Education, [[Stockholm University]]'s article ''The Meaning of Social Climate of Learning Environments: Some Reasons Why We Do Not Care Enough About It, discusses the idea that [[social competence]] is as important to learning as the curriculum.  Teaching has become more bureaucratic in the distribution of curriculum, its organization, and the system has turned it into more of a competition for high grades and less about human emotion.  People often forget the importance of self-esteem and stress; these affect student interaction and learning.  It is two-fold: one separates knowledge from the social climate.  Classroom climate is not associated with learning.&lt;ref name="Mara W. Allodi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allodi|first=Mara W.|title=The meaning of social climate of learning environments: Some reasons why we do not care enough about it|journal=Learning Environments Research|date=18 May 2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=89–104|doi=10.1007/s10984-010-9072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1523">The '''Comprehensive School Reform''' (CSR) program was a program administered by the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Elementary and Secondary Education]].

As established in the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]], the purpose of the program was "to provide financial incentives for schools to develop comprehensive school reforms, based upon scientifically based research and effective practices that include an emphasis on basic academics and parental involvement so that all children can meet challenging state academic content and academic achievement standards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg13.html#sec1601 No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Sec. 1601]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSR program made its last award in 2005, although it continued to appropriate funds to one school in 2006-2008.&lt;ref name="CSR Funding"&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/programs/compreform/funding.html Archived: Funding Status - Comprehensive School Reform Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5976">The '''Cybernetic Culture Research Unit''' ('''Ccru''') was a student-run interdisciplinary collective founded in 1995 out of the [[University of Warwick]]'s philosophy department.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"&gt;[http://divus.cc/london/en/article/nick-land-ein-experiment-im-inhumanismus Mackay, Robin. "Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism." ''Divus''. 27 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with the work of [[Sadie Plant]] and [[Nick Land]].

==History==
The collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers [[Sadie Plant]] (around whom it was founded), [[Nick Land]], and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging [[cyberfeminist]] thinking that would lead to the ''Virtual Futures'' conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Reynolds, Simon. "Renegade Aacdemia"]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing [[post-structuralism]], [[cybernetics]], [[science-fiction]], [[rave culture]], and [[occult studies]].&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled ''Ccru: Writings 1997-2003'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0/|title=Ccru: Writings 1997-2003|accessdate= September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and affiliates==
Although it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant.&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"&gt;[http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10459/1/nick-land-mind-games Fisher, Mark. "Nick Land: Mind Games." ''Dazed and Confused''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Renegade Aacdemia]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were affiliated with the Ccru during and after its time as part of the University of Warwick Philosophy department include philosophers [[Iain Hamilton Grant]], [[Ray Brassier]] and [[Reza Negarestani]]; cultural theorists [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and [[Kodwo Eshun]]; publisher and philosopher Robin Mackay; digital media theorists Luciana Parisi and [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]]; electronic music artist and [[Hyperdub]] label head Steve Goodman, aka [[Kode9]]; writer and theorist Anna Greenspan; novelist [[Hari Kunzru]]; and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], among others.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"/&gt; Land and the Ccru collaborated frequently with the experimental art collective 0[rphan&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;d[rift&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Maggie Roberts and Ranu Mukherjee),{{r|orphan}} notably on ''Syzygy'', a month-long multidisciplinary residency at Beaconsfield Contemporary Art gallery in South London, 1999, and on 0[rphan]d[rift&gt;]'s ''Cyberpositive'' (London: Cabinet, 1995), a schizoid work of cut-and-paste cyberphilosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orphandriftarchive.com/neofuture/ctm13-berlin.php|title=0rphan Drift :: Neo Future &gt; CTM13 Berlin|website=www.orphandriftarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The role played by Land, Plant, and the Ccru in the development of what has come to be known as [[accelerationism]] is profound, and its legacy is apparent in contemporary debates concerning the viability of the theory in its various guises.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, '[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Accelerate/Accelerate-Introduction.pdf Introduction]' to ''#Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader'', (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014) pp.1-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.{{r|mani}}&lt;ref&gt;Nick Srnicek &amp; Alex Williams, ‘[http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/ #Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics],’ Dark Trajectories: Politics of the Outside, ed. Joshua Johnson (Hong Kong, NAME, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Land himself makes this distinction clear in his commentary on the manifesto.{{r|land}}

The '''Level 3 Diploma in Financial Studies''' is an educational qualification in [[finance]] offered principally in the [[United Kingdom]]. It counts for up to 140 [[UCAS]] tariff points depending on the grade, making it the equivalent to an A2 [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] albeit with an "A" grade being the highest attainable. It consists of three examinations taken throughout the year. The exams for the first two modules can either be completed  using a computer or pen and paper and are marked electronically, these exams are multiple choice whereas the last module is a written exam involving case studies. The Diploma can only be achieved once the [[Certificate in Financial Studies]] has been taken which contains 3 of the 6 units which make up the Diploma. The certificate is equivalent to an AS-level. The Diploma in Financial Studies is produced by [[The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance]].

'''Discover Primary Science''' is a flagship [[project]] of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html Forfás Annual Report 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120014325/http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It facilitates [[teacher training]] in general primary science and provides teachers with online resources and classroom activity packs which can also be used by parents and students.

In 2008, just over 3,100 [[primary school]]s and their teachers participated in activities which included hands-on induction days which were hosted throughout the country in [[college]]s of education, [[institute of technology]], [[universities]] and education centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Scientist website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119235342/http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards of Science Excellence ==

Discover Primary Science also manages the Awards of Science Excellence each year, as well as coordinating a series of Discover Science Centres across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - The Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/images-making-the-news-692435.html?ino=4 Picture on Discover Primary Science - Front of the Irish Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools registered on the Discover Primary Science project can opt to apply for an Award of Science Excellence after they have met certain criteria for science-related activities. In 2007 and 2008, more than 1,000 schools received awards nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/news/june07/061107_primary_school.html UCD Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dominant culture''' is a cultural practice that is [[Dominance hierarchy|dominant]]  within a particular political, social or economic entity, in which multiple cultures are present. It may refer to a [[language]], [[religion]]/[[ritual]], [[value (ethics)|social value]]  and/or [[social custom]]. These features are often a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] for an entire [[society]]. It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of "dominant culture" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title= A Dictionary of Sociology | year=1998|author=Gordon Marshall|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture that is dominant within a particular [[geopolitical entity]] can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation.  In a [[multicultural]] society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of [[minority culture]]s or [[subculture]]s.

==Examples and applications==

===Native American studies===
In the [[United States]], a distinction is often made between the [[indigenous culture]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and a dominant culture that may be described as "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so on.  Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own [[Native American tribe|tribe]], community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= |date=May 1974 |title=The Native American in Juvenile Fiction: Teacher Perception  of Stereotypes |url=http://jaie.asu.edu/v13/V13S2tea.html |journal=Journal of American Indian Education |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages= |author=Maria Falkenhagen and Inga K.

===Other American groups===

[[Image:EducationFr.svg|thumb|350px|School system in France]]

The '''French educational system''' is highly centralized and organized, with many subdivisions. It is divided into the three stages of ''enseignement primaire'' (primary education), ''enseignement secondaire'' (secondary education), and ''enseignement supérieur'' (higher education). In French higher education, the following degrees are recognized by the [[Bologna Process]] (EU recognition): ''Licence'' and ''Licence Professionnelle'' (bachelor's degrees), and the comparably named ''Master'' and ''Doctorat'' degrees.

==History==

{{main article|History of education in France}}
[[File:Julesferry.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jules Ferry]]
Napoleon launched the university and secondary educational systems to [[Napoleon]]. Guizot started the elementary system.  Intense battles took place over whether the Catholic Church should play a dominant  role. The modern era of French education begins at the end of the nineteenth century. [[Jules Ferry]], a Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern school (''l'école républicaine'') by requiring all children between the ages of 6 and 12, both boys and girls, to attend. He also made public instruction mandatory, [[free education|free of charge]], and [[secular education|secular]] (''[[Laïcité|laïque]]''). With these laws, known as French Lubbers, Jules Ferry laws, and several others, the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] repealed most of the [[Falloux Laws]] of 1850–1851, which gave an important role to the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Léon Guérard , ''French civilization in the nineteenth century''(1914)  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id= online] pp 222-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
{{Update|date=April 2016}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
All educational programmes in [[France]] are regulated by the Ministry of National Education (officially called ''Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de la Jeunesse et de la Vie associative''). The head of the ministry is the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]].

The teachers in public primary and secondary schools are all state [[civil servants]], making the ''ministère'' the largest employer in the country. [[Professors]] and [[researchers]] in France's universities are also employed by the state.

At the primary and secondary levels, the [[curriculum]] is the same for all French students in any given grade, which includes public, semi-public and subsidised institutions. However, there exist specialised sections and a variety of options that students can choose. The reference for all French educators is the ''Bulletin officiel de l'éducation nationale, de l'enseignement supérieur et de la recherche (B.O.)'' which lists all current programmes and teaching directives. It is amended many times every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/default.htm|title=Le Bulletin officiel|work=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School year==
In [[Metropolitan France]], the school year runs from early September to early July. The school calendar is standardised throughout the country and is the sole domain of the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Duru-Bellat,  "France: permanence and change." in  Yan Wang, ed. '' Education policy reform trends in G20 members'' (Springer, 2013) pp. 19-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, schools need time to organise exams (for example, the [[baccalauréat]]). Outside Metropolitan France, the school calendar is set by the local ''recteur''.

Major holiday breaks are as follows:
*[[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (''la Toussaint''), two weeks (since 2012) around the end of October and the beginning of November;
*[[Christmas]] (''Noël''), two weeks around [[Christmas Day]] and [[New Year's Day]];
*winter (''hiver''), two weeks starting in mid February;
*spring (''printemps'') or [[Easter]] (''Pâques''), two weeks starting in mid April;
*summer (''été''), two months starting in early July. (mid-June for high school students).

==Primary school==
Schooling in [[France]] is not mandatory (but instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid285/bulletin_officiel.html?cid_bo=115074|title=Obligation scolaire|last=nationale|first=Ministère de l'Éducation|work=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale|access-date=2018-05-23|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; is). Most parents start sending their children to preschool (''maternelle'') when they turn 3. Some even start earlier at age 2 in ''toute petite section "TPS"''. The first two years of preschool (TPS and ''petite section'' "PS") are introductions to community living; children learn how to become students and are introduced to their first notions of arithmetic, begin to recognize scripture, develop oral language, etc. The last two years of preschool, ''moyenne section'' and ''grande section,'' are more school-like; pupils are introduced to [[reading (activity)|reading]], writing and more mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;Marie Duru-Bellat,  "France: permanence and change." in  Yan Wang, ed. '' Education policy reform trends in G20 members'' (Springer, 2013) pp. 19-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

A preschool can have its own school zone (mostly true in towns) or be affiliated to an elementary school (mostly in villages). As in other educational systems, French primary school students usually have a single teacher (or two) who teaches the complete curriculum.

After kindergarten, the young students move on to the ''école élémentaire'' (elementary school). In the first 3 years of elementary school, they learn to write, develop their reading skills and get some basics in subjects such as [[French language|French]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and the arts, to name a few. Note that the French word for a teacher at the primary school level is ''professeur'' or ''professeure des écoles'' (previously called ''instituteur'', or its feminine form ''institutrice'').

Children stay in elementary school for 5 years until they are 10–11 years-old. The grades are named: CP (''cours préparatoire''), CE1 (''cours élémentaire 1''), CE2 (''cours élémentaire 2''), CM1 (''cours moyen 1'') and CM2 (''cours moyen 2''). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N54&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|Secondary education in France}}
After primary school, two [[educational stage]]s follow:&lt;ref&gt;Marie Duru-Bellat,  "France: permanence and change." in  Yan Wang, ed. '' Education policy reform trends in G20 members'' (Springer, 2013) pp. 19-32.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''collège''''' ([[middle school]]), for children during their first four years of [[secondary education]] from the age of 11 to 15.
* '''''lycée''' (''[[high school]]), which provides a three-year course of further secondary education for children between the ages of 15 and 18. Pupils are prepared for the ''[[baccalauréat]]'' (baccalaureate, colloquially known as ''le bac'') or the CAP (Ce''rtificat d'aptitude professionnelle''). The ''baccalauréat'' can lead to higher education studies or directly to professional life.
* '''''CFA''' (centre de formation des apprentis'', apprentice learning center), which provides vocational degrees: le ''Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle''.

==International education==
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Home|website=Iscresearch.com|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed France as having 105 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Information &gt; ISC News|website=Iscresearch.com|accessdate=2016-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms: "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has its own international school regulator, the AEFE (Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger).

==Higher education==
{{see also|List of colleges and universities in France|Academic ranks in France}}
Higher education in France is organized in three levels, which correspond to those of other European countries, facilitating international mobility: the ''Licence'' and ''Licence Professionnelle'' ([[bachelor's degrees]]), and the [[Master's degree in Europe|Master's]] and [[Doctorate|Doctorat]] degrees.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The Licence and the Master are organized in semesters: 6 for the Licence and 4 for the Master.&lt;ref name="La Licence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20277/la-licence.html |title=La Licence|language=French|website=enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |date=2016-07-19 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Master"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20193/le-master.html |title=Le Master|language=French|website=enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |date=2016-07-19 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These levels of study include various "parcours" or paths based on UE (Unités d’Enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS); a student accumulates these credits, which are generally transferable between paths.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A Licence is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained; a Master is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained.&lt;ref name="La Licence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Master"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ben-David, Joseph and Philip G. Altbach. eds. ''Centers of Learning: Britain, France, Germany, United States'' (2nd ed. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;


Licence and master's degrees are offered within specific ''domaines'' and carry a specific ''mention''. ''Spécialités'' which are either research-oriented or professionally oriented during the second year of the Master. There are also Professional Licences whose objective is immediate job integration. It is possible to later return to school through continuing education or to validate professional experience (through VAE, Validation des Acquis de l’Expérience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/N11129.xhtml |title=Validation des acquis de l'expérience (VAE) |language=French |website=Vosdroits.service-public.fr |date=2011-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711060140/http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/N11129.xhtml |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Higher education in France is divided between [[grandes écoles]] and public universities. The grandes écoles admit the graduates of the level [[Baccalauréat]] + 2 years of validated study (or sometimes directly after the [[Baccalauréat]]) whereas universities admit all graduates of the [[Baccalauréat]].

A striking trait of French higher education, compared with other countries, is the small size and multiplicity of establishments, each specialised in a more-or-less broad spectrum of areas. A middle-sized French city, such as [[Grenoble]] or [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], may have 2 or 3 universities (focused on science or sociological studies) and also a number of engineering and other establishments specialised higher education. In [[Paris]] and its suburbs there are 13 universities, none of which is specialised in one area or another, and a large number of smaller institutions that are highly specialised. It is not uncommon for graduate teaching programmes ([[master's degree]]s, the course part of [[PhD]] programmes etc.) to be operated in common by several institutions, allowing the institutions to present a larger variety of courses.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. A. Deer, ''Higher Education in England and France Since the 1980s'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering schools and the professional degrees of universities, a large share of the teaching staff is often made up of non-permanent professors; instead, part-time professors are hired to teach one only specific subject. The part-time professors are generally hired from neighbouring universities, research institutes or industries.

Another original feature of the French higher education system is that a large share of the scientific research is carried out by research establishments such as [[CNRS]] or [[INSERM]], which are not formally part of the universities. However, in most cases, the research units of those establishments are located inside universities (or other higher education establishments) and jointly operated by the research establishment and the university.

===Tuition costs===
Since higher education is funded by the state, the fees are very low; the tuition varies from €150 to €700 depending on the university and the different levels of education. (''licence, master, doctorate''). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. Additionally, students from low-income families can apply for scholarships, paying nominal sums for tuition or textbooks, and can receive a monthly stipend of up to €450 per month.

The tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities, albeit a little higher (around €700). However it can reach €7,000 a year for private engineering schools, and some business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15,000 a year.

Health insurance for students is free until the age of 20 so only the costs of living and books have to be added. After the age of 20, the health insurance for students costs €200 a year and cover most of the medical expenses.

Some public schools have other ways of gaining money. Some do not receive sufficient funds from the government for class trips and other extra activities and so these schools may ask for a small (optional) entrance fee for new students.

===Universities in France===
{{see also|List of public universities in France|University reform in France}}
The public universities in France are named after the major cities near which they are located, followed by a numeral if there are several. Paris, for example, has thirteen universities, labelled Paris I to XIII. Some of these are not in [[Paris]] itself, but in the suburbs. In addition, most of the universities have taken a more informal name which is usually that of a famous person or a particular place. Sometimes, it is also a way to honor a famous alumnus, for example the science university in Strasbourg is known as "Université [[Louis Pasteur]]" while its official name is "Université Strasbourg I" (however, since 2009, the three universities of Strasbourg have been merged).&lt;ref&gt;Ben-David, Joseph and Philip G. Altbach. eds. ''Centers of Learning: Britain, France, Germany, United States'' (2nd ed. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The French system has undergone a reform, the [[Bologna process]], which aims at creating European standards for university studies, most notably a similar time-frame everywhere, with three years devoted to the bachelor's degree ("licence" in French), two for the Master's, and three for the doctorate. French universities have also adopted the ECTS credit system (for example, a licence is worth 180 credits). However the traditional curriculum based on end of semester examinations still remains in place in most universities. This double standard has added complexity to a system which also remains quite rigid. It is difficult to change a major during undergraduate studies without losing a semester or even a whole year. Students usually also have few course selection options once they enroll in a particular diploma.

France also hosts various branch colleges of foreign universities. These include [[Baruch College]], the [[University of London Institute in Paris]], [[Parsons Paris School of Art and Design]] and the [[American University of Paris]].

===''Grandes écoles''===
{{main article|Grandes écoles}}

The ''grandes écoles'' of France are elite higher-education establishments. They are generally focused on a single subject area (e.g., [[engineering]] or [[business]]), have a small size (typically between 100 and 300 graduates per year), and are highly selective. They are widely regarded as prestigious,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Education.html|accessdate=2009-06-07|title= Understanding the "Grandes Ecoles" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/grande-%C3%A9cole |title=grande école |work=French to English translation by CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 02, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of France's scientists and [[corporate officer|executives]] have graduated from a ''grande école''.

National rankings are published every year by various magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/palmares-des-grandes-ecoles-de-commerce/ L'Étudiant, Palmarès des grandes écoles de commerce].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/palmares-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs/ L'Étudiant, Palmarès des écoles d'ingénieurs].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/palmares/ Le Figaro, Classement des écoles de commerce].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usinenouvelle.com/classement-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs L'Usine nouvelle, Palmarès des écoles d'ingénieurs].&lt;/ref&gt; While these rankings slightly vary from year to year, the top ''grandes écoles'' have been very stable for decades:

* science and engineering: [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]], [[Ecole Polytechnique]], [[Mines ParisTech]], [[SUPAERO|ISAE-Supaéro]] and [[CentraleSupélec]];
* humanities: three [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]] and [[Ecole des Chartes]];

===Preparatory classes (CPGEs)===
{{main article|Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles}}

The '''[[Preparatory classes]]''' (in French "''classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles''" or CPGE), widely known as ''prépas'', is a prep course with the main goal of training students for enrollment in a ''grande école''. Admission to CPGEs is based on performance during the last two years of high school, called ''Première'' and ''Terminale''. Only 5% of a generation is admitted to a ''prépa''. CPGEs are usually located within high schools but pertain to tertiary education, which means that each student must have successfully passed their ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' (or equivalent) to be admitted in a CPGE. Each CPGE receives applications from hundreds of applicants worldwide{{Citation needed|reason=lack of accuracy|date=March 2009}} every year in April and May, and selects students based on its own criteria. A few CPGEs, mainly the private ones (which account for 10% of CPGEs), also have an interview process or look at a student's involvement in the community.

The ratio of CPGE students who fail to enter any ''grande école'' is lower in scientific and business CPGEs than in humanities CPGEs.

====Scientific CPGEs====
The oldest CPGEs are the scientific ones, which can only be accessed by scientific [[Baccalauréat|Bacheliers]]. Scientific CPGE are called TSI ("Technology and Engineering Science"), MPSI ("Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Science"), PCSI ("Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering Science") or PTSI ("Physics, Technology, and Engineering Science") in the first year, MP ("Mathematics and Physics"), PSI ("Physics and Engineering Science"), PC ("Physics and Chemistry") or PT ("Physics and Technology") in the second year and BCPST ("Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Life and Earth Sciences").

First year CPGE students are called the "Math Sup"—or ''Hypotaupe''—(Sup for "Classe de Mathématiques Supérieures", superior in French, meaning post-high school), and second years "Math Spé"—or ''Taupe''—(Spés standing for "Classe de Mathématiques Spéciales", special in French). The students of these classes are called ''Taupins''. Both the first and second year programmes include as much as twelve hours of mathematics teaching per week, ten hours of physics, two hours of philosophy, two to four hours of (one or two) foreign languages teaching and four to six hours of options: either chemistry, ''SI'' (Engineering Industrial Science) or ''Theoretical Computer Science'' (including some programming using the [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] or [[Categorical Abstract Machine Language|CaML]] programming languages, as a practical work). With this is added several hours of [[homework]], which can rise as much as the official hours of class. A known joke among those students is that they are becoming moles for two years, sometimes three. This is actually the origin of the nicknames ''taupe'' and ''taupin'' (''taupe'' being the French word for a mole).

====Business CPGEs====
There are also CPGE which are focused on economics (who prepare the admission in [[:Category:Business schools in France|business schools]]). These are known as "Prépa EC" (short for ''Economiques et Commerciales'') and are divided into two parts : prépa ECS, which focuses more on mathematics, generally for those who graduated the scientific baccalaureat and prépa ECE, which focuses more on economics, for those who were in the economics section in high school.

====Humanities CPGEs (Hypokhâgne and Khâgne)====
The literary and humanities CPGEs have also their own nicknames, ''Hypokhâgne'' for the first year and ''Khâgne'' for the second year. The students are called the ''khâgneux''. These classes prepare for schools such as the three [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]], the [[Ecole des Chartes]], and sometimes [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris|Sciences Po]].

There are two kinds of [[Khâgne|''Khâgnes'']]. The ''Khâgne de Lettres'' is the most common, and focuses on philosophy, French literature, history and languages. The ''Khâgne de Lettres et Sciences Sociales'' (Literature and Social Sciences), otherwise called Khâgne B/L, also includes mathematics and socio-economic sciences in addition to those literary subjects.

The students of Hypokhâgne and Khâgne (the humanities CPGE) are simultaneously enrolled in universities, and can go back to university in case of failure or if they feel unable to pass the highly competitive entrance examinations for the ''[[Écoles Normales Supérieures]]''.

====Colles====
The amount of work required of the students is exceptionally high. In addition to class time and homework, students spend several hours each week completing oral exams called ''colles'' (sometimes written 'khôlles' to look like a Greek word, this way of writing being initially a ''khâgneux{{'}}s'' joke, since ''khâgneux'' study Ancient Greek). The ''colles'' are unique to French academic education in CPGEs.

In scientific and business CPGEs, ''colles'' consist of oral examinations twice a week, in French, foreign languages (usually English, German, or Spanish), maths, physics, philosophy, or geopolitics—depending on the type of CPGE. Students, usually in groups of three or four, spend an hour facing a professor alone in a room, answering questions and solving problems.

In humanities CPGEs, ''colles'' are usually taken every quarter in every subject. Students have one hour to prepare a short presentation that takes the form of a French-style ''dissertation'' (a methodologically codified essay, typically structured in 3 parts: thesis, counter-thesis, and synthesis) in history, philosophy, etc. on a given topic, or the form of a ''commentaire composé'' (a methodologically codified commentary) in literature and foreign languages. In Ancient Greek or Latin, they involve a translation and a commentary. The student then has 20 minutes to present his/her work to the teacher, who finally asks some questions on the presentation and on the corresponding topic.

''Colles'' are regarded as very stressful, particularly due to the high standards expected by the teachers, and the subsequent harshness that may be directed at students who do not perform adequately. But they are important insofar as they prepare the students, from the very first year, for the oral part of the highly competitive examinations, which are reserved for the happy few who successfully pass the written part.

===Recruitment of teachers===
Decades ago,{{When|date=July 2016}} primary school teachers were educated in Ecoles Normales and secondary teachers recruited through the "Agrégation" examination. The situation has been diversified by the introduction in the 1950s of the CAPES examination for secondary teachers and in the 1990s by the institution of "[[Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres|Instituts Universitaires de Formation des Maîtres]]" (IUFM), which have recently been renamed Écoles Supérieures du Professorat et de l’Éducation (ESPE). University teachers are recruited by special commissions, and are divided between:

* "teachers-researchers" (enseignants-chercheurs), with at least a doctorate: they teach classes and conduct research in their field of expertise with a full tenure. They are either Maître de Conférences (Senior lecturers), or Professeurs (Professors). Only a Professor can be the director of studies for a PhD student. The net pay is from 2,300 to 8,800 (with extra duties) euros per month. Net salaries of over 4,000 euros per month (2011 level) are however very unusual, and limited to the small minority of teacher-researchers who have held the grade of first class full professor for at least seven years, which is rare. The maximum possible net salary for second-class full professors and chief senior lecturers (maître de conférence hors classe)—the end of career status for most full-time teacher-researchers in French universities—is 3,760 euros a month (2011)—and only a minority of this group ever reach this level.
* Secondary school teachers who have been permanently assigned away from their original school position to teach in a university. They are not required to conduct any research but teach twice as many hours as the "teachers-researchers". They are called PRAG (professeurs agrégés) and PRCE (professeurs certifiés). Their weekly service is 15 or 18 hours. The net pay is from 1,400 to 3,900 euros per month.
* CPGE teachers are usually "agrégés" or "chaire sup", assigned by the Inspection Général according to their qualifications and competitive exam rank as well as other factors. Their weekly service is about 9 hours a week, 25 or 33 weeks a year. Net pay : from 2,000 to 7,500 euro (extra hours)
* Primary school and kindergarten teachers (Professeurs des écoles), educated in "[[Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres|Instituts Universitaires de Formation des Maîtres]]" (IUFM), have usually a "master" (Bac+5). Their weekly service is about 28 hours a week.

==Religion==
Religious instruction is not given by public schools (except for 6- to 18-year-old students in [[Alsace-Moselle]] under the [[Concordat of 1801]]). ''[[Laïcité]]'' (secularism) is one of the main precepts of the [[France|French republic]].

In a March 2004 ruling, the French government banned all "conspicuous religious symbols" from schools and other public institutions with the intent of preventing [[proselitism|proselytisation]] and to foster a sense of tolerance among ethnic groups. Some [[religious]] groups showed their opposition, saying the law hindered the freedom of religion as protected by the French constitution.

{{see also|French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools}}

==Statistics==
The [[French Republic]] has 67 million inhabitants, living in the 13 regions of metropolitan [[France]] and four overseas departments (2.7 million). Despite the fact that the population is growing (up 0.4% a year), the proportion of young people under 25 is falling. There are now{{when|date=August 2015}} fewer than 19 million young people in metropolitan France, or 32% of the total population, compared with 40% in the 1970s and 35% at the time of the 1990 census. France is seeing a slow aging of the population—less marked however than in other neighbouring countries (such as [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), especially as the annual number of births is currently increasing slightly.

Eighteen million pupils and students, i.e. a quarter of the population, are in the education system. Of these, over 2.4 million are in [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabla-Langlois|first1=Isabelle|last2=Dauphin|first2=Laurence|title=Students in higher education|url=http://publication.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/eesr/8EN/EESR8EN_ES_11-students_in_higher_education.php|website=Higher education &amp; research in France, facts and figures - 49 indicators|publisher=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche|accessdate=23 November 2015|location=Paris|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Education Minister reported in 2000 that 39 out of 75,000 state schools were "[[school violence|seriously violent]]" and 300 were "somewhat violent".&lt;ref&gt;Lichfield, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4517">'''Estella Bagnelle''' (also known as '''Mary Estelle Bagnelle''') was an American [[state school|public school]] educator and administrator serving in the roles of teacher, principal of schools, member of the board of education, and county superintendent of schools. She served as County Superintendent of Instruction for [[Madera County, California]] from 1899 until 1911.&lt;ref name="herhatwasinthering.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Estelle Bagnelle|url=http://www.herhatwasinthering.org/biography.php?id=4828|website=herhatwasinthering.org|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Her father, J. D. Bagnelle, was born in [[Mississippi]], of an old [[Southern United States|southern]] family descended from French progenitors and identified with the early history of [[Virginia]]. During his early manhood, he moved to [[Illinois]] and engaged in the mercantile business at [[Litchfield, Illinois|Litchfield]], until his early death. He married Amanda Slaughter (born December 28, 1901, [[Tennessee]]). The Slaughter family is traced back to 1608 in Scotland, and three brothers coming from that country founded the family in America.{{sfn|Guinn|1905|p=697}}

Estella Bagnelle's education, begun in Litchfield, her native town, was completed in the state normal school of [[San Jose, California]] (now [[San Jose State University]]), from which she was graduated in 1885.{{sfn|Guinn|1905|p=697}}

==Career==
After teaching for a year in San Jose, in 1887 she began to teach in the district schools of Madera county, and afterward was for eight years connected with the Madera schools. During the first six years of this time, she held the position of vice-principal and then for two years served as principal. In 1898, she was nominated for county superintendent of schools on the Democratic ticket and received a majority of 140, taking the oath of office in January, 1899, for a term of four years. At the expiration of that time, in 1902, she was re-elected without opposition.{{sfn|Guinn|1905|p=697}}

There are four improvements for which she has labored indefatigably, namely: uniformity of text books; higher standard of teachers; better salaries; and more interest among trustees. Aside from her duties as superintendent, she served as secretary of the San Joaquin Teachers’ Association, was interested in the National Educational Association, and had sympathy with all movements for the benefit of the profession. May, 1893, she was chosen a member of the county board of education, at the time of the organization of Madera county, and after 1899, she officiated as secretary of the board.{{sfn|Guinn|1905|p=697-98}}

==Personal life==
After retiring in January, 1911, she married the miner, Oscar H. McDonald, of [[Coarsegold, California]] on April 5, in [[Oakland]], and they removed to [[Nome, Alaska]] on May 1.{{sfn|Wagner|1911|p=189}}

[[Image:Beijingguozijianpic.jpg|thumb|The ''Guozijian'' (Imperial College) of Beijing]]
The '''Guozijian''',&lt;ref name="Yuan 194"&gt;Yuan, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes translated as the '''Imperial College''', '''Imperial Academy''', '''Imperial University''', '''National Academy''',  or '''National University''',&lt;ref name="MoteTwitchett1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick W. Mote|author2=Denis Twitchett|title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=archery&amp;f=false|date=26 February 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the national central institution of higher learning in [[Chinese dynasties]] after the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]]. It was the highest institution of academic research and learning in [[China]]'s traditional educational system, with the function of administration of education.

In Vietnam, the Imperial Academy ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Quốc Tử Giám) existed after the [[Lý dynasty]]. Several notable chairmans of Guozijian in Vietnam history are Chu Văn An, Nguyễn Phi Khanh, [[Vũ Miên]], and [[Lê Quý Đôn]].

==History==
[[File:The Kwo-tze-keen, or National University.jpg|thumb]]
Formerly it was called the [[Taixue]], literally meaning "Imperial University". The Taixue for Gongsheng (''tribute students'') from the populace was part of Guozijian, along with Guozixue for noble students. The central schools of taixue were established as far back as 3 CE, when a standard nationwide school system was established and funded during the reign of [[Emperor Ping of Han]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Sui dynasty]], it was called Guozijian (Kuotzuchien).

At the Guozijian, law, math, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming [[Hongwu Emperor]].&lt;ref name="MoteTwitchett1988 2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick W. Mote|author2=Denis Twitchett|title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=archery&amp;f=false|date=26 February 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guozijian was shut down in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;During the 1898 reform of the Qing Dynasty, the education and administration of education functions of Guozijian was mainly replaced by the Imperial Capital University (also translated as Imperial University of Peking), later known as [[Peking University]]. So some claim Peking University to be the successor of the Guozijian. [[National Central University]] ([[Nanking University]]) takes Nanking Kuotzuchien in Ming (later Nanking Academy in Qing) as its predecessor.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on the modern school system including universities was adopted. At first, it mainly embodied the modern European and Japanese model, and afterwards was heavily influenced by American model.

==Locations==
[[File:Imperial Academy of Hue.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the Imperial Academy in Huế, central Vietnam]]
Guozijian were located in the national capital of each dynasty, such as [[Chang'an]], [[Luoyang]] and [[Kaifeng]]. In early years of [[Ming]], Guozijian was in [[Nanjing]], and then there were two capitals, thus there were two Guozijian, [[Nanking Kuotzuchien|one in Nanjing]] and one in [[Beijing]]. During the [[Qing dynasty]], Guozijian was in [[Beijing]].

The [[Guozijian (Beijing)|Beijing Guozijian]], located at the [[Guozijian Street]] in the [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]], was the imperial college during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties; most of the current buildings were built during the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geissfoundation.org/insider_beijing/temples/guozijian.htm|title=Guozijian|publisher=[[James Geiss (Academic)|James P. Geiss]] Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last Guozijian in China and the  predecessor of [[Peking University]].

==Early life==
Henrik Valeur was born in [[Denmark]] in 1966 to visual artist Mogens Valeur and fashion designer Birgitte Valeur. His grandfathers were both civil engineers.&lt;ref name=zingy&gt;Niveditha Ravikumar.

==Career==
===Denmark, Sweden===
In 1995 Henrik Valeur started out on his own making competition entries of which a few were awarded, including a proposal for a new entrance to [[Copenhagen Zoo]]&lt;ref&gt;"Jury’s comment: The small – and rather inaccessible – project resembles an elevated landscape, through which a vigorously formed passage is cut out. The proposal is praised for its artistic nerve." ("Dommerkomiteens bemærkninger: Det lille - og meget vanskeligt tilgængelige - projekt har karakter af et hævet landskabeligt terræn, hvorigennem der skæres en stærkt formet passage. Forslaget fremhæves for sin kunstneriske nerve.") [[:dk:Arkitekten|Arkitekten]] no. 17, Konkurrencehæfte 48 (p.12), 1996, ISSN 0004-198X (in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt; and for a new university on [[Amager]] (U97),&lt;ref&gt;"Jury’s comment [excerpts]: With its numerous layers of identity and use the overall structure can be seen as a place where dialogue and concentration meet. [...] As a whole, this entry can be seen as a contribution to the discussion of the university of the future and ways in which planning can actively intervene in a building project which is to be developed over an extended period of time."

With Swedish architect and comedian [[:sv:Fredrik Fritzson|Fredrik Fritzson]], he initiated CoMa in 2001 – a research project about the newly formed [[Øresund Region]], centered on the cities of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]], hence the name CoMa, and the urban regions of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pearl River Delta]]/[[Hong Kong]]. The project was based on a “diagnosis of society as a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society.

==Concerns==
===Natural environment===
According to Henrik Valeur, city and nature should be mixed.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

In a feature article in [[Politiken]] (2009) he argued that in response to [[climate change]], i.e. [[extreme weather]], [[sea level rise]] and [[stormwater]] etc., ecology and urbanity must be integrated. But rather than moving the city out into the countryside, as [[Ebenezer Howard]] had proposed with his [[Garden city movement|garden city]] concept more than a hundred years earlier, Henrik Valeur suggested that nature be incorporated in the city both physically, for instance in the form of soil and vegetation that can absorb excess water, and conceptually, in the way we think about cities.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Valeur.

The book ''[[India: the Urban Transition]]'' (2014) provides a number of examples, including the revitalization and integration of an existing system of water canals with a new network of pathways for pedestrians in the city of Bangalore,&lt;ref name=Mukta /&gt; the replacement of asphalt with natural surfaces, so-called ''green streets'', in the city of Chandigarh and the use of plants and natural ventilation to create fresh air inside an office building,&lt;ref name=Chopra /&gt; in which the plants are also used as movable space dividers with the interior planning being based on principles of [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name=India /&gt;

===Smart city===
While in favor of urban development, as a means of creating development in the so-called "[[Developing country|developing]]" world,&lt;ref&gt;“Thus, instead of encouraging people to remain in the rural areas, as development aid generally does, people must be encouraged to move to cities, where living conditions, job opportunities, education and health care can and must be improved.” Henrik Valeur. [[India: the Urban Transition|''India: the Urban Transition – a Case Study of Developmemt Urbanism'']] (p.16), Architectural Publisher B, 2014, {{ISBN|978-87-92700-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik Valeur has voiced concern about the concept of [[smart city]] floated by Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Concept-of-smart-cities-created-by-IT-companies/articleshow/46448754.cms ''Concept of smart cities created by IT companies''], [[Times of India]], March 4, 2015. Retrieved on September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Henrik Valeur the "concerns related to the concept of smart city have to do with the issues of control and surveillance, the risk of corruption, misuse and mismanagement, and the prospect of smart cities becoming exclusive enclaves for the rich".&lt;ref name=zingy /&gt;

==Concepts==
===Parallel processing===
In response to the tradition of central control and the associated principle of [[determinism]] in Scandinavian planning, Henrik Valeur, in collaboration with Fredrik Fritzson, developed the concept of ''parallel processing'' in [[urban planning]],&lt;ref name=Stensgaard /&gt; which was discussed at the ''6th European Biennal of Towns and Town Planning'' in 2005&lt;ref name=Process /&gt; and implemented in the development of [[Musicon]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Urbanism /&gt;

“The objective of parallel processing is not only to [[Democratization|democratize]] the planning process, but also to let mutual understanding and inspiration generate results, which are more than the sum of the individual interests.” This should be achieved by “establishing planning processes that engage all of the parties involved throughout the entire sequence”.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

Rather than involving the various actors and stakeholders one after the other at various stages of the process (a serial process) they should all be involved from the very beginning and be able to interact with each other and with the relevant authorities throughout the process (open-ended planning processes were proposed).&lt;ref name=Stensgaard /&gt; To this end, and in order to promote flexibility and experimentation, new planning methods and instruments, such as the 1:1 sketch model, the 4D+ model, the Change Design Model, role plays and scenario games, were introduced along with the use of new [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]].&lt;ref name=Process /&gt;

===Co-evolution===
In biology, “the term [[coevolution|co-evolution]] is used to describe cases where two (or more) species reciprocally affect each other's evolution”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_33 ''Understanding evolution'']. [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley University]]. Retrieved on October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrik Valeur introduced the concept of co-evolution in architecture in 2006 as curator of the project ''CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China'' for which he asked four young architecture offices from Denmark to work together with planners and researchers from four Chinese universities to answer the question: "How can China proceed with its ambitious project to improve living conditions for its population without exhausting the very resources needed to sustain a better life?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://free-soil.org/index.php?post_id=715&amp;comment=yes Co-Evolution], Free Soil, November 14, 2007. Retrieved on March 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bert /&gt;

By creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate “creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development".&lt;ref name=co&gt;Henrik Valeur (ed.). ''CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China'', [[Danish Architecture Centre]], 2006, {{ISBN|87-90668-61-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrik Valeur later argued that: "As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people".&lt;ref name=India /&gt;

===Development urbanism===
In 2010, Henrik Valeur wrote an op-ed in the Danish newspaper [[Dagbladet Information|Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Valeur.

[http://henrikvaleur.dk/files/The_Poor_Are_Moving_To_Town.pdf ''The poor are moving to town'']. Retrieved on October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book [[India: the Urban Transition|''India: the Urban Transition - a Case Study of Development Urbanism'']], which can be seen as a "call for action to everyone who wants to make a positive and concrete difference to the urban environments of developing societies",&lt;ref name=Chopra /&gt; Henrik Valeur describes development urbanism as “a multidisciplinary field that is focused on sustainable urban development as a means of combating [[poverty]] and its related illnesses and of protecting the [[Natural environment|environment]], the [[climate]] and the [[Natural resource|resources]]. It addresses basic human concerns in urban settings, seeing cities not as “dumb” [[machine]]s but rather as sophisticated [[ecology|ecologies]] in which people are adapting to a constantly changing environment”.&lt;ref name=India /&gt;

The concept of development urbanism can be seen as an alternative to the concept of [[smart city]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamakaan.com/events/1957 ''Development urbanism - an alternative to the "smart city" concept''], [[Lamakaan]], February 1, 2015.

Retrieved on September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Said Henrik Valeur: “There are obviously too many unresolved problems in our cities today, but my point is that many of these problems can be solved by very simple and inexpensive means. Smart technologies are rarely necessary and may, in fact, create more problems than they solve”.&lt;ref name=tekton1 /&gt;

== Early life ==

Robertson grew up in [[Ludlow]], [[Shropshire]]. Her background is [[gymnastics]] in which she participated from the age of six to thirteen until she [[Spinal disc herniation|slipped a disc]]. She achieved third place at the British Championships in the [[Vault (gymnastics)|vaulting horse]], later getting into [[hip hop dance]]. Robertson names [[Levell Smith Junior]] as her biggest influence.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 she attended the Midlands Academy of Dance and Drama in [[Nottingham]] for a two-year course in [[musical theatre]].

== Career before Strictly Dance Fever ==

In 2004, Robertson won choreographer [[Wade Robson]]'s [[MTV]] show, ''Shakedown'', taking the title of best dancer in Europe. In 2005, she was a backing dancer in the video of the single "[[Only U]]" by [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]]. She has also danced for [[Rachel Stevens]] and [[McFly]].

== Strictly Dance Fever ==

{{See also|Strictly Dance Fever}}

''Strictly Dance Fever'' is an amateur dance competition broadcast on the BBC, consisting of several rounds of auditions followed by weekly live shows in which one couple is voted off each week until three couples are left for the final live show. Voting is done by professional judges and the viewing public, each making up 50% of the total score. The four judges award scores out of ten, while the public phones in to vote for their favourite. During the weeks of the live shows, the couples live together in a ''Dance Mansion'' where they receive intensive training.

The show is open to non-professional dancers over the age of 18.&lt;ref name="pressfinal"/&gt; Even though Robertson had previously won a similar competition on MTV called ''Shakedown'' and had been awarded the title of best dancer in Europe, she was not a professional dancer and therefore was allowed to enter.

Robertson participated in series two, which was broadcast in the spring of 2006. In that series 80,000 participants applied for the auditions. Over a million telephone votes were cast over the course of the series.&lt;ref name="pressfinal"/&gt;

Robertson auditioned with her boyfriend Bruno. Eventually he was not selected for the live shows and she was partnered with [[Darrien Wright]]. Robertson and Wright won the final on 3 June 2006 beating [[Darren Bailey]] and [[Lana Williams]].

Robertson and Wright received the top score of ten out of ten of all the judges on both their dances in the final.&lt;ref name="pressfinal"/&gt; They performed [[Milonga (dance)|The Milonga]] and a freestyle dance. In an earlier round they had also achieved the highest possible score for one of their dances.

The prize consisted of ₤50,000 for the couple and a contract to dance for one week in the production of ''[[Footloose (musical)|Footloose]]'' on the [[West End theatre|West End]]. Robertson said after winning the final: "I want to put the prize money towards a dance studio so I can teach."&lt;ref name="pressfinal"&gt;

== Career after Strictly Dance Fever ==

As part of their prize, Robertson and Wright won a professional dance contract. This culminated early in July 2006 when, for a week, the pair took to the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as background dancers in ''[[Footloose (musical)|Footloose]]'' in [[London]]'s [[Novello Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[David Essex]] and [[Cheryl Baker]] also starred in the show.

Robertson's career suffered a minor set-back when she was injured after an attack on holiday in Portugal. Regarding this incident she's quoted as saying: "I've never had anything so painful happen to me in my life before. It was horrible, absolutely horrible. [...] Stuff happens to you in life and you just have to get on with it and as long as I don't stop dancing it's ok...I'll be ok."&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14201">The '''International Moral Education Congress''' was an international [[academic conference]] held in Europe six times between 1908 and 1934. It convened because of an interest in moral education by many countries beginning a decade before the inaugural event. The movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; The idea to hold the congress was at the behest of the International Union of Ethical Societies; its greatest proponents were Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster]] and [[Gustav Spiller]], the secretary of the Union.&lt;ref name=Sadler1909&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=M.

==Background==
The Moral Education League of London was founded in 1897. This organization exercised a considerable influence, not only in the United Kingdom but in various parts of the British Empire and throughout the world. Its president was [[John Stuart Mackenzie]]. Among its members were Catholics, Anglicans, Jews, Unitarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Nonconformists, Ethicists, Rationalists, Positivists, and others. Its secretary was Harrold Johnson, who was later appointed Hon. Secretary of the International Moral Education Congress Executive Council. The league also employed a demonstrator, [[Frederick James Gould]], who acquired an international reputation for his numerous 
books on moral lessons. This League succeeded in 1906 in inducing the Board of Education to make provision for moral instruction in the education code for England and Wales.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aikins|first1=J.A.M.|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912 and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7062408M/Report_on_the_second_International_Moral_Education_Congress_at_The_Hague_August_1912|location=Ottawa|pages=3-|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a new Italian Education Code was published, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year, a new Hungarian Education Code was issued. In 1905, a new Austrian Education Code came to light. In Portugal, a manual of Moral Instruction for Primary Schools, as distinct from Religious Instruction, was officially published in 1906. In the United States, schemes of moral instruction were elaborated in many places. In Germany, the Reading Books for Elementary Schools contained abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland, several Cantons took distinct steps in the direction of drawing up Moral Instruction Programmes. In Belgium, Moral Instruction Syllabuses for Primary Schools and for Training Colleges existed. In France and Japan, where moral instruction was introduced, the subject was being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia, the authorities were turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England, the Code of the Board of Education for 1906 stated that "Moral instruction should form an important part of every school curriculum". Educationists generally laid increasing emphasis on the moral factor in education, while men in every walk of life came more and more to feel that the training of the intellect must be accompanied by the development of character if the school is to serve effectively the nation and humanity. This movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt;

==1908==
[[File:Sir Michael Ernest Sadler photo by George Charles Beresford 1914.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Michael Ernest Sadler, president of the First Congress]]
The First Congress was held at the [[University of London]], London, England, on September 25–29, 1908.&lt;ref name=archive.org1st&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Spiller, Gustav|title=Papers on moral education, communicated to the first International Moral Education Congress held at the University of London September 25-29, 1908; (1908)|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924030610954|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]] served as president. The Congress counted altogether some 1,800 members and 2,000 volumes of the Papers on Moral Education were disposed of within less than four weeks after the first Congress met.&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; Both the educational magazines and the leading daily papers rendered valuable assistance to the Congress. There were sessions on the following topics: The Principles of Moral Education; Aims, Means and Limitations in the various types of schools; Character Building by Discipline, Influence and Opportunity; the Problems of Moral Instruction; Relation of Religious Education to Moral Education; Systematic Moral Instruction; The Relation of Moral Education to Education under Other Aspects; the Problem of Moral Education under varying conditions of Age and Opportunity; Biology and Moral Education.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1912==
The Second Congress was held at the Hague, August 22–27, 1912.&lt;ref name=archive.org2nd&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Aikins, James Albert Manning|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912, and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools (1913)|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonthesecon00unknuoft|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. J. Th. Mouton was the President of the Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="The1912"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VUwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA488|edition=Public domain|year=1912|publisher=The Publisher's Circular Limited|pages=488–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following twenty-three countries sent official government delegates: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, India (British), Ireland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Romania, South Australia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and Tunis. Over 1,000 members (apart from honorary members) were officially enrolled for the congress. Over 200 papers of some 2,000 words each were contributed and appeared in the five published volumes of more than 1,200 pages. The subjects dealt with and under discussion at the various sessions were: Moral Education and Character Building considered from the Denominationalist, the Undenominationalist and the Independent-Moralist points of view; Moral Education considered from social and national points of view Formation of the Will; Physical Training as a means of Character-Building; Moral Education considered from a Practical Point of View; the Moral Education of Adolescents; Character-Building in family life and in society at large; Character-Building of young people at educational institutions not dedicated to the ordinary primary education; Character-Building of Abnormal Children. This Congress stated it would not advocate the views of any society or party, but it would afford to all who are interested in moral education, whatever their religious or ethical convictions, nationality and point of view, an equal opportunity of expressing their opinions and comparing them with those of others. This proved so good a basis that the congress with unanimity adopted it as the basis of future congresses, with the addition of the following object: The object of the Congress is to enlist the active co-operation of all, irrespective of race, nations, and creed, in promoting the work of moral education. The first aim of the Second Congress, as of the first, was to cultivate the co-operation of men and women representing different schools of thought in matters of education, giving every one an opportunity in the spirit of toleration, of defining and explaining his opinion and point of view.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1922==
[[File:AdolpheFerriereND.jpg|thumbnail|Adolphe Ferriere, president of the Third Congress]]
The Third Congress met in the Aula, or Assembly Hall, of the [[University of Geneva]], July 28 to August 1, 1922.&lt;ref name=archive.org3rd&gt;{{cite web|title=International Moral Education Congress|publisher=JSTOR|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2377499/2377499_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 members attended, representing 30 nationalities and 29 national committees. Thirty-three papers were contributed, all being published in French, in two volumes, by Delachaux, at Neuchatel. The topics were confined to (1) the international motive, with special reference to the teaching of history; and (2) the motive of service. [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] gave the inaugural address on behalf of the International Executive Council (London), and was followed by the newly elected president of the Congress, Dr. [[Adolphe Ferrière]], who was an  advocate of [[progressive education]]. Among the speakers during the eight sessions, perhaps the most popular were three—Professor Foerster; [[Albert Thomas (minister)|M. Albert Thomas]], Director of the Labor Office of the League of Nations; and [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of the Scout Movement. A special session was held in the hall of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, chaired by [[Gustav Spiller]], which included [[Nitobe Inazō]], Director of the Section of International Bureaus. The Congress approved of the establishment of an International Moral Education Bureau at the Hague, and decided to form a permanent association of educationists of the world, based on the 29 national committees already existing.&lt;ref name="National1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Education Association of the United States|title=Today's Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2IVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA316|edition=Public domain|year=1921|publisher=National Education Association|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Congress took place in [[Rome]], Italy, from September 28 to October 2, 1926. Francesco Orestano served as president.&lt;ref name="League1925"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quarterly Bulletin of Information on the Work of International Organisations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV8oAQAAMAAJ|year=1925|publisher=League of Nations|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly review==
In 2004, Marco Cicchini of the University of Geneva published his study based on a review of the proceedings and publications of the six congresses. He synthesized the congresses' aims and ideals, the theoretical and institutional outlines, the socio-professional profiles of the participants, the status of their contributions, and the disciplines invited to discuss the issues. He also noted on the changes which led to the disappearance of the congress.&lt;ref name=Paedagogica2004&gt;{{cite journal|title=Un bouillon de culture pour les sciences de l'éducation?

'''Ivan Vaughan''' (18 June 1942 – 16 August 1993) was a boyhood friend of [[John Lennon]], and later schoolmate of [[Paul McCartney]] at the [[Liverpool Institute]], both commencing school there in September 1953. He was born on the same day as McCartney in [[Liverpool]]. He played [[bass guitar|bass]] part-time in Lennon's first band, The [[Quarrymen]], and was responsible for introducing Lennon to McCartney at a community event (the [[Woolton]] village fête) on 6 July 1957, where The Quarrymen were performing. McCartney impressed Lennon, who invited McCartney to join the band, which he did a day later. This led to the formation of [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney's songwriting partnership]], and later of [[The Beatles]].

==Personal life ==
Vaughan studied [[Classics]] at [[University College, London]], married in 1966 and settled down to family life with a son and daughter, and became a teacher.

Lennon and McCartney never forgot the friend who brought them together. For a time they put Vaughan on the payroll of their Apple company, in charge of a plan that never took off to set up a school with a Sixties, hippie-style education ethos. Vaughan's wife Jan, a language teacher, was hired to sit down with Lennon and McCartney and help with the French lyrics to the 1965 song "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]".

==Autobiographic and Documentary ==
In 1977 Vaughan was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's Disease]]. His book, ''Ivan: Living with Parkinson’s Disease'' was published in 1986 and he also featured in a documentary produced for the BBC in 1984 by [[Jonathan Miller]] about his search for a cure.

Vaughan's death touched Paul McCartney so deeply that he began to write poetry for the first time since he was a child. He wrote the poem "Ivan" about him after his death, which was published in McCartney's book, ''Blackbird Singing''.

'''Kuzman Šapkarev Primary School''' (alternative spellings include Kuzman Shapkarev or Kuzman Šapkarev; {{lang-mk|ОУ „Кузман Шапкарев“}}) is a state-owned [[primary school]] in the suburb of [[Dračevo, Skopje|Dracevo]] ({{lang-mk|Драчево}}), located 10&amp;nbsp;km south from the downtown of [[Skopje]], capital of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

The school was established in 1971 (starts working January 1, 1972), when the older schools located in Dracevo, Rajko Zhinzifov Primary School and Kliment Ohridski Primary School, became too small for the rising number of students, mostly due to the new-comers in the suburb after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]]. Kuzman Shapkarev Primary School is located in a totally renovated (2006-2011) building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiselavoda.gov.mk/ |title=Локална самоуправа |publisher=Kiselavoda.gov.mk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers all the necessary conditions for a modern and interactive teaching of the pupils. As part of the school there are fully functional kitchen, sports hall and dentist office. As state's laws in Macedonia proclaim, all the school cabinets and labs are fully furnished with computers and comfortable chairs and desks that allow  normal and healthy development of children.

Kuzman Shapkarev Primary School bears the name of one of a prominent [[ethnographer]], [[folklorist]] and textbook writer from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The date of his death, March 18, is celebrated as the school day with a ceremony and sport and cultural tournaments.

The students of the school regularly participate and achieve excellent results in the regional math competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smm.org.mk/ |title=Сојуз на Математичари на Македонија |publisher=Smm.org.mk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quizzes, as well as national chemistry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ykc.edu.mk/ |title=ykc.edu.mk |publisher=ykc.edu.mk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; history, [[Macedonian Language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.ukim.edu.mk/ |title=Институт за македонски јазик "Крсте Мисирков" |publisher=Imj.ukim.edu.mk |date=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. competitions. In the preparations for these competitions, especially active are the teachers from the subject teaching programmes, who try to build a friendly and cooperative relationship with the students. Also, very active in promoting the school and achieving medals and trophies are the students participating in one of the many [[sport clubs]], the most active are the ones from the [[team handball|handball]] and [[basketball]] school teams, since these are the most popular sports in the country.

A few years ago the school started a new tradition in choosing the [[laureate]] of the graduating class. The list of the laureates in the last years goes as:
*Angela-Aleksandra Ivanovikj (2007)
*Karloina Ilievska (2008)
*[[Filip Simeski]] (2009)
*Martin Bibovski (2010)
*Jovana Sajkovska (2011)

'''Lawrence Kohlberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ɜːr|g}}; October 25, 1927 – January 19, 1987) was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] best known for his [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|theory of stages of moral development]]. He served as a professor in the Psychology Department at the [[University of Chicago]] and at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] at [[Harvard University]]. Even though it was considered unusual in his era, he decided to study the topic of moral judgment, extending [[Jean Piaget]]'s account of children's moral development from twenty-five years earlier.&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rest|first=James|author2=Clark Power |author3=Mary Brabeck |title=Lawrence Kohlberg (1927–1987)|journal=American Psychologist|date=May 1988|volume=43|series=5|pages=399–400|doi=10.1037/h0091958}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it took Kohlberg five years before he was able to publish an article based on his views.&lt;ref name="Rest"/&gt; Kohlberg's work reflected and extended not only Piaget's findings but also the theories of philosophers [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[James Mark Baldwin]].&lt;ref&gt;See Kohlberg, L. (1982), "Moral development," in J.M. Broughton &amp; D.J. Freeman-Moir (Eds.), ''The Cognitive Developmental Psychology of James Mark Baldwin: Current Theory and Research in Genetic Epistemology'', Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was creating a new field within psychology: "moral development". In an empirical study using six criteria, such as citations and recognition, Kohlberg was found to be the 30th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom, S.J. et al. (2002). The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century. ''Review of General Psychology''. Vol. 6, No. 2, 139–15. Haggbloom et al. combined three quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], with three qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) membership, American Psychological Association (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lawrence Kohlberg was born in [[Bronxville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;See Fowler, J.W., Snarey, J., and DeNicola, K. (1988), ''Remembrances of Lawrence Kohlberg: A compilation of the presentations given at the Service of Remembrance for Lawrence Kohlberg, at Memorial Church, Harvard University, on May 20, 1987'', Atlanta, GA: Center for Research in Faith and Moral Development.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of four children of Alfred Kohlberg,&lt;ref&gt;Keeley, J. (1969), ''The China Lobby Man: The Story of Alfred Kohlberg'', New Rochelle, NY: Arlington House.&lt;/ref&gt; a Jewish German entrepreneur, and of his second wife, Charlotte Albrecht, a Christian German chemist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His parents separated when he was four years old and divorced finally when he was fourteen. From 1933 to 1938, Lawrence and his three other siblings rotated between their mother and father for six months at a time. In 1938 this rotating custody of the Kohlberg children was ended, allowing the children to choose the parent with whom they wanted to live.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kohlberg attended high school at [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts, which was an elite preparatory school. Kohlberg served in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] at the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohlberg, L. (1991), "My Personal Search for Universal Morality," in L. Kuhmerker (Ed.), ''The Kohlberg Legacy for the Helping Professions'', Birmingham, AL: R.E.P. Books.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for a time with the [[Haganah]] on a ship smuggling Jewish refugees from Romania through the British Blockade, into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Laurence, "Beds for Bananas," The Menorah Journal, Autumn 1948, pp. 385–399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph W. Patzert, Running the Palestine Blockade, Airlife Publishing: Shrewsbury, England, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Captured by the British and held at an internment camp on Cyprus, Kohlberg escaped with fellow crew members. Kohlberg was in Palestine during the fighting in 1948 to establish the state of Israel, but refused to participate and focused on nonviolent forms of activism. He also lived in an Israeli kibbutz during this time, until he was able to return to America in 1948.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same year he enrolled at the University of Chicago. At this time at Chicago it was possible to gain credit for courses by examination, and Kohlberg earned his bachelor's degree in one year, 1948. He then began study for his doctoral degree in psychology, which he completed at Chicago in 1958. In those early years he read [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s work. Kohlberg found a scholarly approach that gave a central place to the individual's reasoning in moral decision making. At the time this contrasted with the current psychological approaches of [[behaviorism]] and [[psychoanalysis]] that explained morality as simple internalization of external cultural or parental rules, through teaching using reinforcement and punishment or identification with a parental authority.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, L. (1963). The development of children's orientations toward a moral order: I. Sequence in the development of moral thought. ''Vita Humana'', ''6''(1–2), 11–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{ref improve|section|date=January 2018}}
Kohlberg's first academic appointment was at Yale University, as an assistant professor of psychology, 1958–1961. In 1955 while beginning his dissertation, he had married Lucille Stigberg, and the couple had two sons, David and Steven. Kohlberg spent a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Palo Alto, California, 1961–1962, and then joined the Psychology Department of the University of Chicago as assistant, then associate professor of psychology and human development, 1962–1967. He held a visiting appointment at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1967–68, and then was appointed Professor of Education and Social Psychology there, beginning 1968, where he remained until his death.

===Stages of moral development===
{{main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
In his unpublished 1958 dissertation, Kohlberg wrote what are now known as [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|Kohlberg's stages of moral development]].&lt;ref name="dissertation"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16 | journal=Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Chicago | year=1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stages are planes of moral adequacy conceived to explain the development of [[moral reasoning]]. Created while studying psychology at the University of Chicago, the theory was inspired by the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and a fascination with children's reactions to [[moral dilemma]]s.&lt;ref name="Crain"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crain |first=William C. |title=Theories of Development |edition=2Rev |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1985 |isbn=0-13-913617-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg proposed a form of "Socratic" moral education and reaffirmed [[John Dewey]]'s idea that development should be the aim of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kohlberg |first1=Lawrence |last2=Mayer |first2=Rochelle |date=Winter 1972 |title=Development as the aim of education |journal=[[Harvard Educational Review]] |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=449–496 |url=http://auburn.edu/~silvesb/smicha/Kohlberg&amp;Mayer.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also outlined how educators can influence moral development without indoctrination and how public school can be engaged in moral education consistent with the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Rest"/&gt;

Kohlberg's approach begins with the assumption that humans are intrinsically motivated to explore, and become competent at functioning in, their environments. In social development, this leads us to imitate role models we perceive as competent and to look to them for validation.&lt;ref&gt;"Kohlberg, L. (1969), "Stage and sequence," ''Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research'', McGraw Hill: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus our earliest childhood references on the rightness of our and others' actions are adult role models with whom we are in regular contact. Kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life, observed in universally occurring social institutions, such as families, peer groups, structures and procedures for clan or society decision-making, and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance. Endeavoring to become competent participants in such institutions, humans in all cultures exhibit similar patterns of action and thought concerning the relations of self, others, and social world. Furthermore, the more one is prompted to imagine how others experience things and imaginatively to take their roles, the more quickly one learns to function well in cooperative human interactions.

The sequence of stages of moral development thus corresponds to a sequence of progressively more inclusive social circles (family, peers, community, etc.), within which humans seek to operate competently. When those groups function well, oriented by reciprocity and mutual care and respect, growing humans adapt to larger and larger circles of justice, care, and respect. Each stage of moral cognitive development is the realization in conscious thought of the relations of justice, care, and respect exhibited in a wider circle of social relations, including narrower circles within the wider.

Kohlberg's [[theory]] holds that [[moral reasoning]], which is the basis for [[ethical]] behavior, has six identifiable developmental [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructive]] stages – each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last.&lt;ref name="higheststage" /&gt; Kohlberg suggested that the higher stages of moral development provide the person with greater capacities/abilities in terms of decision making and so these stages allow people to handle more complex dilemmas.&lt;ref name="Rest"/&gt; In studying these, Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment beyond the ages originally studied earlier by Piaget,&lt;ref name="piaget"&gt;{{cite book | last=Piaget | first=Jean | title=The Moral Judgment of the Child | publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co. | location=London | year=1932 |isbn=0-02-925240-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="higheststage"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | year=1973 | pages=630–646 | doi=10.2307/2025030 | issue=18 | publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18 | jstor=2025030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding considerably upon this groundwork, it was determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with [[justice]] and that its development continued throughout the [[life expectancy|life span]],&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt; even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of such research.&lt;ref name="philmoral"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= Essays on Moral Development, Vol. I: The Philosophy of Moral Development |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | authorlink=Lawrence Kohlberg |author2=Charles Levine |author3=Alexandra Hewer | title=Moral stages : a current formulation and a response to critics | publisher=Karger | location=Basel, NY | year=1983 |isbn=3-8055-3716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His model "is based on the assumption of co-operative social organization on the basis of justice and fairness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Some Cross-Cultural Evidence on Ethical Reasoning | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | date = May 2001 | first = Judy | last = Tsui |author2=Carolyn Windsor | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg studied moral reasoning by presenting subjects with [[moral dilemmas]]. He would then categorize and classify the reasoning used in the responses, into one of six distinct stages, grouped into three levels: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.&lt;ref name="istoought"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= From ''Is'' to ''Ought'': How to Commit the Naturalistic Fallacy and Get Away with It in the Study of Moral Development |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence | editor=T. Lickona |title=Moral Development and Behavior: Theory, Research and Social Issues |publisher=Rinehart and Winston |location=Holt, NY |year=1976 |chapter= Moral stages and moralization: The cognitive-developmental approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement"&gt;{{cite book |last=Colby |first=Anne |author2=Kohlberg, L. |title=The Measurement of Moral Judgment Vol. 2: Standard Issue Scoring Manual |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987 | isbn=0-521-24447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each level contains two stages. These stages heavily influenced others and have been utilized by others like [[James Rest]] in making the ''[[Defining Issues Test]]'' in 1979.&lt;ref name="judgingmoralissues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |title=Development in Judging Moral Issues |year=1979 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-0891-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral education ===
Kohlberg is most well-known among psychologists for his research in moral psychology, but among educators he is known for his applied work of moral education in schools. The three major contributions Kohlberg made to moral education were the use of Moral Exemplars, Dilemma Discussions, and Just Community Schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Snarey, J. R. (2012). Lawrence Kohlberg: Moral biography, moral psychology, and moral pedagogy. In W.E. Pickren, D. A. Dewsbury, M. Wertheimer, W. E. Pickren, D. A. Dewsbury, M. Wertheimer (Eds.), ''Portraits of pioneers in developmental psychology'' (pp. 277–296). New York, NY, US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg's first method of moral education was to examine the lives of moral exemplars who practiced principled morals such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Socrates, and Abraham Lincoln. He believed that moral exemplars' words and deeds increased the moral reasoning of those who watched and listened to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kohlberg never tested to see if examining the lives of moral exemplars did in fact increase moral reasoning. Recent research in moral psychology has brought back the value of witnessing moral exemplars in action or learning about their stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Algoe, S. B., &amp; Haidt, J. (2009). Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', ''4''(2),105–127. doi:10.1080/17439760802650519&lt;/ref&gt; Witnessing the virtuous acts of moral exemplars may not increase moral reasoning, but it has been shown to elicit an emotion known as moral elevation that can increase an individual's desire to be a better person and even has the potential to increase prosocial and moral behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aquino, K., McFerran, B., &amp; Laven, M. (2011). Moral identity and the experience of moral elevation in response to acts of uncommon goodness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''100''(4), 703–718. doi:10.1037/a0022540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnall, S., Roper, J., &amp; Fessler, D. M. (2010). Elevation leads to altruistic behavior. ''Psychological Science'', ''21''(3), 315–320. doi:10.1177/0956797609359882&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, J. A., &amp; Haidt, J. (2008). Moral elevation can induce nursing. ''Emotion'', ''8''(2), 291–295. doi:10.1037/1528-3542.8.2.291&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kohlberg's hypothesis that moral exemplars could increase moral reasoning might be unfounded, his understanding that moral exemplars have an important place in moral education has growing support.

Dilemma discussions in schools was another method proposed by Kohlberg to increase moral reasoning. Unlike moral exemplars, Kohlberg tested this method by integrating moral dilemma discussion into the curricula of school classes in humanities and social studies. Results of this and other studies using similar methods found that moral discussion does increase moral reasoning and works best if the individual in question is in discussion with a person who is using reasoning that is just one stage above their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The final method Kohlberg used for moral education was known as "just communities". In 1974, Kohlberg worked with schools to set up democracy-based programs, where both students and teachers were given one vote to decide on school policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The purpose of these programs were to build a sense of community in schools in order to promote democratic values and increase moral reasoning. Kohlberg's idea and development of "just communities" were greatly influenced by his time living in an Israeli kibbutz when he was a young adult in 1948 and when he was doing longitudinal cross-cultural research of moral development in another Israeli kibbutz.&lt;ref&gt;Snarey, J. R., Reimer, J., &amp; Kohlberg, L. (1985). Development of social-moral reasoning among Kibbutz adolescents: A longitudinal cross-cultural study. ''Developmental Psychology'', ''21''(1), 3–17. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Some of Kohlberg's most important publications were collected in his ''Essays on Moral Development'', Vols. I and II, ''The Philosophy of Moral Development'' (1981) and ''The Psychology of Moral Development'' (1984), published by Harper &amp; Row. Other works published by Kohlgainz or about Kohlberg's theories and research include ''Consensus and Controversy'', ''The Meaning and Measurement of Moral Development'', ''Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education'' and ''Child Psychology and Childhood Education: A Cognitive Developmental View''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/author/lawrence-kohlberg/ |title=Lawrence Kohlberg: books by Lawrence Kohlberg @ |publisher=Bookfinder.com |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
[[Carol Gilligan]], a fellow researcher of Kohlberg's in the studies of moral reasoning that led to Kohlberg's developmental stage theory, suggested that to make moral judgments based on optimizing concrete human relations is not necessarily a lower stage of moral judgment than to consider objective principles. Postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different, but not lower structure than that Kohlberg had described, Gilligan wrote ''[[In a Different Voice]]'', a book that founded a new movement of [[Ethics of care|care-based ethics]] that initially found strong resonance among [[feminists]] and later achieved wider recognition.

Kohlberg's response to Carol Gilligan's criticism was that he agreed with her that there is a care moral orientation that is distinct from a justice moral orientation, but he disagreed with her claim that women scored lower than men on measures of moral developmental stages because they are more inclined to use care orientation rather than a justice orientation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kohlberg disagreed with Gilligan's position on two grounds. First, many studies measuring moral development of males and females found no difference between men and women and when differences were found it was attributable to differences in education, work experiences, and role-taking opportunities, but not gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Second, longitudinal studies of females found the same invariant sequence of moral development as previous studies that were of just males.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, Gilligan's criticism of Kohlberg's moral development theory was centered on differences between males and females that did not exist. Kohlberg's detailed responses to numerous critics can be read in his book ''Essays on Moral Development: Vol.II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages.''

Another criticism against Kohlberg's theory was that it focused too much on reason at the expense of other factors. One problem with Kohlberg's focus on reason was that little empirical evidence found a relationship between moral reasoning and moral behavior. Kohlberg recognized this lack of a relationship between his moral stages and moral behavior. In an attempt to understand this, he proposed two sub-stages within each stage, to explain individual differences within each stage.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kohlberg, L. (1984). ''Essays on Moral Development: Vol .II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages''. San Francisco, Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; He then proposed a model of the relationship between moral judgments and moral action. According to Kohlberg,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; an individual first interprets the situation using their moral reasoning, which is influenced by their moral stage and sub-stage. After interpretation individual's make a deontic choice and a judgment of responsibility, which are both influenced by the stage and sub-stage of the individual. If the individual does decide on a moral action and their obligation to do it, they still need the non-moral skills to carry out a moral behavior. If this model is true then it would explain why research was having a hard time finding a direct relationship between moral reason and moral behavior.

Another problem with Kohlberg's emphasis on moral reasoning is growing empirical support that individuals are more likely to use intuitive "gut reactions" to make moral decisions than use reason-based thought.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Arnold, M. L. (2000). Stage, Sequence, and Sequels: Changing Conceptions of Morality, Post-Kohlberg. ''Educational Psychology Review'', ''12''(4), 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt; The high use of intuition directly challenges the place of reason in moral experience. This expanding of the moral domain from reason has raised questions that perhaps morality research is entering areas of inquiry that are not considered real morality, which was a concern of Kohlberg when he first started his research.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Scholars such as [[Elliot Turiel]] and [[James Rest]] have responded to Kohlberg's work with their own significant contributions.

==Death==
While doing cross-cultural research in [[Belize]] in 1971, Kohlberg contracted a parasitic infection. Due to this, he suffered from extreme abdominal pain. The long-term effects of the infection and the medications took their toll, and Kohlberg's health declined as he also engaged in increasingly demanding professional work, including "Just Community" prison and school moral education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Power, F.C., Higgins, A., and Kohlberg, L, ''Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education'', New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg sometimes experienced depression as well.

On January 19, 1987, Kohlberg parked at the end of a dead end street in Winthrop, Massachusetts, across from Boston's Logan Airport. He left his wallet with identification on the front seat of his unlocked car and walked into the icy Boston Harbor. His car and wallet were found within a couple of weeks, and his body was recovered some time later, with the late winter thaw, in a tidal marsh across the harbor near the end of a Logan Airport runway.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Walsh, Catherine (2000). "The Life and Legacy of Lawrence Kohlberg", ''Society'' ''37''(2): 38–41. {{doi|10.1007/BF02686189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kohlberg's body was recovered and his death confirmed, former students and colleagues published special issues of scholarly journals to commemorate his contribution to developmental psychology.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Boyd, D. (Ed.) (October, 1988), "Special Issue in Honour of Lawrence Kohlberg," ''Journal of Moral Education'' Vol. 17, #3; Rest, J. (Ed.) (April, 1988), "Special Issue, The Legacy of Lawrence Kohlberg," ''Counseling and Values'' Vol. 32, #3; Schrader, D. (Ed.) (Spring, 1990), "The Legacy of Lawrence Kohlberg, ''New Directions for Child Development'', #47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Monbukagakusho Scholarship'''|文部科学省奨学金|Monbukagakushō Shōgakukin}}, formerly known as Monbusho Scholarship, is an academic [[scholarship]] offered by the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (''Monbu-kagaku-shō'', or MEXT). 
To date, some 65,000 students from approximately 160 countries and regions around the world have studied in [[Japan]] under the Japanese Government  Scholarship program established in 1954.

== Scholarship types ==

There are seven types of Japanese government-sponsored scholarships available under the Japanese Government (Monbu-kagaku-shō) Scholarship program: those for research students, teacher training students, [[undergraduate]] university students, Japanese studies students, college of technology students, special training students and YLP students.

'''Research students''':
You must be under 35 years of age and a college graduate (includes prospective graduates). Or you must have completed 16 years of schooling. This programs allows the recipients to apply for a Graduate Degree Program (Masters and/or PhD) given that they passed their assigned University's entrance examination. 

'''Teacher training students''':
You must be under 35 years of age and a graduate of a college or teacher training college. You must have at least five years of active experience as a teacher in a primary, secondary or teacher training college in your country. (Please note that college and university teachers currently in active service are not considered for this scholarship).

'''Undergraduate university students''':
You must be at least 17 and under 22 years of age and have completed 12 years of school education or have completed courses in a school comparable to a high school (includes prospective graduates).

Every year a large number of students are enrolled by embassy recommendation (''see below''). Each half of the contingent undergoes a 1-year preparatory program at either [[Osaka University|Osaka University Center for Japanese language and culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjlc.osaka-u.ac.jp/ |title=Osaka University Center for Japanese language and culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tufs.ac.jp/ |title=Tokyo University of Foreign Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; before entering a 4-year undergraduate program at one of 87 [[Japanese national universities]].

'''Japanese studies students''':
Applicants must be from 18 to 30 years old. Applicants must be enrolled as undergraduate students in faculties or schools which major in Japanese language or Japanese culture in a university outside Japan at the time when they come to Japan and must be enrolled in the home institution at the time when they return to their home countries. Students majoring in the fields other than Japanese language or Japanese culture who wish to study various aspects of Japan ( engineering, economy, agriculture, architecture, art, etc.) as part of their major studies should apply to the JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) for admission to the Short-term Student Exchange Promotion Program.

'''College of technology students''':

The participants must be university or college graduates, who have at least 3–5 years' work experiences in public administration or enterprises and so on(*). The screening of the participants is based on recommendations of the recommending authorities.

===Recommendations===

'''[[Embassy]] recommendation''': In this type of scholarship, scholarship recipients are recruited and initially screened by a Japanese embassy (or consulate general, depending on the country). Research student, Undergraduate student, College of technology student, and Special training college student recruitment for the next fiscal year (April, October) is made between March and May. The initial screening (documentary examination, written test and interview) is made at the embassy between June and August. The embassy then recommends the selected candidates to the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the beginning of September.
Teacher training and Japanese studies student recruitment for the next fiscal year (for those arriving in Japan in October) is made between December of the previous year and the following February. Screening is conducted between mid-February and March. Selected candidates are recommended to the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by end of April.
 
'''University recommendation''': Research students and Japanese studies students who will be studying in Japan as an exchange student based on inter-university student exchange agreements can be screened through the national, public or private Japanese university involved as a candidate for a Japanese Government Scholarship. The university directly recommends the selected candidates to the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
Research students recommended by a university for study in Japan as government-sponsored scholarship recipients basically arrive in Japan in October.
Japanese studies students basically arrive in Japan in October according to the university program. Universities recommend candidates to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology by mid-April.

'''Domestic Selection''': Privately financed, full-time postgraduate foreign students, prospective postgraduate students, and full-time, prospective fourth-year undergraduate university students (prospective sixth-year students in the case of medical schools, etc.) are granted domestic selection scholarships that begin in April. Recruitment is conducted through national, public and private universities with the exception of junior colleges.
Universities carefully screen academically and individually excellent students and recommend them by mid-December as government-sponsored scholarship candidates to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

Krassovska was born  Nathalie Leslie in [[St. Petersburg]], the daughter of a Russian mother and Scottish father. Depending on the source her birthdate is recorded as June 1 or June 3, with the year ranging from 1917 to 1919, most frequently 1918.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;The Independent, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska, Star ballerina of rare talent and charm, Nadine Meisner (February 16, 2005) https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nathalie-krassovska-6152419.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Find a Grave, Nathalie Leslie Krassovska https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11342415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska (April 12, 2005) https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1487612/Nathalie-Krassovska.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother was a soloist with the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]; her mother Lydia Krassovska was a dancer with [[Diaghilev]]’s [[Ballets Russes|Ballet Russes]].

Young Nathalie began her ballet studies with her grandmother, but her formal training took place in Europe. In Paris, she trained with [[Olga Preobrajenska]], St Petersburg's pre-Revolutionary prima ballerina. In London, she studied with Russian ballet master [[Nikolai Legat]]. Under the name of Nathalie Leslie she danced with [[Ida Rubinstein]]'s company at the Paris Opera. At age 14, she was selected by [[Bronislava Nijinska]] for her company, the Théâtre de la Danse.  In 1933, she joined [[George Balanchine]]'s short-lived [[Les Ballets 1933|Les Ballets]]. After Les Ballets, Krassovska partnered with [[Serge Lifar]] for a tour of South America.

== Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo ==
Krassovska joined the Ballet Russe de Paris in 1935 and [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]]’s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1936. In 1938, she became a member of the Massine-Denham Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. During her time with the troupe, Krassovska worked closely with [[Mikhail Fokine]], the well-known choreographer and reformer of conventional ballet traditions. Fokine personally coached her for roles in [[Les Sylphides]], [[Le Spectre de la Rose]] and other ballets. She advanced to the position of principal dancer and performed with the group until 1950.

During World War II, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo moved its home base to New York&lt;ref&gt;Russian Ballet History, http://www.russianballethistory.com/companymetamorphosis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and toured primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Krassovska was acclaimed for her lyrical style, especially in performances of the [[Romantic ballet]]s. In 1948, she premiered [[Pas de Quatre]] at the [[New York Metropolitan Opera|New York Met]], alongside [[Alicia Markova]], [[Alexandra Danilova]] and [[Mia Slavenska]]. [[Anton Dolin]]’s restaging of the 1845 [[Jules Perrot]] ballet is an evocation of four legendary ballerinas from the Romantic era.

In 1949, Krassovska first danced the title role in [[Giselle]], one of the most famous Romantic ballets. It was to become one of her signature roles. Writing of the performance, [[Montreal Daily Star]] dance critic S. Morgan-Powell reportedly wrote, "Her dancing was characterized by a purity of style not often seen nowadays in ballet."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nathalie Krassovska, 86, Dancer Particularly Known for 'Giselle,' Dies, Jack Anderson (February 11, 2005) https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/dance/nathalie-krassovska-86-dancer-particularly-known-for-giselle-dies.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also noted for her performances in Les Sylphides, Scheherazade, The Snow Maiden, [[Swan Lake]] and [[The Nutcracker]].&lt;ref name= latimes&gt;Los Angeles Times, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska, 86; Ballerina Praised for Lyrical Performances (February 17, 2005) http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/local/me-passings17.3&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''American Dancer'' article, reviewer Albertina Vitak said, "Krassovska stands out over all and is one of the most valuable assets of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chazin-Bennahum|first1=Judith|title=Rene Blum and The Ballets Russes: In Search of a Lost Life|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195399331|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krassovska's repertoire was not limited to [[ballet blanc]]. She learned [[tap dancing]] for her character in The New Yorker, [[Leonide Massine]]'s 1940 ballet based on cartoons from the popular [[The New Yorker|magazine]]. For Capriccio Espagnol, another Massine work, Krassovska and the cast were required to execute [[Flamenco]] steps such as the [[bulerías]] and [[seguidilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=Leslie|title=Leonide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786417520|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career after Ballet Russe ==
Krassovska briefly joined [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] in 1949. When Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin decided to found the [[London Festival Ballet]] in 1950, they asked her to be the second ballerina, partnering with English dancer [[John Gilpin (dancer)|John Gilpin]]. On opening night at the [[Stoll Theatre]], Krassovska and Gilpin triumphed in Massine's Le Beau Danube. Their partnership became a major company attraction.

Krassovska stayed with Festival Ballet through 1960 and continued to perform the standard 19th century repertory. She danced in Great Britain under her birth name Nathalie Leslie. As a guest artist with the Ballet Russe in the late 1950s, she used the surname Krassovska.

Krassovska moved to U.S. in the 1960s. Having toured the country a number of times, she decided that [[Dallas, Texas]], with its flowers, trees and pleasant climate was one of the nicest cities.&lt;ref&gt;Andros on Ballet, Dick Andros (first published September 1997, updated February 2005) http://michaelminn.net/andros/biographies/krassovska_nathalie/&lt;/ref&gt; She opened a dance school at her home and founded a student company, Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse. She became an American citizen in 1964.

Krassovska was invited frequently as a guest teacher and coach throughout the Southeastern U.S. She danced in local productions of The Nutcracker into her 80s and produced her last concert, Tribute to Ballet Russe, at Southern Methodist University in 1997.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

== Film ==
In 1941 and 1942, while a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Krassovska appeared in two movies choreographed by Massine, Spanish Fiesta (an adaptation of Capriccio Espagnol) and [[The Gay Parisian]] (also known as Gaité Parisienne). Her remarkable beauty caught the eye of [[David Selznick|David O. Selznick]] and he offered her a movie contract.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database, Nathalie Krassovska https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469986/?ref_=nmbio_ql&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was a very difficult decision, she chose to remain with the ballet company.
  
For the 1953 film [[Never Let Me Go (1953 film)|Never Let Me Go]], Krassovska doubled in long shots for [[Gene Tierney]] in her role as a Russian ballet dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spicer|first1=Chrystopher|title=Clark Gable: Biography, Filmography, Bibliography|date=1955|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-1124-4|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krassovska was interviewed and shown in archival footage for the 2005 documentary movie [[Ballets Russes (film)|Ballets Russes]].

== Personal life ==
Her romantic life was reputedly eventful and she was briefly married to an Austrian count.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;  Another interest, outside of ballet, was the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Krassovska helped raise $850,000 toward a construction project for the St. Seraphim Orthodox Church in Dallas.

== Death ==
Nathalie Krassovska died on February 8, 2005 due to complications from surgery. She is buried in [[Restland Memorial Park]] in Dallas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17359">The '''Record Commissions''' were a series of six [[Royal Commission]]s of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and (from 1801) the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] which sat between 1800 and 1837 to inquire into the custody and public accessibility of the state [[archive]]s. The Commissioners' work paved the way for the establishment of the [[Public Record Office]] in 1838. The Commissioners were also responsible for publishing various historical records, including the ''[[The Statutes of the Realm|Statutes of the Realm]]'' (i.e. of England and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) to 1714 and the ''Acts of Parliament of Scotland'' to 1707, as well as a number of important medieval records.

Although the six Commissions were technically distinct from one another, there was a considerable degree of continuity between them, and it is common practice to regard them as a single entity and to refer to them in singular form as the '''Record Commission'''.

==Activities==
[[File:Patent Roll 1201 Record Commission.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Extract from the [[Patent Rolls|Patent Roll]] for [[Regnal years of English monarchs|3]] [[John, King of England|John]] (1201–2), as published by the Record Commission in 1835 using [[record type]]]]
The first Commission was established on 19 July 1800, on the recommendation of a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] appointed earlier in the year, on the initiative and under the chairmanship of [[Charles Abbot, 1st Baron Colchester|Charles Abbot]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Helston (UK Parliament constituency)|Helston]], "to inquire into the State of the Public Records of this kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Walne 1973, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The public records were at this time housed in a variety of repositories, including the [[Tower of London]], the [[chapter house]] of [[Westminster Abbey]], the [[Pell Office]] adjacent to [[Westminster Hall]], [[Somerset House]], and elsewhere, often in a disorganised state and in highly unsuitable physical conditions. The idea of a single central repository was mooted as early as 1800, and became the subject of an abortive parliamentary [[Bill (law)|bill]] in 1833, but it was to be some years before this was achieved: in the meantime, the Commissioners arranged for various moves of individual classes of records into new accommodation. These moves were well-intentioned and sometimes led to improvements in storage and arrangement, but more often resulted in the loss and further disorganisation of records.&lt;ref&gt;Walne 1973, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell 1984, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Commission (in particular the sixth Commission, which sat from 1831 to 1837) gained a reputation for inactivity, corruption, [[wikt:jobbery|jobbery]], and for including among its members too many persons in high office with other demands on their time. Some of these criticisms came from external observers, such as Sir [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas|Harris Nicolas]]; others were made by the Commission's own salaried employees, notably [[Henry Cole]], and to a lesser extent [[Thomas Duffus Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell 1984, p. 277–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Ann |last=Cooper |title=Cole, Sir Henry (1808–1882) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear=2004 |year=2008 |edition=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5852 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Parliamentary committee]], appointed to inquire into its work, reported in 1836 that the national archives remained scattered in a number of unsuitable locations, and in the custody of "a multitude of imperfectly responsible keepers".&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell 1984, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these controversies emerged the [[Public Record Office Act 1838]], which established the [[Public Record Office]] in that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners' second objective was to make the records more accessible through the compilation of [[finding aid]]s ([[Index (publishing)|index]]es and [[Calendar (archives)|calendar]]s), and where possible the publication of these, as well as the publication of full texts of selected records of particular importance. The sixth Commission employed four sub-Commissioners ([[Joseph Hunter (antiquarian)|Joseph Hunter]], [[Francis Palgrave]], [[Joseph Stevenson]], and for a time [[John Caley]]), as well as other ''ad hoc'' editors and a number of clerks, specifically on the task of editing records for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Walne 1973, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Commission's publications used a "[[record type]]" typeface, designed to present the text in a near-[[facsimile]] of the manuscript originals. The publications programme was generally considered a success, and many of the Commission's editions remain in current scholarly use. In other cases, however, the absence of a permanent arrangement to the records rapidly rendered the compilation of finding aids efforts redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Walne 1973, pp. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Samuel Martin Jordan''' (1871 &amp;ndash; 1952) was an American presbyterian missionary in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]).

He is sometimes referred to as the "father of modern education in Iran".&lt;ref name="Lorentz"&gt;John H. Lorentz, ''Historical Dictionary of Iran'' (Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 1995). {{ISBN|0-8108-2994-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-2994-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating first from [[Lafayette College]] and then from the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1898, he moved to [[Tehran]] and spent 43 years as a missionary in Iran.  Under his direction, the establishment that later took the name of [[Alborz High School]] was upgraded to the ''American College of Tehran'' and received a permanent charter from the Board of Regents of the [[State University of New York]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="Lorentz" /&gt; Jordan served as president of the institution from 1899 until 1940.  He received the first Scientific Medal of Iran in 1940.

[[Image:American College Tehran.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''McCormick Hall (Alborz), [[Alborz High School|American College of Tehran]]'', circa 1930]]

In appreciation of his many services to [[higher education in Iran]], a boulevard in Tehran, [[Jordan, Tehran|Jordan Boulevard]], was named after him. Although after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] this street's name was changed (to ''Africa''), the old name is still widely used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} A statue of him, perhaps the only of a Westerner in Iran at the time, which is still on display in [[Amirkabir University]], was dedicated in Alborz High School{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. Further, a theater in Tehran was named after him.&lt;ref name="Lorentz" /&gt;

On 21 April 2005, [[Fariborz Maseeh]] (founder of [[IntelliSense]]) and the Massiah Foundation pledged $2 million to create an interdisciplinary research center at [[UC Irvine]] named "The Dr. Samuel M. Jordan Center for Persian Studies and Culture" that will bring together scholars in [[Persian history]], language, culture, art and literature.

'''Spalding Gray''' (June 5, 1941 – January 11, 2004) was an American actor and writer. He is best known for the autobiographical [[One-person show|monologues]] that he wrote and performed for the theater in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as for his film adaptations of these works, beginning in 1987. He wrote and starred in several, working with different directors.

Theater critics [[John A. Willis|John Willis]] and Ben Hodges described his monologue work as "trenchant, personal narratives delivered on sparse, unadorned sets with a dry, [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], quiet mania."&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Willis|Willis, John]]; Hodges, Ben (2006). ''Theatre World: Volume 60''. [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|316}} Gray achieved renown for his monologue ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]]'', which he adapted as a 1987 film in which he starred; it was directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]. Other of his monologues which Gray adapted for film were ''[[Monster in a Box]]'' (1991), directed by [[Nick Broomfield]], and ''[[Gray's Anatomy (film)|Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1996), directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]].

Gray is believed to have committed suicide in New York City in January 2004, after struggling with depression and severe injuries following a car accident. Steven Soderbergh made a documentary film about Gray's life entitled ''[[And Everything Is Going Fine]]'' (2010). An unfinished monologue and a selection from his journals were published in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

==Early life==
Spalding Rockwell Gray was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, to Rockwell Gray,&amp;nbsp;Sr., the treasurer of [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] and Margaret Elizabeth "Betty" (née Horton). He was the middle-born of three sons; his brothers were Rockwell,&amp;nbsp;Jr. and Channing. They were raised in the [[Christian Science]] faith of their mother. Gray and his brothers grew up in [[Barrington, Rhode Island|Barrington]], Rhode Island, spending summers at their grandmother's house in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island. Rockwell became a literature professor at [[Washington University in Saint Louis]], and Channing a journalist in Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="NYmag2"/&gt;

After graduating from [[Fryeburg Academy]] in [[Fryeburg, Maine]], Gray enrolled at [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], as a poetry major. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1963.

In 1965, Gray moved to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], where he became a speaker and teacher of poetry at the [[Esalen Institute]]. In 1967, while Gray was vacationing in Mexico City, his mother committed [[suicide]] at age 52. She had suffered from depression.&lt;ref name="gaby"&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
Gray began his theater career in New York in the late 1960s. In 1970, he joined [[Richard Schechner]]'s experimental troupe, [[The Performance Group]]. With actors from The Performance Group, including [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Elizabeth LeCompte]], Gray helped to co-found the theater company [[The Wooster Group]]. He worked with them from 1975 to 1980, before leaving the company to focus on his monologue work. During this time, he also appeared in [[adult film]]s, having a featured role in ''[[Farmer's Daughters]]'' (1976) and appearing in [[Radley Metzer]]'s ''Maraschino Cherry'' (1978),&lt;ref name=SFWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/08/spalding_gray_monologist_racon.php |title=Here's to the Late Spalding Gray: Monologist. Raconteur.

Gray first achieved prominence in the United States with the film version of his monologue ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]].'' He had performed this monologue in New York City, and published it as a book in 1985. He adapted it as a film in 1987, directed by Jonathan Demme. This work was based on his experience in Thailand during filming a small role in ''[[The Killing Fields (movie)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984), about the war in Cambodia.

In 1987 Gray traveled to Nicaragua with Office of the Americas. He wrote an unproduced screenplay based on the experience. Some of his experiences there were documented in ''[[Monster in a Box]]''.

Gray received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and the [[National Book Award]] in 1985 for this work. He continued to write and perform monologues until his death. Through 1993, these works often incorporated his relationship to his girlfriend [[Renée Shafransky]]. They married and she became his collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Spalding|title=Monster in a Box|year=1992|publisher= [[Vintage Books]] |location=New York City|isbn=0679737391|edition=A Vintage original, 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Spalding|title=Gray's Anatomy|year=1994|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0679751785|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later married Kathleen Russo.

Gray's success with his monologues brought him various supporting movie roles. He also played the lead role of the Stage Manager in a high-profile 1988 revival of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s play ''[[Our Town]]'' by the [[Lincoln Center Theater]].

In 1992, Gray published his only novel, ''Impossible Vacation.'' The novel reflects elements of Gray's life, including his upbringing as a [[Christian Scientist]],{{clarify|date=September 2013|reason=at this tagging, article categorized as "former christian scientists". did he leave? if not, category needs adjustment; if he did, needs assertion in prose}} his [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] background, and his mother's suicide. Gray wrote a subsequent monologue related to his experiences in writing and promoting this book, entitled ''Monster in a Box''.

During an interview in 1997 with film critic [[Edward Vilga]], Gray was asked whether the movie industry was "confused" by his writings and roles. He responded:

::I would say that my major problem with Hollywood is this—I sometimes paraphrase [[Bob Dylan]]—Bob Dylan says "I may look like [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]], but I feel just like [[Jesse James]]." I say, "I may look like a gynecologist, an American ambassador's aide, or a lawyer, but I feel like [[Woody Allen]].". . . My insides are not what my outsides are. I'm not who I appear to be. I appear to be a [[Boston Brahmin|Wasp Brahmin]], but I'm really a sort of neurotic, perverse New York Jew. When I was performing one year ago at this time in Israel, a review came out in Hebrew about ''Monster in a Box,'' and it read, "Spalding Gray is funny, sometimes hilarious, wonderfully neurotic for a non-Jew." Only the Jews can say something like "wonderfully neurotic."&lt;ref&gt;Vilga, Edward (1997). ''Acting Now: Conversations on Craft and Career''. [[Rutgers University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}

Gray's performance style relied upon an impressionistic use of memories rather than a recounting of chronological facts. Gray referred to his style of monologue as resulting from a sort of "poetic journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentile|first1=John S.|title=Cast of One: One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage|date=1989|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign-Urbana|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems and death==
In June 2001, Gray suffered severe injuries in a car crash while on vacation in Ireland. In the crash, Gray  suffered a broken hip, which left his right leg almost immobilized, and a fracture in his skull. During surgery on his skull, a [[Titanium#Medical|titanium]] plate was placed over the break after surgeons removed dozens of bone fragments from his [[Frontal lobe|frontal cortex]]. A jagged scar on his forehead was a reminder of the injury. He struggled to recover from his injuries and a severe depression that set in some time after the accident. He had already struggled intermittently with depression in his life.&lt;ref name="sacks"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/the-catastrophe-oliver-sacks |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |author-link=Oliver Sacks |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |title=The Catastrophe |date=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering both from physical impairment and ongoing depression, Gray struggled for months and was treated with a variety of different therapies.&lt;ref name="NYmag2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Williams | first = Alex  | title = Vanishing Act  | work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]]| date = February 2, 2004 | url = http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9787/ | accessdate = July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray sought treatment from [[neurologist]] [[Oliver Sacks]], who began treating Gray in August 2003 and continued to do so until almost the time of Gray's death. Sacks later said Gray perceived the taking of his own life as part of what he had to say, with the monologuist having "talked about what he called 'a creative suicide.' On one occasion, when he was being interviewed, he thought that the interview might be culminated with a 'dramatic and creative suicide. ... I was at pains to say that he would be much more creative alive than dead."&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt;

On January 9, 2004, Gray had an interview with Theresa Smalec, the subject of which was [[Ron Vawter]], a deceased friend and colleague whom he had met in the winter of 1972–73. Gray and Vawter had worked closely together throughout the 1970s, first with [[The Performance Group]], then as core members of [[The Wooster Group]] (founded by Gray and [[Elizabeth LeCompte]]). The edited transcript of "Spalding Gray's Last Interview" was published in 2008 by the ''New England Theatre Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smalec | first = Theresa | title = Spalding Gray's Last Interview | work = [[New England Theatre Journal]] | year = 2008 | url = http://www.netconline.org/netc-publications.php | accessdate = September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2004, Gray was declared missing. The night before his disappearance, he had taken his children to see [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Big Fish]].'' It ends with the line, "A man tells a story over and over so many times he becomes the story. In that way, he is immortal." Gray's widow, Kathie Russo, said after he disappeared, "You know, Spalding cried after he saw that movie. I just think it gave him permission. I think it gave him permission to die."&lt;ref name="NYmag2" /&gt;

When Gray was first reported missing, his profile was featured on the Fox Network television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/missing_persons/brief.cfm?id=25815 |title=Spalding Gray –  Missing Person | work = [[America's Most Wanted]] |date= |accessdate= December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2004, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York reported that Gray's body was discovered by two men and pulled from the [[East River]]. One of the men gave an interview about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/dont-miss/wifl/spaldinggray0807 |title=What It Feels Like to Find Spalding Gray's Body |last=Snead|first=Robin|date=August 2007 |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|page=91|accessdate= February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Gray jumped off the side of the [[Staten Island Ferry]]. Gray had previously attempted suicide in 2002; in addition, he had a history of depression, and his mother had killed herself in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/08/obituaries/spalding-grays-body-is-found-2-months-after-disappearance.html?_r=0| |title=Spalding Gray’s Body Is Found 2 Months After Disappearance|agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=The New York Times| date=March 8, 2004|accessdate=March 2, 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray was reported to have been working on a new monologue at the time of his death. There was speculation that his revisiting the material of the car crash in Ireland and his subsequent attempts to recover from his injuries might have triggered a final bout of depression.&lt;ref name="NYmag2" /&gt;

Gray was buried at [[Oakland Cemetery (Sag Harbor, NY)|Oakland Cemetery]] in [[Sag Harbor, New York|Sag Harbor]], New York. He was survived by his wife Kathie Russo, stepdaughter Marissa, sons Forrest Dylan Gray and Theo Spalding Gray, and brothers Rockwell and Channing Gray.

===Legacy===
Theater historian Don Wilmeth noted Gray's contribution to a unique style of writing and acting: 
{{quote|The 1980s saw the rise of the autobiographical monologue, its leading practitioner Spalding Gray, the WASP from Rhode Island who portrays himself as an innocent abroad in a crazy contemporary world. . . others, like [[Mike Feder]], who grew up in Queens and began telling his life on New York radio, pride themselves on their theatrical minimalism, and simply sit and talk. Audiences come to autobiography for direct connection and great stories, both sometimes hard to find in today's theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth, Don B.; Miller, Tice L. (1996). ''Cambridge Guide to American Theatre''.  [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|293}}}}

Describing the play-film monologue, theatre director Mark Russell wrote: 
{{quote|He broke it all down to a table, a glass of water, a spiral notebook and a mic. Poor theatre—a man and an audience and a story. Spalding sitting at that table, speaking into the mic, calling forth the script of his life from his memory and those notebooks. A simple ritual: part news report, part confessional, part American raconteur. One man piecing his life back together, one memory, one true thing at a time. Like all genius things, it was a simple idea turned on its axis to become absolutely fresh and radical."&lt;ref name=Swimming/&gt;}}

Journalist and author [[Roger Rosenblatt]], described Gray as 
{{quote|Spalding the storyteller... Spalding the mystical. Spalding the hilarious. Spalding the self-exposed, the professionally puzzled, the scared, the brave. Spalding the supporting actor. That's what he was in the movies. But as a writer and a stage performer, he changed the idea of what a supporting actor is. He supported ''us''... He played our part... We tacitly elect a few to be the chief tellers of our tales. Spalding was one of the elected. The specialty of his storytelling was the search for a sorrow that could be alchemized into a myth. He went for the misery sufficiently deep to create a story that makes us laugh... In so doing, he invented a form, a very rare thing among artists. Some called it the 'epic monologue' because first it was spoken and then it was written, like the old epics, and because it consisted of great and important themes drawn from the hero's life...And the one true heroic element in his makeup was the willingness to be open, rapidly open, about his confusions, his frailties."&lt;ref name=Swimming&gt;Gray, Spalding (2005). ''Swimming to Cambodia''. Theatre Communications Group.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Intro}} }}

Director Jonathan Demme said of Gray, "Spalding's unfailing ability to ignite universal emotions and laughter in all of us while gloriously wallowing in his own exquisite uniqueness will remain forever one of the great joys of American performance and literature".&lt;ref name=Swimming/&gt;

"He took the anarchy and illogic of life and molded it into something we could grab a hold of," said actor and novelist [[Eric Bogosian]]. "It took courage to do what Spalding did, courage to make theatre so naked and unadorned, to expose himself in this way and to fight his demons in public."

Theater critic Mel Gussow wrote of Gray's ''Swimming to Cambodia'' and ''Terrors of Pleasure'' that "Through a look or a comment, he offers intelligent analysis. Though the narrative is entirely centered around Mr. Gray himself, it never suffers from self-pity or self-indulgence. He remains the antihero in his own fascinating life story, the never ending tale of EverySpalding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gussow|first1=Mel|title=Theatre: Spalding Gray. Review of Terrors of Pleasure, by Spalding Gray|work=The New York Times|date=May 15, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous works by and about him===
In 2005, Gray's unfinished final monologue was published in a hardcover edition entitled ''Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue.'' The monologue, which Gray had performed in one of his last public appearances, is augmented by two additional pieces he performed at the time, a short remembrance called "The Anniversary" and an open letter to New York City written in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Also included in the book is an extensive collection of remembrances and tributes from fellow performers and friends.

The 2007 play ''Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell,'' produced at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, is based on his monologues and journals. Kathleen Russo, his widow, developed the concept for the play.&lt;ref name="brantley"/&gt; The show has a cast of four actors as well as a rotating guest artist; all five read from selected portions of his work.&lt;ref name="brantley"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/theater/reviews/07gray.html |authorlink=Ben Brantley|first=Ben |last=Brantley |title=A Master of Monologues, Living on in His Words|work=The New York Times|date= March 7, 2007|accessdate= February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s documentary about Gray, ''[[And Everything Is Going Fine]],'' was released at Utah's [[Slamdance Film Festival]]. The film was compiled from film and video clips of Gray's early life and career. His widow said that Soderbergh "wanted Spalding to tell the story, as if it was his last monologue, and I think he accomplished that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/movies/17soderbergh.html |title=One Singular Auteur, Through Another|work=The New York Times|date= January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a selection from his journals was published as ''The Journals of Spalding Gray,'' edited by Nell Casey, who had worked with his widow Kathie Russo on the project.&lt;ref name="rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/the-journals-of-spalding-gray-edited-by-nell-casey-book-review.html |first=Ron|last= Rosenbaum|title= What Spalding Gray Left Us|work=The 'New York Times|date= October 28, 2011|accessdate= February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight Garner thought this material was less interesting than Spalding's monologues. He said they have value as a "portrait of a theatrical coming of age" as Gray determined how to make his art. Garner notes, "His art, these journals make clear, is what kept him alive."&lt;ref name="garner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/books/journals-of-spalding-gray-edited-by-nell-casey-review.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Sunday%20Book%20Review&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |first=Dwight|last= Garner|title=Peering Beyond a Monologist’s Stage Presence Into His Uncensored Mind| work=The New York Times|date= October 17, 2011|accessdate= February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strathmore Business School (SBS)''' is the graduate business school of [[Strathmore University]]. Based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], it offers [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and other postgraduate programs, as well as [[executive education]] programs. It was started in 2005 through a partnership between Strathmore University and [[IESE Business School]]. As part of Strathmore University, it is a private non-profit institution and a corporate work of [[Opus Dei]], a [[Personal prelature|Personal Prelature]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. It was the first green business school in Africa.

==History==
[[File:Strathmore Business School Campus.JPG|thumb|Strathmore Business School Campus, Madaraka]]
In 2005, Strathmore University entered into a partnership with IESE Business School, creating Strathmore Business School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Linda|title=Iese advances further into Africa|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/c5ad9a2a-baa5-11d9-a27b-00000e2511c8.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|agency=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|date=2 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new business school started its first program on 11 January 2006 with Dr George Njenga as the dean, offering the Advanced Management Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Advanced Management Program|journal=Market Intelligence: MI : the Investor's Journal|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its MBA for Executives program was launched in 2007.

It operated from office space in the university's library, conducting classes in the conference facilities of hotels in Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nation.co.ke/business/-/996/102180/-/7wd94kz/-/index.html|title = New Business Course for Senior Managers|last = |first = |date = 13 January 2016|work = |access-date = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, construction began at the site of a new campus, at which it started operating in 2012. The building was designed to have a very low carbon footprint, receiving an award, in 2012, for being the Best Green Building Development in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strathmore Business School – Green Tech, Retrofit for Resilience|url=http://buildesign.co.ke/strathmore-business-school-green-tech-retrofit-resilience/|website=BUILDesign|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olingo|first1=Allan|title=Stars shine at real estate awards|url=https://ktnkenya.tv/?articleID=2000055575&amp;story_title=stars-shine-at-real-estate-awards&amp;pageNo=1|accessdate=30 March 2015|agency=The Standard Media Group|publisher=The Standard Media Group|date=5 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150429182356/https://ktnkenya.tv/?articleID=2000055575&amp;story_title=stars-shine-at-real-estate-awards&amp;pageNo=1|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">'''Suzanne Césaire''' [née Roussi] (11 August 1915 – 16 May 1966), born in [[Martinique]], and was a writer, teacher, scholar, anti-colonial and feminist activist, and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]].

==Early life==
Suzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.

==University and marriage to Aimé Césaire==

During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who introduced her to [[Aimé Césaire]], a fellow student at the École normale supérieure.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]''. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.

==Literary career==
Suzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal ''Tropiques'', of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and [[René Ménil]], both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.

While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology ''The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean'' (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.

Césaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:

“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with [[André Breton]] following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Blachère, “Breton et Césaire: Flux et reflux d’une amitié”, Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146-159 (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of [[Afro-Surrealism]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Rosemont, ''Surrealist Women'' (2000) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of ''Tropiques'' can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. ''Tropiques'' was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of ''Tropiques'' towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of ''Tropiques'', published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nouvelleseditionsplace.com/produit/tropiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropiques'' published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientbookline/service/reference.asp?output=PORTAL&amp;INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP&amp;DOCID=0467910&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

Suzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of ''Tropiques'', she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed "Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]
Her encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - "La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">'''Thomas William Andrews (T. Bill)''' (born 1958 in Hutchinson, Kansas) is an American [[abstract impressionist]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[author]]. He paints [[landscapes]], florals and representational and architectural pieces in the style of [[impressionism]], as well as [[Figurative art|figurative]] studies, but his primary emphasis is on extremely large-format [[action painting]] in a style reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]] and other painters in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of painting known as [[abstract expressionism]].

After serving in the U.S. Navy [[Nuclear Power]] Program, he enrolled as an undergraduate member of the [[University of Iowa Writers' Workshop]] in the mid-1980s.  It was while at the Writers' Workshop that he adopted his [[nom de plume]] "T. Bill" (sometimes "T-Bill".  He then received his doctorate from Yale University, writing a fictionalized memoir of his experiences at Yale entitled "Power Ties."

His [[abstract art]] painting studio is located alongside a horse meadow.  His largest collection of work is at his flagship gallery in West Des Moines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavanaughgallery.com/T-Bill_Andrews.html Images of some of T-Bill's paintings at Kavanaugh Gallery in West Des Moines]&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquisitions at other galleries are handled by Mid-America Art Brokers of St. Louis.

Established in 1918, '''Tallinn University of Technology''' ('''TTÜ'''; {{lang-et|Tallinna Tehnikaülikool}}, abbreviated ''TTÜ'') is the only [[Vocational education|technical]] university in Estonia. TTÜ, in the capital city of [[Tallinn]], is a university for engineering, business, and public administration.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyinestonia.ee/study/institutions/international-degree-programmes/tallinn-university-of-technology|title=Tallinn University of Technology|date=|website=|publisher=[Archimedes Foundation], Study in Estonia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524021314/http://www.studyinestonia.ee/study/institutions/international-degree-programmes/tallinn-university-of-technology|archive-date=2012-05-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educations.com/Tallinn_University_of_Technology__b12666.html|title=Tallinn University of Technology|last=Educations.com|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TTÜ has colleges in [[Tallinn]], [[Tartu]], [[Kuressaare]] and [[Kohtla-Järve]]. Despite the similar names, [[Tallinn University]] and Tallinn University of Technology are separate institutions.

==History==
In the early twentieth century, Estonia recognised an urgent need for locally trained engineering specialists. Until then, young people from Estonia had received their specialist education in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Germany]] or [[Riga]]. Opportunities had to be sought for engineering-minded people to acquire an Estonian-based education which was adapted to local conditions and needs; Estonia was in the process of establishing itself as an independent country.

On 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses. That date has been recognised as the founding date of the Tallinn University of Technology.{{whom|date=June 2018}} Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture. In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution. Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published. In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia. In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.

By the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named the Tallinn Technical Institute. The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining. In 1938, the name Tallinn Technical University (TTU) was effective. In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded. After 2003 the university was known in English as the Tallinn University of Technology (TTÜ).

On 1 July 2008, TTÜ took over [[International University Audentes]] (IUA), which became part of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, except the Law School which joined the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 2014 an agreement for merger of the [[Estonian Maritime Academy]] with TTÜ was signed.

On 16 November 2016, TTÜ and the [[Estonian Information Technology College]] signed a merger agreement. Since 1 August 2017, the IT College is a part of TTÜ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttu.ee/tut-and-the-it-college-signed-a-merger-agreement|title=TTÜ and the IT College signed a merger agreement|date=|website=|publisher=Tallinn University of Technology|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TTÜ today==
There are over 30 fully accredited international degree programmes (4 Bachelor programmes, 18 Master programmes and 10 PhD programmes) that are available fully in English.

'''''U.S. News &amp; World Report''''' is an American [[media company]] that publishes news, opinion, consumer advice, rankings, and analysis. Founded as a [[newsmagazine|newsweekly magazine]] in 1933, U.S. News transitioned to primarily web-based publishing in 2010. ''U.S. News'' is best known today for its influential Best Colleges and Best Hospitals rankings, but it has expanded its content and product offerings in education, health, money, careers, travel, and cars. The rankings are popular in North America but have drawn widespread criticism from colleges, administrations, and students for their dubious, disparate, and arbitrary nature. The ranking system by ''U.S. News'' is usually contrasted with the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' rankings.

==History==
'''''United States News''''' was founded in 1933 by David Lawrence (1888–1973), who also started '''''World Report''''' in 1946. The two magazines covered national and international news separately, but Lawrence merged them into ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=David E. Sumner | title=American winners and losers:2001 to 2010 | journal=International Conference on Communication, Media, Technology and Design | date=May 2012 | url=http://www.cmdconf.net/2012/makale/6.pdf | accessdate=June 25, 2016 | location=Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently sold the magazine to his employees. Historically, the magazine tended to be slightly more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than its two primary competitors, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', and focused more on economic, health, and education stories. It also eschewed sports, entertainment, and celebrity news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620229/US-News-World-Report | title=U.S. News &amp; World Report | accessdate=June 24, 2008 | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important milestones in the early history of the magazine include the introduction of the "Washington Whispers" column in 1934 and the "News You Can Use" column in 1952.&lt;ref name="about-usnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/info/features/about-usnews|title=About U.S. News &amp; World Report|publisher=|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usnews-timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/info/articles/2013/05/17/celebrating-80-years |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016005625/http://www.usnews.com/info/articles/2013/05/17/celebrating-80-years |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the weekly magazine's circulation passed one million and reached two million by 1973.&lt;ref name="about-usnews" /&gt;

Since 1983, it has become known primarily for its influential ranking and annual reports of colleges and graduate schools, spanning across most fields and subjects. ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' is America's oldest and best-known ranker of academic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/us-news-college-rankings-are-denounced-but-not-ignored/2011/09/02/gIQAn6BzzJ_story.html | title=U.S. News college rankings are denounced but not ignored | accessdate=September 4, 2011 | work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]] | year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers the fields of business, law, medicine, engineering, education, social sciences and public affairs, in addition to many other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/rankings | title=U.S. News &amp; World Report: Comprehensive Categories of Academic Institutions | accessdate=June 18, 2012 | work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P.| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its print edition was consistently included in national [[bestseller]] lists, augmented by online subscriptions. Additional rankings published by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' include hospitals, medical specialties and automobiles.

In October 1984, [[publisher]] and [[real estate]] developer [[Mortimer Zuckerman]] purchased U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref name="usnews-timeline" /&gt; Zuckerman is also formerly the owner of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. In 1993, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' entered the digital world by providing content to [[CompuServe]] and in 1995, the website usnews.com was launched. In 2001, the website won the [[National Magazine Award]] for General Excellence Online.&lt;ref name="infoplease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0881066.html|title=2001 National Magazine Awards|publisher=Infoplease}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' published its first list of the nation's best high schools. Its ranking methodology includes state test scores and the success of poor and minority students on these exams, and schools' performance in [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement exams]].

Starting in June 2008, the magazine reduced its publication frequency in three steps. In June 2008, citing the decline overall magazine circulation and advertising, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' announced that it would become a [[biweekly]] publication, starting January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/media/11mag.html | title=U.S. News Plans to Publish Biweekly and Expand Consumer Focus | accessdate=June 24, 2008 | work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=June 11, 2008 | first=Richard | last=Pérez-Peña}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hoped advertisers would be attracted to the schedule, which allowed ads to stay on newsstands a week longer. However, five months later the magazine changed its frequency again, becoming monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.san&amp;s=94198&amp;Nid=49092&amp;p=966247 | title=Red Ink: 'U.S. News' Goes Monthly, Hearst and Rodale Cut Staff | accessdate=June 11, 2008 | work=MediaPost | date=June 11, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307234522/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.san&amp;s=94198&amp;Nid=49092&amp;p=966247 | archivedate=March 7, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, ''U.S. News'' expanded and revamped its online opinion section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion | title=Political Blogs, Opinions, Commentaries and Forums on Current Issues | work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P. | accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version of the opinion page included daily new op-ed content as well as the new Thomas Jefferson Street blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion | title=Political Blogs, Opinions, Commentaries and Forums on Current Issues | work=US News | accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal memo was sent on November 5, 2010, to the staff of the magazine informing them that the "December issue will be our last print monthly sent to subscribers, whose remaining print and digital replica subscriptions will be filled by other publishers."&lt;ref name="poynter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&amp;aid=194030 | title='December issue will be our last printed monthly sent to subscribers' | accessdate=November 5, 2010 | work=PoytnerOnline | date=November 5, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106000859/http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&amp;aid=194030 | archivedate=November 6, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo went on to say that the publication would be moving to a primarily digital format but that it would continue to print special issues such as "the college and grad guides, as well as hospital and personal finance guides." Prior to going defunct, ''U.S. News'' was the lowest-ranking news magazine in the U.S., after ''Time'' and ''Newsweek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-sacks/americas-best-college-sca_b_45064.html | title=America's Best College Scam | work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]]| date=April 5, 2007 | first=Peter | last=Sacks | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402215319/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-sacks/americas-best-college-sca_b_45064.html | archivedate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekly digital magazine, ''U.S. News Weekly'', introduced in January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/companies/media/2009/01/23/us-news-launching-digital-newsweekly.html?page=all |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200336/http://upstart.bizjournals.com/companies/media/2009/01/23/us-news-launching-digital-newsweekly.html?page=all |archivedate=2015-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to offer subscription content until it ceased at the end of April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News Digital Weekly. 4/24/2015, Vol. 7 Issue 17, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is owned by U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P., a privately held company based in the ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' building in [[New York City]]. The editorial staff is headquartered in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="about-usnews" /&gt; The company's move to the Web made it possible for ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' to expand its [[service journalism]] with the introduction of several consumer-facing rankings products. The company returned to profitability in 2013.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/value-added-us-news-and-world-report-returns-to-the-ranks-of-profitability/2013/04/27/2e16c306-ae05-11e2-a986-eec837b1888b_story.html|title=Value Added: U.S. News &amp; World Report returns to the ranks of profitability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial staff of U.S. News &amp; World Report is based in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Brian Kelly (editor)|Brian Kelly]] has been the [[chief content officer]] since April 2007. The company is owned by media proprietor [[Mortimer Zuckerman]].

==Rankings==
===Who Runs America?===
The first of the U.S. News &amp; World Report's famous rankings was its "Who Runs [[America]]?" surveys.  These ran in the spring of each year from 1974 to 1986.  The magazine would have a cover typically featuring persons selected by the USN &amp; WR as being the ten most powerful persons in the United States.  Every single edition of the series listed the [[President of the United States]] as the most powerful person, but the #2 position included such persons as [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-22-1974|title=backissues.com - U.S. News &amp; World Report April 22, 1974 - Product Details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairmen]] [[Paul Volcker]] and [[Arthur Burns]] (each listed multiple years) and US Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-16-1979|title=backissues.com - U.S. News &amp; World Report April 16, 1979 - Product Details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the top ten each year were officials in government, occasionally others were included, including TV anchormen [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Dan Rather]], [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] Chairman [[David Rockefeller]], [[AFL-CIO]] leader [[George Meany]], and consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]]. The only woman to make the top ten list was First Lady [[Rosalynn Carter]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-14-1980|title=backissues.com - U.S. News &amp; World Report April 14, 1980 - Product Details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these overall top ten persons, the publication also included top persons in each of several fields, including Education, Business, Finance, Journalism, and many other areas.  The survey was discontinued after 1986.

===Best colleges===
{{main |U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking}}
[[File:US News College.jpg | thumb|2016 Best Colleges cover]]
In 1983, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' published its first "America's Best [[College]]s" report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morse|first1=Robert|title=The Birth of the College Rankings|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/05/16/the-birth-of-college-rankings|publisher=US News|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings have been compiled and published annually since 1987. These rankings are based upon data that ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' collects from each educational institution from an annual survey sent to each school. The rankings are also based upon opinion surveys of university faculties and administrators who do not belong to the schools. In addition to colleges, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' also ranks graduate schools and academic programs in a number of specific disciplines, including business, law, engineering, nursing, and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools|title=Graduate School Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223061939/https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools|archive-date=2017-02-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of U.S. News &amp; World Report's Best Colleges rankings is reflected in its 2014 release, which brought 2.6 million unique visitors and 18.9 million page views to usnews.com in one day.&lt;ref name="minonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minonline.com/news/23050.html#.U9fIXfldXTo|title=U.S. News Pulls Social Levers to Break Records for 'Best Colleges' Package - min Online|date=19 September 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123051555/http://www.minonline.com/news/23050.html#.U9fIXfldXTo|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic came from over 3,000 sites, including [[Facebook]] and [[Google]].&lt;ref name="minonline" /&gt; U.S. News &amp; World Report continues to publish comprehensive college guides in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=U.S.News+and+World+Report+Best+Colleges&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3AU.S.News+and+World+Report+Best+Colleges | title=Amazon's listings of U.S. News "College Guides" | publisher=Amazon.com | date= | accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Morse created the U.S. News Best Colleges rankings methodology, and continues to oversee its application as chief data strategist at U.S. News.

====Criticism====
{{main | Criticism of college and university rankings (North America) | Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}
During the 1990s, several educational institutions in the [[United States]] were involved in a movement to boycott the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' college rankings survey. The first was [[Reed College]], which stopped submitting the survey in 1995. The survey was also criticized by [[Alma College]], [[Stanford University]], and [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Nelson, "[http://www.universitybusiness.com/page.cfm?p=64 Why you won't find St. John's College ranked in U.S.News &amp; World Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040044/http://www.universitybusiness.com/page.cfm?p=64 |date=2007-09-27 }}", ''University Business: The Magazine for College and University Administrators''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[SAT scores]] play a role in The ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' college rankings even though ''U.S. News'' is not empowered with the ability to formally verify or recalculate the scores that are represented to them by schools. Since the mid-1990s there have been many instances documented by the popular press wherein schools lied about their SAT scores in order to obtain a higher ranking.&lt;ref&gt;Diver, Colin. {{cite web | title=Is There Life After Rankings | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/11/is-there-life-after-rankings/304308/2/ | work= [[The Atlantic]] | date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated that the elements in the methodology of ''U.S News &amp; World Report's'' rankings are redundant and can be reduced to one thing: money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/03/ED28864.DTL&amp;hw=rojstaczer&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=College Rankings are Mostly About Money | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 3, 2001 | first=Stuart | last=Rojstaczer }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2007, during the annual meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], members discussed [[Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)#Presidents Letter|the letter to college presidents]] asking them not to participate in the "reputation survey" section of the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking).

As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the ''U.S. News'' reputational rankings in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Scott | last =Jaschik | title =More Momentum Against 'U.S.News' | publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = 20 June 2007 | url= http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/20/usnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement also said that its members "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = | last = | title = Annapolis Group Statement on Rankings and Ratings | publisher = [[Annapolis Group]] | date = 19 June 2007 | url= http://www.collegenews.org/x7131.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database will be web-based and developed in conjunction with higher-education organizations including the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]] (NAICU) and the [[Council of Independent Colleges]].

On June 22, 2007, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, "in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the 'intangibles' of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges."&lt;ref name="aboutanna"&gt;{{cite web | first = Robert | last = Morse | title = About the Annapolis Group's Statement | publisher = U.S. News &amp; World Report | date = 22 June 2007 | url = https://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702061309/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more | archivedate = 2 July 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, "It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that [[NAICU]] will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. ''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''."&lt;ref name="aboutanna"/&gt;

Some higher education experts, such as Kevin Carey of Education Sector, have asserted that ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s college rankings system is merely a list of criteria that mirrors the superficial characteristics of elite colleges and universities. According to Carey, the ''U.S. News'' ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity. He suggests that there are more important characteristics parents and students should research to select colleges, such as how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Carey | first=Kevin | title=College Rankings Reformed | url=http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf | publisher=educationsector.org | accessdate=July 28, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823184901/http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf | archivedate=August 23, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of college rankings and their impact on admissions gained greater attention in March 2007, when [[Sarah Lawrence College#Outgoing president|Dr. Michele Tolela Myers]] (the former President of [[Sarah Lawrence College]]) [[Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)#Sarah Lawrence College|shared in an op-ed]]&lt;ref name="Tolela Myers"&gt;{{cite news | first = Michele | last = Tolela Myers | title = The Cost of Bucking College Rankings | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 11 March 2007 | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030901836.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', when not given SAT scores for a university, chooses to simply rank the college with an invented SAT score of approximately one standard deviation (roughly 200 SAT points) behind those of peer colleges, with the reasoning being that [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT-optional]] universities will, because of their test-optional nature, accept higher numbers of less academically capable students.

In a 2011 article regarding the Sarah Lawrence controversy, [[Peter Sacks]] of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' criticized the ''U.S. News'' rankings' centering on test scores and denounced the magazine's "best colleges" list as a scam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-sacks/americas-best-college-sca_b_45064.html | title=America's Best College Scam | last=Sacks | first=Peter | publisher=''The Huffington Post'' | date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the ''U.S. News'' worldview of college quality, it matters not a bit what students actually learn on campus, or how a college actually contributes to the intellectual, ethical and personal growth of students while on campus, or how that institution contributes to the public good [...] and then, when you consider that student SAT scores are profoundly correlated [to] parental income and education levels – the social class that a child is born into and grows up with – you begin to understand what a corrupt emperor 'America's Best Colleges' really is. The ranking amounts to little more than a pseudo-scientific and yet popularly legitimate tool for perpetuating inequality between educational haves and have nots – the rich families from the poor ones, and the well-endowed schools from the poorly endowed ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Best global universities===

The weighting of the individual categories in determining overall rank was informed by surveys on what matters most to residents. [[Massachusetts]] occupies the top rank of the 2017 list, with an overall #2 ranking in health care and #1 ranking in education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings Best States Rankings].

The '''University Act''' was enacted by the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] to establish degree-granting [[university|universities]] for [[British Columbia]]. The first University Act was passed in 1890, which act continues in force and defines the first Convocation of The University of British Columbia. A subsequent Act was passed in 1908 (in conjunction with the University Endowment Act of 1907). Under this new statute, the governance of the [[University of British Columbia]] was clarified.

The '''Yale-China Association''' ({{zh|t=雅禮協會|p=Yǎlǐ Xiéhuì}}), formerly '''Yale-in-China''', is an independent, [[nonprofit organization]] which seeks to develop educational programs in and about China and further understanding between Chinese and American people. Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society, Yale-China's work is characterized by long-term relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity. Current programs include the fields of [[public health]] and nursing, legal education, English language instruction, American Studies, and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students. Publications include a regular newsletter, biennial report, and the annual Yale-China Health Journal.

==Establishment==
The Yale-China Association was first incorporated as the '''Yale Foreign Missionary Society''', and was known informally as Yale-in-China as early as 1913. It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise. It was re-incorporated in 1934 as a secular organization, the Yale-in-China Association, and in 1975 as the Yale–China Association.

A reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century, which took form in the [[Student Volunteer Movement]], Yale-China was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of [[Yale]] graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas. The founders chose China as the focus of their work, in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892, [[Horace Tracy Pitkin]], who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]]. The city of [[Changsha]] in [[Hunan]] Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries.

==Early years==
At the urging of the home office in [[New Haven]] as well as other missionaries in China, the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than [[evangelism|evangelical]] function. With the arrival of Dr. [[Edward H. Hume]] in 1905, medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor. The educational compound that began with Dr. Hume's medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school, the [[Yali School]]; the College of Yale-in-China (later moved to Wuhan, where it joined two other missionary colleges to form [[Huachung University]]); and the [[Central South University|Hsiang-Ya Medical College]], Nursing School and Hospital. Over the years, Hsiang-Ya (a compound of hsiang, denoting Hunan, and ya, denoting Yale-China; transliterated today as Xiangya) developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China. More than at other foreign-affiliated institutions, an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible. By the late 1920s, all major leadership positions were held by Chinese, and Yale-in-China was very much a joint Sino-American enterprise.

Between 1919 and 1920, future Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had several encounters with the school: he edited its student magazine, re-focusing it on "thought reorientation," and operated a bookshop out of its medical college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spence |first=Jonathan |title=Mao Zedong: A Life |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale Group Spurs Mao's Emergence |date=29 February 1972 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |page=2 |url=http://digital.library.yale.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/yale-ydn/id/135148/rec/14 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
The war years (1937–45) placed enormous strains on the Yale-in-China institutions, especially the Hsiang-Ya Hospital, which cared for war casualties and refugees. For example, the life of paralyzed [[Frank Wattendorf]] was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore von Karman]] with Lee Edson (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', page 201, [[Little, Brown and Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops. Nevertheless, these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators. The Yale-in-China staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their pre-war operations. Within four years, however, a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and Yale-in-China's future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China.

==Hong Kong Years==
By 1951, the new Communist government had taken possession of Yale-in-China's Changsha properties and renamed the [[Yali School]] as "Liberation Middle School." Dr. Dwight Rugh, Yale-in-China's last representative in Changsha, spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus, and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951. With his departure, the ties between Yale-in-China in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years.

Between 1951 and 1954, hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalist-held Taiwan led to a suspension of Yale-in-China's work within China. [[Preston Schoyer]], who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war, worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends. During those years, Yale-in-China devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the U.S. while looking in Asia for new projects to support. Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by [[Ch'ien Mu]] (1895–1990) and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland. In early 1954, after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations, Yale-in-China's trustees formally affiliated the organization with [[New Asia College]].

Unlike in Changsha, Yale-in-China's relationship with New Asia College was, by intention, one of support and assistance rather than direct administration. Yale-in-China secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other U.S. foundations to support the development of the college, and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States. In 1956, Yale-in-China resumed the practice of sending Bachelors, two recent Yale graduates, to teach English, though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School.

In the late 1950s, the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored. In 1959, the Council of British Universities selected New Asia, United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus. Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asia's entrance. {{sfnb|ChapmanPlumb|2001| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wne5gRl4e-kC&amp;dq=yale-china+association&amp;q=schoyer#v=snippet&amp;q=schoyer&amp;f=false 84]}}  Yale-in-China contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings, including the university health clinic, the Yali Guest House, Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College. Yale-in-China also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the [[Yale-China Chinese Language Center|New Asia - Yale-in-China Chinese Language Centre]] and the [[International Asian Studies Programme]], which now enroll hundreds of international students every year. Meanwhile, the relationship with New Asia College, where the Yale–China Association (as the organization was renamed in 1975) has maintained a representative office for fifty years, remains a strong one.

==Return to the Mainland==
By the 1970s, both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for Yale-China's contributions. At the same time, the normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland. In the fall of 1979, Yale-China staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College, the successor to Hsiang-Ya, and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of Yale-China English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College. Two English instructors were also sent to [[Wuhan University]] the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University.

Despite the geographical continuities, however, the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within Yale-China itself. Political sensitivities in China and Yale-China's own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre-1949 years. Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former Yale-in-China institutions, the emphasis was placed on shorter-term academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program. Throughout the 1980s, Yale-China's medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the U.S. and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge. During the same years, nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in Yale-China's English teaching program in China. Yale-China also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the university's International Asian Studies Program.

The decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of Yale-China's activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of Yale-China's historical bases in Hong Kong, Changsha and Wuhan. While maintaining its English teaching program, Yale-China initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Haven's Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai People's Art Theater which resulted in a Chinese-language stage production of [[Amy Tan]]'s ''[[Joy Luck Club (book)|Joy Luck Club]]'' in 1994. Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies, legal education, public health, nursing, and service in the non-profit sector for China and American students.

The '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' (F&amp;ES) is a [[professional school]] of [[Yale University]]. It was founded to train [[forester]]s, and now trains environmental leaders through four 2-year degree programs ([[Master of Environmental Management]], Master of [[Environmental Science]], Master of [[Forestry]], and Master of Forest Science) and two 10-month mid-career programs. Yale F&amp;ES strives to create new knowledge that will sustain and restore the health of the biosphere and emphasizes the possibility of creating a regenerative coexistence between humans and non-human life and the rest of the natural world. Still offering forestry instruction, the school has the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.

==History==
[[File:Yale School of Forestry class of 1904.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Yale School of Forestry class of 1904]]
The school was founded in 1900 as the '''Yale Forest School''', to provide high-level forestry training suited to American conditions. At the urging of Yale alumnus [[Gifford Pinchot]], his parents endowed the two-year postgraduate program. At the time Pinchot was serving as [[Bernhard Fernow]]'s successor as Chief of the Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], USFS). Pinchot released two foresters from the division to start the school: fellow Yale graduate [[Henry Solon Graves]] and James Toumey.&lt;ref name=Sparhawk&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparhawk |first=W.N. |chapter=The History of Forestry in America |page=710 |title=Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture |year=1949 |location=Washington, D.C.  |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |url= https://archive.org/stream/treesyearbookofa00unitrich |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves became the School's first dean and Toumey its second.

When the school opened, other places in the United States offered forestry training, but none had a post-graduate program. (Both Pinchot and Graves had gone to Europe to study forestry after graduating from Yale.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinchot |first=Gifford |title=Breaking New Ground |year=1998 |publisher=Island Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n64aE9kblKMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA152 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1900, the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] had 24 students, [[Biltmore Forest School]] 9, and Yale 7.&lt;ref name="Sparhawk" /&gt; Despite its small size, from its beginnings the school influenced American forestry. The first two chiefs of the USFS were Pinchot and Graves; the next three were graduates from the school's first decade. Wilderness and land conservation advocate [[Aldo Leopold]] graduated in the class of 1908.

In 1915, Yale School of Forestry's second dean, James Toumey, became one of the "charter members", along with [[William L. Bray]] of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]], by then reestablished at [[Syracuse University]], and [[Raphael Zon]], of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/|title=You are being redirected...|author=|date=|website=esa.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the "activist wing" of that society formed [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"/&gt;

Besides the school's own forests, Yale has used a number of other sites in the eastern United States for field education over the years. From 1904 to 1926, the summer session leading to a master's degree in forestry was held at [[Grey Towers National Historic Site|Grey Towers]] and [[Forester's Hall]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050979_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Forester's Hall |accessdate=2012-05-30 |last1=Steiner |first1=Ben |last2=Husson |first2=Leon |last3=Helfrich |first3=Carson O. |format = PDF |date= December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1912, Yale classes took occasional field trips to the land of the Crossett Lumber Company in [[Arkansas]]. For two decades from 1946 until 1966, the company provided the school a "camp," including cabins and a mess hall, used during spring coursework on forest management and wood products production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1-last=Darling, Jr. |author1-first=O.

Reflective of the expanding variety of environmental interests, the school changed its name to the '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' in 1972. Today, F&amp;ES is a leader in global sustainability, hosting the bi-annual [http://yess.yale.edu Yale Environmental Sustainability Summit] to assemble thought leaders from around the globe. The school's 16th and present dean is [https://environment.yale.edu/profile/burke/ Ingrid "Indy" Burke], who replaced [[Peter Crane|Sir Peter Crane]] in October, 2016.&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;{{Citation | url   = http://news.yale.edu/2016/07/20/biogeochemist-indy-burke-named-dean-yale-s-school-forestry-environmental-studies | title = Biogeochemist Indy Burke named dean of Yale’s School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies | work  = YaleNews | publisher  = [[Yale University]] | accessdate = March 8, 2017 | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yale-Myers Forest]], in [[Union, Connecticut]], donated to Yale in 1930 by alumnus [[George Hewitt Myers]], is managed by the school as a multiple-use working forest. Yale-Toumey Forest, near [[Keene, New Hampshire]], was set up by James W. Toumey (a former dean of the school) in 1913. Other Yale forestlands include Goss Woods, Crowell Forest, Cross Woods, [[Bowen Forest]], and Crowell Ravine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.yale.edu/forests/ |title=Yale School Forests |publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-alarm fire burned several buildings within the Yale Myers Forest Camp on May 28th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/05/29/fire-claims-four-fes-buildings/|title=Fire claims four F&amp;ES buildings|author=|date=|website=yaledailynews.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebuilding efforts are ongoing.

== Student life ==
The school has an active tradition of student involvement in academic and extracurricular life. Many students take part in student interest groups, which organize events around environmental issues of interest to them. These groups range in interest from Conservation Finance and International Development, to the Built Environment and "Fresh &amp; Salty: The Society for Marine and Coastal systems". There are also social and recreational groups, such as the Forestry Club, which every Friday organizes themed "TGIF" ("Thank-God-I'm-a-Forester") happy hours and school parties; the Polar Bear club, which swims monthly in Long Island Sound under the full moon (year-round); Veggie Dinner, which is a weekly vegetarian dinner club; the Loggerrhythms, an a cappella singing group; and the student-run BYO Café in Kroon Hall opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Drew |title=Kroon opens student café |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/feb/18/kroon-opens-student-cafe/ |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable F&amp;ES tradition is the extravagant environmentally inspired decoration of graduation caps in preparation for commencement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/graduation-snapshots/|title=Graduation snapshots|author=|date=|website=environment.yale.edu|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
