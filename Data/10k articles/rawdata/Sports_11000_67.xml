There were two cities bidding to host the event: [[Albena]] and [[Tromsø]]. The bidding procedure, which was held in 2010 in [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], lasted several days; in the end the Norwegians won by a 95–47 vote.

In May 2014, it was announced that the budget for the Olympiad would cost 15 million [[Norwegian krone|NOK]]. However, the Norwegians initially did not know that they also had to organise the [[Chess World Cup 2013]] and therefore they did not take into account the cost for this event in the amount of €2 million. The organisers requested additional funding for the Olympiad apart from the 75 million NOK that were already secured, but the Norwegian government did not approve it. Then, they sought sponsorships to cover the unanticipated expenses, and managed to attract private sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Doggers: [http://www.chess.com/news/troms-olympiad-in-trouble-3259 Tromsø Olympiad in Trouble?], [[Chess.com]], 14 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the Norwegian parliament approved an additional 12 million NOK for staging the event, whereupon the organisers confirmed that the Chess Olympiad would take place in Tromsø.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Doggers: [http://schach.chess.com/news/troms-olympiad-saved-receives-extra-state-funding-8648 Tromsø Olympiad Saved, Receives Extra State Funding], Chess.com, 5 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administrative Director of Chess Olympiad Tromsø 2014 AS was Børge Robertsen. Chairman of the board was [[Henrik Andenæs]], but later he was replaced by [[Herman Kristoffersen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Henriksen, Thor Harald|title=Han fikk ikke vinter-OL til Tromsø.

== The event ==

=== Competition format and calendar ===
The tournament was played in a [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system format]]. The [[time control]] for every single game was 90 minutes per 40 moves, with addition of 30 seconds per move and 30 minutes after the 40th move. It is allowed once again for a player to offer a [[Draw by agreement|draw]] at any time during the game. A total of 11 rounds were played, in which every team played with four of their players against another team. Every team was allowed to nominate one reserve player.&lt;ref name="FIDE-rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=95&amp;view=article |title=FIDE Handbook: Olympiad Pairing Rules |publisher=Fide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams were ranked according to the match points won in every round. In case of same number of match points by two or more teams, the tie-breaker was decided by applying: 1. The [[Sonneborn-Berger]] system; 2. Total game points scored; 3. Sum of the match points of the opponents, excluding the lowest one.&lt;ref name="FIDE-rules"/&gt;

The opening ceremony of the Chess Olympiad was held at 19:30 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]] ([[UTC+02:00|UTC+2]]) on 1 August and the closing ceremony was held at 20:00 CEST (UTC+2) on 14 August.  Tournament rounds started on 2 August and ended with the final round on 14 August. All rounds started at 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), except for the first and the final round which started at 15:00 CEST (UTC+2) and 11:00 CEST (UTC+2), respectively. There were two rest days at the tournament, the first one on 7 August after the fifth round and the second one on 13 August before the final round. In addition, the Arbiters meeting took place at 21:30 CEST (UTC+2) on 1 August and the Captains meeting at 09:00 CEST (UTC+2) on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/olympiad2014/official-info/schedule |title=Tromsø 2014: Schedule |publisher=official website |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open event ===
[[File:Yu Yangyi.jpg|thumb|upright|Yu Yangyi of China won the individual gold medal in the open event.]]
The open section of the tournament was contested by a record number of 177 teams representing 172 nations. Norway, as host nation, fielded three teams, whilst the [[International Braille Chess Association]] (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provided one team.

Players who participated at the Olympiad included the reigning World Champion and highest rated player in the world Magnus Carlsen, nine of the top ten players from the FIDE rating list published in July 2014, and four former World Champions. The former World Champion [[Vishwanathan Anand]], who was the challenger in the [[World Chess Championship 2014]], was the only player from the top ten who missed the Olympiad. The highest rated female chess player, [[Judit Polgár]], represented Hungary in the open section. However, not all of the teams submitted their strongest line-ups for the Olympiad. [[China]], who were expected to be one of the strongest teams in the tournament, were represented by only two players rated above 2700. [[Russia]] were the strongest team in the open section with an average rating of 2777 points, followed by [[Ukraine]] with 2722 and [[France]], led by [[Maxime Vachier-Lagrave]], with 2718. Other teams with average ratings higher than 2700 rating points were [[Armenia]], with the World no. 2 [[Levon Aronian]], playing on the top board, the [[United States of America]], and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="CB: Tromso 2014"&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/tromso-2014-preview-and-preparations Tromso 2014: Preview and preparations], ChessBase, 27 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

China won their first gold in the open event and remained the only unbeaten team in the tournament. They scored eight wins and three draws for a total of 19 points, finishing two points clear of the opposition. Second place was shared by four teams on 17 points: [[Hungary]], [[India]], Russia and [[Azerbaijan]]. Hungary won the tie-breaker for second place to claim the silver medal, and India ranked third to win the bronze medal. Russia, who were once again clear favourites before the tournament, finished in fourth place. Armenia, the defending champions from the previous Chess Olympiad, scored 16 points to finish in eighth place.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/olympiad2014/news/final-interim-report-looking-the-part China and Russia claim gold!], official website, 14 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gaprindashvili Trophy ===
The [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] Trophy is awarded to the nation that has the highest total number of match points in the open and women's divisions combined. Where two or more teams are tied, they are ordered by the same tie breakers as in the two separate events.

The trophy, named after the former women's World Champion (1961–78), was created by FIDE in 1997.

== FIDE presidential election ==
The FIDE presidential election was held at the 85th FIDE Congress, which took place during the Olympiad. All of the 177 member nations of FIDE were eligible to vote for one of the two candidates: the incumbent FIDE President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]] and the former World Chess Champion [[Garry Kasparov]]. Prior to the Congress, Kasparov reproached FIDE for irregularities in the published list of delegates and at least one member of the FIDE Electoral Commission (ELE) agreed with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.com/news/delegate-issues-deepen-for-fide-elections-6742 Delegate Issues Deepen for FIDE Elections], Chess.com, 18 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Ilyumzhinov defeated Kasparov by 49 votes (110 votes for the incumbent president and 61 for Kasparov).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/kirsan-ilyumzhinov-remains-fide-president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov remains FIDE President], ChessBase, 11 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
On 7 July 2014, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov complained in an open letter to the Prime Minister of Norway [[Erna Solberg]] that some teams had difficulties in obtaining travel visas. In the letter he mentioned that the team members with no Norwegian embassies or consulates in their countries had to travel to another country in order to apply for visas; moreover, each team member had to do it individually and in person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8134-presidents-letter-to-the-prime-minister-of-norway-.html President's letter to the Prime Minister of Norway], [[FIDE]], 7 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, Børge Robertsen, administrative director of the Olympiad, responded on behalf of the organisers and notified them that they were working hard on the matter, and had already sent approximately 1,500 invitation letters to participants who required visas. He also stated that the entire visa application process is easy to follow and can be handled online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/visa-problems-for-the-chess-olympiad Visa problems for the Chess Olympiad], [[ChessBase]], 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fondation Neva Women's Grand Prix Geneva 11-05-2013 - Kateryna Lagno.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Kateryna Lagno]]'s transfer from Ukraine to Russia caused controversy prior to the Olympiad.]]
On 16 July 2014, the organising committee announced that some national teams had missed the 1 June deadline to submit their team line-ups. They included [[Central African Republic]], [[Gabon]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Cambodia]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Senegal]] in the open, as well as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]] in the women's section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/olympiad2014/news/late-entries-excluded-from-chess-olympiad Late entries excluded from Chess Olympiad], Chess24.com, 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/russian-reigning-champions-miss-2014-olympiad Russian reigning champions may miss 2014 Olympiad], Chess24.com, 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers also stated that the regulations regarding the deadline applied to all, and that no exceptions would be allowed. Particularly surprising was the disqualification of Russia's women's team, as they were reigning champions from the previous Chess Olympiad. The chess media linked the missed deadline with Kateryna Lagno's circumstance of changing federations, and reported that the Russian Chess Federation allowed the deadline to pass, while awaiting her transfer from Ukraine to Russia to become official. It was alleged that  [[Kateryna Lagno]] was needed to strengthen Russia's women's team following the retirement of [[Nadezhda Kosintseva|Nadezhda]] and [[Tatiana Kosintseva]]. FIDE criticised the decision of the organisers not to allow these teams to compete at the Olympiad. FIDE Vice President Israel Gelfer said that the ultimate decision of allowing teams to compete lays in the hands of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. In addition, he implicated Garry Kasparov, and advocated cancelling the Olympiad. Gelfer said that the organising committee was influenced by people who are working for Kasparov, and that they were using it for election purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/russian-women-s-team-out-of-olympiad Russian Women's team out of Olympiad], ChessBase, 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov responded promptly, and characterized Gelfer's statements as 'bizarre', stating that to punish 175 teams for the mistakes of one was an absurd arrogance. He also criticised FIDE for allowing the Russian Chess Federation to violate the rules and receive an exception, and said that it was a real threat to the global chess community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/garry-kasparov-on-the-threat-to-troms Garry Kasparov on the threat to Tromsø], ChessBase, 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July, the organising committee informed FIDE President Ilyumzhinov that, while they stood by the interpretation of the regulations, they would allow the teams who had missed the 1 June deadline to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/organisers-stand-by-case-but-allow-teams-to-play |title=Organisers stand by case but allow teams to play|publisher=En.chessbase.com |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths ==
The final day of competition was marred by the deaths of the Swiss-born Seychelles player Kurt Meier, who suffered a heart attack during his game, and Alisher Anarkulov, an [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] representing the International Chess Committee of the Deaf, who was found dead in his hotel room shortly afterwards. The closing ceremony began with a [[minute of silence]] to mark the two deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://chess-news.ru/en/node/16440| title =Two Deaths at Olympiad: Another Participant Passes Away  |publisher =Chess-News|date=15 Aug 2014| accessdate = 15 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''All Sport''' is a brand of [[sports drink]], whose competitors include [[Gatorade]] and [[Powerade]]. It was created by [[PepsiCo]], as their response to [[The Coca-Cola Company]]'s Powerade and [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oat's]] Gatorade. After PepsiCo's acquisition of Quaker Oats Company, in 2001, All Sport was sold to [[Monarch Beverage Company|The Monarch Beverage Company]], of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In 2007, All Sport was purchased by privately held [[Big Red (drink)|Big Red, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredltd.com/history |title=History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523191042/http://www.bigredltd.com/history |archivedate=23 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed by [[Keurig Dr Pepper]].

All Sport originally was lightly carbonated, but this was changed after consumers objected. It was also originally marketed as a "Thirst Quencher" like Gatorade but was soon changed to market it as a "Body Quencher" and, more recently, a "Non Carbonated Sports Drink".

==History==
[[File:A bird's view of Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|left|A bird's view of Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar.]]
The stadium was built with Chinese government aid and opened in 1970.&lt;ref name=alaba&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogunsanwo|first=Alaba|title=China's Policy in Africa, 1958-71|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dn0fbuz4mEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=China's+Policy+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fIOCUsjpB8utkgWd_4HgDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=China's%20Policy%20in%20Africa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was China's first stadium project in Africa and it marked the beginning of its [[stadium diplomacy]] over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2014/chinas-stadium-diplomacy-in-africa/ |title=China's Stadium Diplomacy in Africa |last1=Ross |first1=Elliot |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Roads &amp; Kingdoms |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was the location of a ceremony on 5 February 1977, uniting the [[Afro-Shirazi Party]] and the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] into the [[Chama cha Mapinduzi]]. The flags of the respective parties were raised and lowered for the last time with the flag of the Chama cha Mapinduzi then being raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Africa|journal=Africa Journal|year=1997|issue=65-70|pages=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=d-pGTsnMNNHTiAKI1qiAAg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=s_DiAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Chama+Cha+Amaan+Stadium+Mapinduzi+Tanganyika+Afro-Shirazi+Party+African+National+Union&amp;q=final+time#search_anchor|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Konde|first=Hadji|title=Press freedom in Tanzania|year=1984|publisher=Eastern Africa Publications|location=Arusha [Tanzania]|isbn=9976-2-0029-3|pages=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=d-pGTsnMNNHTiAKI1qiAAg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Jd-6AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Chama+Cha+Amaan+Stadium+Mapinduzi+Tanganyika+Afro-Shirazi+Party+African+National+Union&amp;q=amaan#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amani Abeid Karume]] was sworn in as president of Zanzibar on 8 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The East African Journal of Human Rights and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vceAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=East African Human Rights Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual [[Revolution Day (Zanzibar)|Revolution Day]] anniversary celebration at the national level is held at the stadium on 12 January.

It is the biggest sports complex in Iran. The massive [[Azadi Stadium]] is located within the walls of this complex.  It was designed by [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian]] along with the San Francisco office of [[Skidmore,_Owings_&amp;_Merrill|Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merill]], and constructed by Iran's [[Arme Construction Company]].

The complex was initially built for the [[1974 Asian Games]], with a future Olympic Games bid in mind.

The '''California League Most Valuable Player Award''' ('''MVP''') is an annual award given to the best player in [[minor league baseball|minor league baseball's]] [[California League]]. In 1941, [[Spider Jorgensen|John Jorgensen]] won the first ever California League MVP Award.

Eight [[catcher]]s have also won the award. Seven players who won the award were [[pitcher]]s. Twenty-six [[outfielder]]s have won the MVP Award, the most of any position. Six players played during seasons for which position information is unavailable.

Sixteen players from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) organization have won the MVP Award, more than any other, followed by the [[San Diego Padres]] organization (7); the [[Los Angeles Angels|California/Los Angeles Angels]], [[Minnesota Twins]], and [[San Francisco Giants]] organizations (5); the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization (4); the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] organization (3); the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Seattle Mariners]], and [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] organizations (2); and the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Colorado Rockies]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Houston Astros]], and [[New York Mets]] organizations (1).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Dartitis''' (pronounced dart-eye-tis) is a condition which can affect [[darts]] players, and severely damage their performance. It can be compared to 'the [[yips]]', an expression used to describe apparent loss of fine motor skills without any explanation. The term is used in reference to players who struggle with some kind of [[psychological]] problem with their technique and/or release of their darts.

==Etymology==
Dartitis is a [[portmanteau]] of the sport's name and "-itis", a suffix that relates to a medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/itis|title=Definition of '-itis'|publisher=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described by the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' as "(in darts) nervous twitching or tension that destroys concentration and spoils performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/dartitis|title=dartitis|publisher=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
In 1986 five-times World Champion, [[Eric Bristow]] revealed he had the condition because he was having problems with the release of his darts.&lt;ref name=de&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Bristow interview|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123146,00.html|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristow managed to make a partial recovery from the condition, and even managed to regain the number one position in the [[Darts world rankings|world rankings]]. Former World Champion [[Mark Webster (darts player)|Mark Webster]] also had dartitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Darts Championship: Mensur Suljovic and Daryl Gurney in Monday action|url=https://news.sky.com/story/world-darts-championship-mensur-suljovic-and-daryl-gurney-in-monday-action-11175037|website=Sky News|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2017 Grand Slam of Darts]], [[Berry van Peer]] suffered from dartitis. This was visible in his matches against [[Simon Whitlock]], [[Gary Anderson (darts player)|Gary Anderson]] and [[Cameron Menzies]].&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;

==Condition==
Dartitis is believed to be a form of [[dystonia]],&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/13/what-is-dartitis-affliction-explained-after-berry-van-peers-grand-slam-of-darts-trauma-7074642/|title=What is dartitis? Affliction explained after Berry van Peer’s Grand Slam of Darts trauma|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is described by the UK [[NHS]] as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A medical term for a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions. The spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go. Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) can also be a characteristic of some types of dystonia. Dystonia is thought to be a neurological condition (caused by underlying problems with the brain and nervous system). However, in most cases, brain functions such as intelligence, memory and language remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dystonia/|title=Dystonia |publisher=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Gladiator''''' is a 1992 American [[List of sports films|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Rowdy Herrington]], and starring [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[James Marshall (actor)|James Marshall]], [[Brian Dennehy]], and [[Robert Loggia]]. The film tells the story of two [[teenager]]s trapped in the world of [[Crime|illegal]] underground [[boxing]]. One is fighting to pay off [[gambling]] debts accumulated by his father. The second is fighting for the money to get out of the [[ghetto]]. While being exploited by a boxing promoter, the two teens become friends.

==Plot==
Tommy Riley and his father have just moved to start a new life. Tommy's father has accumulated many gambling debts but has found a new job that requires him to travel extensively, leaving his son alone at home. Tommy also has a hard time fitting in at school, having crossed gang members. He takes a job at a local diner and enters into a romantic relationship with Dawn, the daughter of the owner, but is jumped by the gang members outside the restaurant. Seeing how well Tommy is able to fight, a local boxing promoter by the name of Pappy Jack offers Tommy a chance to fight in an illegal underground boxing operation. When two men arrive announcing that Tommy's father owes a large sum of money to pay off gambling debts, Jack convinces his boss, boxing promoter Jimmy Horn to buy out the debt, which forces Tommy to pay off his father's debts by boxing.

Tommy enjoys a great deal of success and develops a friendship with Romano and Abraham "Lincoln" Haines, two fellow fighters. However, he continues to be harassed by gang members, and discovers that two of them, "Black Death" and "Short Cut" are boxers who fight dirty, using elbows, kicks, knees, and low blows, and counting on the crooked refs to overlook the clear violations.  Tommy defeats Black Death in the ring, but Short Cut hides a fluid in his gloves, which he uses to blind Romano during a match.  Unable to defend himself, Romano is brutally beaten in the ring and is declared brain dead by the doctors.  Short Cut later tries the same trick on Tommy, but Tommy has learned to fight dirty, and defeats Short Cut.

Meanwhile, Lincoln shows signs of possible brain damage and is told to quit fighting for at least 60 days or else suffer permanent brain damage.  Despite this, Horn arranges a match between Lincoln and Tommy.  Afraid of killing Lincoln, Tommy takes a beating until the two are unwilling to continue the match.  In revenge, Horn, a former boxer who retired undefeated, punches Lincoln severely enough to knock him out of the ring.

Furious, Tommy challenges Horn to a match.  If Horn wins, Tommy will continue to work for him indefinitely, but if Tommy wins, his father's debt is wiped clean.  Horn accepts on the condition that they fight bare-knuckle. Horn's vast experience with boxing initially gives him the upper hand, and Horn's confidence influences him to play with and humiliate Tommy as a result. Tommy eventually uses the various forms of advice he has received throughout his brief boxing experience to outthink Horn: he fakes a broken hand to give Horn even more confidence, and then uses the element of surprise to defeat Horn, freeing himself from Horn's contract.

{{Main|Gladiator (1992 soundtrack)}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
A soundtrack containing a blend of hip hop and rock music was released on February 25, 1992 by [[Columbia Records]] It failed to make it to the ''Billboard'' charts, but [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant's]] cover of "[[We Will Rock You]]" was a minor hit on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at #83. The soundtrack also contained the last appearance by the rap group, [[3rd Bass]]. [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s unused score was released by [[Intrada Records]] in 2013, but none of [[Brad Fiedel]]'s retained score appears on the 1992 album.

[[Image:Map of SWFC's early home grounds.png|thumb|250px|right|Modern day map of Sheffield showing the locations of the early home grounds of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] (north-south): [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheaf House (stadium)|Sheaf House]], Highfield, [[Olive Grove]] and [[Myrtle Road]].]]
'''Highfield''' is a former home ground of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday Football Club]] and was located on London Road near to the centre of [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The club started to use the ground when they formed in 1867 and continued to use the ground until moving to [[Myrtle Road]] in 1870. 

The ground was a field that was part of a recreational ground that was at the time called ''the Orphanage'', having just changed their name from the ''Cremorne Gardens'' (named after the [[Cremorne Gardens, London|gardens]] in [[London]] and after which [[The Cremorne, Sheffield|The Cremorne]] public house was named).  [[Charles Blondin]], the high wire artist, was reported to have performed in the gardens.  They also provided the home ground for Mackenzie F.C. during the 1867 [[Youdan Cup]].

The site is now thought to be occupied by the [[Highfield, Sheffield|Highfield]] library.

The Pack will hold the fifth selection in the draft, but will have a new coach as [[Mike Sherman]] was dismissed the following day.''
**[[San Francisco 49ers]] 20, [[Houston Texans]] 17 (OT): The 49ers' ''[[Joe Nedney]] kicks a 33-yard field goal with 3:52 left in overtime, giving the Texans the first choice in the 2006 NFL Draft, while the Niners will pick sixth.  The Texans would fire coach [[Dom Capers]] the next day.''
**[[Jacksonville Jaguars]] 40, [[Tennessee Titans]] 13: ''Backup quarterback [[Quinn Gray]] throws two touchdowns for the Jaguars, who rest several starters, while the Titans will select third in the draft thanks to a strength of schedule tiebreaker.''
**[[Minnesota Vikings]] 34, [[Chicago Bears]] 10: ''In [[Mike Tice]]'s last game as Vikings head coach, he goes out a winner thanks to two [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] touchdown passes while Da Bears rested many of their regulars. Tice was informed by new Vikings owner [[Zygi Wilf]] that he was fired one hour following the contest.''
**[[Washington Redskins]] 31, [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 20: ''The Redskins victory clinches the final playoff spot in the NFC as  [[Clinton Portis]] rushes for 124 yards and two touchdowns.  The Eagles also made history — in a double negative way — by becoming the first team since the 2002 expansion to go unbeaten (6–0) in divisional play one year (in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]) to going winless (0–6) the next year and the first in history to do just that.''
**[[St. Louis Rams]] 20, [[Dallas Cowboys]] 10: ''Any playoff drama for Dallas was sucked out with the Redskins' victory, and it showed in the second half for the Cowboys, who blew a 10–7 halftime lead. The game was [[ESPN]]'s final [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] telecast after nineteen seasons, the last eight as a full-season package.  [[NBC]] will take over the package starting with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], renaming the games "[[Football Night in America]]." [[Mike Martz]] and his interim replacement, Joe Vitt, were fired as Rams' coaches the following day, and Cowboys' coach [[Bill Parcells]], who had been reported ready to step down signed a two-year contract extension that Friday (January 6).''

**[[Four Hills Tournament]]: The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jakub Janda]] wins his fifth World Cup event of the season in the New Year Ski Jump in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Germany, 1.9 points ahead of [[Finland|Finn]] [[Janne Ahonen]], who nevertheless retains his overall lead in the Tournament, 5.8 points ahead of Janda.

'''John O'Gaunts''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] from 1884 until 1895.

==History==
Located to the south of Lincoln city centre, the John O'Gaunts ground had no spectator facilities and only a dressing room for the players.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p70, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took its name from [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], who owned land in Lincoln.

Lincoln City were elected to the Second Division of [[the Football League]] in 1892, with the first Football League game played at the ground on 1 October 1892 as Lincoln beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1–0 in front of 2,000 spectators. The highest League attendance at the ground was set on 23 March 1894 when 7,500 watched Lincoln lose 2–0 to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

At the end of the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95 season]] the club moved to [[Sincil Bank]], around 300 metres to the south-east. The final League match at John O'Gaunts was played on 13 April 1895, with Lincoln beating [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] 5–2. The ground was later used for housing, and is now the site of Sibthorp Street.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57568">A '''winless season''' is a [[Season (sports)|regular season]] in which a [[Team sport|sports team]] fails to win any of their games. The antithesis of a [[perfect season]], this ignominy has been suffered twelve times in professional [[American football]], six times in [[arena football]], three times in professional [[Canadian football]], once each in American professional [[field lacrosse|lacrosse]] and [[box lacrosse]], more than twenty-five times in major [[Australian Rules football|Australian football]] leagues, over twenty times in top-level [[rugby league]], at least twice in top-level [[rugby union]], and twice in English [[county cricket]].

==Gridiron football==
Because of the relatively small number of games played in [[college football|college]] and [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[American football|football]] seasons, there is a possibility that a particularly inept team will not manage to win any games. Before overtime was used consistently, teams might tie a game without winning one; these are generally counted in lists of winless seasons. This is because, during eras before overtime was introduced to American football, leagues generally ignored tied games when calculating winning percentage.

Ties the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|2008 Detroit Lions]] for most losses in a single season. Coincidentally, both had perfect 4–0 preseasons. First NFL franchise to have multiple seasons with 15 or more losses, going 1–31 over two seasons, with their only win in week 16 of the [[2016 Cleveland Browns season|2016 season]]. The only franchise to have a winless season and a perfect season ([[1948 Cleveland Browns season|1948]]).

The [[Rochester Jeffersons]] went a combined 0–21–2 from 1922 to 1925, but played only partial NFL schedules in those years (0–4–1, 0–4, 0–7 and 0–6–1, respectively). They also had another winless season in 1911 going 0–1–3 in the [[New York Pro Football League]].

===Arena Football League===
The previously shorter length of seasons in [[arena football]] made imperfect seasons quite possible. The following teams went through an [[Arena Football League]] season without winning a game:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Year || Team || Played || Remarks
|-
| 1989 || [[Washington Commandos|Maryland Commandos]] || 4 || Only year branded as the Maryland Commandos.

|-
| 1994 || [[Milwaukee Mustangs (1994–2001)|Milwaukee Mustangs]] || 12 || First winless team to remain in same city during following season. Went to 10–4 in [[1996 Arena Football League season|1996]]. Folded in 2001.
|-

|-
| 2003 || [[Carolina Cobras]] || 16 || Went to 6–10 the following season. Folded in 2004.
|-
| 2018 || [[Lehigh Valley Steelhawks]] || 15 || Only team in the league to be winless. Was 9-1 the season before and 2nd in the league.
|}

In 2001, the [[Columbus Wardogs]] of [[AF2]], the minor league of the AFL, made history becoming the first American football team to go 0–16.

===United Football League===
The [[United Football League (2009–)|United Football League]] had one winless season. In their inaugural season, the [[2009 New York Sentinels season|2009 New York Sentinels]] lost all six of their games. The team, which was a [[traveling team]] that played games in Hartford, Long Island and New Jersey (and had intended to play a game in New York City but backed out), fired its head coach and settled permanently in Hartford to become the [[Hartford Colonials]]. Under the UFL's double [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format, only one team could finish any particular season entirely with losses, since every team played each other at least twice.

===World League of American Football===
The 1991 inaugural season of the [[World League of American Football]] saw the [[Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks]] fold after losing all ten of their regular-season games.  The following year, the WLAF replaced that franchise with the [[Ohio Glory]] who almost met the same fate but managed one win in their lone season.

===Other American football leagues===
Since non-professional, semi-professional and minor league teams are inherently unstable in their membership, it is far easier for seasons in which a team wins no games to occur. In the case of non-professional teams, neither mechanisms to force a team to shut down against its will, nor effective drafts or revenue sharing mechanisms to distribute talent evenly among teams typically exist, leading to poor teams accumulating multiple winless seasons. Four teams in football history have both lost all their games and failed to score a single point in an entire season; all played eight games or less. The 1938 Clintonville Four Wheel Drive Truckers failed to score a point in a nine-game season, but managed two 0–0 ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least twelve teams who have accumulated losing streaks of 20 games or more; there are also four teams who have accumulated seasons of all losses with at least 13 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Games Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date=1986-10-08 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of minor professional football, particularly in indoor football leagues, winless seasons often result from an owner's abandonment or other financial hardship. The [[American Indoor Football Association]] had at least one winless team in five out of six seasons. The [[National Indoor Football League]] went its first three seasons without a winless season, but beginning in 2004, at least one team went winless every year until the league's collapse in 2007. Though the [[Spring Football League]] had two teams with winless seasons (the [[Los Angeles Dragons]] and the [[Miami Tropics]]), and the [[Stars Football League]] had one such team (the traveling 2011 Michigan Coyotes), they are almost never mentioned in discussions of perfect and perfectly bad seasons, since those teams only played two games each before the seasons were cut short.

[[AF2]] was the minor league of the [[Arena Football League]]. In 2001, the [[Columbus Wardogs]] made history becoming the first American football team to finish a season 0–16.

The [[Legends Football League]] (originally Lingerie Football League), whose seasons are only three to four games long for each team, has had eight teams with perfectly bad seasons in three years of play. One such team, the [[Toronto Triumph]], did not win a game in either of their competing seasons in 2011 and 2012.

The [[Princeton Tigers]] [[sprint football]] squad, a team consisting of players under 172 pounds, sustained 16 consecutive winless seasons before [[Princeton University]] shut the team down in 2015, citing safety concerns in allowing players to play on a team so heavily outmatched.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sprintfootball.com/single-post/2016/04/12/Princeton-drops-Sprint-Football&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Football League===
The [[Canadian Football League]] currently has a regular season of eighteen games; from 1952 to 1985 it was generally sixteen games as with the current NFL season, though those teams in the Eastern Division played only fourteen as late as 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/standings/1973/reg |title=1973 Regular Season Standings &amp;#124; CFL.ca &amp;#124; Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the CFL did not adopt interdivisional regular season play until the early 1960s. Consequently, especially given the much smaller number of teams playing, there have been fewer imperfect seasons than in the National Football League, with the exception of the first decade or so when fewer games were played.

====CFL teams with no wins in a season (based on official CFL site)====

==National Pro Grid League ==
The [[National Pro Grid League]], which operated from 2014 to 2016, has a season of 3 to 4 games per team  plus a 4 to 8 team playoff. The Los Angeles Reign lost all ten games it played during the league's (and team's) three-year existence.

|}

==Lacrosse==
Seasons in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and its predecessors [[Major Indoor Lacrosse League]] and [[Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League]] have varied from eight games in the first years of competition to sixteen games today, with the extension having been gradual. The [[Charlotte Cobras]], who played only one season before folding, are the only team in the history of the NLL to have not won a game in a season. In their sole 1996 season they played twelve games and lost them all, before folding.

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], the season has consisted of either twelve or fourteen games since the league was formed in [[2001 MLL season|2001]]. The only winless season in Major League Lacrosse has been by the 2006 [[Rochester Rattlers|Chicago Machine]], who went 0–12 and lost an MLL record thirteen consecutive games.

==Other North American leagues==
In the other major professional sports leagues of North America it is virtually impossible that a team could lose all its games, for the simple reason that there are many more games in the regular season than in football or lacrosse.

===Major League Soccer===
The Major League Soccer schedule has consisted of between twenty-six and thirty-four games. No team in Major League Soccer has ever come close to losing all its games: the most losses in a MLS season is 24 from 32 games by the [[Kansas City Wizards]] in 1999, the year when the league used shootouts to decide all tied games. Shootouts were abandoned the following season. In [[2013 Major League Soccer season|2013]], [[D.C. United]] set new MLS records in futility. They won a league low three games, and lost a record 24 games, tying the aforementioned Wizards.

===National Basketball Association===
Since the 1967–68 season, the National Basketball Association's regular season schedule has been 82 games long (except 1998–99, 50 games and 2011–12, 66 games due to lockouts). It has been as few as 48 games long, but eventually expanded to an 82-game schedule.

The [[2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats]] hold the record for the lowest winning percentage of any team in an NBA season, winning only 7 out of 66 games in a lockout-shortened season, for a winning percentage of 0.106. This broke the record held by the [[1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers season|1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers]], who had a winning percentage of .110 in a full 82-game season. The [[1947–48 Providence Steamrollers season|1947–48 Providence Steamrollers]] won an all-time NBA low of six games  out of 48 (.125 winning percentage).

The [[1953–54 Baltimore Bullets season|1953–54 Baltimore Bullets]] went 0–20 on the road.  More recently, the [[1990–91 Sacramento Kings season|1990–91 Sacramento Kings]] managed a near-imperfect road season, winning only one of 41 away games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199011200WSB.html |title=Sacramento Kings at Washington Bullets Box Score, November 20, 1990 |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date=1990-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Kings lost 43 consecutive road games before beating the [[Orlando Magic]] 95–93 on November 23, 1991.

====Women's National Basketball Association====
Since its formation in 1997, the WNBA regular season has been gradually increased from 30 to the current 34-game schedule.

No team has gone through a WNBA season without winning a game; the fewest wins in a WNBA season has been three by the [[1998 WNBA season|1998]] [[Washington Mystics]] in their first season, and the [[2011 WNBA season|2011]] [[Tulsa Shock]]. Two other expansion WNBA teams, the [[2008 WNBA season|2008]] [[Atlanta Dream]] at 4–30 and the [[2006 WNBA season|2006]] [[Chicago Sky]] at 5–29 have come closest to this record.

====United States Basketball League====
The [[Atlantic City Seagulls (United States Basketball League)|Atlantic City Seagulls]] of the (now defunct) summertime, minor league [[United States Basketball League|USBL]] finished the 2001 season with an 0–28 record. It was quite a turnaround for the franchise, as they were dominant in the USBL just a few years earlier; the Seagulls were USBL runners-up in 1996, then swept to three straight titles in 1997–99. In 2000, the Seagulls slipped to 12–18, fourth place, and were beaten in the first round of the playoffs; after their winless 2001 campaign, the Seagulls folded.

====British Basketball League====
In 2013, Mersey Tigers became the first top-flight British basketball team to go a whole season winless.

This record of 0–33 in the regular season of the 2012–13 BBL Championship, was completed with a 90–57 loss away to Glasgow Rocks, but can also be extended to include their complete season of 0–35 (defeats in the first round of the BBL Cup and BBL Trophy).

The defeat in the BBL Trophy was also significant because they fell at this stage to EBL Division One side, Worthing Thunder, and in doing so, it was the first time a BBL side had been knocked out from a competition by an EBL team.

They also currently hold the longest losing streak of 34 consecutive defeats in the BBL Championship.

===National Hockey League===
The National Hockey League's schedule, like that of the NBA, consists of 82 games. Since the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05]] [[lockout (industry)|lockout]], teams receive two points for a win, one point for a loss in overtime or a [[penalty shootout|shootout]], and zero points for a loss in regulation time. From 1997 until 2004, teams received two points for a win, one point for a tie or overtime loss, and zero points for a regulation loss. Prior to 1997, teams received two points for a win, one point for a tie, and no points for a loss. 
From 1997 to 2004, NHL standings tables had four columns: W–L–T–OTL. From 2005 to 2010, it was reduced to three, W–L–OTL; in 2011, a "regulation/overtime win" column (ROW) was added, which excludes shootout wins; it does not change the point totals, but does serve as the second tiebreaker (after games played; since all teams play 82 games by the season's end barring any unreschedulable cancellations, it becomes the first tiebreaker at season's end).

No team has ever come close to losing every game in an NHL season; the worst record is by the [[1974–75 Washington Capitals season|1974–75 Washington Capitals]] who went 8–67–5 (8 wins, 67 losses, 5 ties). The 1974–75 Capitals and [[1992–93 Ottawa Senators season|1992–93 Ottawa Senators]] hold the record for fewest wins on the road with one. The NHL played an 80-game season in 1974–75, whereas in 1992–93 the schedule consisted of 84 games, thus giving the Senators the percentage record for worst road record. The Senators also set a record by losing their first 38 consecutive road games (the Senators' road statistics include a neutral site game played in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in which the Senators were considered the road team).
====Ukrainian Hockey Championship====
Winless seasons occurred frequently in the [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship]], the top-level ice hockey league in Ukraine. The longest series belongs to [[HK Dneprovskie Volki Dnepropetrovsk|HK Dniprovski Vovky]] who lost all 30 games in the regulation time in the [[2007–08 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|2007–08 season]]. [[SDYuShOR Sokil]], the academy team of [[HC Sokil Kyiv]], had three winless seasons ([[1999–2000 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|1999–2000]], [[2004–05 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|2004–05]], and [[2006–07 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|2006–07]]). Four more teams completed a season without winning a single game: [[Ivars Kyiv]] lost all 12 games in [[1996–97 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|1996–97]], Kryzynka II, the second team of [[HK Kryzynka Kiev]] (playing in the same league as the main team), tied 1 and lost 13 games out of 14 in [[1998–99 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|1998-99]], [[HC Khimik Sieverodonetsk]] lost all 16 games in [[2003–04 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|2003–04]], and [[VIM-Berkut]] lost all 10 games in [[2009–10 Ukrainian Hockey Championship|2009–10]].
===Major League Baseball===
Since the early 1960s, the schedule of both leagues of [[Major League Baseball]] has been 162 games long, and before that it was 154 games long. With such a schedule, it is practically impossible for a team to finish with a winless season. The [[sabermetric]] baseball statistic [[Wins Above Replacement]] is calculated on the premise that even a team consisting entirely of [[Glossary of baseball (R)#replacement-level player|replacement-level players]] is expected to win a baseline minimum number of games (typically 40-50 depending primarily on the caliber of the team's division) per 162 game season.

The closest to a perfectly imperfect season in the [[National League]] was the infamous [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season]], who finished with a record of 20-134 after its roster was looted by the owners of the team, who then stacked the best players onto the [[1899 St. Louis Perfectos season|St. Louis Perfectos]].

With a win percentage of .130, the Spiders are (as of 2016) the last of three major league teams to have finished a season below the [[Mendoza line]] (.200) in win percentage; the others were the [[1889 Louisville Colonels season|1889 Louisville Colonels]] (.196), and the [[1890 Pittsburgh Alleghenys season|1890 Pittsburgh Alleghenys]] (.169), whose best players had jumped to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the newly formed Player's League.

Since the establishment of the [[American League]] in 1901, the teams to have come closest to imperfection are the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics (36–117), the 1935 Boston Braves (38–115), the 1962 New York Mets (40–120) and the 2003 Detroit Tigers (43–119).

==Australian rules football==

===VFL/AFL===
In the [[Australian Football League]] (until 1990 called the '''Victorian Football League'''), seasons have ranged from twelve games per team (in 1916, when only four teams competed due to World War I) to 22 games (since [[1970 VFL season|1970]], except for 1993 when 20 games were played), with most seasons being of 18 or 22 games duration.

===WAFL===
The [[West Australian Football League]] has existed within Western Australia under various names since 1885, and until the 1980s was of equivalent standard to the VFL and SANFL. Its season was originally around six to nine games in length, later increasing to 21 games, and from 2018 is 18 games.{{ref label|under-age|a|a}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wafl.com.au/games |title=West Australian Football League |publisher=WAFL |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1897-1995====
From the time of the formation of the Victorian Football League in 1896 until it was dissolved in 1995, the VFA was the second-tier club competition in Victoria. Its home-and-away season varied erratically from 12 to 22 games in length.

==Rugby league==

===Great Britain===
In the [[Rugby Football League Championship]], teams initially played a variable number of games, with the maximum ranging over time from 26 to 38, and some teams playing as few as fourteen. In more modern times the fixture list has been standardised at 26 games per team.

As a result of this fairly lengthy schedule, it has been almost impossible for British rugby league teams to lose all their games, with the only exception being during World War II's so-called "Wartime emergency League" when teams were often able to arrange no more than ten games and some as few as five. The only two winless seasons since normal competition resumed after the war have been in the second and third divisions of the Championship.

===New South Wales Rugby Football League/National Rugby League===
In the New South Wales Rugby Football League, the ancestor of today’s [[National Rugby League]], seasons were initially between eight (in the event of [[Kangaroo tour]]s) and sixteen games long, so that a very bad team could go through a season with only losses. As a result of the expansion of the NSWRL from 1947 onwards, the season has been lengthened gradually with a few intermissions. The following NSWRFL teams up to 1966 did not win a single game:
{| class="wikitable sortable"

|-

|}
Since 1967, NSWRFL and later NSWRL, ARL and NRL seasons have been between 22 and 26 games long; thus it is much less likely a very bad team could lose every single one of its games.

===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long, so that a very bad team could easily fail to win a game; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games, which made winless seasons much less likely.

==Rugby union==
[[Super Rugby]], the Southern Hemisphere's principal club competition, has seen two teams go through an entire season with no wins or draws. Both seasons were in the competition's past incarnations of Super 12 and Super 14, each name reflecting the number of competing teams.

Under both Super 12 ([[1996 Super 12 season|1996]]–[[2005 Super 12 season|2005]]) and Super 14 ([[2006 Super 14 season|2006]]–[[2010 Super 14 season|2010]]) formats, each team played all other teams once, resulting in seasons of 11 and then 13 games. The competition became Super Rugby with the addition of [[Melbourne Rebels|a 15th team]] in [[2011 Super Rugby season|2011]]. The season format was also heavily revamped; the regular season now consists of 16 matches.

The Super 12 and Super 14 eras each saw one team finish a season with only losses; both teams with this dubious distinction are from [[South Africa]]. In [[2002 Super 12 season|2002]], the [[Bulls (Super Rugby)|Bulls]], based in [[Pretoria]], finished with 11 losses from 11 matches. The other imperfect season was that of the [[Johannesburg]]-based [[Lions (Super rugby franchise)|Lions]] in the final season of the Super 14 format in 2010, who lost all 13 of their matches, while ending up with a final points difference of negative 300.

In [[2018 National Rugby Championship|2018]], the [[Sydney Rays]] finished the National Rugby Championship regular season with 0 wins and 0 draws in 7 games.

==Association football==
Only three teams are known to have completed a season with no victories or draws. [[Antigua Barracuda F.C.|Antigua Barracuda]] lost all 26 matches of the [[2013 USL Pro season|2013]] [[United Soccer League|USL Pro]], while in the 2015–16 season, English non-league team Longford AFC, played a 30-game season in the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two (14th tier on the English pyramid), losing all their matches after the majority of their players and manager left. In 2016, [[Grêmio Barueri Futebol|Grêmio Barueri]] lost all 19 matches of the [[Campeonato Paulista Série A3]], the third level of the São Paulo state championship. After the disastrous season, the Antigua and Grêmio Barueri teams folded.

In the [[2010–11 Ukrainian Second League]] (3rd tier on the Ukrainian pyramid), [[FC Veres Rivne]] lost all 14 out of 22 scheduled games before being expelled from the league due to failure of payment of league dues; in addition, they also did not score a single goal at home.

In top-level domestic league football however, few teams have completed their respective seasons without winning a game. In the [[2010–11 Serbian SuperLiga]], [[FK Čukarički Stankom]] played an entire season winless, drawing five matches and losing 25 in a 30-game season, giving them only 5 points and finishing bottom in a field of 16. The team also only scored ten goals whilst conceding 65.

In the [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group]], which is the top tier of association football in the European country, three teams have all played a season without winning, with those being [[Torpedo Ruse]] (four draws out of 22 matches during [[1951 A PFG|1951]]), [[Rakovski Ruse]] (one draw out of 30 matches during [[1996–97 A PFG|1996/97]]) and [[Chernomorets Burgas Sofia]] (also one draw out of 30 matches during [[2006–07 A PFG|2006/07]]). Chernomorets were however the worse performing out of these, conceding 131 goals with only eight in reply (the same number scored as Rakovski Ruse in their winless season), they still however completed the season with a minus 2 points total, because they violated a rule concerning not being able to field enough youth players.

In the [[1946–47 Allsvenskan]] with 22 games played, [[Billingsfors IK]] tied 3 games and lost 19, the only team in Swedish football history never to win even one single Allsvenskan game in a season.

In the [[1999–2000 Vyshcha Liha]], the highest division of Ukrainian football championship, [[FC Zirka Kirovohrad]] tied 9 matches and lost 21 out of 30.

The open high frequency of draws in association football, coupled with the relatively long length of seasons and [[promotion and relegation]] system used in a majority of jurisdictions to automatically remove the lowest performing teams from any given league, makes winless seasons less likely to occur.

==Netball==
In the [[ANZ Championship]], which formed out of the old Commonwealth Bank Trophy in 2008, seasons have been thirteen games. There has so far been one winless season, by the [[Central Pulse]] from [[Wellington]] (formed as a combination [[Capital Shakers|of the Wellington Shakers]] and Western Flyers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/sport/national-sport/217301 |title=Central Pulse fail to attract Silver Ferns |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the opening 2008 season.  They did earn one point when a game was abandoned due to a leaking roof. The Pulse were to win only one game each in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10581309|title=Netball: Pulse winless no more|date=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010, thus having a record of 2–36 after three seasons.

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
{{Main article|Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884|Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1920}}
In English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]], which has a history dating back to the early nineteenth century and was until the middle twentieth century up to the highest standard of the game, seasons have varied in length. Before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team losing all its games was not uncommon. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of [[one-day cricket]], seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Only two county teams have ever finished a season with only losses in a program of eight or more games:

There were no completely winless seasons in the [[Pro40|Sunday League]] limited-overs competition during its history from 1969 to 2009.

===International first-class cricket===
With the exception of the [[Sheffield Shield]] since the 1970s, most first-class cricket competitions outside England have either been knock-outs or of such short length that it becomes an everyday occurrence for a team to lose all its games. Some, such as the [[Ranji Trophy]] and most seasons of the [[Quaid-e-Azam Trophy]], have indeed been ''knockout'' competitions, which typically use first innings lead to decide if a match is unfinished.

There have still be some notable winless sequences in non-English first-class cricket:
* in the 1981–1982 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Karachi lost all nine of its matches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/2/Quaid-e-Azam_Trophy_1981-82.html |title=The Home of CricketArchive |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* between 1959–1960 and 1986–1987, Jammu and Kashmir played a total of 115 games without a win&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Thomas; ''The Rigby A−Z of Cricket Records''; p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===International one-day and Twenty20 cricket===
In the 2012–13 season of the Australian [[Big Bash League]], the [[Sydney Thunder]] completed an imperfect season where they lost all their eight games despite possessing the likes of [[Chris Gayle]].
==Notes==
{{note label|under-age|a|a}}In the [[1944 WANFL season|1944 under-19 wartime competition]] that replaced the senior competition between [[1942 WANFL season|1942]] and that season due to the player drain of World War II, [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] lost all nineteen of their games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6615">The '''Nike CTR360''' is a line of [[association football|football]] [[football boot|shoes]] manufactured by [[Nike Inc.|Nike]].

==CTR360 Maestri history==
In October 2009, Nike released the CTR360 Maestri, when they were debuted on the pitch by [[Cesc Fàbregas]].&lt;ref name=footyboots&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footy-boots.com/cesc-fabregas-and-the-ctr360-7931/|title=Cesc Fabregas and the CTR360|accessdate=4 November 2001|publisher=footy-boots.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was meant to reference the Italian for "master".&lt;ref name=soccerbible&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2009/06/01/nike-ctr360-maestri-football-boots.aspx|title=Nike CTR360 Maestri Football Boots|accessdate=3 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTR360 Maestri was created to complement the existing Nike lines of the [[Nike Tiempo|Tiempo Legend]], [[Nike Total 90|Total 90 Laser]] and [[Nike Mercurial Vapor|Mercurial Vapor]]. While the Laser and Vapor are designed for the premier [[Forward (association football)|striker]], the CTR was created for the playmaking [[midfielder]].&lt;ref name=nike&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nike.com/nikefootball/bootroom/boots/ctr360?locale=en_US|title=CTR360|accessdate=3 November 2011|publisher=nike.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its launch, the CTR360 was worn by many top football players, such as [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Mario Balotelli]], [[Javier Mascherano]], [[Sergio Busquets]], [[Florent Malouda]] and [[Alex Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/general/archive/2009/10/04/boot-spotting-nike-ctr360-debut-special.aspx|title=Boot Spotting - Nike CTR360 Debut Special!|accessdate=4 November 2001|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the features built into the CTR360 Maestri, were developed to assist players with receiving and distributing the ball, such as dampening pods on the forefoot, and asymmetrical lacing to increase the amount of contact with the ball. To aid distribution, there is a rubberized pass pad on the instep along with memory foam to create a more uniform surface.&lt;ref name=soccerbible/&gt; In order to help improve the player's first touch, Nike developed a new synthetic leather for the boot, called KANGA-LITE. KANGA-LITE is water resistant, similar to other synthetic leathers, but has better ball feel and touch.&lt;ref name=soccerbible/&gt;

The launch of the CTR featured two colorways, Black/Red/White and White/Yellow/Black. Subsequent colorways were White/Royal/Silver/Black/Retro, White/Maroon/Gold, White/Cyber/Black and Black/White/Blue. The CTR360 is available in five different outsoles, FG - firm ground, SG - soft ground, AG - artificial grass, TF - turf and IC - indoor.

==CTR360 Maestri II==
[[File:CTR360 Maestri II.JPG|thumb|Nike CTR360 Maestri II White/Silver/Purple colorway]]
In December 2010, [[Cesc Fàbregas]] again debuted the new CTR on the pitch against rivals [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/general/archive/2010/12/14/fabregas-debuts-nike-ctr360-maestri-ii.aspx|title=Fabregas Debuts Nike CTR360 Maestri II|accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTR360 Maestri II was designed to build upon the success of its predecessor while making improvements where necessary. The dampening pods on the forefoot were retained, although they were made larger to offer greater control.&lt;ref name=soccerbible2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2010/12/07/nike-ctr360-amp-ctr360-ii-what-s-the-difference.aspx|title=Nike CTR360 &amp; CTR 360 II - What’s the difference?|accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the instep, the control pads have gained a fin-like design, similar to that of the T90 Laser III, for added traction.&lt;ref name=soccerbible2/&gt; The memory foam on the instep was replaced by a pass and receive pad featuring grip-like traction, inspired by a golf putter.&lt;ref name=soccerbible2/&gt;
The CTR360 Maestri II is available in the same five outsoles as the original. The debut colorway for the boot was Red/White/Black, followed by White/Black/Blue, White/Black/Yellow, Black/White/Red, Platinum/Blue/Black and the current White/Silver/Purple. Nike have also come out with the "clash collection" which provided a new colour way  White/Blue/black.

First two color releases in 2012 for the Nike CTR360 Maestri II is Dark Shadow/Volt and Loyal Blue.

==Elite Series==
In anticipation of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in South Africa, Nike released the Elite Series of football boots. The goal was to create faster versions of their shoes, without compromising their most important qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2010/04/22/nike-elite-world-cup-football-boots.aspx|title=Nike Elite World Cup Football Boots|accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce the weight of the CTR, a carbon fiber outsole was added which made the boot 19% lighter.&lt;ref name=soccerbibleelite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2010/05/04/nike-elite-ctr360-maestri-world-cup-football-boots.aspx|title=Nike Elite CTR360 Maestri|accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original colorway for the Elite series was Metallic Mach Purple/Total Orange. These colors were chosen to make it easier for players to spot each other on the field.&lt;ref name=soccerbibleelite/&gt;

The Elite CTR360 was worn in the World Cup by many players, including [[Mario Balotelli]], [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Fabio Cannavaro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/general/archive/2010/06/07/pre-world-cup-football-boots-spotting.aspx|title=Pre-World Cup Football Boots Spotting|accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=soccerbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the Elite Series in May 2010, there has been an Elite version of every colorway of CTR except the current White/Silver/Purple.

== Discontinuation==
The successful line was ended by Nike when it announced its new silo, Magistas. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.footyheadlines.com/2013/12/new-nike-magista-2014-boot-leaked-ctr.html&lt;/ref&gt; The replacing of CTR360 received a mixed reception. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.footyheadlines.com/2013/12/new-nike-magista-2014-boot-leaked-ctr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pepsi Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], USA. The arena is home to the [[Denver Nuggets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[Colorado Avalanche]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and the [[Colorado Mammoth]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). When not in use by one of Denver's sports teams, the building frequently serves as a concert venue.&lt;ref name=aolcity&gt;{{cite web|title=Pepsi Center in Denver, CO|url=http://search.cityguide.aol.com/denver/entertainment/pepsi-center/v-101448627|publisher=AOL City Guide|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "...Affectionately referred to as "The Can" by some..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is named for its chief [[corporation|corporate]] [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], [[PepsiCo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About KSE|url=http://www.pepsicenter.com/kse/company/about-kse/|publisher=Kroenke Sports Enterprises|accessdate=June 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Pepsi Center was constructed as part of a large six-year sporting venue upgrade in Denver along with [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]], and [[Broncos Stadium at Mile High]] (formerly Invesco Field at Mile High), home of the [[Denver Broncos]]. The complex was constructed to be readily accessible. The arena is situated at Speer Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in downtown Denver, and is served by 2 nearby exits off [[Interstate 25]]. [[Pepsi Center / Elitch Gardens (RTD)|A light rail station]] is on the western side of the complex.

Ground was broken for the arena on November 20, 1997, on the {{convert|4.6|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. Its completion in October 1999 was marked by a [[Celine Dion]] concert.&lt;ref name=arenaseat/&gt; Also included in the complex are a basketball practice facility used by the Nuggets, and the Breckenridge Brewery Mountain House''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pepsicenter.com/food-drink/breckenridge-brewery-mountain-house&lt;/ref&gt;'', a restaurant accessible from within and outside the Center itself. The [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the building houses a suspended [[sculpture]] depicting various hockey and basketball athletes in action poses.

Before the construction of Pepsi Center, the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche played in [[McNichols Sports Arena]], a building that has since been torn down to serve as a parking lot for nearby [[Broncos Stadium at Mile High]]. Coincidentally, prior to the Avalanche relocating to Denver, the then-[[Quebec Nordiques]] played at another arena to which Pepsi owned naming rights: the [[Colisée Pepsi]].

==Activity==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
[[File:Pepsi Center logo (1999-2009).svg|thumb|Original Pepsi Center logo (1999–2009)]]
[[File:Pepsi Center inside.jpg|thumb|Pepsi Center's interior during the 2007 Frozen Four hockey tournament, with the scoreboard used from 1999 to 2013.]]
Pepsi Center hosted the [[51st National Hockey League All-Star Game|2001 NHL All-Star Game]], the 2001 [[Stanley Cup]] Finals, and the [[2005 NBA All-Star Game|2005]] [[NBA All-Star Game]]. From 2004 to 2006, the center hosted the [[Mountain West Conference]] [[Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|men's basketball tournament]]. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) Men's [[ice hockey]] [[Frozen Four]] West Regional was hosted on March 24 and March 25, 2007. The [[Centrix Financial Grand Prix of Denver]] was held in the parking lot from 2002 to 2006. In 2004, [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] was selected as one of five cities in the U.S. to host the Dew Action Sports Tour, a new extreme sports franchise that began in 2005. Titled the Right Guard Open, the inaugural event was held at Pepsi Center from July 6 to July 10. The Dew Action Sports returned to Denver for its second year in 2006 during July 13&amp;ndash;16.

The NCAA Men's [[ice hockey]] [[Frozen Four]] tournament was held at the arena on April 10 and April 12, 2008. Pepsi Center also hosted games of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in 2004, 2008, 2011, and 2016. In 2012, the NCAA Women's [[basketball]] [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship|Final Four]] was held here.

===Other events===
During the week of July 2&amp;ndash;8, 2007, the arena hosted the International Convention and Contests of the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]], a men's singing organization.

The arena also hosted the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], although the party's [[President of the United States|presidential]] [[Nomination|nominee]], then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]], made his acceptance speech at the nearby [[Invesco Field at Mile High]]. To prepare for the convention, Pepsi Center underwent large scale projects including electrical power increases and the installation of new [[transformer]]s by [[Xcel Energy]] (which is the namesake of the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], which hosted the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] the following week) and telecommunications wiring by [[Qwest]]. A backup generator was installed that has the capacity to power the entire city of [[Pueblo, Colorado]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Roughly {{convert|12|mi|km}} of [[optical fiber]] cables were installed for the massive communication needs of the convention.

The UFC has hosted four events at the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-president-dana-white-we-always-planned-to-come-back-to-denver |title=UFC President Dana White: We Always Planned to Come Back to Denver |date=July 24, 2011 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arena enhancements==
Prior to the 2013–14 season, the octagonal scoreboard that was in use since the arena's opening was replaced with a new four-sided rectangular scoreboard. The two center faces measure {{convert|27|ft|m}} high by {{convert|48|ft|m}} long, while the two end faces measure {{convert|21|ft|m}} high by {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide. &lt;!--please insert citation on scoreboard--&gt;

==Double-booking controversy==
[[File:Pepsi Center DNC 2008.jpg|right|thumb|The main entrance to the arena as it looked during the third day of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].]]
On August 15, 2008, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] booked an internationally televised event, ''[[WWE Raw]]'', to take place at Pepsi Center on Monday, May 25, 2009. However, Denver Nuggets and Pepsi Center owner Stan Kroenke arranged a verbal agreement to book Game 4 of the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|NBA Western Conference Finals]] between the Nuggets and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] on the same date prior to the Nuggets actually earning a slot in the playoffs. Though a contract existed to hold the venue for the WWE event and only a verbal agreement granted the Nuggets the venue, Kroenke stood firm that the Nuggets game would take precedence.

WWE chairman [[Vince McMahon]] said, "Even though the Denver Nuggets had a strong team this year and were projected to make the playoffs, obviously Nuggets and Pepsi Center owner Stan Kroenke did not have enough faith in his own team to hold the May 25 date for a potential playoff game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WWE vs. Denver Nuggets|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/10250122?cid=2009EP-00|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 19, 2009|date=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the WWE event, [[Ticketmaster]] refused to refund their processing fee, thereby only giving fans a partial refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Game 4 on Monday Bumps WWE Event from Pepsi Center|first=Benjamin|last=Hochman|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_12399761|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee, however, is strictly charged by Ticketmaster alone and not WWE or KSE.
On May 20, 2009, it was announced that the WWE event scheduled for Pepsi Center would be moved to [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] (home of the Nuggets' Western Conference Finals opponent), and return to the Denver area for a non-televised event at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on August 7, 2009, with refunds for the original date made available at points of purchase.

The '''Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta''' is a [[regatta]] in the English county of [[Devon]]. The first recorded regatta was in 1822 and the regatta was formally established in 1834. It is based on the [[River Dart]], in the town of [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], and the village of [[Kingswear]] opposite.

The regatta takes place over the Thursday, Friday and Saturday where the Friday is the last Friday in August.  The regatta is formally opened on the preceding Wednesday evening, although as the regatta has grown, some events start as early as the weekend before.

The regatta is organised by a committee appointed at a public meeting each year called by Dartmouth Town Council.  Many other organisations are involved in running events under the auspices of the Regatta Committee.

==History==

The first recorded regatta in Dartmouth was in 1822. There were three sailing races, one six-oared gig race, and a military band played out at the [[Dartmouth Castle]] and 120 attended a ball.

In 1834 the regatta, which used to be run by leading gentlemen of the neighbourhood, changed its format when the inhabitants of the town called a meeting and elected a committee of their own.

In 1856 it became a royal regatta when [[Queen Victoria]], [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] came into Dartmouth in a flotilla of nine boats on an unscheduled visit because of bad weather, arriving the day before the regatta started on 11 August. Prince Albert and his son went up to Sharpham Point in the new steamboat Dartmouth, which had arrived on the river only the previous day. The Queen followed in the state barge, going as far as [[Dittisham]].  The Queen came ashore at 6 pm and was met by the borough mayor.  The Queen then drove in a carriage over 'The Ridges' to the 'Black House' at the junction of Jaw Bones/Swannaton Road/Stoke Fleming Road. She was accompanied by Sir H.F. Seale on horseback.  That night there were special illuminations both ashore and afloat.  The Queen donated £25 and Prince Albert gave £20 for three rowing races to be competed for by the sailors of Dartmouth and this was done on the second day of the regatta.  The Queen the next day sailed on to Plymouth but before leaving bestowed the title of 'Royal' on the regatta.

The Committee write each year to the Monarch to request the renewal of the Royal Patronage.

The patron now is [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], the Duke of York.

==Events==

Although the event is described as a regatta, the charter specifically provides that a regatta should take place on the [[River Dart]] during a fair in the town.  To many visitors, the events in the town are more visible, but there is a vast array of events both on and off the water. 

===Rowing===

There are two distinct forms of rowing, on two separate days.

The West of England Amateur Rowing Association holds one stage of its championship on the Thursday.  This rowing is in [[skiff]]s and [[scull]]s, with competitors from across the West of England and further afield - Bexhill Rowing Club and BTC (Southampton) being present at the 2008 regatta.

On the Friday, the local rowing events take place, where local crews (often representing pubs and clubs from the town) compete over various distances in purpose built rowing boats.

===Air displays===

The regatta has for many years hosted the [[Red Arrows]] RAF display team. 

In recent years, displays have also been made by the [[Royal Navy]] [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopter display team, the [[Black Cats (Royal Navy)|Black Cats]]. In addition, the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]], RAF [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]], [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] and [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar]] aircraft have displayed, along with RN [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] and [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook]] helicopters. In recent years it has also had The Royal Artillery parachute display team landing in the river Dart.

===Running===

Organised in association with the Dartmouth Amateur Athletics Club, adult road races to Stoke Fleming (up what is possibly the steepest hill in any regular race, Weeke Hill) and back, and fun races for children are held.

===Tennis===

An [[Lawn Tennis Association|LTA]] recognised tournament is held on the courts in Coronation Park and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], with events covering mixed doubles and the normal singles and doubles matches.

===Sailing===

Four days of events are held in [[Start Bay]], along with fun sailing in the [[River Dart]]. This [[regatta]] is one of the largest [[sailing]] events in the [[United Kingdom]]. The sailing events are organised by the Joint Regatta Sailing Committee ([[Royal Dart Yacht Club]] and Dartmouth Yacht Club) under the auspices of the regatta committee.

===Guardship===

Traditionally, a [[Royal Navy]] vessel attends the regatta as guard ship. In 2008, [[HMS Argyll (F231)|HMS ''Argyll'']] (a type 23 frigate) performed the task, following on from her sister ship [[HMS Somerset (F82)|HMS ''Somerset'']] the previous year. The regatta has also had visits from the navies of [[Belgian Navy|Belgium]], [[French Navy|France]] and [[Armada of the Argentine Republic|Argentina]] ([[ARA Libertad (Q-2)|ARA ''Libertad'']]), among others. The guard ship is open to the public during the regatta, and the crew traditionally take part in a large number of regatta events.

===Street Market===

During the regatta, the road along the river front is closed to allow the street market (known locally as the "Cheap Jacks") to set up in front of the Royal Avenue Gardens.  The market is open only on the Wednesday to Saturday of regatta week.

There is also a craft market in a marquee on Coronation Park.

===Steamboat rally===

Usually, a rally of steam powered vessels, all available for inspection throughout the regatta, is organised in conjunction with the [[Steam Boat Association of Great Britain]]. They, with other classic craft, also participate in a review, proceeding down river with a commentary detailing their history.

===Children's events===

Pavement artists, crab fishing and fancy dress competitions all feature.

===Other events===

There are numerous other events including:
* Barrel rolling races
* Waiters and Waitresses races
* The International Trolley Race
* Tug of war
* A waterborne tug of war (two boats secured together by a rope at the stern with the teams rowing against each other)
*Water Polo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverdartmouth.com/festivals-and-events/port-of-dartmouth-royal-regatta-p1511953&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fireworks===

There are two fireworks displays, on the Thursday and Saturday nights.

===Music===

Throughout the week there are public performances in the bandstand in the Royal Avenue Gardens. There is a rock concert at the beginning of the week.

There are also recitals in the local churches.

The '''Rugby Federation of Armenia''' ({{lang-hy|'''Հայաստան Ռեգբիի ֆեդերացիա''', Hajastani Regbii Federatsia}}; {{lang-ru|'''Федерация регби Армении''', Federatsiya Regbi Armenii}}) is the governing body for [[rugby union]] in [[Armenia]].

It was founded in 2000 and joined FIRA-AER (now [[Rugby Europe]]) as an associate member in 2002. Rugby Europe suspended the Rugby Federation of Armenia in November 2014 due to inactivity.&lt;ref name =rd-2014/&gt;

==History==
Rugby was first played in the country in the 1960s, when Armenia was a republic within the [[Soviet Union]]. Armenia had its own representative team within the USSR, although it was not considered to be a proper national side. Armenian clubs including Yerevan Dinamo RC and Yerevan Spartak RC played in the top division of [[Soviet Championship (rugby union)|Soviet Championship]] and [[Soviet Cup (rugby)|Soviet Cup]]. The rugby teams were disbanded due to the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]] and economic difficulties in Armenia during first years of independence in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name = ah-2012/&gt;

Rugby in Armenia went into hibernation for almost a decade until the founding of the Rugby Federation of Armenia (RFA) in 2000. Gagik Panikian become the RFA president in 2002 and the RFA joined FIRA-AER (now [[Rugby Europe]]) later that year. National teams for sevens and fifteen-a-side were soon formed to play in European competitions.

As of 2012, there were three rugby clubs in Armenia: Ararat, Artashat, and Ureni.&lt;ref name = ah-2012/&gt; Rugby Europe suspended the Rugby Federation of Armenia due to inactivity in 2014.&lt;ref name =rd-2014/&gt;

==National teams==
*[[Armenia national rugby union team|Armenia]] - the national men's rugby union team was formed in 2004 and was largely drawn from players of Armenian heritage in France. The team played at the 2004 European Championships, defeating {{nrut|Norway}} and {{nrut|Israel}}.
*[[Armenia national rugby union team (sevens)|Armenia 7s]] - the national men's rugby union seven-a-side team was formed in 2003.

'''USA Footvolley''' is the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[Footvolley]] in the [[United States]]. It is in charge of selecting the United States Footvolley team and any other teams which officially represent the United States, as well as the overall organization and operation of the sport within the country, in accordance with the Amateur Sports Act. The national headquarters is located in [[Sunny Isles Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name='WOODS'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-143726711/footvolley-hot-sport-south.html |title=Footvolley hot sport in South Beach: |accessdate=2010-01-29 |last=Woods |first=Casey |date=March 27, 2006 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |publisher=Miami Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Footvolley’s popularity taking off in South Florida|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article51001670.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965&lt;ref name='PVTLN'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footvolley.net/news.php?nsid=17 |title=Birthplace of Footvolley to Host Olympic Games! |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Pro Footvolley Tour, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]]. The game of footvolley - first called 'pevoley', literally meaning "footvolley", that was discarded for "futevôlei". Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro; however cities like [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], [[Goiânia]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] and [[Florianópolis]] have players who have been playing footvolley since the 1970s.

Teams of footvolley had five a side at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.&lt;ref name='FVBRH'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html |title=Futevolei Historia |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Futevolei.com.br }} ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html&amp;ei=9zljS9ukC4eXtgepss24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBAQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26num%3D50 English translation]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival.
Brazilian athletes: Wellington Correa 'Helinho' and Renan were the Champions of the competition; but the sport gained steam for international development.

In 2016, the City of Sunny Isles Beach, FL provided USA Footvolley its Official Training Centre. Here is where the National Team trains.

==Organizational structure==
There are several parts and levels that make up USA Footvolley. There is the National governing body (national) level, the Zone (regional) level, and the Local Footvolley Committee (local/state) level.

===Pro Footvolley Tour rules===
The rules in the [[United States]] professional tour [[Pro Footvolley Tour]] are designed to make the matches faster and more aggressive. Some of the notable differences are: net height of 2.10 Meters; 2-pointers are awarded up to 3-times maximum per set for all shots scored with the foot when one foot goes above the head when striking the ball and the other foot is off the ground (bikes, matrix kicks, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro Footvolley Tour |url=http://wlrn.org/post/shark-attack-beach-footvolleys-popularity-taking-florida-us// |publisher=[[wlrn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro Footvolley Tour airs on Root Sports, Comcast SportsNet, Time Warner SportsChannel, Bright House Networks, WapaDeportes, and CaribVision.  Through DirecTV Pro Footvolley Tour can be seen in the entire United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Explore DirectTV |url=https://www.directv.com/tv/Pro-Footvolley-Tour-c01jckE2UEpKYms9/Episode-UW5ZWjRPRVVvQkhRZzFtanlJaWJPZz09 |publisher=[[DirectTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comcast |url=http://corporate.comcast.com/images/sportsnet-houston1.pdf |publisher=[[Comcast NBC Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Championship/US Open===
The National Championship is exactly what the name implies.  There is only 1 National Championship meet at the conclusion of each season across the country. The National Championships are also of the invitational meet format and offer extremely high level competition.  Only a very small percentage of people who ever play footvolley will make it to this high a level of competition. This meet is generally used to determine the US National Team for various international level meets each year, but is not used to determine the US Olympic Team.

===US Olympic Trials===
The United States Olympic Trials will be held for the first time on June 25 in [[Seaside, Oregon]]. This event will be held  once every 4 years. Since this meet offers such a coveted prize (a spot on the US Olympic Team) for the 2016 Rio Olympics exhibition tournament. United States citizenship is required to compete at this meet since only United States citizens are allowed to represent the United States at the Olympics. The Olympic Trials are also under unique requirements made by the [[United States Footvolley Association|USFA]].

Trials meets are also held for the World Championships and World University Games, typically at a national championship meet.

==Plot==
Bliss Cavendar ([[Ellen Page]]) is a misfit in the small town of Bodeen, [[Texas]], with no sense of direction in her life. Her mother, Brooke ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]), a former beauty queen, pushes her to enter beauty pageants despite her lack of interest. During a shopping trip to Austin with her mother, Bliss encounters three [[roller derby]] team members and finds herself intrigued by the sport in which teams and players are given pun names that highlight the violent aspect of the sport. Intrigued, she and her friend Pash ([[Alia Shawkat]]) attend a roller derby bout under the pretense of going to a football game, where they see the "Holy Rollers" defeat the "Hurl Scouts", a perennially unsuccessful derby team.

Returning to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Bliss lies about her age and tries out for the Hurl Scouts, discovering her natural skating abilities in the process. Joining the team, Bliss is given the [[derby name]] "Babe Ruthless." After realizing she needs to be merciless in roller derby, Bliss sees she needs to take charge in other aspects of her life. One involves Bliss's love interest, a lanky young rock guitarist and singer named Oliver ([[Landon Pigg]]) whom she meets via her exposure to roller derby. They enjoy a whirlwind romance before Oliver leaves for a tour, taking a T-shirt Bliss gave him to remember her by, in exchange for his jacket. She later finds a picture of him at a gig with another girl, who is wearing her T-shirt. She burns his jacket in retribution and subsequently breaks up with him following his return, although he vehemently denies that anything happened.

Another sub-plot examines Bliss's relationship with her parents, a loving but controlling mother and an amiable but clueless father ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) who seldom opposes his wife's parental decisions. After seeing her excelling and enjoying roller derby, Bliss's father convinces her mother to let Bliss out of a pageant (which is at the same time as the championship roller derby game) and convinces the Hurl Scouts to come get Bliss for the bout. Various other sub-plots include her relationship with Pash, and confrontations with a stuck up snob at school. Pash is fine with Bliss's new path, until she gets arrested with an open container of beer while she is waiting for Bliss, who has left to go find Oliver. Eventually, Pash gets together with their manager and forgives Bliss. The movie ends with the Hurl Scouts narrowly losing the championship match and everyone finally getting along; the team chants "We're number two!" which was the same thing they chanted when they lost their first match.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[File:Eve Whip It TIFF09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] was praised by critics for her performance.]]
Critical reception for ''Whip It'' was generally positive; based on 182 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 84%, with an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 7/10.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/whip_it/|title=Whip It Movie Reviews|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]] | accessdate= April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] calculated an average score of 68, based on 31 reviews.&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/whip-it|title=Whip It Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]| publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. O. Scott]] called the film "predictable", but said "You might, nonetheless, want to see this movie, even—or maybe especially—if you have seen ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' or ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]''. Familiarity is not always a bad thing, and if the script, by Shauna Cross, piles sports movie and [[coming-of-age]] touchstones into a veritable [[cairn]] of [[cliché]]s, the cast shows enough agility and conviction to make them seem almost fresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/movies/02whip.html |title=Misfits With Big Hearts and Roller-Derby Grit |date= October 2, 2009 | first= A.

Scott| work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] said it's a "coming-together of two free spirits, Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page, and while it may not reflect the kind of female empowerment [[Gloria Steinem]] had in mind, it has guts, charm, and a black-and-blue sweetness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= September 30, 2009 | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/whip-it-2009 |title=Whip It |first= Roger | last= Ebert| authorlink = Roger Ebert| work = RogerEbert.com | accessdate= June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Miami Herald'', "''Whip It'' is completely predictable from the first frame. It also is ridiculously, utterly entertaining. Drew Barrymore's smashing directorial debut harkens back to an era in which Hollywood studio pictures could still move and enthrall the audience while plying in hoary cliches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= September 30, 2009 | url= http://miamiherald.typepad.com/reeling/2009/09/review-whip-it.html |title=Review: ''Whip It''|first= Rene | last= Rodriguez| work= [[The Miami Herald]] | accessdate= June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
