'''Abdul Bari''' was a [[squash (sport)|squash]] player. He was one of the leading players in [[India]] in the 1940s. After India became independent, he was sponsored to travel to the [[United Kingdom]] to compete in the [[British Open Squash Championships|British Open]] (the effective world championship of the sport at the time), where he finished runner-up in 1950 to the [[Egypt]]ian player [[Mahmoud Karim]].

Bari was distantly related to the brothers [[Hashim Khan]] and [[Azam Khan (squash player)|Azam Khan]], who went on to dominate the international squash scene in the 1950s and early-1960s representing [[Pakistan]]. 

Bari died of a [[Stroke|brain haemorrhage]] in 1954.

'''Alys McKey Bryant''' (1880–1954) was an American [[aviator]]. She was the first woman to fly on the Pacific Coast and in Canada, and one of the few female members of the [[Early Birds of Aviation]]—individuals who had solo piloted an aircraft prior to December 17, 1916. She cut short her brief career as a pilot after her husband, John Bryant, died while performing an air show in Victoria, Canada, in August 1913.  During World War I she trained pilots.

==Biography==
Bryant began flying in 1912, when she answered a magazine advertisement offering "the ultimate in excitement" by Fred Bennett of the Bennett Aero Company of The Palms, California. Bennett's pilot, John Bryant, approved her and signed her on to his exhibition flying team as an airplane pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nexis.com/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=47FK-KXJ0-01D6-Y34K&amp;csi=249804&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|title=Canada's First Air Disaster|last=Allinson|first=Sydney|date=December 15, 2002|work=|access-date=June 23, 2016|via=Times Colonist (Victoria)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of being signed on, she had never flown before, which was not uncommon during the time. Most pilots had to teach themselves to fly. On July 31, 1913, she became the first woman to fly in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Frank H.|date=October 1939|title=Pioneer Flying in British Columbia, 1910—1914.|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/bchf/bchq_1939_4.pdf|journal=The British Columbia Historical Quarterly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her real passions were repairing and building.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Most of her work was the manual labor that, at the time, it was normally expected men would do. She had careers in aviation, submarine diving, automobiles, and was also into motorcycles. During World War I, she helped construct balloons and dirigibles at Akron,{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} and trained pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/ms/87-02/87-2-A.HTML |title=Alys McKey Bryant Papers |website=specialcollections.wichita.edu |access-date=2016-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505052702/http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/ms/87-02/87-2-A.HTML |archivedate=2016-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1913 Alys married John Bryant, who was killed in a crash ten weeks after their wedding. After that she continued to fly for a while, including a trip to Vancouver, where she flew in an exhibition for Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother George, Duke of York &amp;ndash; both future Kings of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Planck |first=Charles |date=1942 |title=Women with Wings |publisher=Harper and Brothers Publishers |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Americans in North Korea''' consist mainly of defectors and prisoners of war during the [[Korean War]] as well as their locally born descendants.

==Prisoners of war==
On September 17, 1996, The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported the possible presence of American POWs in North Korea, citing declassified documents. The documents showed that the [[U.S. Defense Department]] knew in December 1953 that "more than 900 American troops were alive at the end of the war but were never released by the North Koreans". The [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] did not confirm the report, saying it had no clear evidence that any Americans were being held against their will in North Korea but pledged to continue to investigate accounts of defectors and others who said they had seen American prisoners there. The North Korean government has said it is not holding any Americans.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Knew in 1953 North Koreans Held American P.O.W.'s. New York Times,September 17, 1996 article. https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/17/world/us-knew-in-1953-north-koreans-held-american-pow-s.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|List of American and British defectors in the Korean War}}
[[Operation Big Switch]], the exchange of remaining prisoners of war, commenced in early August 1953 and lasted into December. During that period, some 21 American soldiers refused to return to their homeland and decided to stay in the country (along with one British soldier and 327 South Koreans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.gov/military/korea/factsheets/opswitch.html Operations Big and Little Switch]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly before the deadline was about to expire, Americans south of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] broadcast a message to the defectors in [[Panmunjom]], saying "We believe that there are some of you who desire repatriation." Defector Richard Corden shouted "Do any Americans want to go home?" and his fellow detainees answered "No!"&lt;ref name="arti_Kore"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Korea Vets Bear Stigma of American Talib Lindh | last1= Crenson | first1 = Sharon L. |last2=Mendoza | first2=Martha | work = Los Angeles Times |agency=AP | date = April 7, 2002 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/07/news/mn-36625/2 | page = 2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small population of '''Angolans in the Netherlands''', largely consisting of refugees from the [[Angolan Civil War]].

==Migration history==
The Netherlands has no longstanding historical links with Angola. Early Angolan migrants in Europe typically [[Angolans in Portugal|settled in Portugal]], the former [[colonial history of Angola|colonial power in their home country]]. However, they found it difficult to obtain work there, and also suffered from discrimination. Some thus travelled to other countries, including the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Trouw20070720"&gt;{{citation|date=2007-07-20|accessdate=2009-09-04|last=Sysling|first=Fenneke|periodical=Trouw|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2007/07/20/2306121/Nederland_in_trek_bij_Angolezen.html|title=Nederland in trek bij Angolezen/Netherlands in vogue with Angolans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major draw for Angolan migration to the Netherlands was the relatively generous asylum policy.&lt;ref name="Trouw20070720"/&gt; In the first half of 2001 alone, 1,800 Angolans applied for asylum in the Netherlands, making up nearly half of the total number of Angolan asylum-seekers in the western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nederland populairst bij Angolezens/Netherlands most popular with Angolans|periodical=[[Trouw]]|date=2001-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-04|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2001/09/01/2377492/Nederland_populairst_bij_Angolezen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, from 1998-2002, more than 10,000 Angolans applied for asylum in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Trouw20070720"/&gt; As many as 4,500 of those consisted of [[unaccompanied minor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article935072.ece/Angolese_jongeren_zien_Nederland_als_paradijs|title=Angolese jongeren zien Nederland als paradijs|last=Moleman|first=Hans|date=2002-07-02|accessdate=2009-10-11|periodical=[[de Volkskrant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands had their claims for asylum rejected and were thus ineligible for residence permits, but had been permitted to delay their departure due to the lack of safety in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2001/05/30/2363390/Kalsbeek__Angolezen_terug.html|title=Kalsbeek: Angolezen terug/Kalsbeek: Angolans, go back|date=2001-05-30|accessdate=2009-08-04|periodical=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|State Secretary]] for Justice [[Job Cohen]] pushed to have the delay of departure scheme ended; though in his judgment the situation in Angola as a whole was still not safe, Luanda was stable enough to enable Angolans to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Angolese asielzoekers hoeven nog niet terug/Angolan asylum-seekers will not go back|periodical=Trouw|date=1999-07-02|accessdate=2009-09-04|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1999/07/02/2402231/Angolese_asielzoekers_hoeven_nog_niet_terug.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2002, there was little return migration from the Netherlands to Angola; only ten such individuals were known to the International Organization for Migration.&lt;ref name="Iom2006"&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2003, the number of returnees began to increase sharply.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Return and Emigration of Aliens from the Netherlands programme, rejected asylum seekers are eligible for a variety of support including an airline ticket to the airport nearest their return destination, reimbursement of fees paid to acquire travel documents, and a resettlement payment to assist with the initial period after relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaccompanied minors returning to Angola voluntarily also receive assistance in locating their family, and may also be provided with free temporary accommodation at a reception centre if their family cannot be located or cannot receive them.&lt;ref name="Iom2006" /&gt;

There is also some [[illegal immigration]] from Angola to the Netherlands. Irregular migrants do not typically make use of [[people smuggler]]s to enter the Netherlands; they instead get help from their social networks. Such practises have prevented the emergence of large-scale smuggling organisations in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wijk|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic characteristics==
{{asof|2009}}, statistics of the Dutch [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] with regards to people of Angolan origin showed:
*6,286 persons of first-generation background (3,705 men, 2,581 women)
*2,729 persons of second-generation background (1,336 men, 1,393 women), of which:
**815 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (401 men, 414 women)
**1,914	persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (935 men, 979 women)
For a total of 9,015 persons (5,041 men, 3,974 women). This represented roughly 3.5 times the 1996 total of 2,594 persons. Their total population peaked in 2004 at 12,281 persons and has been in decline since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBS|2009}}; the year 1996 is the earliest for which statistics are available online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
{{Asof|2007}}, Angolans had established five of their own organisations in the Netherlands, as well as three jointly with Congolese migrants. The latter are unusual in Dutch society, as the two groups share neither a common language (other than Dutch) nor a common country of origin. The organisations generally aim to bring Angolans together and promote their integration into Dutch society, empower Angolan women, provide sex education, and organise social activities and sports competitions. The organisations are generally male-dominated, with as many as 80% of the members being men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laarman|2007|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenians in Cyprus''' or '''Armenian-Cypriots''' ({{lang-hy|Կիպրահայեր}}, {{lang-el|Αρμένιοι της Κύπρου}}, {{lang-tr|Kıbrıs Ermenileri}}) are ethnic [[Armenians]] who live in [[Cyprus]]. They are a recognized minority with their own language, schools and churches. Despite the relatively small number of Armenians living in Cyprus, the Armenian-Cypriot community has had a significant impact upon the [[Armenian diaspora]] and Armenian people. During the [[Middle Ages]], Cyprus had an extensive connection with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], while the [[Ganchvor monastery]] had an important presence in [[Famagusta]]. During the [[Ottoman Cyprus|Ottoman Era]], the [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary church]] and the [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] were very prominent. Certain Armenian-Cypriots were or are very prominent on a Panarmenian or international level and the fact that, for nearly half a century, the survivors of the [[Armenian Genocide]] have co-operated and co-existed peacefully with the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriots]] is perhaps a unique phenomenon across the Armenian Diaspora. The emigration of a large number of Armenian-Cypriots to the [[United Kingdom]] has virtually shaped today's [[Armenians in the United Kingdom|British-Armenian]] community.

Currently, Armenians in Cyprus maintain a notable presence of about 3,500 on the island (including about 1,000 non-Cypriot Armenians),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesser-used Languages in States Applying for EU Membership|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2001/298817/IPOL-CULT_ET%282001%29298817_EN.pdf|website=European Parliament|accessdate=20 January 2015|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly centred on the capital [[Nicosia]], but also with communities in [[Larnaca]], [[Limassol]] and [[Paphos]].&lt;ref name=FaridM&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirbagheri|first=Farid|title=Historical dictionary of Cyprus|year=2010|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f82Jn_H4VukC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=armenians+cyprus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qy57T8PmC-Pz0gHvrdiTBg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20cyprus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadjilyra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjilyra|first=Alexander-Michael|title=The Armenians of Cyprus|year=2009|pages=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jH4Xy4KFrYC&amp;q=paphos#v=onepage&amp;q=%225%25%20in%20paphos%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian Prelature of Cyprus is located in Nicosia.

Since May 2006, the Representative is [[Vartkes Mahdessian]].&lt;ref name="today"&gt;[http://artsakhtoday.com/?p=3885&amp;lang=en Vartkes Mahdessian takes more than 2/3 of the vote winning by 68%]&lt;/ref&gt; The religious leader of the community, since June 2014, is Catholicosal Vicar Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, accountable to the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Armenians in Cyprus}}

===Byzantine Era (578–1191)===
[[File:MauriceTremissis.png|thumb|right|300px|[[solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]]]

Armenians have had a presence in Cyprus since the 6th-century.&lt;ref name=kasbarian&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Edinburgh University Press| isbn = 978-0-7486-8610-0| pages = 241–273| last1 = Kasbarian| first1 = Sossie| last2 = Gorman| first2 = Anthony| title = Diasporas of the Modern Middle East| chapter = The ‘Others’ Within:: The Armenian Community in Cyprus| series = Contextualising Community| accessdate = 2018-11-22| date = 2015| chapterurl = http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0jc2.11| jstor = 10.3366/j.ctt16r0jc2.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Theophylact Simocatta]], an early 7th-century [[Byzantine]] writer, the Byzantine General [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice the Cappadocian]] captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners during his campaign against the Persian King [[Chosroes I]]; around 3,350 of these prisoners were deported to Cyprus.&lt;ref name=RCohen&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=Global diasporas: an introduction|year=2008|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tMICnlZ7fwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=armenians+in+cyprus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TS17T8i6F4ru0gH_2bmuBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20in%20cyprus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor [[Heraclius]] for political reasons and also during the pontificate of [[Catholicos]] [[Hovhannes III Odznetsi]] for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Arab Conquest|Arab raids in Cyprus]], more arrived by the patrician [[Niketas Chalkoutzes]] for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of [[Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca|Saint Lazarus' basilica]] in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] church in the 10th century and was used by [[Armenian-Catholics]] during the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Crusades.E2.80.94Lusignan Period 1191-1489|Latin Era]] as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos [[Khachig I of Armenia|Khatchig I]] established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] was established. Between 1136–1138, Byzantine Emperor [[John II Comnenus]] moved the entire population of the Armenian city of [[Tel Hamdoun|Tell Hamdun]] to Cyprus. After [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]]' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince [[Thoros II, Prince of Armenia|Thoros II]] in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against [[Richard Lionheart|Richard the Lionheart]], when he landed in Limassol.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19540738/The-Armenians-of-Cyprus-booklet|title=Booklet on the Armenians of Cyprus|last=Hadjilyra|first=Alexander-Michael|date=May 2009|publisher=Kalaydjian Foundation|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin Era (1191–1570)===
[[File:Lazarus Larnaca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca|Saint Lazarus' basilica]] in Larnaca]]

After the purchase of Cyprus by titular [[Franks#Legacy|Frankish]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] Guy de Lusignan in 1192, in his attempt to establish a western-type feudal kingdom, the latter sent emissaries to Europe, Cilicia and the [[Levant]], resulting in a massive immigration of Armenians and other peoples. Because of their proximity, their commercial ties and a series of royal and nobility marriages, the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] and the Kingdom of Cilicia became inextricably linked. In the subsequent centuries, thousands of Cilician Armenians sought refuge in Cyprus fleeing the Muslim attacks such as the [[Siege of Antioch (1268)|Fall of Antioch]]. Cyprus became now the easternmost bulwark of Christianity; in 1441 the authorities of Famagusta invited Armenians from Cilicia to settle there. The Fall of [[Sis (Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia)|Sis]] in April 1375 put an end to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia; its last King, [[Leo V, King of Armenia|Levon V]], was granted safe passage to Cyprus. Although the [[Egyptian Mamelukes]] had taken over Cilicia, they were unable to maintain their hold on it; Turkic tribes eventually made their way to the region and established themselves there, leading to the conquest of Cilicia by [[Tamerlane]]. As a result, 30,000 Armenians left Cilicia in 1403 and settled in Cyprus, which continued to be ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayk.net/docs/The_Armenians_of_Cyprus.pdf|title=Book The Armenians of Cyprus|last=Hadjilyra|first=Alexander-Michael|date=May 2009|publisher=Kalaydjian Foundation|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Frankish and the Venetian Eras, there were Armenian churches in Nicosia, Famagusta, [[Spathariko]]. Armenians were amongst the seven most important religious groups in Cyprus, in possession of stores and shops in the ports of Famagusta, Limassol and [[Paphos]], as well as in the capital Nicosia, thus controlling a large segment of commerce. Additionally, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] was one of the eleven official languages of the Kingdom of Cyprus. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} According to chroniclers [[Leontios Machairas|Leontios Makhairas]], [[George Boustronios]] and [[Florio Bustron]], the Armenians of Nicosia had their own Prelature and used to live in their own quarter, called ''Armenia'' or ''Armenoyitonia''. In Famagusta, a Bishopric was established in the late 12th century and Armenians lived around the Syrian quarter. Historical documents suggest the presence of an important monastic and theological centre there, at which Saint [[Nerses of Lampron|Nerses Lampronatsi]] is said to have studied. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

During the Middle Ages, Armenians in Cyprus were actively engaged in commerce, while some of them formed military garrisons in [[Kyrenia]] and elsewhere. A number of Armenians defended the Frankish Kingdom of Cyprus against the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] at Xeros, against the Saracens at [[Stylloi|Stylli]] village and against the Mamelukes in Limassol and [[Khirokitia]]. By 1425, the renowned [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] – originally the Coptic monastery of [[Macarius of Alexandria|Saint Makarios]] near Halevga came under Armenian possession, as did sometime before 1504 the Benedictine/Carthusian nunnery of [[Notre Dame de Tyre]] or Tortosa in walled Nicosia. During the Latin Era, there was also a small number of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]] in Nicosia, Famagusta and the [[Bellapais]] Abbey, where Lord [[Hayton of Corycus]] served as a monk. The prosperity of the inhabitants of Cyprus was brought to a halt by the harsh and corrupt Venetian administration and the iniquitous taxes they imposed. Their tyrannical rule, combined with adverse conditions, caused a noticeable decline in the island's population. According to historian Stephen de Lusignan, by the late Venetian Era, Armenians lived mainly in Famagusta and Nicosia and, in small numbers, at three "Armenian villages", [[Platani, Cyprus|Platani]], [[Kornokipos]] and Spathariko. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Ottoman Era (1570–1878)===
[[File:Magaravank1974.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] monastery (1967)]]

During the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|Ottoman conquest of the island]], about 40,000 [[Ottoman Armenians|Ottoman-Armenian]] craftsmen were recruited. Many of the Ottoman Armenians who survived the conquest settled mainly in Nicosia, increasing its Armenian population, while the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was recognised as an [[Ethnarch]]y, through the ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' institution. However, the Bishopric in Famagusta was abolished, as the Christian population was [[Siege of Famagusta|slaughtered or expelled]] and the entire walled city became forbidden for non-Muslims. As a reward for their services during the conquest, the Armenians of Nicosia were granted the right to guard Paphos Gate. However this privilege was used only for a short period. By a ''[[firman]]'', they were given back the Notre Dame de Tyre church, which the Ottomans had turned into a salt store. Additionally, the Magaravank monastery had won the favour of the Ottomans and became an important way station for Armenian and other pilgrims en route to the [[Holy Land]], as well as a place of rest for travellers and Catholicoi and other clergymen from Cilicia and [[Jerusalem]]. Contrary to the [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latins]] and the [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronites]], Armenians – being Orthodox – were not persecuted because of their religion by the Ottomans. Even though about 20,000 Armenians lived in Cyprus during the very first years of the Ottoman Era, by 1630 only 2,000 Armenians remained, out of a total of 56,530 inhabitants. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} 
[[File:Eramian Farm House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Eramian Farm House in [[Pano Deftera]]]]
In the [[Bedesten]], there were many Armenian merchants and in the late 18th century/early 19th century Nicosia's leading citizen was an Armenian trader called Sarkis, who was a "''beratli''" and was initially the [[dragoman]] for the French Consul, before becoming the dragoman for the English Consul. Gifted with the acumen of industry, Armenians practised lucrative professions and in the beginning of the 17th century [[Armenians in Iran|Persian Armenians]] settled in Cyprus as silk traders, as did some affluent Ottoman-Armenians in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Boghos-Berge Agha Eramian. However, with the new order of things, the number of Armenians and other Christians dramatically declined due to the onerous taxation and the harshness of the Ottoman administration, compelling many Christians to become [[Linobambaki]], [[Crypto-Christianity|Crypto-Christians]], which explains why former Armenian villages were inhabited by [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriots]] at the end of the 19th century. A few Armenian-Cypriots became Catholics through marriage with affluent Roman Catholic families. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Gradually, after the bloody [[Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire#1821-1829|1821 events]], the Ottomans destroyed the Armenian and Greek mansions, prohibited [[Greek Cypriots|Greeks]], Franks,{{clarify|reason=French catholics?|date=November 2018}} Armenians and Maronites from carrying guns and hanged or massacred 470 notables, amongst them the Armenian parish priest of Nicosia, der Bedros, some improvements were observed during the [[Tanzimat]] period. In the spirit of the [[Hatt-i Sharif|Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane]], the Armenian Bishop, the Greek Archbishop and the Maronite Suffragan Bishop participated in the Administrative Council, which was formed in 1840. After 1850, some Armenians were employed in the civil service, while in 1860 the Notre Dame de Tyre became amongst the first in Cyprus to have a [[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]. Additionally, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 benefited the Armenian and other merchants of the island, while in 1870 the first Armenian school was established in Nicosia by newly arrived Archimandrite Vartan Mamigonian. Furthermore, as a result of the [[Hatt-ı Hümayun]] in 1856, the administrative autonomy of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was officially recognised. Based on various estimates, the Armenian-Cypriot community of the 19th century numbered between 150–250 persons, the majority of whom lived in Nicosia, with smaller numbers living in Famagusta, Larnaca, the north and south of the capital and, naturally, around the Magaravank.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-1"/&gt;

===British Era (1878–1960)===
[[File:Geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots.jpg|thumb|right|Geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots]]

With the arrival of the British in July 1878 and their progressive administration, the already small Armenian community of the island was particularly strengthened. Known for their linguistic skills, several Armenians were contracted to Cyprus to work as interpreters and public servants at the consulates and the British administration, such as Apisoghom Utidjian. The number of Armenians in Cyprus significantly increased following the massive deportations, the massacres and the [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide]] perpetrated by the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Young Turks]]. Cyprus welcomed over 10,000 refugees from [[Cilicia]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Constantinople]], who arrived in Larnaca and all its other harbours, about 1,500 of them made the island their new home. Industrious, cultivated and progressive, they brought new life into the old community and establish themselves as people of the arts, letters and sciences, entrepreneurs and merchants, craftsmen and photographers, as well as professionals who introduced new crafts, dishes and sweets to the island, thus contributing to Cyprus' socioeconomic and cultural development.&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibrahayer.com/index.php5?&amp;page_id=159&amp;path=159|title=Life in the Armenian Quarter|date=May 2011|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newcomers established associations, choirs, sports groups, Scout groups, bands, churches, schools and cemeteries throughout Cyprus. Armenians were the first locksmiths, mechanics, seat, comb and stamp makers, upholsterers, watchmakers and zincographers in Cyprus. They were the first to introduce the cinema, they significantly improved the craft of shoemaking and it was Armenians who first introduced [[pastirma|Armenian bastourma]], [[baklava]], dried apricots, gassosa, [[gyros]], [[halva]], [[ice cube]]s, [[Kibbeh|koubes]], [[Lahmacun|lahmadjoun]], [[Loukoumades|lokmadhes]] and pompes into the Cypriot cuisine. Armenians also introduced two techniques of embroidery needlework: the Aintab work and the Marash work.
[[File:Armenian Quarter Cyprus 1930's.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Victoria Road, Nicosia of the Armenian Quarter in the 1930s]]
Law-abiding by nature,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Armenian-Cypriots always had a high profile with the British administration and many became conscientious civil servants and disciplined policemen or were employed at the [[Cyprus Government Railway]] and at Cable and Wireless. Throughout the 1920s–1950s, many worked at the asbestos mines at [[Pano Amiantos|Amiandos]] and the copper mines at Mavrovouni and [[Skouriotissa]], some of whom had been trade unionists. Some Armenian-Cypriots participated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|1897 Greco-Turkish War]], the two World Wars and the [[EOKA]] struggle. Also, the [[French Armenian Legion|Eastern Legion]] was formed and trained between December 1916 and May 1918 in [[Monarga]] village, near Boghazi, consisting of over 4,000 Diasporan Armenian volunteers who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Some Armenian refugees arrived from [[Armenians in Israel|Palestine]] and [[Armenians in Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"/&gt; The Armenian-Cypriot community prospered throughout the British Era, by establishing associations. In many ways unique across the whole Armenian Diaspora, it was built just outside Nicosia between 1924–1926, after the generous and benevolent donation of the Egyptian-Armenian tobacco trading brothers Krikor and Garabed Melkonian, initially in order to shelter and educate 500 orphans of the Genocide, who planted the trees in front of the school in memory of their slaughtered relatives. From an orphanage (1926–1940), it gradually became a world-renowned secondary school with a boarding section.&lt;ref name="EPASI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epasi.eu/CountryReportCY.pdf|title=Education Policies to Address Social Inequalities: Cyprus Country Report|last=Spinthourakis|first=Julia-Athena|date=November 2008|work=Department of Elementary Education|publisher=[[University of Patras]]|page=4|accessdate=11 February 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence Era (1960–present)===
The end of the EOKA struggle found Armenian-Cypriots having forged strong bonds with the rest of the Cypriots. The 1960 Independence brought a new era for the Armenians of Cyprus, who – together with the Maronite and Roman Catholics – were recognised as a "''religious group''" by the [[Constitution of Cyprus|Cypriot Constitution]] and were now represented by an elected Representative. The size of the community, however, had been reduced because of the emigration of about 900 Armenian-Cypriots to the [[United Kingdom]], due to the emergency situation caused by the EOKA struggle and the poor state of the local economy. A second factor that contributed to the reduction of the community's size was the emigration of about 600 Armenian-Cypriots to [[Soviet Armenia]], as part of the pan-Armenian movement for repatriation.&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibrahayer.com/index.php5?&amp;page_id=150&amp;path=150|title=From the past of the community: Nerkaght|date=April 2011|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

During the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963 Turkish self-segregation|1963–1964 inter-communal troubles]], the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered major losses, as the Armenian quarter of Nicosia fell into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area: taken were the Prelature building, the mediaeval Notre Dame de Tyre, the Melikian-Ouzounian school, the Genocide Monument, the club houses of the Armenian Club, AYMA and [[AGBU|Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU)]], as well as the Armenian Evangelical church; also taken was the mediaeval [[Ganchvor monastery|Ganchvor church]] in Famagusta. In total, 231 Armenian-Cypriot families became victims and/or lost their shops and enterprises. As a result, hundreds of Armenian-Cypriots left for [[Armenians in the United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Armenians in Canada|Canada]], [[Armenians in Australia|Australia]] and the [[American Armenian|United States]].&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer5"/&gt; After the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered additional losses, several families became refugees, the renowned Magaravank monastery in [[Pentadaktylos|Pentadhaktylos]] was taken by the Turkish troops, the [[Melkonian Educational Institute|Melkonian]] boys dormitory was bombed by the Turkish Air Force, while the [[Ayios Dhometios]] Armenian cemetery was hit by [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and fell within the buffer zone. As a result, dozens of Armenian-Cypriots emigrated, mainly to Great Britain. In total, about 1,300 Armenian-Cypriots left Cyprus in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to those who emigrated to Soviet Armenia.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-1"/&gt;

With the unfailing support of the government, the small yet industrious Armenian community of Cyprus gradually managed to recover from its losses and continued to prosper in the remaining urban areas, contributing culturally and socioeconomically to the development. On 24 April 1975, Cyprus became the first European country to recognise the Armenian Genocide with Resolution 36/1975; two more resolutions followed, Resolution 74/1982 and Resolution 103/1990, with the latter declaring 24 April as a National Remembrance Day of the Armenian Genocide in Cyprus. Over the past decades, the dynamics of the Armenian-Cypriot community have changed with the increased number of marriages with [[Greek-Cypriots]] and other non-Armenians, and the arrival over the last 30–35 years of thousands of Armenian political and economic immigrants because of the [[civil war in Lebanon]], the [[Islamic uprising in Syria|insurgencies in Syria]], the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution in Iran]] and the [[Iran-Iraq war]], as well as after the [[1988 earthquake|Spitak earthquake]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]; some of them have settled permanently in Cyprus. According to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] of the [[Council of Europe]], the Armenian language – the mother tongue of the vast majority of Armenian-Cypriots – was recognised as a minority language of Cyprus on 1 December 2002. Today, it is estimated that the Armenians living in Cyprus number about 3,500. In Cyprus there is also a small number of Armenians coming from [[Ethiopian Armenians|Ethiopia]], [[Armenians in Greece|Greece]], [[Armenians in Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkey]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayk.net/destinations/cyprus/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001133239/http://www.hayk.net/destinations/cyprus/ |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
There is no accurate information as to the number of Armenians living in Cyprus during the Byzantine Era. Although during the early Kingdom of Cyprus there were tens of thousands of Armenians living in Cyprus (mainly in Nicosia and Famagusta - where in the latter they numbered around 1,500 souls in 1360), by the late Frankish Era and certainly during the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Venetian Period 1489-1571|Venetian Era]], the number of Armenians in Cyprus dwindled - for a number of reasons: this was due to the tyrannical rule of the Venetian administration, combined with the adverse natural conditions (which affected all Cypriots), as well as the [[Hellenisation]] of the various minorities of the island. In fact, the 1572 survey of population and property of Nicosia after the [[Ottoman conquest of Cyprus#Ottoman conquest of Cyprus|Ottoman conquest]], under [[beylerbey]] Sinan Pasha, recorded 90-95 local Armenians in Nicosia, out of about 1,100 inhabitants - all with completely Hellenised names.

[[File:Table showing the Armenian-Cypriot population between 1881 and 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Table showing the geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots (1881-1960)]]
[[File:Table showing the urban distribution of Armenian-Cypriots.jpg|thumb|right|Table showing the urban distribution of Armenian-Cypriots (1881-1960)]]

It appears that during the very first years of the [[Ottoman Cyprus|Ottoman Era]] (1570–1878), about 20,000 of the 40,000 recruited Ottoman Armenians had remained in Cyprus. Their number, however, rapidly declined, due to the harshness and the oppression of the regime, the onerous taxation and the natural disasters: according to the Latin Bishop of Paphos, Pietro Vespa, in 1630 there were only 2,000 Armenians in Cyprus (out of a total population of 56,350 - mostly living in rural areas), as a great number emigrated elsewhere and many others embraced Islam or they became Linobambaki. Franciscan missionary Giovanni Battista da Todi recorded only 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1647, while in 1660 he recorded over 300 Armenians on the island. Cardinal [[Bernardino Spada]], representative of [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]], also mentioned 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1648, out of 3,000 inhabitants, also mentioning that their church was the largest in the capital, with 3 priests. Up until the mid-18th century, despite the limited arrival of Ottoman Armenians and [[Iranian Armenians|Persian Armenians]], their number was rather small. Russian monk Basil Barsky, who visited the island in 1727 and 1735, mentions "some Armenians" living in Nicosia. Visiting Cyprus in 1738, British traveller [[Richard Pococke]] mentions "very few Armenians, yet they have possession of an ancient church [in Nicosia]", while for the island as a whole he makes mention to "a small number of Armenians, who are very poor, though they have an Archbishop and a convent in the country". However, by the time Italian Abbot Giovanni Mariti visited Cyprus in 1760 and 1767, they had apparently become "the richest section of the inhabitants [of Nicosia]", which is why thought "there are many Armenians [on the island]". By the mid–19th century, following various waves of Hellenisation (peaceful assimilation) and [[Turkification]] (forced conversion), the number of Armenian-Cypriots ranged between 150–200.

When the Scot [[John MacDonald Kinneir]] visited Cyprus in 1814, he estimated about 40 Armenian families in Nicosia (around 200 persons) - out of a total of 2,000 families (about 10,000 persons), as did British Consul Niven Kerr and Greek Vice-Consul Demetrios Margarites in 1844 and 1847, respectively. The first large-scale Ottoman census in 1831, under the supervision of Muhassil (governor) Halil Effendi, counted 114 non-Muslim males in the Armenian quarter of Nicosia and 13 at the Armenian Monastery (with a total male population of 45,365). Therefore, the number of Armenians in Cyprus would have been around 200 (out of a total of about 88,500). Visiting Cyprus in 1835, American missionary Rev. Lorenzo Warriner Pease writes "the number of Armenians [in Nicosia] is between 30 and 40 families". In 1841, about 200 Armenians lived on the island (out of a total of 108,600), of whom about 150-160 resided in Nicosia (with a population of 12,000) - according to the record of population by [[governor|Muhassil]] Talât Effendi and the writings of French historians and travellers Louis Lacroix and Count [[Louis de Mas Latrie]]. The Latin Vicar General Paolo Brunoni also mentioned 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1848, as well as some others at the Magaravank. In 1874 Belgian traveller Edmond Paridant-van der Cammen estimated 190 Armenians in Nicosia (out of a total of 13,530). Although unreliable for the Armenian population of Nicosia (mentioning only 20 families in 1875), researcher Philippos Georgiou recorded 6-8 Armenian families around the Magaravank and 5 Armenian families in Larnaca. In 1877, newly arrived priest Hovhannes Shahinian recorded 152 Armenians living in Cyprus, while the first modern population census of Nicosia, carried out in 1879 by the District Commissioner, Major-General [[Robert Biddulph (British Army officer)|Sir Robert Biddulph]], counted 166 Armenians - out of a total of 11,197 inhabitants.

The British colonial censuses that took place between 1881 and 1956 provide us with fairly accurate data on the Armenian population of Cyprus. The following numbers are the combined figures of those recorded as Armenians (by religion) and those recorded as speakers of Armenian: in 1881 there were 201 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 174 belonged to the "[[Armenian Church]]"), who increased to 291 in 1891 (of whom 269 were "[[Gregorian Church|Gregorians]]" and 11 "[[Armenian Catholics]]") and to 553 in 1901 (of whom 491 were "Gregorians" and 26 "Armenian Catholics"); the numerical increase was due to the influx of Armenian refugees from the [[Hamidian massacres]]. In 1911 there were 611 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 549 were "Gregorians" and 9 "Armenian Catholics"), while in 1921 their number rose to 1,573 (of whom 1,197 belonged to the "Armenian Church") and to 3,617 in 1931 (of whom 3,377 were "Armenian Gregorians"), as a result of the huge wave of refugees from the Armenian Genocide.

In 1935 the Armenian Prelature recorded 3,819 Armenians in Cyprus: 102 were "native Cypriots" (mainly residing in Nicosia), 399 resided at the Melkonian Educational Institute, while 3,318 were "refugees", i.e. genocide survivors and their descendants; of those, 2,139 lived in Nicosia, 678 in Larnaca, 205 in Limassol, 105 in Famagusta, 58 in Amiandos, 25 in [[Lefka]], 20 in [[Kalo Chorio (Çamlıköy)|Kalo Khorio (Lefka)]], 18 in [[Pano Lefkara]], 17 around the Magaravank, 5 in Kyrenia, 4 in Paphos and 44 in various villages. In 1946 there were 3,962 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 3,686 were "Armenian Gregorians"), while in 1956 they numbered 4,549.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"/&gt;

[[File:2011 distribution of Armenian-Cypriots.jpg|thumb|left|Current geographical distribution of Armenian-Cypriots]]

The last accurate census of the population of Cyprus with regard to its ethnic breakdown was carried out in 1960; it recorded 3,628 Armenians in Cyprus (of whom 3,378 were "[[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Gregorians]]"). In 1978 and 1987 the Armenian Prelature recorded the Armenian population of Cyprus, which was 1,787 and 2,742, respectively (however, without extra information regarding their geographical distribution).

Since then, their number has increased; currently, about 3,500 Armenians live in Cyprus: 65% live in the capital, Nicosia, 20% in Larnaca, 10% in Limassol and 5% in Paphos and some villages. Over 95% of the Armenian population of Cyprus speak Armenian and are [[Armenian Orthodox]] (also known as Armenian Apostolic or Gregorian); some 5% belong either to the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], Armenian Catholic Church, [[Latin Church]], [[Greek Orthodox Church]], [[Anglican Church]][[Plymouth Brethren|Plymouth Brethren Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] or they are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. About 1,000 out of the 3,500 Armenians who live in Cyprus hail from [[Armenia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Greece]], [[Iraq]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kuwait]]. Most of the first wave of Armenians from Armenia who arrived in Cyprus from 1988 onwards were in fact the Armenian-Cypriots and their descendants who emigrated to [[Armenia]] between 1962–1964, as part of the [[Right of Return#Armenia|nerkaght]] (''ներգամթ – repatriation'') Panarmenian movement.

[[File:Places of origin of Armenian-Cypriots.jpg|thumb|right|Places of origin of Armenian-Cypriots, according to information collected by Archbishop Bedros Saradjian in 1935]]

According to available information, the about 1,000 refugees from the Hamidian massacres (1894–1896) mainly originated from [[Diyarbakir|Diyarbakir (Dikranagerd)]], [[Aintab]] and [[Kilis]]; only about 100 of them stayed. The next wave of Armenian refugees were the about 2,000 who fled the [[Adana massacre]] in 1909, most of whom returned to their ancestral homes in [[Adana]] within the same year.&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibrahayer.com/index.php5?&amp;page_id=162&amp;path=162|title=The Armenian Genocide and Cyprus (1915–1930): setting up a new life on a quiet island across Cilicia|date=June 2011|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the largest wave of Armenian refugees – some of whom had come before and returned – were the nearly 9,000 who escaped the massive deportations, the horrific massacres and the genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks; about 1,300 of them decided to stay, while the others eventually made arrangements to settle in other countries. Those refugees came mainly from Adana and [[Silifke|Seleucia (Silifke)]], while there a significant number of them came from [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]], [[Marash]], [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], [[Hadjin]] and Aintab; smaller numbers came from other places, alphabetically: [[Adapazarı|Adapazar]], [[Edirne|Adrianople (Edirne)]], [[Afyonkarahisar|Afion-Karahisar]], [[Alexandretta|Alexandretta (Iskenderoun)]], [[Arapgir]], [[Armash, Ottoman Empire|Armash]], [[Bahçe, Osmaniye|Baghche]], [[Bahçecik, Bilecik|Bardizag]], [[Çelikhan|Balian Dagh]], [[Birecik|Biredjik]], [[Bitlis]], [[Bursa|Brusa]], [[Çemişgezek|Chemishgezek]], Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]), [[Dörtyol]], [[Şanlıurfa|Edessa (Urfa)]],  [[Erzurum|Erzerum]], [[Eskişehir|Eskishehir]], [[Develi|Everek]], [[Iconium|Ikonion (Konya)]], [[Ceyhan|Jeyhan]], [[Kesab]], [[Kharpert]], [[Kütahya|Kutahia]], [[Malatia]], [[Mersin]], [[Misis]], [[Musa Dagh|Musa Dagh (Musa Ler)]], [[Nicomedia|Nicomedia (Izmit)]], [[Rhaedestus|Rhaedestos (Tekirdagh)]], [[Sasun]], [[Sivas|Sebastia (Sivas)]], [[Tufanbeyli|Shar]], [[Sivrihisar|Sivri Hisar]], Smyrna ([[Izmir]])]], [[Tokat|Tokat (Evdokia)]], [[Trabzon|Trepizond]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], [[Yerznga|Yerzinga]], [[Yozgat]] and [[Süleymanlı|Zeitun]].&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer1"/&gt;

==Politics==
Armenian-Cypriots have been politically organised since the late 19th century. The breakdown below examines their involvement in local administration, [[Politics of Cyprus|Cypriot politics]] and [[Armenian diaspora#Political and religious conflicts|Armenian politics]].

===Local administration===
With regard to local administration, the Armenian participation has been limited. Traditionally, there is the appointed [[Muhtar (title)|mukhtar]] of Nicosia's Karaman Zade quarter (the Armenian Quarter). So far, there have been 4 mukhtars: Melik Melikian (1927–1949), Kasbar Delyfer (1949–1956), Vahe Kouyoumdjian (1956–2009) and Mgo Kouyoumdjian (2011–today). Bedros Amirayan served as an appointed member of Famagusta's municipal committee (1903–1905), Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian served as an appointed municipal councillor and, later on, Vice Mayor, for Nicosia (1964–1970), while Berge Kevorkian served as an appointed municipal councillor for Nicosia (1970–1986).

===[[Politics of Cyprus|Cypriot politics]]===
With the exception of the elected Representatives, so far there has been only one Armenian-Cypriot MP in the [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]], [[Marios Garoyian]]. He was elected as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Nicosia District]] on 21 May 2006 with the [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] and in October 2006 he became the party's President. After the election of [[Demetris Christofias]] as [[President of Cyprus|President of the Republic of Cyprus]] in February 2008, Marios Garoyian was voted Speaker of the House of Representatives on 6 March 2008, the second highest political position in Cyprus. He was re-elected as an MP for Nicosia District on 22 May 2011 and he served as House Speaker until 2 June 2011.

===[[Armenian diaspora#Political and religious conflicts|Armenian politics]]===
Despite its relatively small size, the Armenian-Cypriot community has been an active participant in Panarmenian politics already since the late 19th century, even though this became more established in the mid-20th century. All three major Armenian Diaspora parties are active in Cyprus, especially [[Dashnaktsutiun|ARF Dashnaktsoutiun]]. It established its presence in Cyprus as early as in 1897 and it continued to be present on and off on the island until the early years of the 20th century. At that time, Cyprus was frequently used as a stepping stone for some European [[Armenian fedayees]] who had [[Asia Minor]] and Cilicia as their final destination. However, after the Armenian Genocide, the party presence became minimal, save for individual members, supporters and/or sympathisers, until it was re-organised after [[World War II]] and was officially re-established in 1947; its chapter is called "Karenian", after [[Karekin Pastermadjian|Armen Karo]], who briefly visited Cyprus, in order to organise the assembly of weapons for the [[Zeitun Rebellion (1895–1896)|Zeitoun Resistance]].

ARF Dashnaktsoutiun is affiliated with the [[AYMA, Nicosia|Armenian Young Men's Association (AYMA)]] in Nicosia, the Armenian Club in Larnaca and the Limassol Armenian Young Men's Association (LHEM) in Limassol, as well as with the Armenian National Committee of Cyprus, the [[Armenian Youth Federation]] of Cyprus, the “Azadamard” Armenian Youth Centre, the [[Armenian Relief Society]] of Cyprus and the [[Hamazkayin|Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association]] of Cyprus, all based in Nicosia. The Armenian Relief Society chapter of Cyprus is called "Sosse", after [[Sose Mayrig|Sosse Mayrig]], who visited Cyprus in the summer of 1938, while the Hamazkayin chapter of Cyprus is called "Oshagan", after [[Hagop Oshagan]], who had been a professor at the Melkonian Educational Institute between 1926–1934.

The [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party|ADL Ramgavar]] first appeared in Cyprus in the early 1930s, in the form of a core of party members. It also participated in the Diocesan Council elections of 1947, which caused a very big stir in community life. However, the party has officially been active in Cyprus since 1956. Its chapter is called ''Tekeyan'', after [[Vahan Tekeyan]], who had been a professor at the Melkonian Educational Institute between 1934–1935.&lt;ref name="ADL Ramgavar in CyprusGibrahayer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayem.org/en/democratic-liberal-party-ramgavar|title=The Armenian Democratic Liberal Ramgavar party in Cyprus|date=November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has never been very active on the island, mainly because it was overshadowed by the significant presence of the ''[[Armenian General Benevolent Union|AGBU]]'', affiliated with ADL Ramgavar. Both organisations lost a substantial number of followers, when they "repatriated" to Armenia between 1962–1964, as part of the ''nerkaght'' (''ներգաղթ – repatriation'') movement and when they realized that what was promised was not real.

The youngest Armenian political party in Cyprus is [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|SDHP Hunchakian]], which was set up on the island in 2005, following the split within the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union|AGBU]], which was brought about by the decision to close the Melkonian Educational Institute. It must be noted, though, that as Cyprus was frequently used as a stepping stone for some European Armenian fedayees who had Asia Minor and Cilicia as their final destination during the late 19th century and the early 20th century, a small number of the party's members temporarily stayed on the island during those times. SDHP Hunchakian is affiliated with the ''[[Nor Serount Cultural Association]]'' in Nicosia.

The Armenian-Cypriot community has been actively engaged in Panarmenian issues, such as the organisation of demonstrations and other forms of protest on matters that pertain to all Armenians. Other than promoting awareness and recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which is more extensively examined below, the Armenian-Cypriot community has been lobbying successfully in favour of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]], as a result of which Cypriot politicians and EuroMPs are sympathetic towards its existence. During the last decade, the Armenian-Cypriot community was actively involved in the movement to raise awareness on the unilateral closure of the Melkonian Educational Institute by the AGBU (2004–2005), the [[Armenia–Turkey relations#Modern relations#Current developments#2009 signing of accord|Armenia-Turkey protocols]] and the extradition of [[Ramil Safarov]] to [[Azerbaijan]] (2012), as well as in events commemorating [[Hrant Dink]]'s memory, organised every year since his murder in 2007.

Finally, in recent years the Armenian-Cypriot community has been providing financial and humanitarian aid to Armenians in need around the world: it has provided assistance to earthquake-stricken Armenians in Armenia, after the 1988 earthquake, to orphans in Nagorno-Karabakh, to [[Armenians in Lebanon]], Armenians in Greece and [[Armenians in Syria]], as well as to Armenians in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, through the "Hayastan" All-Armenian Fund.

===[[Armenian Genocide recognition]]===
[[File:Genocide memorial service.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Armenian Genocide memorial service with the participation of Greek-Cypriot politicians (2008)]]

On the level of the ordinary people, most Cypriots are aware of the great calamity the [[Armenians|Armenian nation]] suffered during 1894–1923 and have always been supportive and sympathetic towards Armenians; the Armenian Genocide refugees who remained in Cyprus were in the unique position of escaping from [[Ottoman Turks]] and living amicably amongst Turkish-Cypriots.

Cyprus has been one of the pioneering countries in recognising the Armenian Genocide, when on 25 January 1965 Foreign Minister [[Spyros Kyprianou]] first raised the issue to the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]]. Prior to his powerful speech, a delegation comprising ARF Dashnaktsoutiun Bureau members Dr. Papken Papazian and Berj Missirlian, as well as Armenian National Committee of Cyprus members Anania Mahdessian and Vartkes Sinanian, handed him a memorandum urging Cyprus' support in raising the issue at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gibrahayer.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_archive.html|title=Forty Years After A Milestone – Vartkes Sinanian|date=April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus was also the first European country (and the second world-wide, after [[Uruguay]]) to officially recognise the Armenian Genocide. On 24 April 1975, after the determined efforts and the submission by Representative Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian, Resolution 36 was voted unanimously by the House of Representatives. Representative Aram Kalaydjian was instrumental in passing unanimously through the House of Representatives two more resolutions regarding the Armenian Genocide: Resolution 74/29–04–1982, submitted by the Foreign Relations' Parliamentary Committee, and Resolution 103/19–04–1990, submitted by all parliamentary parties. Resolution 103 declared 24 April as a National Remembrance Day of the Armenian Genocide in Cyprus.

Since 1965, when Cypriot government officials started participating in the annual Armenian Genocide functions, Cyprus' political leaders are often keynote speakers in those functions organised to commemorate the Armenian Genocide. Over the last years, there is usually a march starting from the centre of Nicosia and ending at the [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] church in [[Strovolos]], where a commemorative event takes place in front of the [[Armenian Genocide Monument in Nicosia|Armenian Genocide Monument]]; other events also take place, such as blood donations.

==Social life==
The Armenian-Cypriot community has traditionally had an active and structured social life. Various charity, cultural, educational and social events are organised, such as fund-raisers/bazaars, art/book exhibitions, dancing/theatre performances, balls, lunches, film screenings, camps/excursions in Cyprus and abroad (panagoum), as well as lectures and commemoration ceremonies regarding Armenia, [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], the Armenian Diaspora and the Armenian Genocide.

The main venue for community events is the AYMA club and the "Vahram Utidjian" Hall, at the basement of the Armenian Prelature building, both in [[Strovolos]], Nicosia. In the past, numerous events were organised at the Melkonian Educational Institute in [[Aglandjia]], the hall of the Armenian Club in Nicosia or the hall of the old AGBU club in Nicosia. School events take place at the open amphitheatre or the newly built auditorium of Nicosia's Nareg Armenian School. More recently, some community events have been organised at the Larnaca Armenian Club or Limassol's [[Sourp Kevork|Armenian church]] hall.

===Notable organisations===
* [[AYMA]] [''Armenian Young Men's Association/Հայ Երիտասարդաց Միութիւն'' (Hay Yeridasartats Mioutiun)]. Established by a group of young Armenian men in Nicosia in October 1934, it is the leading Armenian-Cypriot club and the centre of the social, sports and cultural life of the Armenian-Cypriot community. After it was housed in various rented places, it acquired its own club house in 1961 in Tanzimat street, purchased for the sum of £6,000. As the club house was taken over during the [[Cyprus intercommunal violence|1963–1964 intercommunal violence]], AYMA fell in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area, as was the rest of the historical Armenian Quarter of Nicosia. It was then housed in various rented places. Its own premises, built between 1985–1986 by architects Marios &amp; Nicos Santamas, are located at the corner of Alasia and Valtetsi streets, near the [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] church in [[Strovolos]], Nicosia, on land leased by the government (Decision of the Council of Ministers 21.188/17–12–1981), and were inaugurated on 30 May 1987 by President [[Spyros Kyprianou]]. There is a well-organised library room at the club house. Its renovated and expanded functions hall was inaugurated on 28 February 2010 by Representative [[Vartkes Mahdessian]]. AYMA is affiliated with the [[Homenetmen]] Panarmenian organisation.
* ''[[Armenian Youth Federation]] of Cyprus'' [Կիպրոսի Երիտասարդական Միութիւն (Gibrosi Yeridasartagan Mioutiun), 1977]. It edifies children, teenagers and young adults.
* ''[[Armenian Relief Society]] of Cyprus '' [Հայ Օգնութեան Միութիւն (Hay Oknoutian Mioutiun), also known as HOM (ՀՕՄ), "Sosse" chapter, 1988]. It is a women's charity organization, which sends help to [[Armenia]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], the Armenian Diaspora and local charity organisations.
* ''[[Hamazkayin|Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association]] of Cyprus'' [Համազգային Հայ Կրթական եւ Մշակութային Միութիւն (Hamazkayin Hay Grtagan yev Mshagoutayin Mioutiun), "Oshagan" chapter, 1999]. It organizes various cultural events, such as dance and theatre performances, art exhibitions, lectures etc.

==Legal status and representation==
[[File:Armenian-Cypriot Representatives (1960-2011).jpg|thumb|left|The Armenian Representatives, 1960–2013]]

With the Independence of Cyprus, on 16 August 1960, under Article 2 § 3 of the Constitution, Armenians, and Catholics (both Marionite and Roman Catholic) were recognised as "religious groups". In the referendum held on 13 November 1960, all three religious groups opted to belong to the co-religious Greek-Cypriot community (as it was expected), something which consequently defined their political options in the game of inter-communal controversy and somewhat affected their relations with the Turkish-Cypriots, who in turn viewed them as an extension of the Greek-Cypriot political choices. This is why the religious groups were affected similarly during the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence|inter-communal violence]] (1963–1964) and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Article 110 § 3 recognises the administrative autonomy of the religious groups’ Churches, as it was established with the [[Hatt-ı Hümayun of 1856|''Hatt-ı Hümayun'']] in 1856. According to Article 111, the three Churches retain their powers regarding matters of [[personal status]]. ''Law 95/1989'' transferred the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to the family courts, the configuration of which was defined by ''Law 87(I)/1994''; of the three religious groups, only the Armenians participate in their workings.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 109 of the Constitution, Armenian-Cypriots were given political representation: as a result of their choice to belong to the Greek-Cypriot community, an Armenian and a Latin participated in the Nicosia members of the Greek Communal Chamber, while a Maronite participated in the Kyrenia members (''Colonial Law 36/1959'', ''Colonial Law 6/1960'' and ''Greek Communal Chamber Law 8/1960''). The two Communal Chambers, which acted as a Lower Parliament, had jurisdiction over all religious, educational, cultural and other affairs of communal nature (Article 87).

With the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the common state in 1963 and the self-dissolution of the Greek Communal Chamber in 1965, it was decided to transfer the executive powers of the Greek Communal Chamber to the newly formed Ministry of Education and its legislative powers to the House of Representatives (''Law 12/1965''). According to the Decision of the Council of Ministers 4.907/29–07–1965, it was decided that the three Representatives would provisionally continue to represent their communities in the House on issues pertaining to the jurisdiction of their Chamber and that the House was to request their opinion before legislating on pertinent matters (''Law 12/1965''). In order to approximate the tenure of the other MPs, the term of the three Representatives was annually extended (''Law 45/1965'', ''Law 49/1966'', ''Law 50/1967'', ''Law 87/1968'' and ''Law 58/1969''). The status of the three Representatives in the House of Representatives was confirmed with ''Law 58/1970'' and furthermore specified with ''Law 38/1976'', ''Law 41/1981'' and ''Law 66(I)/2011''. Since 1991, the elections for the three Representatives have been held simultaneously and in parallel with the general parliamentary elections and the Representatives’ term is identical with that of the proper MPs (''Law 70/1986'').

The Representatives act as liaisons between their communities and the state and they are ''par excellence'' competent to bring before the state all issues relating to their group. Their participation has a 5-year duration and a consultative character, as although they can express their views on matters relating to their group, they do not have the right to vote. Especially in the case of the Armenians, the Representative delivers a speech about the Armenian Genocide during the plenary session of the House convened on or near 24 April each year. So far, six (6) Armenian Representatives have served: Berge Tilbian from Nicosia (1960–1970), Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian from Nicosia (1970–1982), Aram Kalaydjian from Larnaca (1982–1995), Bedros Kalaydjian from Larnaca (1995–2005), Dr. Vahakn Atamyan from Nicosia (2005–2006) and [[Vartkes Mahdessian]] from Nicosia (2006–today).

Since 1998, the elected Representative is ''ex officio'' member of the Diocesan Council (''Թեմական Ժողով'') of the Armenian Ethnarchy (''Ազգային Իշխանութիւն'').

==Elections==
The first elections for the Armenian member of the Greek Communal Chamber took place on 5 August 1960 between ''Vahram Levonian'' and Berge Tilbian, who was elected after receiving 60.49% (1,364 votes). Between 1965–1970, the term of office for the Armenian, the Maronite and the Latin Representatives was extended by special laws, until ''Law 58/1970'' was enacted, properly including them in the House of Representatives. The second elections were held on 19 July 1970 between ''Berge Tilbian'' and Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian, who was elected after receiving 56.30% (590 votes); Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian was re-elected on 3 October 1976, with ''Aram Kalaydjian'' as his opponent, after receiving 50.96% (612 votes).

The next elections were held on 14 March 1982 between ''Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian'' and Aram Kalaydjian, who secured 58.36% (771 votes); Aram Kalaydjian was re-elected on 13 July 1986, with ''Anna Ashdjian'' as his opponent, after securing 65.08% (792 votes), and again on 19 May 1991, again winning over ''Anna Ashdjian'' and receiving 67.00% (875 votes). Because of Aram Kalaydjian's death on 10 September 1995, a by-election was held on 22 October 1995, between ''Kevork Mahdessian'' and Bedros Kalaydjian, who won with 60.34% (849 votes). Bedros Kalaydjian was re-elected on 26 May 1996, securing 73.91% (997 votes) against ''Anna Ashdjian'' and again on 27 May 2001, receiving 57.13% (857 votes) against ''Dr. Garabed Khatcho-Kazandjian''.

Because of Bedros Kalaydjian's death on 1 September 2005, a by-election was held on 9 October 2005, with Dr. Vahakn Atamyan receiving 52.03% (769 votes) against ''Dr. Antranik Ashdjian'' (43.91%) and ''Parsegh Zartarian'' (4.12%). The next elections took place on 21 May 2006, with Vartkes Mahdessian receiving 52.60% (899 votes) against ''Dr. Vahakn Atamyan''. The most recent elections were held on 22 May 2011, with Mahdessian securing 67.67% (1,105 votes) against ''Dr. Antranik Ashdjian''.

Although not elected, the Armenians in Nicosia also have a ''mukhtar'', appointed by the Ministry of Interior. The first mukhtar was Melik Melikian (1927–1949), succeeded by Kasbar Delyfer (1949–1956) and Vahe Kouyoumdjian (1956–2009). As of 1 January 2011, the current Armenian mukhtar is Mgo Kouyoumdjian.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Armenian religion in Cyprus}}

Like most communities of the Armenian Diaspora, the Armenian-Cypriot community is predominantly [[Armenian Apostolic]] (about 95%). Some 5% belong either to the Armenian Evangelical Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church, Greek Orthodox Church, Anglican Church, Plymouth Brethren Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church or they are Jehovah's Witnesses; of this 5%, historically the most significant groups have been Armenian Evangelicals, who in the 1940s and 1950s comprised about 10% of the Armenian-Cypriot community, and Armenian-Catholics, who have been on the island since the time of the [[Crusades]].

===Armenian Prelature of Cyprus===
[[File:Armenian Prelature building in Nicosia.jpg|thumb|right|The building of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus in [[Strovolos]], Nicosia]]

The Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was established in 973 by Catholicos Khatchig I. Historically, the Prelature has been under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]], while today it is the oldest ''[[diocese|theme]]'' that falls under its jurisdiction. Since 2014 the Prelate, a Catholicosal Vicar General, has been ''Archbishop Nareg Alemezian''. The parish priest in Nicosia is ''Fr. Momik Habeshian'', while the parish priest in Larnaca and Limassol is ''Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian''. For centuries, the Prelature building was located within the Armenian compound in Victoria street in walled Nicosia; when that area was taken over by Turkish-Cypriot extremists in 1963–1964, the Prelature was temporarily housed in Aram Ouzounian street and, later on, in Kyriakos Matsis street in Ayios Dhometios. Thanks to the efforts of Bishop Zareh Aznavorian and with financial aid from the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]], the new Prelature building was erected in 1983, next to the Sourp Asdvadzadzin church and the Nareg school in Nicosia, by architects Athos Dikaios &amp; Alkis Dikaios; it was officially inaugurated on 4 March 1984, during the pastoral visit of Catholicos [[Karekin I|Karekin II]]. By initiative of Archbishop [[Varoujan Hergelian]], in 1998 the basement of the building was renovated and the "Vahram Utidjian" Hall was formed; previously a store room, it became a reality from the proceeds of the auction in 1994 of the art collection that Vahram Utidjian had donated to the Prelature in 1954. It was inaugurated on 3 February 1999 by Catholicos [[Aram I]]; numerous charity, communal and cultural events take place there. The Prelature's consistory houses a collection of ecclesiastical relics, some of which were previously in the old [[Notre Dame de Tyre]] church or the Magaravank.

===Armenian Evangelical Church===

The first Armenian Evangelicals in Cyprus came after the arrival of the British in July 1878. As they were not committed, and very few, they quickly became associated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. With the influx of more [[Protestants]], Armenian Evangelicals became affiliated with the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] as early as 1887. In 1933, the newly formed Cyprus Synod of the |Reformed Presbyterian Church divided its congregations into Armenian and Greek councils. Armenian Evangelicals were granted provisional autonomy from the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America#Missions|Reformed Presbyterian Mission]] in 1954, which was formalised in 1962. In Larnaca, Armenian Evangelicals dwindled after the inter-communal troubles of 1963–1964, services were no longer held; in Nicosia, the Armenian Evangelical church fell into Turkish-Cypriot control during the inter-communal troubles and so services were then held at the [[American Academy Nicosia|American Academy]] chapel until 1973. After nearly 30 years of inactivity, by initiative of Nouvart Kassouni-Panayiotides and Lydia Gulesserian and with the help of Hrayr Jebejian, Executive Secretary of the Bible Society in the Gulf Armenian Evangelicals were re-organised at the Greek Evangelical church in Larnaca in 2002. Since 2005, when Hrayr Jebejian moved to Cyprus, services are held every few months at the Greek Evangelical church in Nicosia. Also, the Armenian Evangelical Church organizes a few lectures in Nicosia.

===Armenian Catholic Church===
[[File:Bellapais Abbey.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bellapais Abbey]] (early 20th century)]]

Armenian-Catholics first came to the island during the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Crusades—Lusignan Period 1191-1489|Frankish Era]] from the nearby Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era. During the Ottoman Era, there was a very limited conversion of Armenian Orthodox to [[Catholicism]], mainly due to the proselytising activities of the [[Franciscan]] mission in Nicosia and Larnaca, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries; however, these must have been temporary apostasies and their number never exceeded 50 at any given time. In 1794 the small Armenian Catholic community of Larnaca was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery of the town. It was during the [[British Cyprus (1878–1960)|British Era]] that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the Armenian genocide. In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in Nicosia and Saint Joseph's convent in Larnaca; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian-Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community. However, due to the influx of Lebanese-Armenians to Cyprus since the mid-1970s, there has been a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics on the island. Currently, local Armenian-Catholics are less than 20, in addition to about 30 foreign Armenians.

==Places of worship==

There are five Armenian Orthodox churches in Cyprus, two in the capital Nicosia (one in the north) and one in each Larnaca, Limassol and Famagusta. Additionally, there are three Armenian chapels in the vicinity of Nicosia and one within the Magaravank complex, the latter in the north. There is also an Armenian Evangelical church in [[North Nicosia]]. Finally, there is the renowned Magaravank in the north.

==Education==
{{Main article|Armenian education in Cyprus}}

Armenians have always attached particular emphasis in education, which – in conjunction with the Church – is the foundation for the preservation of their national and cultural heritage. Armenian schools teach [[Armenian studies|Armenology]], which includes Armenian history and traditions, ensuring the perpetuation of Armenianism from generation to generation.

==Monuments==
{{Main article|Armenian monuments in Cyprus}}

The Armenian-Cypriot community has several historical monuments, including the Armenian Genocide Monument in Nicosia and a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] obelisk dedicated to Abbot [[Mekhitar of Sebaste|Mekhitar]].

==The Armenian Quarter==

The original Armenian quarter (13th - late 15th/early 16th century) may have been located in the eastern part of Frankish Nicosia and that Armenians acquired their new quarter within the 16th century. After the conquest of the city in 1570, the Ottomans renamed the extant Armenian quarter to "Karamanzade mahallesi" (literally: quarter of the son of Karaman), in honour of one of the Generals who took part in the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–73)|conquest of Cyprus]] and came from [[Karaman Eyalet]]. From the 16th century to December 1963, the western part of walled Nicosia formed what was known as the Armenian Quarter ({{lang|el|Αρμενομαχαλλάς}} in [[Greek language]]), '({{lang|hy|Հայկական թաղ}} in Armenian language) or ({{lang|tr|Ermeni mahallesi}} in [[Turkish language]]). Administratively, the Armenian Quarter included both the Karaman Zade quarter and the [[Arab Ahmet, Nicosia|Arab Ahmed Pasha]] quarter.

After the [[British Empire]] gained control of Cyprus from the Ottoman Empire, this part of the city housed several British officers. Their presence, together with that of the Latins, gave it the unofficial Greek name {{lang|el|Φραγκομαχαλλάς}} for "Levantine Quarter". The first hotels of Nicosia opened on Victoria street during this time, including the "Armenian Hotel" (c. 1875- c. 1925) and the "Army and Navy Hotel" (1878 - c. 1890), resulting in the first cutting of the [[Venetian walls of Nicosia|Venetian walls]] at the end of Victoria street.

The heart of the Armenian quarter was Victoria street (''Վիքթորիա փողոց/οδός Βικτωρίας/Viktorya sokağı''), in which the Armenian compound was located, as well as many houses and, at a later time, the AGBU club house; at times, AYMA's club house was there as well. Victoria street was the road that every Armenian-Cypriot would walk on to go to church, to school, to the clubs, to visit family, relatives and friends etc. One could see all the time Armenian-Cypriots walking around the narrow streets amidst a profusion of Oriental smells and a chatter in Armenian. The street, full of beautiful [[ashlar]] buildings, started from the Latin church of the Holy Cross and ended at the [[Arabahmet Mosque|Arab Ahmed Pasha mosque]], having Mahmoud Pasha street as its extension (where the American Academy Nicosia was between 1922-1955 and the Armenian Evangelical church since 1946). As it was a one-way street, traffic was only allowed from the north to the south.

During the Cypriot intercommunal violence, a large part of the Armenian Quarter of Nicosia was gradually taken over by Turkish Cypriots between 21 December 1963 and 19 January 1964. Most Armenian-Cypriots left their homes during this time, while other families stayed for a longer period in tents at the grounds of the Melkonian Educational Institute.

The Armenian quarter was also home to many Turkish Cypriots, as well as some Greek-Cypriots, Maronite-Cypriots, Roman Catholic Cypriots and British nationals.

The '''Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science''' is an award given annually by the [[Baltic Assembly]] for achievements in three categories: literature, art and science.

The prize is an annual award given to a citizen of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania "for outstanding achievements" in three categories: literature, art and science. It was awarded for the first time in 1994 and consists of a statuette, a diploma and a sum of money, presently (2016) 5,000 [[euro]]. It is awarded during the formal session of the assembly. A joint jury consisting of three persons per prize make the decision on whom to award the prize. The purpose of the award is according to the Baltic Assembly to "demonstrate the common interests of the countries in this region in upholding of their national identity and self-esteem; create an opportunity to learn about the achievements of the neighbouring countries; maintain a continuous interest among the people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania about developments in the Baltic States; strengthen cooperation among the Baltic States in the fields of literature, the arts and science; encourage more and more people to become interested in the intellectual values and languages of the Baltic nations; and raise the level of literature, the arts and science in the Baltic States."&lt;ref name=baltic1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baltasam.org/en/prizes/baltic-assembly-prize|title= Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Baltic Assembly]]|access-date= 5 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baltic2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltasam.org/en/1567-meeting-of-the-joint-jury-of-the-baltic-assembly-prize-in-literature,-the-arts-and-science-2015|title= Prize winners of the Baltic Assembly Prizes for Literature, the Arts and Science 2015|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Baltic Assembly]]|access-date= 5 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eeparl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.riigikogu.ee/en/parliament-of-estonia/delegations/ba/|title= The Baltic Assembly|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Riigikogu]]|access-date= 5 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lvparl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://saeima.lv/en/news/saeima-news/23879-baltic-assembly-prize-for-literature-awarded-to-maris-berzins|title= Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature awarded to Māris Bērziņš|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Saeima]]|access-date= 5 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bisaya''' are an [[indigenous people]] of the north-west and the coast line of [[Borneo]], Malaysia. They mostly live near the [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]] district, the [[Padas River]] also [[Kuala Penyu]] in the [[Sabah]] region. There are also some Bisaya living in [[Kampung Manunggang]], Sabah, which follow [[Irreligion|no religion]] and along the [[Limbang River]] in the northern state [[Sarawak]]. Nowadays the Bisaya living in Sabah are  [[Muslim]], while the Bisaya living in Sarawak are mostly [[Animism]], with a smaller Muslim community. In Brunei, they are referred as ''Dusun'', ''Jati Dusun'' and ''Bisaya'' (Though they are not to be confused with the Dusun people of Sabah).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bisaya people are also regarded as a relatives of the [[Dayak people]] whereas Bisaya was not brought into Borneo instead they are aboriginal of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Alexander Hammerton|author2=Dr. Charles Hose|title=Peoples of All Nations|year=1922|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=81-7268-156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
Several theories have been put forward by various researchers regarding the origins of the name of the Bisaya people. Beyer H.O. in 1926, Hester E.D. in 1954 and Harrison in 1956 suggested that the name may have come from the empire of Sri Vijaya (Sonza, 1972). However, in 1960, Eugene Vestraelen (Professor of Linguistics at the University of San Carlos, Cebu City) cautioned that the linguistic derivation of ''Vijaya'' would not be ''Bisaya'' but ''Bidaya'', or ''Biraya''.

In 1960, John Carol suggested that the name originated from a cultural hero named Sri Visaya.

Another theory is that the word Visaya (or Bisaya, as it is pronounced in the Philippines) comes from the word for the Hindu merchant, trader, herder, artisan, landowner (etc.) caste: the "Vaishyas", which can be traced back to Sanskrit, and assume that the label was given by the Sri Vijayans and others pirates and traders coming from India.

==History==
[[File:Bisaya House.JPG|thumb|The rehabilitation of a traditional Bisaya house in the Heritage Village of [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]].]]

Bisaya's indigenous people settled in Borneo thousands of years ago. The Bisaya were a people who were loved, feared and respected by others on the island.{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}} They are skilled in agriculture, particularly in the areas such as [[paddy planting]], [[ginger]], [[sago]], local [[ginger]], [[tapioca]], banana, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[coconut]]. They also hunt animals and breed others, such as chicken, [[duck]], [[goose]], goat, [[Asian Buffalo|buffalo]], cows and many more.

Bisaya people are skilled in catching fish either from the [[River fishing|river]] or at [[Sea fishing|sea]], and they can hold their breath under water without [[drowning]]. One of the tragic stories of the Bisaya happened a few hundred years ago when Awang Kuyoh, son of Awang Alak Betatar was drowned by the [[Sulu people]], who took his wife back to [[Sulu Island]]. Legend has it that the Bisaya sailor called Awang Semaun and his crew sailed around this island starting from [[Klias River]], and he tied a handkerchief in front of the boat.  When he arrived at the starting point, the handkerchief was torn and that's how this island came to be called Handkerchief Island or Pulau Sapu Tangan or Pulau Peraca in local language. The Imperial Colony called it Borneo. From Spanish records, this island was known as Borneo during the first visit of the Portuguese sailor Magellan, in service of the [[Spanish Crown]].

===Brunei Historical Centre version===

The popular legend of the Bisaya origin as  described Bewsher(1958),Sandin(1971) and Hussain &amp; Newman(1987) goes as follows:-

In 1370, Ma-ho-mo-sha [Maha Mokhsa] was a King of Barunai [P'o-ni]. A Chinese mission commanded by Chang Ching Tze dispatched to P'o-ni in 1370 (9th month, 3rd year of Hung-wa), found the king in a burned out capital with just 1,000 inhabitants. He sent a tribute mission to the Emperor of China in August 1371.

Some versions of the Syair Awang Semaun trace the foundation of Brunei to fourteen saudara (brothers and first cousins). Other versions say they were all sons of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, a supernatural being who fell to earth in an egg at Ulu Limbang, and fathered them by fourteen different aboriginal wives:

# Patih Barbai [Marbai] [Peti Barambai], Paduka Sri Pangiran Bendahara Sri Maharaja Permaisuara. The official version states that he became the second Muslim ruler as Sultan Ahmed - see below.
# Awang Si Mawn [Semaun], Pangiran Temenggong.
# Patih Mambang.
# Patih Tuba.
# Patih Sangkuna [Peti Runak].
# Patih Manggarun.
# Patih Malakay.
# Patih Pahit. m. Si Lampang, a captured Banteng.
# Damang Sari.
# Patih Sindayung.
# Damang Libar Dawn, Juru Shahbandar. Emigrated to Java, where he lived for nine years. m. a Javanese lady, by whom  he said to have had issue, one son and one daughter (?): a) Nakhoda Ragam (or Sultan Bolkiah - see below). a) Palingkam Kahaya.
# Hapu Awang.
# Patih Layla Langkung.
# Awang Alak Betatar [Umuk Batata]. The official version states that he became the first Muslim ruler as Sultan     Muhammad Shah.

Paduka Sri Sultan Muhammad Shah[1363–1402], Sultan of Brunei, a younger son of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, by an aboriginal lady. He was chosen by the saudara to become the first ruler. Constructed his palace at Pirasung. Legends have Brunei founded some 29 reigns ago by 14 brothers of heroic stature and semi-divine descent, according to a Monograph of the [[Brunei Museum Journal]]. The exploits of the 14 founding heroes of Brunei are recounted in a very lengthy poem called the "Sha'er Awang Semaun.". Awang Alak Betatar was not the eldest, but was chosen to be their leader because of his intelligence and good looks. He was installed Sultan of Brunei and he remarried with the daughter of the Sultan of Johor.

===Sabah history===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The name of Borneo was the first known as Bonian among the Bisaya people.  When the native bisaya converted into Islam together with their leader Awang Alak Betatar, the word was change from Bonian into Bornian due to the mother tongue of the preacher which is came from Taif, Arab Saudi. At the same time the native people had to pronounce Borneo until the Malaysia Day in 1963. Today it was known as Sabah.{{citation needed|reason= A personal blog is not legitimate evidence. There is already a Sabah History Wikipedia page, all details listed here DOES NOT coincide with the said page. Everything written under ==Sabah history= seems to contain a lot of racially motivated propaganda.|date=July 2015}}

In 1959, [[Tun Datu Haji Mustapha Datu Harun]] met [[Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak Ismail Jalil]] in a place called [[Kampung Takuli]], [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]], Sabah. He was to convey a message of freeing the Borneo from British Colonial. Tun Mustapha asked Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak his view regarding the new name of [[Borneo]] . The Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak told Tun Mustapha to use [[Sabah]] as the name of the state. That is his ancestor [[Awang Alak Betatar]] mentioned the word [[Mongoi da sasabah]] every times he wants to go to the sea. The meaning is [[let's go fishing to the sea]] whereas the island was surrounded by the sea and had a lot fish.{{citation needed|reason= A personal blog is not legitimate evidence. There is already a Sabah History Wikipedia page, all details listed here DOES NOT coincide with the said page. Everything written under ==Sabah history= seems to contain a lot of racially motivated propaganda.|date=July 2015}}

Tun Mustapha had offered Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak to form Sabah Rulers but he rejected it because he is too old. According to the record his age is almost bicentennials. He prays someday his grandchildren will embrace all the people with the information when the times come and may them guidance by Allah the Almighty. The census of Bisaya is at least 1,000,000 people throughout Borneo (Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and Kalimantan) and West Malaysia. Most of them lived in Sabah.{{citation needed|reason= A personal blog is not legitimate evidence. There is already a Sabah History Wikipedia page, all details listed here DOES NOT coincide with the said page. Everything written under ==Sabah history= seems to contain a lot of racially motivated propaganda.|date=July 2015}}

===Tales from Limbang===

The legend tells of an immigrant family living in the North of the Borneo Island. In this family were seven children, six boys (Peti Barambai or Pati Barabai, si Garamba, Peti Garamba, Peti Runa or Pati Begunak, Smaun or Si Maun and Alak Batata or Urak Betatar or Lok Batata or Awang Alah Bertabar) and a girl (Siti Duyah or Duri or Bunga Sunting). A boat race was used to determine who was to become the Rajah of Brunei.

This race was won by Alak Betatar the youngest brother. He became the first Rajah of Brunei and later converted to Islam and became Sultan Mohammed, the first Sultan of Brunei. Peti Barambai, the eldest brother, became the Raja of Java. Si Garamba settled in the Limbang area and became the ancestor of the Bisaya's. Peti Garamba settled in the Tutong(Brunei),Peti Runa  in the Kinabatangan  River (Sabah) and Smaun in the Birau River(south of Tutong). Siti Duyah married a Chinese named Awang Sunting (or Ong Sum Ping) and settled near Mount Kinabalu (Sabah).

==The first king of Borneo==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
In the year 977, we are told, Hianzta, king of Puni, sent envoys to China, who presented tribute with the following words: "May the emperor live thousands and tens of thousands of years, and may he not disapprove of the poor civilities of my little country." The envoys presented a letter from the king. This was written on' what looked like the very thin bark of a tree; it was glossy, slightly green, several feet long, and somewhat broader than one inch; the characters in which
it was written were small, and had to be read horizontally. In all these particulars the letter resembled the books of magic which are still written by the Battas of inland Sumatra. The message ran: "The king of Puni, called Hianzta, prostrates himself before the most august emperor, and hopes that the emperor may live ten thousands of years. I have now sent envoys to carry tribute; I knew before that there was an emperor, but I had no means of communication. Recently
there was a merchant called Pu Lu, whose ship arrived at the mouth of my river; I sent a man to invite him to my place, and he told me that he came from China. The people of my country were much delighted at this, and preparing a ship, asked this stranger to guide them to the court. The envoys I have sent only wish to see Your Majesty in peace, and I intend to send people with tribute every year. But when I do so I fear that my ships may occasionally be blown to Champa, and I therefore hope Your Majesty will send an edict to that country with orders that, if a ship of Hianzta arrives there, it must not be detained. My country has no other articles, and I pray Your Majesty not to be angry with me." The envoys were entertained and sent home with presents.

How early the Arab doctrines were taught in Barunai is impossible to state with any precision. Local tradition ascribes their introduction to the renowned Awang Alak Betatar, afterwards known as Sultan Mohammad Shah. Like most of his subjects this warrior was a Bisaya, and in early life he was not a Muslim, not indeed a civilised potentate at all, to judge by conventional standards; for the chief mark of his royal dignity was an immense chawat, or loin-cloth, escorted by eighty men, forty in front and forty behind. He is the earliest monarch of whom the present Barunais have any knowledge, a fact to be accounted for partly by the brilliance of his exploits, partly by the introduction about that time of Arabic writing. After much fighting he subdued the people of '''Igan, Kalaka, Seribas, Sadong,Semarahan, and Sarawak''' [Most of the ethnics extinct due to illness and disease] and compelled them to pay tribute. He stopped the annual payment to Majapahit of one jar of pinang juice,a useless commodity though troublesome to collect. During his reign the Muruts or Lun Bawang were brought under Barunai rule by peaceful measures,and the Chinese colony was kept in good humour by the marriage of the Barunai king's brother and successor to the daughter of one of the principal Chinamen.

This is an interesting account in many ways, and tallies very closely with what other evidence would lead one to suspect. For there is reason to think that Barunai, before it became Muslim, was a Bisaya kingdom under Buddhist sovereigns and Hindu influence; and nearly all the particulars given with regard to the people of Borneo are true of one or other of the races allied to Bisayas and living near Barunai to-day.
&lt;!--==Beaufort history==

Beaufort, Sabah; name was given in commemoration of the first English Governor called L.P. Beaufort. He had arrived here on 1889. Beaufort town situated nearby the Padas rivers to replace the Kota Klias government of Borneo Thrones. The relocation of the administration center had been approved by the current rulers, Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak Ismail Jalil in 1884.--&gt;

===The Lost Treasure===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
It was believed that [[Awang Alak Betatar]] had made two weapons as the symbol of his throne. The weapons were handmade and created from the rock of star and the shape is similar to each other which is black and long sword. [[Sultan Awang Koyoh]] was the successor of his father's throne after he left [[Kota Klias]] and [[Awang Koyoh]] have keep that sword of star. [[Awang Alak Betatar]] became [[barunah]] or [[barunai]] ruler and called as [[Sultan Mohammad Shah]]. A [[Keris]] also part of a weapon which became as a symbol of [[Kota Klias]] throne. It was believed to be lost during the assassination of Awang Koyoh nearby [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] water. Some fishermen had caught a big fish with this [[Keris]] some 60 years ago.

The [[Keris]] and the [[Andiban]] were both made from gold. It was told by the eldest, when Awang Alak Betatar killed the wild buffalo or [[tambadau]], the golden horns was discovered by Awang Alak and that inspired him to create another small and secret weapons.

==Language==
{{main article|Sabah Bisaya language|Brunei Bisaya language}}
Sabah Bisaya language has 90% intelligibility of Tatana, a [[Dusunic languages|Dusun]] dialect. Bisaya in Sabah also has 58% lexical similarity with dialects of Sarawak Bisaya and 57%–59% with Brunei dialect.&lt;ref name = "Ethnologue: Bisaya, Sabah"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music, arts and crafts==

The traditional musical instrument consists of Kulintangan, gong, and many of small gongs (cf. Asmahs claim that the Bisaya are supposed to be the best gong musicians). It is as if somebody just beats the gong and everyone-men, women, young and old just starts to dance. All these instruments are used in the wedding ceremony, celebrating very important people etc.
Besides the musical items, the Bisayas are able to make good weapons for various purposes. There are andiban, sumpit, parang, keris and knife.

==Festivals==

===Rumbia===

====The leaves (roun rombia)====
The Rumbia's leaves can be woven into a roof, the women are trained by their elders (women ) to inherit the rumbia-weaving skill. The Rumbia'leaves known as roun rombia in Bisaya dialect. Meanwhile, the process of weaving the Rumbia's leaves known as manyarut. The woven Rumbia's leaves need to be dried under the sun. These leaves would last for two to three years, environment-friendly.

====The branch====
In the past, the branch of Rumbia tree used as wall for a house or hut ( in the farm ). The branch can be used to build chicken home, fence to guard the plants ( vegetables etc. ) and the dried branch used as a torch ( to spread the fire; to clear the land for agriculture purpose ). Meanwhile, skin of the branch can be woven into basket, mat, and others. Among the well-known woven stuff from this Rumbia parts are saging (a kind of basket carried at the back of a person), lalibu (a flat woven-basket useful during paddy harvesting), and topau (a mat used to dry the paddy seed).

====The trunk====
We start from the upper part, here we can get a punoh, this part is a delicious 'vegetable'. Can be eaten raw, sweet and soft. The punoh served as main menu (vegetable) during wedding reception among Bisaya community. Then, sago (staple food of Bisaya, young generation didn't agree with this) is extracted from the Rumbia's trunk. The skin (palunoh) of Rumbia tree can be used a firewood, floor for hut, and wall too. The trunk can be used as a bridge, it is a strong trunk and last longer. During flood, my brothers and I used to build a boat from the Rumbia tree. I missed those days, we are adult now. In case of emergency, you can get water from the roots of Rumbia tree. It tastes water, of course.

===Mibulang===
One of their main festivals called [[Babulang]] or Mibulang such as buffalo racing is celebrated annually in Batu Danau, Sarawak near the Brunei border. More photos of the festival in June 2006  showing their black traditional costumes and their buffalo racing tradition are available on [[flickr]] at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/babulang2006/]

'''Conflict escalation''' is the process by which conflicts grow in severity over time. This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context.  In [[systems theory]], the process of conflict escalation is modeled by [[positive feedback]].

While the word ''escalation'' was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the [[Cold War]] by two  important books: ''On Escalation'' ([[Herman Kahn]], 1965) and ''Escalation and the Nuclear Option'' ([[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lawrence|title=The evolution of nuclear strategy|year=1993|publisher=St Martin's press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-02843-1|pages=198–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAxF8SBR3IC&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=%22The%20Impact%20of%20Atomic%20Weapons%20on%20Strategy%20and%20Tactics.%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]—the [[Cold War]].

Conflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit [[rules of engagement]]. Highly successful [[military tactics]] exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. [[Napoleon]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] both advocated this approach. [[Sun Tzu]] elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that [[military strategy]] was about minimizing escalation, and [[diplomacy]] about eliminating it.

==Continuum of force==
{{Main|Use of force continuum}}
The United States Marine Corps' "Continuum of Force" (found in MCRP 3-02B){{clarify|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? Be a little more specific --&gt; documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are:

===Level 1: Compliant (cooperative)===
The subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 2: Resistant (passive)===
The subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 3: Resistant (active)===
Initially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points.

===Level 4: Assaultive (bodily harm)===
The unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and [[Strike (attack)|blow]]s.

===Level 5: Assaultive (lethal force)===
The subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons.

==Preventing==
A major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a [[mindset]] to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in [[peacemaking]]. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of [[protest]]s, [[Strike action|strike]]s, or other [[direct action]]s.

[[Mohandas Gandhi]], a major proponent of [[nonviolence]], used satyagraha to demonstrate that:
*Peacefully controlling a group of people with a common cause was possible.
*One could accomplish objectives through [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] without capitulating to violent attack.
*His method ensured mutual support.
*It was possible to desist from retributive justice.
*It was not ultimately desirable to inflict [[punishment]], even when grievously wronged.

With this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided [[technological escalation]] and demonstrated to those in power that:
* The group was held together by its own discipline, and not by any kind of authority using violence.
* Authority could surrender without being subjected to violence.
* Authority could depart safely.
* Authority could devolve without obstacles, for the [[dissent]] was well enough organized to constitute an effective [[political party]].

==Conflict escalation curve==
{{Original research section|date=September 2016}}
The conflict escalation curve is a concept created by [[Michael N. Nagler]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far [[dehumanization]] has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).

The curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed.
 
The curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages.

===Stage 1: Conflict resolution===
In the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.

===Stage 2: Satyagraha===
The conflict escalates into [[satyagraha]], or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called "the law of suffering"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation.

Invoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: "The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering."&lt;ref&gt;K. Shridharani, "War without Violence" P. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders.

===Stage 3: Sacrifice: the last resort===
When the conflict has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous "fasts unto death" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like [[Kathy Kelly]] who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.

The philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion.

===How to use the conflict escalation curve===
The conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried.

For example, in 2003, US President [[George W. Bush]] dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as "a focus group," saying: "Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Richard|title=Antiwar Protests Fail to Sway Bush on Plans for Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/international/middleeast/19IRAQ.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=NY Times|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming.

==Systems view==
Carol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory.{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Jay Forrester]] and [[Donella Meadows]] observed that people in crisis would often push the [[twelve leverage points]] towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo.{{cn|date=February 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11902">'''Glenn Ford''' (October 29, 1949 – June 29, 2015) was convicted of murder in 1984 and released from [[Angola Prison]] in March 2014 after a full exoneration. Ford was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. He was the longest serving death row inmate in the United States to be fully exonerated before his death.&lt;ref name=Nightline /&gt; He was denied compensation by the state of Louisiana for his wrongful conviction.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera" /&gt;

==Arrest==
Isadore Rozeman, 58, was found dead in his jewelry store on November 5, 1983, by Shreveport police who had been notified by acquaintance Dr. A. R. Ebrahim that the shop appeared to be in disarray. Rozeman had been murdered with a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. Glenn Ford, Rozeman's yard man, was known to be in the vicinity of the store at the time of the murder and identified by multiple people at the trial. He was known to be with Jake and Henry Robinson after the crime, showing materials stolen from the crime scene as well as a [[.22 (disambiguation)|.22 calibre pistol]] belonging to Jake. An acquaintance of Ford testified that he had a [[.38|.38 pistol]] in his waistband the morning of the crime, the same [[caliber]] bullet found at the crime scene. Police initially were unable to find any evidence of the crime at Ford's residence, but did find residue from a gunshot wound on his left hand (he is left-handed). Ford was immediately taken into custody. Evidence was, however, found in Henry Robinson's possession, as well as pawn shop receipts in Ford's name from the date of the murder.&lt;ref name="Motion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Dale|title=Motion To Vacate Conviction And Sentence|url=http://archive.shreveporttimes.com/assets/pdf/D9219637311.PDF|accessdate=15 April 2015|publisher=Shreveport Times|date=6 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clements|first1=Gary|last2=Novod|first2=Aaron|title=Louisiana ’ s Longest-Serving Death Row Prisoner Ordered Freed After 30 Years Glenn Ford, An Innocent Man, To Be Released Imminently|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/GFord-PR.pdf|website=Death Penalty Info|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction==
Ford was assigned two [[Lawyer|attorney]]s by the state due to his inability to pay for a lawyer on his own. Both were selected from an alphabetical listing of lawyers from the local bar association.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Freedom After 30 Years on Death Row|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/freedom-after-30-years-on-death-row/284179/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead attorney was an oil and gas lawyer who had never tried a case, criminal or civil, before a jury.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The second attorney had been out of law school for only two years and worked at an insurance defense firm on [[slip and fall]] cases.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Prosecutors were able to take advantage of the defense's inexperience and use a [[peremptory challenge]] capacity to keep [[African Americans]] off the jury, resulting in an all [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] jury with a Caucasian judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Rachel|title=ARTICLE: NO DUE PROCESS: HOW THE DEATH PENALTY VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF DEATH ROW PRISONERS|journal=The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal|date=Spring 2007|volume=16|page=195|pages=|url=https://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/pilj/vol16no2/documents/16-2KingArticle.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen|title=THE ROLE OF RACE, POVERTY, INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, AND MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE DECLINE OF THE DEATH PENALTY|journal=University of Richmond Law Review|date=13 Mar 2015|volume=49|page=|pages=692|url=http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bright-493.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was convicted and sentenced to death by the jury without a murder weapon linking him to the crime, and with evidence from confidential informants withheld.&lt;ref name=Nightline /&gt;

[[Barry Scheck]] of the [[Innocence Project]] has levied the accusation that racism played a role in the conviction, as he faced a completely Caucasian jury despite living in a community that is at least half African American.&lt;ref name = "Scheck"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scheck|first1=Barry|title=Barry Scheck: Stunning new case highlights how race bias corrupts juries|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/15/barry_scheck_stunning_new_case_highlights_how_race_bias_corrupts_juries/#|website=Salon.com|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to state that this is part of a broader pattern in the American legal system, and that uniform juries tend to deliberate less than diverse juries drawn from a range of backgrounds. He continues that "diverse juries are more likely to challenge one another, and less likely to fall back on what may be unconscious stereotypes."&lt;ref name="Scheck" /&gt;

Ford was sentenced to death by electrocution at [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in August 1988.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=US man walks free after 25 years on death row|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26540604|accessdate=15 April 2015|agency=BBC|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exoneration==
In 2000, the Louisiana supreme court ordered a hearing on Ford's claim that the prosecution suppressed evidence that might have showed Jake and Henry Robinson to be responsible for the murder (the two were initially implicated in the crime).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finn|first1=Kathy|title=Louisiana man walks free after nearly three decades on death row|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/us-usa-deathrow-louisiana-idUSBREA2B06S20140312|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|date=12 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013, an unidentified [[informant]] told prosecutors that Jake Robinson admitted to shooting and killing Rozeman. This led to Ford's legal team filing a [[motion to vacate]] his conviction and sentence in March 2014, stating that "credible evidence...supporting a finding that Ford was neither present at, nor a participant in, the robbery and murder of Isadore Rozeman."&lt;ref name="Motion"/&gt; State District Judge Ramona Emanuel overturned his conviction that same month.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Ford is one of at least 150 people on death row in the United States who were later exonerated and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Innocence list|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row|website=Death Penalty Info|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life after exoneration===
[[File:Glenn Ford Death Row Exoneree Missing Poster Distributed In New Orleans and In Media 22 April 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|Poster distributed in [[New Orleans]] and to local media on the evening of Ford's disappearance]]
Soon after release from prison, Ford was diagnosed with terminal [[metastatic]] [[carcinoma]] of the lung. He entered home [[hospice]] care under the supervision of Johnathan Thompson (of ''[[Connick v. Thompson]]'' fame) and his organization Resurrection After Exoneration in New Orleans, LA.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Virji|first1=Anar|title=Justice still elusive for exonerated death row inmate|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2015/03/justice-elusive-exonerated-death-row-inmate-150330203209594.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=Al Jazeera|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Amy|last2=Sumell|first2=Jackie|title=Volunteers Gather to Care for Glenn Ford, Exonerated Louisiana Man Who Is Now Dying from Cancer|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/17/volunteers_gather_to_care_for_glenn|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=Democracy Now!|date=17 April 2015|ref=Democracy Now Health Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Ford went missing on the night of April 22, 2015, after a precipitous change in mental state, possibly the result of his physical illness. Police initiated a search and he was found the next day, bloodied and without memory of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Nicole|title=Exonerated death row inmate battling lung cancer found safe after Louisiana disappearance|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/exonerated-death-row-inmate-lung-cancer-missing-article-1.2195863|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was eligible for a $313,000 settlement under Louisiana law, but a judge denied the petition for the funds, stating that he likely had some role in the initial crime as he had been in possession of stolen goods when arrested. Ford knew a robbery was going to take place and did not stop it, according to a 60 Minutes program that aired September 4, 2016. Further, he attempted to destroy evidence by pawning items taken in the robbery and tried to find buyers for the murder weapon used by men Ford implicated in the murder, according to Caddo Parrish District Judge Katherine Dorroh. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/glenn-ford-restitution_n_6972158.html
&lt;ref name=Nightline&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Dan|last2=Yu|first2=Katie|last3=Effron|first3=Lauren|title=Exonerated Death Row Inmate Meets the Former Prosecutor Who Put Him There|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/exonerated-death-row-inmate-meets-prosecutor-put/story?id=30399619|accessdate=18 April 2015|work=Nightline|agency=ABC|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil proceedings against the state are pending.

Ford died under hospice care on June 29, 2015, from complications due to lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/freed-death-row-inmate-dies-supreme-court-ruling "Freed death row inmate died hours before supreme court cited his case"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (June 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
After learning of Ford's innocence, A.M. "Marty" Stroud III, prosecutor for the [[Caddo Parish]] District Attorney's office in the Ford case, regrets his role in the conviction.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Amy|title=Capital Punishment? A Dead Policy Walking |url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/capital_punishment_a_dead_policy_walking_20150408|website=Truth Dig|publisher=King Features Syndicate|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that he believes Ford had an unfair trial where key evidence was suppressed by both police and prosecutors and that Ford's lawyers did not have the financial resources nor the criminal law experience to mount a proper defense. He feels that if he had done his job properly at the time, and all the evidence had been properly collected, "they would not have even been able to arrest Glenn Ford, let alone try him for the crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stroud|first1=Marty|title=RE: "State should give Ford real justice," March 8, 6D|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/20/lead-prosecutor-offers-apology-in-the-case-of-exonerated-death-row-inmate-glenn-ford/25049063/|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=The Times (Shreveport, LA)|date=20 March 2015|ref=Stroud}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellware|first1=Kim|title=Marty Stroud, Prosecutor Who Put Innocent Man On Death Row: 'Whole System Is Fatally Flawed'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/01/marty-stroud-prosecutor_n_6988752.html|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=1 April 2015|ref=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in Oakland''' began to rise during the late 1960s, and by the end of the 1970s [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]'s per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of [[San Francisco]] or [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html Jerry Browns No-Nonsense New Age for Oakland by Heather Mac Donald, City Journal Autumn 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[National Journal]] referred to Oakland as the "1983 crime capital" of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National journal |page=2474 |author=Government Research Corporation |publisher=National Journal Group |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime continued to escalate during the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name=cityjournal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |title=Jerry Brown’s No-Nonsense New Age for Oakland. |publisher=City Journal |date=Autumn 1999 |author=Heather Mac Donald |accessdate=2008-08-08 |authorlink=Heather Mac Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the first decade of the 21st century Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com"&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2010/11/22/oakland-moves-from-3rd-to-5th-in-most-dangerous-city-survey/ Oakland Moves From 3rd To 5th In Most Dangerous City Survey « CBS San Francisco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However the homicide rate in Oakland has dropped substantially in the 21st century,&lt;ref name="www.mercurynews.com"&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_24823295/oakland-city-sees-biggest-drop-homicides-since-2004 Oakland sees biggest drop in homicides since 2004 &lt;&lt; San Jose Mercury News]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="www.latimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-25/news/mn-864_1_unrelated-homicides Oakland Sets Record for Homicides &lt;&lt; Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.sfgate.com"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Murder-rates-dropped-in-S-F-Oakland-in-96-3143014.php Murder rates dropped in S.F., Oakland in '96 &lt;&lt; SFGate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods.  In 2008, homicides were disproportionately concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, even though these districts represent only 44% of Oakland's residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093648/http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges of crime==
Crime remains one of Oakland's challenges, and Oakland continues to have a reputation among its own citizens, its understaffed police force, and residents of other Bay Area cities as a less safe place, with one of the top 20 highest rates of violent crime in the U.S.&lt;ref name="sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crimePerception"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandhomicides/ci_9325071 |title=Crime in Oakland: Perception, reality or both? |author=Hill, Angela |date=Oct 1, 2009 |work=Oakland Tribune |publisher= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drop"/&gt; According to Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts, during 2011 Oakland has averaged three street shootings per day, some of which cause injury or death to innocent bystanders.  Batts also said  “You don’t want a police state, but you want enough [police] to deal with the demand in the city.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/08/11/BA7T1KMEM9.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first1=Carolyn | last1=Jones | first2=Henry K. | last2=Lee | first3=Matthai | last3=Kuruvila | title=Man charged with killing Oakland 3-year-old | date=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of police officers in Oakland has steadily declined during the past several years. "But the men and women of the [[Oakland Police Department]] are still going out there and still stopping dangerous people, people with weapons, and trying to make a difference in the community," said Officer Jeff Thomason, a department spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/18056181/detail.html Oakland Ranks Fifth In Crime Nationwide - News Story - KTVU San Francisco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/17/BAOO18PUM8.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | title=Man killed in Oakland shootout was wanted | date=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these challenges, the homicide rate in Oakland has declined in recent years, thanks in part to new people moving into the city who are more willing to work with police than the previous residents.

==Crime dynamics==
Oakland ranks highly in California for most categories of crime. Violent crimes including assault, rape and murder, occur from two to five times the U.S. average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areaconnect.com/crime/compare.htm?c1=Oakland&amp;s1=CA&amp;c2=San+Jose&amp;s2=CA Crime Rate Comparison: Oakland Vs.

Historically, most murders have occurred in [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]] and the flatlands of [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] between [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]].&lt;ref name="2006HomicideMap"&gt;{{cite map |publisher= San Francisco Chronicle |title= Homicide in Oakland: 2006 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/oaklandhomicides/interactives/map/ |author= Gus D'Angelo |accessdate= 2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behaviorresearch.net/homicidereport.htm|title=Investigating Homicide in Oakland: An analysis of Homicide Patterns and Investigative Approaches in 1997|author=Gini Graham Scott|publisher=Behavior Research Associates|year=1998|accessdate=2008-02-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212005157/http://www.behaviorresearch.net/homicidereport.htm|archivedate=2008-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair]], [[Rockridge, Oakland, California|Rockridge]] and some areas in [[North Oakland, Oakland, California|North Oakland]] have fewer problems with violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oakland.crimespotting.org/#lon=-122.270&amp;dtend=2008-08-06T23:59:07-07:00&amp;dtstart=2008-07-30T23:59:46-07:00&amp;lat=37.806&amp;zoom=14&amp;types=AA,Mu,Ro,SA,DP,Na,Al,Pr,Th,VT,Va,Bu,Ar Oakland Crimespotting interactive map.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Property crime is widespread throughout the city. Oakland records one robbery per 91 residents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Artz |first=Matthew |title=Oakland: Robbery capital of America |newspaper=[[Contra Costa Times]] |date=May 7, 2013 |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_23191897/oakland-robbery-capital-america |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{citation needed span|text=one car theft per 40 residents, three to four times the state average.|date=July 2012}} Carjackings occur two to three times more frequently in Oakland than in other cities of comparable size, and police have recorded at least one reported carjacking in every Oakland neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Carjackings"&gt;{{cite map |publisher= San Francisco Chronicle|title= Oakland sets unhappy mark in carjackings|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/02/MNRK10VJV4.DTL|author=Justin Berton, Chronicle Staff Writer|accessdate= 2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans comprise less than one-third of Oakland's residents, yet they are over-represented in crime statistics, and most homicides occur in [[African-American neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref name=urbanstrategies&gt;[http://www.urbanstrategies.org/documents/2006HomicideReport.pdf Urban Strategies Council.

During that same time, just 802 graduated prepared to attend either a California State University or University of California school."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfchronicle.com/local/bayarea/item/Even-Odds-Part-1-22785.php&lt;/ref&gt;In 2010 the superintendent of Oakland schools set up an African-American male achievement initiative with one of its goals being to cut incarceration rates of black male students by half.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_16600185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, of those arrested for homicide, 84.4% were black, 9.4% hispanic and 6.3% white.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/file/762/762-2013%20Victim%20and%20Suspect%20Race3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, there was an increase in violent crime in general and homicides in particular. As during previous years, a large majority (100) of the 110 homicide victims, as well as a preponderance of known suspects, were black or Latino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.opoa.org/uncategorized/homicides-in-oakland-rise-for-the-first-time-in-four-years/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205053425/http://www.opoa.org/uncategorized/homicides-in-oakland-rise-for-the-first-time-in-four-years/# |archive-date=2012-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The homicide drop in 2010 had been the city's fourth in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%. Although the police department’s resources have been diminishing, according to Assistant Police Chief [[Howard Jordan (Police Officer)|Howard Jordan]] the Oakland police department is committed to improved public safety by increasing police presence during peak crime hours, improving intelligence gathering, and moving more aggressively to arrest violent crime suspects.&lt;ref name="drop"&gt;[http://www.insidebayarea.com/oakland-homicides/ci_14786462 Gradually, Oakland a less deadly place - Inside Bay Area&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaklandnorth.net/2011/01/03/oakland-memorializes-the-94-homicide-of-2010/ Oakland memorializes the 94 homicides of 2010 – Oakland North : North Oakland News, Food, Art and Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime against the city's [[taco truck]] vendors in the [[Fruitvale, Oakland, California|Fruitvale]] district came under scrutiny after the killing of a vendor's 5-year-old son in December 2011. Some truck vendors responded by hiring armed security guards, citing continual robberies and ineffective police response times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baycitizen.org/crime/story/plagued-crime-oakland-food-truck-vendors/ Plagued by Crime, Oakland Food-Truck Vendors Unite for Protection], Shoshana Walter, '''The Bay Citizen''', Mar 3 2012. Retrieved 2011-3-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2012, the city had experienced 115 killings that year, with 4 considered "justifiable", such as in self-defense or officer-related killings. This included the [[Oikos University shooting|killing of seven people]] on April 2 at [[Oikos University]], the largest mass killing in the city's history. 22 homicide victims were women, up from 10 the previous year. Killings related to arguments were at 18, compared to nine in 2011. 9 were domestic violence-related, compared to 7 in 2011. Retaliation killings were at 14, compared to 8 in 2011. Confirmed gang-related killings were at 10, with 15 gang-related killings in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;HARRY HARRIS and KRISTIN J. BENDER:

2016 is on track to have a below average year for homicides in Oakland with only 63 homicides currently recorded as of November 7th 2016. There is, however, a trend of non-lethal shootings occurring such as shooting in the arms or legs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oaklandmofo.com/blog/oakland-homicide-count-is-rising&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Ceasefire==
In 2013, Oakland implemented a gang violence reduction plan used previously in other cities, [[Operation Ceasefire]], based on the research and strategies of author [[David M. Kennedy (criminologist)|David M. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tammerlin Drummond: [http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20505391/tammerlin-drummond-david-kennedy-talks-oakland-and-ceasefire David Kennedy talks Oakland and Ceasefire] - mercurynews, April 28, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain Awareness Center==
The Domain Awareness Center (DAC) is a joint project between the [[Port of Oakland]] and the city. Planning started in 2009 as part of a nationwide initiative to secure ports by connecting [[motion sensor]]s and cameras in and around the shipping facilities. In 2013, the Oakland DAC integrated 130 cameras from the Port of Oakland and four city cameras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Oakland-surveillance-center-raises-concerns-4671708.php&lt;/ref&gt; By including gunshot detection and [[license plate reader]]s the DAC would allow police to faster investigate suspects (which does not exactly equal the alleged shift from "reactive to proactive" crime treatment).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Domain-Awareness-Center-May-Bring-Proactive-Policing-to-Oakland.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal issues with the Oakland Police Department==
Despite its high crime rate, Oakland has fewer police officers than many other major cities.&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;[http://www.orpn.org/staffing.htm Oakland Residents for Peaceful Neighborhoods - Oakland Police Department Understaffed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "When Police Chief Anthony Batts took this job, we started out with 830 officers. We're down to about 666 officers. If this city is going to be a safe place for us to live and raise our family then we as a city have to determine what it's going to cost us to do that and how to get there," Oakland City Council President Larry Reid agreed with Batts that more police officers are needed but said that "residents will have to open their wallets first."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaklandnorth.net/2011/08/10/community-remains-shaken-by-shooting-of-three-year-old/ Community remains shaken by shooting of three-year-old – Oakland North : North Oakland News, Food, Art and Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to an ongoing negative rapport between police officers and community members, evidence of which can be traced back to times preceding [[The Black Panther Party]], and which reemerged in the wake of the [[Oakland Riders]] scandal in 2003, the shooting of [[BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant|Oscar Grant]] in 2009,(though it occurred in Oakland, it did not involve Oakland police, but rather a transit officer for BART) and the controversial handling of [[Occupy Oakland]] protesters in 2011. The homicide clearance rate has declined from 70% to approximately 40% in recent years, primarily due to a reduction in the number of investigators. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winston|first=Ali|title=Getting Away With Murder|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/getting-away-with-murder/Content?oid=3390191|publisher=East Bay Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A remarkably small percentage of current Oakland police officers live in the city itself, primarily due to the high cost of living..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Only 54 police officers live in Oakland; many police recruits also live outside Oakland|url=http://oaklandlocal.com/article/only-54-police-officers-live-oakland-many-police-recruits-also-live-outside-oakland|publisher=OaklandLocal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427052348/http://oaklandlocal.com/article/only-54-police-officers-live-oakland-many-police-recruits-also-live-outside-oakland|archivedate=2013-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Oakland, the number of police officers has been declining. Between 2003 and 2013, the number of police officers in Oakland declined by 91.&lt;ref name="staff"/&gt;  The number of crimes that each officer has to deal with is double or triple those handled by officers in other major California cities.&lt;ref name="staff"/&gt; The number of homicide detectives decreased from 14 in 2010 to 9 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/04/28/oakland-murder-investigators-worry-about-more-cuts/ Oakland Murder Investigators Worry About More Cuts « CBS San Francisco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Detective caseload is more than any other major city in California, except Fresno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chaunceybaileyproject.org/2008/12/28/2081/ Charts: Homicides in California’s largest cities; Oakland homicide detectives’ case loads, wages, overtime | The Chauncey Bailey Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the Police Department had the lowest homicide clearance rate among California’s large cities because the department is understaffed and the detective work in certain instances is not as thorough because there are simply not enough officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chaunceybaileyproject.org/2008/12/28/understaffed-oakland-department-behind-other-cities-in-solving-homicides/ Understaffed Oakland department behind other cities in solving homicides | The Chauncey Bailey Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative police staffing levels ===
In 2004, the number of police officers per 10,000 residents was as follows:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
*Baltimore—49
*Newark—46
*Philadelphia—46
*Chicago—45
*New York City—44
*Detroit—39
{{col-2}}
*St. Louis—39
*Atlanta—35
*Cleveland and Boston—34
*San Francisco—29
*Los Angeles—23
*'''Oakland—18'''
{{col-end}}
Since that year the number of  police officers in Oakland has been cut by approx. 13% to 15.6 per 10,000 residents, resulting in Oakland being called "the city with half a police department." Official estimates are that for a city with Oakland's level of crime approximately 1,100 officers are needed to adequately patrol the city;  as of the beginning of 2013, Oakland employed only 616 officers.&lt;ref name="staff"/&gt;

As of 2010, the city of New Orleans, whose murder rate outpaces that of Oakland,&lt;ref name="wwltv.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/crime/FBI-Report-New-Orleans-Murder-Rate-Ten-Times-National-Average-130161983.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503172350/http://www.wwltv.com/news/crime/FBI-Report-New-Orleans-Murder-Rate-Ten-Times-National-Average-130161983.html|archivedate=2013-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had 48 officers for every 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="wwltv.com"/&gt;

From the 13th century until the 19th century, German speakers were the dominant ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Czechreview"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter Salner |title=Ethnic polarisation in an ethnically homogeneous town |journal=Czech Sociological Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=235–246 |date=2001 |url=http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/upl/archiv/files/171_235SALNE.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227082043/http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/upl/archiv/files/171_235SALNE.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Compromise of 1867]], the government encouraged [[Magyarization]] and, by the end of World War I, Bratislava was predominantly made up of German and Hungarian speakers, with Slovaks as the largest minority. While a minority, Jews from German and Hungarian-speaking areas contributed much to the intellectual culture of the city.&lt;ref name="Czechreview"/&gt; Interpretation of census results is complicated, since before 1918, language was used as census criterion, and after 1918, self-identified ethnicity.
 
In addition, as Bratislava since 1918 has enlarged its territory several times, a more accurate assessment of early demographics might take into account the formerly independent communities ([[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]], [[Lamač]], [[Rača,_Bratislava|Rača]], etc.), which were mostly Slovak. An alternative would be to compare only those districts which officially belonged to the city in the time of a given census.  Moreover, residents of mixed origin tended to identify with the dominant political group, such as Hungarian before 1918, and Slovak after 1918; that is, what would be the most suitable or least dangerous identity.&lt;ref name="Czechreview"/&gt; 
For example, the proportion of ethnic Hungarians appeared to increase from 7.5% in 1850 to 40.53% in 1910. It is more likely that people of mixed backgrounds identified with the one in power. Similarly, the apparent population of Slovaks "jumped" from 14.42% in 1910 to 33% in 1919, but this may have reflected changing self-identification, rather than an exchange of peoples. Many people were bi- or trilingual and multicultural. Because of the pressure of Magyarisation, at one time Slovaks identified or presented themselves as ethnic Hungarians.

After the formation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, Bratislava remained a multiethnic city, but with a different demographic trend. After active [[Slovakization]], the proportion of Slovaks and Czechs increased, while the proportion of Germans and Hungarians fell. With the shift in government, many of the largely Hungarian former government employees emigrated.  Czechs and Slovaks immigrated to the city to take their places in jobs. In 1938, 59% of population were Slovaks or Czechs, while Germans represented 22% and Hungarians 13% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the first Slovak Republic in 1939 brought other changes, most notably the expulsion of many Czechs and Jews under Nazi influence, with the deportation of Jews continuing in the early 1940s, leading to most of the 15,000 from Bratislava being killed or dying from maltreatment in German concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Czechreview"/&gt; In 1945, most of the ethnic Germans were evacuated. After the restoration of Czechoslovakia, the [[Beneš decrees]] collectively punished ethnic German and Hungarian minorities by expropriation and deportation to Germany, Austria, and Hungary for their alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany and Hungary against Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="post-war"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&amp;id=1015&amp;p1=1579 |title=History - Post-war Bratislava |date=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224024348/http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&amp;id=1015&amp;p1=1579 |archivedate=February 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was part of a postwar population transfer approved by the Allies, with the thought of reducing future tensions. Ethnic Germans were expelled from across eastern Europe. The stripping of Slovak citizenship from the Hungarian and German ethnics also forced the minorities to leave the city. Also, Hungary and Slovakia made population exchanges, which further decreased the number of the Hungarians in the city. The city utterly lost its multicultural character and much of its vitality.&lt;ref name="post-war"/&gt; Since the 1950s, the Slovaks have been the dominant ethnicity in the town, making up around 90% of the city's population.&lt;ref name="Czechreview"/&gt; By the mid 1970s, it had surpassed Brno as the second-largest city of Czechoslovakia, and reached one-third the size of [[Prague]], the capital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The '''[[Western Norway]]''' region of [[Norway]] showed the highest population growth rate in Norway in 2010, at 1.44%. The fertility rate in this region is higher than in other parts of Norway. The population as of 1 January 2010 was 1,263,464, with 37.7% of the population living in [[Hordaland]], 33.8% in [[Rogaland]], 19.8% in [[Møre og Romsdal]], and 8.4% in [[Sogn og Fjordane]]. 60% of the population is under 40&amp;nbsp;years old, and 30% is under 20&amp;nbsp;years old. Many of the historical immigrants in Western Norway came from countries like [[Scotland]], [[England]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. Western Norway is the part of Norway which has the largest immigration from the western world.

[[File:Saint Paul Church Bergen Norway 2009 1.JPG|thumb|Saint Paul Church, a [[Catholic church]] in Western Norway.]]
[[Christianity]] is the largest religion. 1,054,573 people are members of the [[Church of Norway]]. There is also 52,365 members in other Christian churches. Islam has 10,685 adherents in Western Norway, Buddhism has 2,082. 1,171 are of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Judaism]], [[Sikhism]] and other religions.

There are more than thousand [[Protestant]] [[church (building)|church]]es (in all municipalities), six [[Catholic]] [[church (building)|church]]es (in [[Bergen]], [[Stavanger]], [[Haugesund]], [[Ålesund]], [[Molde]] and [[Kristiansund]]), two [[mosque]]s (in [[Bergen]] and [[Stavanger]]), two [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[church (building)|churches]] (in [[Bergen]] and [[Stavanger]]), and one [[Hindu temple]] (in [[Bergen]]).

The name "[[Bible Belt (Norway)|Bible Belt]]" has been applied historically to the [[Southern Norway|Southern]] and Western parts of Norway. The region thus defined included most of Western Norway, especially [[Rogaland]], [[Møre og Romsdal]] and some parts of [[Hordaland]]. Notably absent from this belt are bigger cities like [[Bergen]] and [[Stavanger]] where many people identify themselves as non-religious or with other religions. In these areas the conservative branch of the [[Church of Norway]] has a stronghold and the members usually associate themselves to Indremisjonen (Inner Mission). There are also numerous [[Pentecostals]] and members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway|Free Churches]], but these movements are also strongly represented in the rest of the country. The Bible Belt in Norway traditionally reflects the support for the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]]. However, especially since the first decade of the 21st century, conservative bible belt Christians unhappy with the more liberal development of the party have increasingly turned to the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2014}} {{cite news|url=http://www.dagenmagazinet.no/Nyheter/Samfunn/tabid/248/articleView/true/ModuleId/42418/Default.aspx|title=KrF kraftig tilbake i bibelbeltet| language = Norwegian | work= [[Dagen (Norwegian newspaper)|DagenMagazinet]] |first=Per Ole|last=Aalberg|date=16 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2014}} {{cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kommentarer/54978/article/item/null|title=Stjeler fra Høyre|language=Norwegian|work=[[Klassekampen]]|first=Anders|last=Horn|date=23 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135734/http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kommentarer/54978/article/item/null|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[Christianity]] is the largest religious group. Although more and more ethnic [[Norwegians]] are less religious, Christian immigrants have increased the population. Many known Christian missionaries came from Western Norway, for example [[Torill Selsvold Nyborg]], who is now the county mayor of [[Hordaland]].

[[File:StSunniva.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Saint [[Sunniva]], the [[patron saint]] of the Norwegian [[Diocese of Bjørgvin]]. According to legend, Sunniva was the heir of an [[Ireland|Irish]] kingdom, but had to flee when a {{linktext|heathen}} king, who wanted to marry her, invaded. At the Norwegian island of [[Selja, Selje|Selja]], in the present-day municipality of [[Selje]], she and her followers took refuge in a cave. The locals suspected the foreigners of stealing their sheep, and the ruler [[Haakon Sigurdsson|Håkon Jarl]] was sent for. Sunniva and her followers prayed to God that they should not fall into the hands of the heathens, upon which rocks fell down blocking the entrance to the cave.]]

[[Protestantism]] is the majority religion in Norway. Most Norwegians are [[Lutheran]] and members of the [[Church of Norway]]. Over 85% of the population is member here. Every municipalities have Protestant churches. Many municipalities, for example [[Austevoll]], a small municipality with around 4,000 inhabitants, have over 13 church buildings. Most Norwegians are not active in the church. Nevertheless, there are many who participate to worship at [[Christmas Eve]]. People outside the cities are often more religious than the population in the cities, although there are many religious Christians immigrants in the cities.

====Catholicism====
[[Catholicism]] increased its members in Western Norway due to immigration from [[Poland]], the [[Philippines]], [[Chile]], and other [[Latin American]] and [[Europe]]an countries. There are six Catholic churches (as of 2004), in [[Bergen]] (4,925 members), Stavanger (2,863 members), [[Haugesund]] (822 members), [[Ålesund]] (595 members), [[Molde]] (289) and [[Kristiansund]] (212). The largest church is St. Paul church in Bergen. The number of Catholics increased rapidly from 2005, because of immigration (mainly [[Poles|Polish]]). The capacity in the region is too small for all Catholics, and it is therefore planned to build several Catholic churches in the region, in addition to Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="From 2004"&gt;From 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic data''' or '''economic statistics''' are [[data]] (quantitative measures) describing an actual [[economy]], past or present. These are typically found in [[time-series]] form, that is, covering more than one time period (say the monthly [[unemployment rate]] for the last five years) or in [[cross-sectional data]] in one time period (say for consumption and income levels for [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] households). Data may also be collected from [[Survey data|survey]]s of for example individuals and firms&lt;ref&gt;• Jeff Dominitz and Arthur van Soest, 2008. "survey data, analysis of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000229&amp;edition=all&amp;field=content&amp;q=panel%20data&amp;topicid=C8&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• C. Hsiao, 2008. "Economic Panel Data," ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', pp. 4114–4121. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767004113 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[aggregate data|aggregated]] to sectors and industries of a single economy or for the international economy. A collection of such data in table form comprises a [[data set]].

[[Economic methodology|Methodological]] [[economic]] and [[statistical]] elements of the subject include measurement, [[data collection|collection]], [[data analysis|analysis]], and publication of data.&lt;ref&gt;• Referred to in the ''Journal of Economic Literature'' [[JEL classification codes|classification codes]] under [[JEL classification codes#Mathematical and quantitative methods JEL: C Subcategories|JEL: C8 – Data Collection and Data Estimation Methodology]] and [[JEL classification codes#Macroeconomics and monetary economics JEL: E Subcategories|JEL: E01 – Measurement and Data on National Income and Product Accounts and Wealth]].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• T.

Economic data provide an empirical basis for economic research, whether descriptive or [[econometric]]. Data archives are also a key input for assessing the [[replicability]] of empirical findings&lt;ref&gt;Richard Anderson, William H. Greene, B. D. McCullough, and H. D. Vinod, 2008. "The Role of Data/Code Archives in the Future of Economic Research," ''Journal of Economic Methodology'', 15(1), pp. [http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/agmv.pdf 99–115.]&lt;/ref&gt; and for use in decision making as to [[economic policy]].

At the level of an economy, many data are organized and compiled according to the methodology of [[national accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;• Nancy D. Ruggles, 1987. "social accounting," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 377–82.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• André Vanoli, 2008.

In these examples data may be stated in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal or real values]], that is, in money or [[inflation]]-adjusted terms. Other [[economic indicator]]s include a variety of alternative measures of [[output (economics)|output]], orders, [[trade]], the [[labor force]], [[Consumer confidence|confidence]], [[prices]], and financial series (''e.g.,'' [[money]] and [[interest rates]]). At the international level there are many series including [[international trade]], international financial flows, direct investment flows (between countries) and [[exchange rates]]. 

For time-series data, reported measurements can be hourly (e.g. for stock markets), daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Estimates such as averages are often subjected to [[seasonal adjustment]] to remove weekly or seasonal-periodicity elements, for example, holiday-period sales and [[Unemployment#Definitions, types and theories|seasonal unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Svend Hylleberg, 2008. "seasonal adjustment," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition,  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000496&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Seasonal%20Adjustment&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a country the data are usually produced by one or more statistical organizations, ''e.g.,'' a [[government]]al or quasi-governmental organization and/or the [[central bank]]s.  International statistics are produced by several international bodies and firms, including the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]].

Studies in [[experimental economics]] may also generate data,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon L. Smith]], 1976. "Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory," ''American Economic Review'', 66(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1817233 p. 274]–279.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using data collected for other purposes. [[Design of experiments|Designed]] [[randomized experiment]]s may provide more reliable conclusions than do observational studies.&lt;ref&gt;• David Moore and George McCabe. ''Introduction to the Practice of Statistics''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• David A. Freedman, et alia. ''Statistics''.
&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[epidemiology]], economics often studies the behavior of humans over periods too long to allow completely controlled experiments, in which case economists can use [[observational study|observational studies]] or [[quasi-experiment]]s; in these studies, economists collect data which are then analyzed with [[statistical methods]] ([[econometric]]s).

Many methods can be used to analyse the data.  These include, ''e.g.,'' time-series analysis using [[multiple regression]], [[Box–Jenkins method|Box–Jenkins analysis]], and [[Seasonal adjustment|seasonality analysis]].  Analysis may be [[univariate]] (modeling one series) or [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] (from several series). [[Econometrics|Econometricians]], economic [[statistician]]s, and [[financial]] analysts formulate [[statistical model|models]], whether for past relationships or for [[economic forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Diebold, Lutz Kilian and [[Marc Nerlove]], 2008. "time series analysis," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_T000064&amp;edition=current&amp;q=&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; These models may include [[partial equilibrium]] [[microeconomics]] aimed at examining particular parts of an economy or economies, or they may cover a whole economic system, as in [[general equilibrium theory]] or in [[macroeconomics]]. Economists use these models to understand past events and to forecast future events, ''e.g.,'' [[Demand (economics)|demand]], [[price]]s and [[employment]]. Methods have also been developed for analyzing or correcting results from use of [[Missing data|incomplete data]] and [[errors in variables]].&lt;ref&gt;• William S. Krasker ''et al.'', 1983. "Estimation for Dirty Data and Flawed Models," ch. 11, ''Handbook of Econometrics'', v. 1, pp. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573441283010156 651]–698. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Zvi Griliches]] "Economic Data Issues,"  ch. 25, ''Handbook of Econometrics'', v. 3, 1986, pp. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573441286030052 1465]–1514.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Christina D.

==Economic data issues==

Good economic data are a precondition to effective macroeconomic management. With the complexity of modern economies and the lags inherent in [[macroeconomic policy]] instruments, a country must have the capacity to promptly identify any adverse trends in its economy and to apply the appropriate corrective measure. This cannot be done without economic data that is complete, accurate and timely.

Increasingly, the availability of good economic data is coming to be seen by international markets as an indicator of a country that is a promising destination for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. International investors are aware that good economic data is necessary for a country to effectively manage its affairs and, other things being equal, will tend to avoid countries that do not publish such data.

The public availability of reliable and up-to-date economic data also reassures international investors by allowing them to monitor economic developments and to manage their [[financial risk|investment risk]]. The severity of the [[Mexican peso crisis|Mexican]] and [[Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crises]] was made worse by the realization by investors that the authorities had hidden a deteriorating economic situation by slow and incomplete reporting of critical economic data. Being unsure of exactly how bad the economic situation was, they tried to withdraw their assets quickly and in the process caused further damage to the economies in question. It was the realization that data issues lay behind much of the damage done by these international [[Crisis (economic)|financial crises]] that led to the creation of international data quality standards, such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) [[General Data Dissemination System]] (GDDS).&lt;ref&gt;http://dsbb.imf.org International Monetary Fund, Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddshome/ International Monetary Funds, ''General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside a country, the public availability of good quality economic data allows firms and individuals to make their business decisions with confidence that they understand the overall macroeconomic environment. As with international investors, local business people are less likely to overreact to a piece of bad news if they understand the economic context.

Tax data can be a source of economic data. In the United States, the IRS provides tax statistics,&lt;ref&gt;IRS. [https://www.irs.gov – Tax Statistics – Produced by the Statistics of Income Division and Other Areas of the Internal Revenue Service].&lt;/ref&gt; but the data are limited by statutory limitations and confidentiality concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas H. Greenia, 2007. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/08rpstatusegreenia.pdf Statistical Use of U.S. Federal Tax Data]," ''SOI Paper Series''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred''' "'''Fritz'''" '''Klein''' (December 27, 1932{{spaced ndash}}May 24, 2006) was an Austrian-born American psychiatrist and [[Human sexuality|sex researcher]]  who studied bisexuals and their relationships. He was an author and editor, as well as the developer of the [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]], a scale that measures an individual's sexual orientation. Klein believed that sexual orientation changed over the course of a lifetime and that researches underestimated the number of men that had sexual interactions with both sexes.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Pearce, Jeremy (June 4, 2006). [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/us/04klein.html Fritz Klein, 73, Psychiatrist Who Studied Bisexual Culture, Dies.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Klein founded the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] in 1998 which is continuing his work by sponsoring bi-inclusive sex research, educating the general public on sexuality, and promoting bi culture and bi community.

== Life and career ==
Klein was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], to [[Orthodox Jew]]ish parents. He and his family fled to [[New York City|New York]] when he was a child, to escape [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;Associated Press (June 6, 2006). Fritz Klein, 73, noted expert on bisexual life. ''[[Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Yeshiva University]] in 1953, and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1955.  He studied medicine at [[University of Bern]] in [[Switzerland]] for six years, receiving his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1961. He practiced as a [[psychiatrist]] in [[New York City]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Self-identified as [[bisexual]], Klein was surprised at the lack of literature on his sexuality in the [[New York Public Library]] in 1974. That year he founded the [[Bisexual Forum]], the first [[support group]] for the bisexual community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay7KAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7 |title=Bisexual and Gay Husbands: Their Stories, Their Words - Fritz Klein, Thomas R Schwartz - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northeastern.edu/lgbtqa/guide/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009233119/http://www.northeastern.edu/lgbtqa/guide/history.html |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klein Sexual Orientation Grid and other works==

He devised the [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]], a multi-dimensional system for describing complex sexual orientation, similar to the "zero-to-six" scale [[Kinsey scale]] used by [[Alfred Kinsey]], but measuring seven different vectors of sexual orientation and identity (sexual attractions, sexual behavior, sexual fantasies, emotional preference, social preference, lifestyle and self-identification) separately, as they relate person's past, present and ideal future.

Klein published ''[[The Bisexual Option|The Bisexual Option: A Concept of One Hundred Percent Intimacy ]]'' in 1978, based on his research, the world's first real psychological study of bisexuality.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  He also co-authored ''The Male, His Body, His Sex'' in 1978. Klein moved to [[San Diego]] in 1982. He published ''Bisexualities: Theory and Research'' in 1986. In 1998 he founded the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] (AIB), also known as the Bisexual Foundation, to encourage, support and assist research and education about bisexuality. Klein also founded the ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]''.  He remained the Journal's principal editor until his death. He published ''Bisexual and Gay Husbands: Their Stories, Their Words'' in 2001.  Klein published a novel, ''Life, Sex and the Pursuit of Happiness'' in 2005.

In 2006 Klein was diagnosed with [[cancer]], and underwent surgery as a result. Although expected to die from cancer in a matter of months, Fritz Klein instead died at home in [[San Diego]], [[California]], from [[cardiac arrest]] aged 73.&lt;ref name="uktimesobit"&gt;Staff report (16 June 2006).

==Personal life, education and academic career==
Rekers is married with children.&lt;ref name="ChristianityToday"/&gt;

Rekers received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[psychology]] from [[Westmont College]] in 1969. He later received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in psychology from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in 1971 and 1972, respectively.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; As part of his doctoral studies at UCLA, Rekers led an experimental study which used [[Behaviour therapy|behavioral treatment]] to discourage "deviant sex-role behaviors in a male child". The study's published results stated that the "treatment intervention produced a profound change" in the subject, a boy treated from the age of 4 years 11 months.&lt;ref name="behavioral_treatment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rekers |first1=George A. |last2=Lovaas |first2=O.

Murphy's siblings and mother state that the therapy ultimately had lasting damage to the boy and led to him growing up to be a man who grappled constantly with his homosexuality before committing suicide in 2003 at the age of 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/07/ac360-special-report-the-sissy-boy-experiment-begins-tonight/ |title=The 'Sissy Boy' Experiment |date=June 7, 2011 |website=Anderson Cooper 360° |access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekers also holds an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in executive management from [[Southern Wesleyan University]] and [[Th.D.]] from the [[University of South Africa]].&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Professor George |url=http://www.professorgeorge.com/ProfessorGeorge.com/Welcome_to_ProfessorGeorge.com.html |website=ProfessorGeorge.com |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129043736/http://www.professorgeorge.com/ProfessorGeorge.com/Welcome_to_ProfessorGeorge.com.html |archive-date=January 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1972 to 1973, Rekers worked as a research fellow and visiting scholar for the Center for Behavioral Sciences at [[Harvard University]]. After completing his Ph.D., Rekers was an assistant research psychologist and adjunct assistant professor of psychology at UCLA from 1974 to 1977. Rekers joined the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] in 1977 and became the chief psychologist at the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry as well as an associate professor of [[psychiatry]], [[clinical psychology]], and [[pediatrics]]. In 1980, Rekers became head and a tenured professor at the Department of Family and Child Development at [[Kansas State University]]; he left in 1985.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Scholarly work==
Rekers has published numerous journal articles on gender roles among children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=gender+children&amp;num=50&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=%22ga+rekers%22&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=1.&amp;as_sdtp=on&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;hl=en&amp;num=50 |title=Search: GA Rekers |website=[[Google Scholar]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with articles on "cross-gender identified boys" and "child gender disturbances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rekers |first1=GA |year=1975 |title=Stimulus control over sex-typed play in cross-gender identified boys |url= |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=136–148 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(75)90033-8 |pmid=1159373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rekers |first1=George A. |authorlink2=Ole Ivar Lovaas |last2=Lovaas |first2=O.

Rekers refers in his academic work to "the positive therapeutic effects of religious conversion for curing transsexualism" and "the positive therapeutic effect of a church ministry to repentant homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rekers |first1=G. A. |year=1986 |title=Inadequate sex role differentiation in childhood: The family and gender identity disorders |url= |journal=Journal of Family and Culture |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=8–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Butler]] describes this work as "intensely polemical", giving "highly conservative political reasons for strengthening the diagnosis [of "[[Gender identity disorder in children|gender identity disorder]]"] so that the structures that support normalcy can be strengthened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Judith |last=Butler |date=2004 |title=Undoing Gender |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=89-90 |isbn=978-0-41596-922-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekers credits himself for developing a method of assessing gender behavior in children's play in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pip4_B6yXt8C&amp;pg=PA46 |first=George A. |last=Rekers |chapter=Psychosexual Assessment of Gender Identity Disorders |page=46 |editor-last=Prinz |editor-first=Ronald J. |title=Advances in Behavioral Assessment of Children and Families |volume=4 |year=1988 |location=London, UK |publisher=JAI Press |isbn=978-0-89232-894-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the family==
Rekers' views on family life were the focus of a major controversy in [[Florida]] in 2002 when then-governor [[Jeb Bush]] appointed [[Jerry Regier]] to the post of head of the [[Florida Department of Children and Families]] with responsibility for child welfare. Shortly after the announcement of Regier's appointment, it was disclosed that in 1989 the California-based Coalition on Revival had published a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] tract titled ''The Christian World View of the Family'' under the names of Regier and Rekers, which condemned working mothers as being in "bondage" and argued that the government should have no right to place children in protective custody except in cases of extreme abuse or neglect. The tract's authors also "affirm that Biblical spanking may cause temporary and superficial bruises or welts that do not constitute child abuse" and "deny that the Bible countenances any other definition of the family, such as the sharing of a household by homosexual partners, and that society's laws should be modified in any way to broaden the definition of family."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tampatrib.com/MGA1QRR0Z4D.html |last=Jackson |first=Karla|title=Religious Tract Haunts DCF Nominee |newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=August 17, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108093403/http://www.tampatrib.com/MGA1QRR0Z4D.html |archivedate=November 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tract was condemned by Democrats; Bush told the media that Regier "doesn't share those extreme views."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pinkham |first=Paul |title=Protest flares at new DCF secretary |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/081702/met_10206035.html |newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=August 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regier survived the controversy and served as DCF head from 2002 to the end of Jeb Bush's term in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/16/nation/na-newguy16 |title=Ex-Aide of Elder Bush to Head Florida's Child Welfare Agency |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 16, 2002 |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekers is a practicing [[Southern Baptist]], and credits the work of [[C.S. Lewis]], particularly his writings on gender relations, with influencing his religious and social views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Braun |first2=George Alan |last2=Rekers |date=1981 |title=The Christian in an age of sexual eclipse |location=Wheaton, Illinois |publisher=[[Tyndale House]] |isbn=978-0-84230-256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on homosexuality==
Rekers has attracted attention for his views on homosexuality, which have been promoted in a number of forums and court cases. He asserts that homosexuality is a "gender disturbance" that can be corrected through 18 to 22 months of weekly therapy during childhood and adolescence. Mark Pietrzyk, of the gay group the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], has stated that Rekers' method uses [[aversion therapy]] – a practice opposed by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) – that punishes "nonconforming" behavior such as swaggering in girls or limp wrists in boys and rewards "conforming" behavior such as girls playing with dolls and boys playing basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lochhead |first=Caroline |title=Conservatives Brand Homosexuality a 'Tragic Affliction' |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 20, 1997 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/06/20/MN23239.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authorities working in the relevant fields reject Reker's basic premise utterly; a publication from the APA states "The idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations."&lt;ref name="justthefacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html |title=Just the facts about sexual orientation and youth: A primer for principals, educators, and school personnel |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |year=2008 |website=[[American Psychological Association]] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330104903/http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.pdf |archive-date=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} (Printing and distribution of that publication was with the support of the [[American Counseling Association]], the Interfaith Alliance, and the [[National Education Association]].&lt;ref name="justthefacts"/&gt;{{rp|2}})
According to Rekers himself, he spends much of his time with boys whose peers regard them as "sissy" and "effeminate" with the goal of reversing those traits and "help[ing] these children to become better adapted to themselves and to their environment."&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The APA's opposition to his methods led to him resigning from the organization.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Thompson |first=Tracy |title=Scouting and New Terrain |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 2, 1998 |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/32524278.html?FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+2%2C+1998&amp;author=Tracy+Thompson&amp;desc=SCOUTING+AND+NEW+TERRAIN%3B+The+Boy+Scouts+say+they+must+exclude+gay+men.+But+two+banned+Eagle+Scouts+are+fighting+for+their+right+to+belong%2C+in+a+case+that+raises+the+question%2C+Can+a+gay+man+be+a+moral+authority+figure+for+young+boys%3F |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121217174128/https://secure.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/32524278.html?FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+2,+1998&amp;author=Tracy+Thompson&amp;desc=SCOUTING+AND+NEW+TERRAIN;+The+Boy+Scouts+say+they+must+exclude+gay+men.+But+two+banned+Eagle+Scouts+are+fighting+for+their+right+to+belong,+in+a+case+that+raises+the+question,+Can+a+gay+man+be+a+moral+authority+figure+for+young+boys%3F |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 17, 2012 |format=paid archive}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Rekers has appeared in court in several cases as an expert witness testifying on matters concerning homosexuality. His testimony has been strongly criticized by a number of parties including trial judges; the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has asserted that his personal beliefs regarding homosexuality interfere with his ability to give an unbiased professional opinion on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) topics, including [[LGBT adoption in the United States|gay adoption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Currah |first1=Paisley |last2=Juang |first2=Richard M. |last3=Minter |first3=Shannon |title=Transgender Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwOKayHVwcC |date=2006 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-4312-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal experts have discussed whether his involvement with a male prostitute in 2010 could render his testimony unreliable, possibly affecting the outcome of pending cases in Florida and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/us/19rekers.html |title=Scandal Stirs Legal Questions in Anti-Gay Cases |last=Schwartz |first=John |date=May 19, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boy Scouts of America hearing, 1998===
Rekers testified before the Washington, D.C. Human Rights Commission on behalf of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] in 1998 in defense of the group's policy on excluding homosexuals, arguing that it was justified because admission of homosexuals "would legitimize the value of homosexual behavior in the eyes of many of the Boy Scouts ... There would be more homosexual conduct or behavior by the boys in such troops."&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He has acknowledged that his views are heavily influenced by religious concerns; as a member of the [[Southern Baptists]]&lt;!--Please do not delete; this is in the original 1998 Washington Post source--&gt;, he believes that the city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was destroyed by God as a punishment for allowing homosexuality and that active homosexuals face "eternal separation from God", i.e., perpetuity in hell.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

===Arkansas gay adoption case, 2004===
Rekers was an expert witness in a 2004 case involving gay adoption in Arkansas, which had banned LGBT people from adopting in 1999. He argued that "it would be in the best interest of foster children to be placed in a heterosexual home" because the majority of people in the country disapproved of homosexual behaviour, putting further stress on children who were already likely to suffer from psychological disorders. According to Rekers, "That disapproval filters down to children [who] will express disapproval in more cruel, insensitive ways" toward a child being parented by a gay person. In cross-examination, Rekers acknowledged that he believed that homosexuality is sinful and that the Bible is the infallible word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Brooks|first=Jim |title=Gays in home taxing for kids, court hears |url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=ArDemocrat/2004/10/06&amp;ID=Ar01503 |newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=October 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His testimony was rebutted by Dr. Michael Lamb, a psychiatrist, who stated that there was no scientific evidence for the assertion that homosexuals were worse parents than heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Brooks |first=Jim |title=Ban on foster children in residences with gays unlawful, judge finds |url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=ArDemocrat/2004/12/30&amp;ID=Ar00104 |newspaper=The Arkansas Democrat Gazette |date=December 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge, [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] Circuit Court judge Timothy Fox, ruled against the state of Arkansas in December 2004. He was strongly critical of Rekers' testimony, describing it as "extremely suspect" and said that Rekers "was there primarily to promote his own personal ideology." Rekers responded by denouncing the trial as "utterly corrupt."&lt;ref name="aclu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/howard-v-arkansas-decision |title=Howard v.

Following the case, Rekers billed the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services a sum of $165,000 for his testimony, an amount that far exceeded what the state had anticipated. He later increased the bill to $200,000 with the addition of late fees and other charges for preparing paperwork. The unpaid bill led to two years of legal wrangling that was finally settled out of court with a $60,000 payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tubbs |first=Charlotte |title=Agency, witness in gay foster parent case in pay battle |url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=ArDemocrat/2006/12/30&amp;ID=Ar01501 |newspaper=The Arkansas Democrat Gazette |date=December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida gay adoption case, 2008===

{{Main|In re: Gill}}

In 2008, Rekers was an expert witness in ''[[In re: Gill]]'', a case defending Florida's gay adoption ban. He presented testimony asserting that homosexuals are more likely to suffer from depression, substance abuse, and emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Florida Judge Rules Against Gay Adoption Ban |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[All Things Considered]] |date=November 25, 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97478955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing what he called "God's moral laws," he asserted that individual homosexuals are "manipulated by leaders of the homosexual revolt" to the detriment of those suffering this "sexual perversion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Blumner |first=Robyn E. |authorlink=Robyn Blumner |title=Making a loving home for two brothers |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/article918200.ece |newspaper=[[St Petersburg Times]] |date=November 30, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607060637/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/article918200.ece |archive-date=June 7, 2011 |dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserted that [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]] would make unsuitable foster parents, asserting that they suffered from a high risk of alcohol abuse and psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name="Burnside"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Burnside |first=Jeff |title=AG Paid $60,000 to Anti-Gay Activist Who Hired Male Prostitute |url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local-beat/McCollum-paid-60900-to-anti-gay-activist-who-hired-male-prostitute-93042769.html |website=NBC Miami |date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy Lederman ruled against the state. In her decision, she said "Dr. Rekers' testimony was far from a neutral and unbiased recitation of the relevant scientific evidence. Dr. Rekers' beliefs are motivated by his strong ideological and theological convictions that are not consistent with the science. Based on his testimony and demeanor at trial, the court cannot consider his testimony to be credible nor worthy of forming the basis of public policy."&lt;ref name="aclu"/&gt; It later emerged that Rekers had been paid nearly $120,000 for his testimony on behalf of the state, which had been solicited specifically by [[Florida Attorney General]] [[Bill McCollum]]. The attorney general wrote in 2007: "Our attorneys handling this case have searched long and hard for other expert witnesses with comparable expertise to Dr. Rekers and have been unable to identify any who would be available for this case." However, his choice of witness was criticized by [[Nadine Smith]] of the gay-rights organization Equality Florida: "Rekers is part of a small cadre of bogus pseudo scientists that charge these exorbitant fees to peddle information they know has been discredited time and time again. And people like McCollum will pay top dollar for it. There's a reason why he can't find credible sources. Because credible people don't believe this ban should exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rothaus |first=Steve |title=Bill McCullom requested hiring of antigay psychologist now in Rentboy scandal |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/05/11/1623961/bill-mccullom-requested-hiring.html |date=May 11, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third District Court of Appeal State of Florida, stated in the decision: "Dr. Cochran (Professor of Epidemiology and Statistics at the University of California in Los Angeles) also testified about errors in scientific methodology and reporting in Dr. Rekers' study, stating that Dr. Rekers had failed to present an objective review of the evidence on those subjects. Cochran concluded that Dr. Rekers' work did not meet established standards in the field. Another expert, Dr. Peplau (Professor of Psychology at the University of California in Los Angeles), testified that Dr. Rekers had omitted in his review of the scientific literature “other published, widely cited studies on the stability of actual relationships over time.”&lt;ref name=appealdecision&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/Opinions/3D08-3044.pdf |title=Third District Court of Appeal State of Florida, July Term, A.D. 2010 Florida Department of Children and Families, Appellant, vs. In re: Matter of Adoption of X.X.G. and N.R.G., Appellees. |website=Florida Third District Court of Appeal |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational affiliations==

===Family Research Council===
In 1983 Rekers was on the founding board of the [[Family Research Council]], a non-profit Christian [[lobbying]] organization, along with [[James Dobson]] and [[Armand Nicholi|Armand Nicholi Jr]], but the organization reported in 2010 he has not been associated with them for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WU10E03 |title=FRC Statement on Dr. George Rekers |website=[[Family Research Council]] |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508064223/http://www.frc.org/newsroom/frc-statement-on-dr-george-rekers |archive-date=May 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NARTH===

Until May 11, 2010, Rekers was listed as an advisor and officer with the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]];&lt;ref name="narthadvisors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="narthofficers"/&gt; {{As of|2010|6|4|lc=on|df=US}},&lt;ref name="narthadvisors"/&gt; these listings have been removed from the NARTH website. NARTH is an association which promotes the acceptance of [[conversion therapy]] intended to change homosexuals into heterosexuals, contrary to the advice of mainstream professional associations such as the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[American Psychological Association]].  On May 11, 2010, NARTH announced that Rekers had resigned from its board.&lt;ref name="NARTHcomment"/&gt;

===FactsAboutYouth.com===
FactsAboutYouth.com is a website designed to give educators information for teaching youth about sexual orientation. Rekers is listed by name as being a director in the development of the resource through a subcommittee of the [[American College of Pediatricians]] (not to be confused with the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]). The [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]], an organization for which Rekers was an officer, is also listed as managing the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://factsaboutyouth.com/about-us/ |title=About Us |date= |work=FactsAboutYouth.com |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributor for the organization [[Truth Wins Out]] characterized this website as a "phony medical group attempting to peddle anti-gay propaganda to schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Phony Medical Group Attempting to Peddle Anti-Gay Propaganda to Schools |first=Alvin |last=McEwen |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alvin-mcewen/phony-medical-group-attem_b_527772.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Rent boy" allegations==
The ''[[Miami New Times]]'' reported on May 4, 2010, that three weeks previously, Rekers had been photographed at [[Miami International Airport]] with a twenty-year-old "[[rent boy]]" who was using the [[pseudonym]] "Lucien" (later identified as Jo-Vanni Roman). Roman was available for hire through the [[Rentboy.com]] website. Rekers acknowledged hiring Roman for the 10-day European vacation as a "travel assistant" and denies any impropriety. He said that Roman was there to help carry his luggage since he had surgery recently and was unable to carry it himself, although the photograph clearly showed Rekers lifting his own luggage.&lt;ref name="RekersRentBoy"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Christian right leader George Rekers takes vacation with 'rent boy' |first1=Penn |last1=Bullock |first2=Brandon K. |last2=Thorp |newspaper=[[Miami New Times]] |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-05-06/news/christian-right-leader-george-rekers-takes-vacation-with-rent-boy/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/instant-tea/2010/05/04/anti-gay-activist-george-reker-outed-after-hiring-male-escort-from-rentboy-com |title=Anti-gay activist George Rekers outed after hiring male escort from RentBoy.com |date=May 4, 2010 |website=[[Dallas Voice]] |access-date=May 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508070407/http://www.dallasvoice.com/instant-tea/2010/05/04/anti-gay-activist-george-reker-outed-after-hiring-male-escort-from-rentboy-com/ |archive-date=May 8, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rekers was quoted as commenting, "If you talk with my travel assistant ... you will find I spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning [[homosexuality|homosexual]] [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], and I shared the [[Gospel of Jesus Christ]] with him in great detail."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece |title=Baptist minister 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |last=Whittell |first=Giles |authorlink=Giles Whittell |date=May 5, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |access-date=26 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506031447/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece |archive-date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was covered by media outlets and TV shows worldwide.&lt;ref name=Times /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/05/05/1615060/report-anti-gay-leader-took-trip.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506035708/http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/05/05/1615060/report-anti-gay-leader-took-trip.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 6, 2010 |title=Report: Anti-gay leader took trip with prostitute |agency=Associated Press |date=May 5, 2010 |newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8665812.stm |title=Baptist minister denies rentboy claim |date=May 6, 2010 |website=BBC News |access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-rent-boy-and-me-pastor-tells-all-but-no-kiss-1965638.html |title=The rent boy and me: pastor tells all (but no kiss) |first=Guy |last=Adams |date=May 7, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1273778/Anti-gay-activist-George-Rekers-took-10-day-holiday-Rentboy-male-prostitute.html |title=U.S. anti-gay activist 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |date=May 7, 2010 |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/anti-gay-preacher-george-rekers-took-rentboy-on-holiday-as-an-aide/story-e6frg6so-1225863027782 |title=Anti-Gay Preacher George Rekers Took Rentboy on Holiday |date=May 6, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his resignation from NARTH he said "I am not gay and never have been."&lt;ref name="ChristianityToday" /&gt; The scandal became popular fodder for media commentators and comics.&lt;ref name=FrankRich&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/opinion/16rich.html |title=Opinion - A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy |first=Frank |last=Rich |date=May 15, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Rich]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Thanks to Rekers's clownish public exposure, we now know that his professional judgments are windows into his cracked psyche, not gay people's. But...his excursions into public policy have had real and damaging consequences on a large swath of Americans."&lt;ref name=FrankRich/&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'s'' June 7, 2010 issue's Back Story listed Rekers, among others, as a prominent conservative activist who has a record of supporting anti-gay legislation and was later caught in a gay [[sex scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', June 7, 2010, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Greenflag logo.png|thumb|Logo of the Green Flag award scheme]]

The '''Green Flag Award''' is the benchmark national standard for publicly accessible parks and green spaces in the United Kingdom. The scheme was set up in 1996 to recognise and reward green spaces in [[England and Wales]] that met the laid down high standards. 

It is also seen as a way of encouraging others to achieve the same high environmental standards, creating a benchmark of excellence in recreational green areas. Any free to enter public park or green space is eligible to apply for an Award. Privately owned but publicly accessible parks have received awards such as [[Chavasse Park]] (Liverpool One) and [[Rutland Water]] (Anglian Water services Ltd). 

The scheme is owned by the government through the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]], though it is managed by other agents under contract. A pilot scheme was started in 2007, in [[Scotland]], and three parks were given awards that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenflagaward.org.uk/award/default.asp?n=&amp;sectionId=27&amp;parentId=241&amp;pageId=241 |title=Green Flag award scheme |accessdate=2007-10-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814030752/http://www.greenflagaward.org.uk/award/default.asp?n=&amp;sectionId=27&amp;parentId=241&amp;pageId=241 |archivedate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] schools may be awarded the Green Flag in recognition of steps taken towards making the school increasingly [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]]. 

Meanwhile, the award goes to other countries too for example to Germany ([[Erholungspark Marzahn]] and others).

Parks and green spaces are judged in April and May each year and the winners are announced in July. Parks must apply each year to keep their Green Flag Award, and winning sites are eligible to fly a Green Flag in the park for a year. Sites for a Green Flag Award are judged against eight key criteria:&lt;ref name="Civic Trust Awards Website"&gt;[http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/Judges/JudgingCriteria/Default.aspx Judging Criteria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* A welcoming place
* Healthy, safe and secure
* Clean and well maintained
* Sustainability
* Conservation and heritage
* Community involvement
* Marketing
* Management

== Green Pennant Award ==
[[File:Boscombe Chine Gardens, Green Flag Award - geograph.org.uk - 619592.jpg|thumb|right|The Green Flag Award for [[Boscombe]] Chine Gardens]]
The Green Flag Award itself is for public-run open spaces, but the same scheme runs an award for community/charity-run public spaces, such as [[Millennium Green]]s and [[Doorstep Greens]] called the Green Pennant Award. This scheme, started in 2002, has adapted the criteria for voluntary organisations.  

Sites for a Green Pennant Award are judged against eight key criteria:&lt;ref name="Civic Trust Awards Website"/&gt;

* A welcoming place
* Healthy, safe and secure
* Well maintained and clean
* Environmental sustainability
* Biodiversity and heritage
* Community involvement
* Achievement

== Green Heritage Site Accreditation ==
Green Flag Award winning sites, which are over thirty years old, may also apply for Green Heritage Site Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060715191102/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.00100200800k00a006 English Heritage Website - Green Heritage Sites Microsite]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green Flag and social housing ==
Green Flag is one of the steering group partners of [[Neighbourhoods Green]], a partnership initiative which works with social landlords and housing associations to highlight the importance of, and raise the overall quality of design and management for, open and green space in social housing. Between 2012 and 2017 both parties will be working to expand Green Flag Award into the social housing sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/about/gfa Green Flag and Neighbourhoods Green], ''Neighbourhoods Green Website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and management ==
The scheme was originally run by volunteers from its founding in the 1990s. It was then sponsored by the government and run by the [[Civic Voice|Civic Trust]], till the latter went into administration in 2009. Since then, it has been managed by a consortium of [[Keep Britain Tidy]], the [[British Trust for Conservation Volunteers]], and the charity Greenspace. Judges continue to be unpaid volunteers with experience and competence in the management of parks.

'''''How the World Was One: Beyond the Global Village''''' is [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]]'s history and survey of the [[communication]]s revolution, published in 1992.  The title includes an intentional pun; in English ''How the World Was Won'' would sound exactly the same. This work is based on an earlier work by Clarke entitled ''Voice Across the Sea'', published in 1958.

'''The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth''' is an international scientist consensus document discussing and demanding a halt of the [[population expansion]]. This was the first worldwide joint statement of [[Academy of sciences|academies of sciences]], and their cooperative [[InterAcademy Panel on International Issues]]. It was signed by 58 member academies and began as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let 1994 be remembered as the year when the people of the world decided to act together for the benefit of future generations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
Between October 24 and October 27, 1993, an international "scientist's top summit" was held in [[New Delhi]], [[India]], with representatives from [[academy of sciences|academies of sciences]] from all over the world. This grew out of two previous meetings, one joint meeting by the British [[Royal Society]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], and one international meeting organised by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. The scientists discussed the environmental and social welfare problems for the world population, and found them closely linked to the [[population expansion]].

In the year 1950,  were approximately 2.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (2,500 million) humans alive in this world. By 1960, the number had reached 3 billion, and by 1975 was at 4 billion. The 5 billion mark was reached around 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp UN statistics and interpolation of population growth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012190153/http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp |date=2009-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, at the New Delhi meeting, academics estimated the population to be 5.5 billion. For some time, world food production had been able to roughly match population growth, meaning that [[starvation]] was a regional and distributional problem, rather than one based on a total shortage of food. The scientists noted that increased food production on land and on sea in the previous decade was less than the population increase over the same period. Moreover, by increased food production and otherwise, the population growth was contributing to a [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], [[deforestation]] and loss of [[topsoil]], and shortages of [[water]] and fuel. The academics noted that the complex relationships between population size and various environmental effects were not fully understood, but that "there is no doubt that the threat to the ecosystem is linked to population size and resource use". They were aware of the problems with increasing [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse]] emissions and other environmental threats, and found these linked to the population growth.

The scientists decided to adopt a resolution on the problems and on the means to solve them, and that this resolution should be put to vote by the respective national academies of science. In 1993, they also established the [[InterAcademy Panel]], in order to coordinate this and future similar consensus resolutions on important global warming

== Statement summary ==
The academies note that "the world is undergoing an unprecedented population expansion", and that it is necessary to stop it. In fact, we must reach "zero population growth within the lifetime of our children", if we are to achieve the "common goal", which was defined as "the improvement of the quality of life for all, both now and succeeding generations", including "social, economic and personal well-being while preserving fundamental human rights and the ability to live harmoniously in a protected environment".

Moreover, these goals are achievable, but in order to achieve them it is not sufficient to halt the population expansion. At the same time, a number of actions need to be taken, in order to improve health and welfare, and lessen the negative [[human impact on the environment]]. Finally, more research in these areas is needed.

The proposed actions are codified in 21 points. Those directly dealing with halting the population growth include furthering equal opportunities for women, easy access to cheap and safe contraceptives, family planning programmes, broad primary health care and education, and increased research on cultural, religious, and other factors, which "affect reproductive behavior". In accordance with the respect for fundamental human rights, the measures do not include any kind of coercion, but enabling and encouragement for choosing to limit the number of children in a family.

Other points include governmental policies recognizing longer-term environmental responsibilities; assistance from the industrialised to the developing world for environmental problems; pricing and taxing that take environmental cost into account, and thus influence consumer behaviour, and transitions to less energy consumptive economies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15420">The so-called '''Iranian sex tape scandal''' involves the public outcry and judicial proceedings against [[Zahra Amir Ebrahimi]], an actress who appeared in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Nargess (TV series)|Nargess]]'', and an associate producer, accused of appearing together in an explicit sex tape, allegedly filmed for private consumption with a [[camcorder]], a serious crime under [[Law of Iran|Iranian law]].&lt;ref&gt;May 2007. Sex, Iranian Style. [[Playboy]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The actress denies that the tape is of her, while the film producer reportedly has claimed that it is him.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;Bednarz, D.  (2006.)

The case served as a catalyst to prompt the lower house of the [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament of Iran]] to pass a bill making the production of sexually explicit media, even for private consumption, an offense [[Capital punishment in Iran|punishable by death]].&lt;ref name="porndeath"/&gt;

==The tape==
The tape graphically depicts twenty minutes of sex between a woman and a man in a small room with a narrow bed.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;  The man who admitted to his role in the tape is an assistant film producer who was engaged to an [[Iran]]ian [[soap opera]] actress at the time, whom he claimed is the woman in the tape.  Neither of the suspects were named by the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]], the state-run news agency in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;Creasy, R. (2006).

The tape was reportedly made in 2004, although it only came to prominence in early 2006.  It has seen wide distribution on [[DVD]] and over the [[internet]] in Iran.  &lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;Reuters.  (2006.)

==Response==
The tape and the publicity surrounding it caused a massive scandal in Iran, such that Iran's fundamentalist clerics have labeled it a "national shame".&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;  [[Tehran]]'s hardline chief prosecutor [[Saeed Mortazavi]] has even intervened, ordering a special investigation.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;  Iranian politician [[Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi]] also became involved, demanding Ebrahimi (but not Mr. X) be [[stoning|stoned to death]].&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Ebrahimi was interrogated at length by the Iranian authorities,&lt;ref name="sexiniran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="narges"/&gt; but was never charged with any crime.&lt;ref name="taitguardian"&gt;Tait, R. (2006).  [https://www.theguardian.com/iran/story/0,,1954553,00.html "Iranian actor in sex video scandal says ex-fiance faked footage"] ''The Guardian UK''.  Retrieved November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  While ''Narges'' was on hiatus while the scandal broke, producers of two films in which Ebrahimi starred were advised by Iranian authorities not to release the films while the investigation was ongoing.&lt;ref name="sexiniran"/&gt;  As of 2010, these films still had not been released. One of them, ''Journey to Hidalou'' was reviewed for compliance with Islamic law by [[Javad Shamaqdari]], Iran's deputy culture minister for film.  He said that the film was a good one, but could not be released with Ebrahimi in it, and suggested that her scenes be re-shot with a different actress. The film's director, Mojataba Raei, has reportedly refused to re-shoot Ebrahimi's scenes.&lt;ref name="regimedecides"/&gt; Shamaqdari suggested it would take a religious [[fatwa]] to approve Ebrahimi's films for release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Tehran Times Art Desk  | title = Iran may need fatwa to lift ban on "Journey to Hidalou"  | newspaper = [[Tehran Times]]  | publisher =   | date = 2010-02-01  | url = http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=213496  | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | last = [[Mehr News Agency]]  | title = Iranian official's remarks on hijab outrage top cleric  | newspaper = Payvand  | publisher =   | date = 2010-02-05  | url = http://www.payvand.com/news/10/feb/1047.html  | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time [[Zahra Amir Ebrahimi|Ebrahimi]] was rumored to have attempted [[suicide]] because of all the negative media attention after her police [[interrogation]].  The worry that something may have happened to her grew worse when she was forbidden from speaking in public by the Iranian authorities.&lt;ref name="sexiniran"/&gt;  To quell the rumor, she ultimately made a statement to the [http://www.ilna.ir ILNA] news agency: "I just want to tell my country’s people that I am alive.  I should think of Iranian women’s strength and defend the respect of the girls and women of my nation."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Tait, R.  (2006).  [https://www.theguardian.com/iran/story/0,,1941720,00.html "Iranian soap star faces lashing after sex tape made public"].  ''The Guardian UK.''  Retrieved November 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even months and years after the scandal first broke, the case became a cultural touchstone in Iran, much in the same way the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]] had been in the United States, acting as a lightning rod for people to talk about changing attitudes toward sexuality and state authority in private life.&lt;ref name="sexiniran"/&gt;  While the response of the conservative government was one of outrage, many Iranians viewed the scandal coolly, and were reluctant to place blame on the woman in the tape.&lt;ref name="narges"/&gt;

Ebrahimi flatly denies that she is the woman in the tape.  In an interview with the [[The Guardian|Guardian UK]], she said, "I watched the film after I heard about the fuss from colleagues and the girl in it is not me.  I admit there are some similarities to the character I played in ''Narges''. It is possible to use studio make-up to have a person look like me. I have some knowledge of montage techniques and I know you can create a new face by distorting the features of another person."&lt;ref name="taitguardian"/&gt;

==Prosecution==
In December 2006, eight people were arrested as part of the official investigation.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; The man in the tape, "Mr. X", who was believed to have been the one to disseminate it to the public, albeit accidentally, initially fled the country, taking up residence in [[Armenia]].  After Iranian investigators requested he be arrested,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; the man was apprehended and [[extradition|extradited]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="taitguardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="porndeath"/&gt; He was reported to have claimed that he and the woman in the film were [[Nikah Mut‘ah|temporarily married]] at the time.  Under the precepts of [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]], sex during temporary marriage is permitted. Nevertheless, "Mr. X" was tried and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="regimedecides"/&gt; The legal fate of the others arrested in this investigation, whether they were eventually exonerated or not, went unreported in the news media.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;

While Ebrahimi was banned from appearing in films or on television, no formal charges were ever filed against her.  An Iranian judiciary official was quoted as saying: "It depends on finding out whether she had a deliberate role in the case ... If so, it is going to be dealt with as a case of corruption and prostitution."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;  Some legal experts believed Ebrahimi’s denial would have been enough to avoid a guilty verdict had she been tried.  Under Iranian law, film and video footage must be supported by additional evidence or a confession.&lt;ref name="taitguardian"/&gt;  Ebrahimi has stated that she fears her career in the Iranian entertainment industry may be over.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; If the actress (or another woman) were to have been charged and convicted, the punishment could have been severe.  A woman found guilty of having sex outside marriage can face a penalty of up to 99 [[flagellation|lashes]] with a leather strap.&lt;ref name="sexiniran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taitguardian"/&gt;  

While the west in the 21st century has been fairly inundated with such news, this was widely acknowledged by western news sources to have been the first [[Celebrity sex tape|celebrity sex tape scandal]] in Iran.&lt;ref name="taitguardian"/&gt;  Inside Iran, however, people claim that there have been others before this, but that this is the first one that was publicly acknowledged, and the first time the legal authorities decided to do something about it.&lt;ref name="narges"/&gt;

==Subsequent legislation==
In June 2007, the [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament of Iran]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a bill that could make the production of and participation in pornographic media an offense [[capital punishment|punishable by death]].  To become law, the bill still required the approval of Iran's [[Guardian Council]].  In 2009, news outlets began reporting the arrest of suspects under this law, so presumably it has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Tait  | first = Robert  | title = Iranian police arrest pornographic film actors  | work =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Guardian.co.uk]]  | date = 2009-03-09  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/04/iran-pornographic-films-arrests  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill's drafting is widely believed to be a direct response to this sex tape scandal.&lt;ref name="porndeath"&gt;The Associated Press.

[[File:MPP-Iraaf.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan people|Afghan]] man of Irano-Afghan type, from [[Augustus Henry Keane]]'s ''Man, Past and Present'' (1899).]]
The '''Irano-Afghan race''' (also known as the '''Iranid race''') is an obsolete term for a physical type most common among populations native to the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Garn, ''Human races'', Thomas, 1971, 3rd ed., University of Michigan, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fx6pzonsCIC&amp;pg=PA132 Race and Racism: An Introduction] [https://www.amazon.com/Race-Racism-Introduction-Carolyn-Fluehr-Lobban/dp/0759107955# (see also)] by Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Pages 127–133, Publication Date: December 8, 2005, {{ISBN|0759107955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/racesofeurope.htm The Races of Europe] by Carleton S. Coon&lt;/ref&gt; The Irano-Afghan type was classified as belonging to the greater [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] race. It was variously associated with either the [[Nordic race|Nordic]] subtype or the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] subtype, depending on the authority consulted.

==Physiognomy==
[[Carleton S. Coon]] in his ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]'' classifies the ''Indo-Afghans'' and ''Irano-Afghans'' as Nordic, describing them as being long-faced, high-headed and leptorrhine (having long and narrow noses). [[Bertil Lundman]] by contrast postulates an "Iranid" subtype of his "Eastern Mediterranean" race. [[Earnest Hooton]] in 1946 describes the "Iranian Plateau type" as distinct from the [[Atlanto-Mediterranean]] one:
{{quote|particularly in its long, high-bridged, and boldly jutting nasal promontory. It has the same huge dolichocephalic head and massive, usually long face. The great nose may be either straight or convex, more often the latter.&lt;ref name="hooton1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dienekes.awardspace.com/texts/hootonmed/ |title=Earnest Hooton on the Mediterranean Subrace (from E. A. Hooton, Up from the Ape, 1946) |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Renato Biasutti the type was defined by:
{{quote|Brunet-white color, very dark hair and eyes, abundant pilosity; medium stature (165), slim body; very long (74) and high head with prominent occiput; long face; large and high nose with root at the level of the forehead, straight or convex spine, strongly curved nostrils (64); full lips, robust chin.&lt;ref name="biasutti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dienekes.110mb.com/texts/biasutticaucasoid/ |last=Biasutti |first=Renato |title=Renato Biasutti on Caucasoid Subraces: from Le Razze e i popoli della terra |pages=409–410 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511091339/http://dienekes.110mb.com/texts/biasutticaucasoid/ |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Lawrence Angel]] following Coon in 1971 discusses a "Nordic-Iranian type" in the following terms:
{{quote|D1 lies between Anglo-Saxon and Keltic area norms, and D2 is the earlier pre-Bronze Age Corded form which Coon identifies. Type D3, lighter and more hawk-nosed, is transitional to the Mediterranean type B4 and to type D4 (Iranian), which is the Proto-Iranian of Vallois, Irano-Afghan of others, and Proto-Nordic of Krogman, and which is more linear and more rugged than D3 and has a more tilted chewing plane, more [[aquiline nose|nasal convexity]], and deeper occiput. Type D5 approximates Coon's Danubian-Halstatt and successor Central European forms.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lawrence Angel, ''The people of Lerna; analysis of a prehistoric Aegean population'', Princeton, N.J., American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1971, pp. 36–38 [http://dienekes.awardspace.com/texts/angeltypes/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
Karlan had two sons named Kodi and Kaki, then Kodi had two sons named (Dilzak) [[Dilazak]] and (Shamak Khan) [[Orakzai]] from whom the first branch of  Karlani tribes descend.&lt;ref name="asarjan"/&gt;
==Tribes==
About the Karlani tribes, after explaining family trees of the other tribes' origins, Sir [[Olaf Caroe]] writes in his acclaimed book ''The Pathans'':
"And thus end the genealogies of the three sons of [[Qais]].
But where are such famous tribes as the [[Afridis]], [[Khattaks]], [[Orakzais]].
Where are the Bangash; above all where are the [[Wazirs]] and [[Mahsuds]]. What of the Khaibar, and [[Waziristan]], and the hills of Kohat."
Sir Olaf was greatly impressed by [[Pashtun culture]] during his tenure with the British government in [[British India]]. But he was especially intrigued by the Karlani tribes. These were the tribes that were not subjected to rule by foreigners, these are the ones that refer to themselves by tribe rather than by race.
For example "Mu Bangash, Asi Tanoli, Mung Afridi, Mizh Wazir, Mizh Mahsud (We Bangash, We Tanoli, We Afridi, We Wazir/Mahsud) etc. Instead of " Mung Pukhtana' (We Pathans). They speak the harder dialect of Pashto. (Although the dialects differ by region even among themselves). They predominantly inhabit the hills and are occasionally called hill tribes.
And some speak other regional languages like more than 50% Tanolis speak hindko.

The '''Kot Diji Fort''' ({{Lang-ur|{{nq|کوٹ ڈیجی قلعہ}}}}; {{Lang-sd|ڪوٽ ڏيجي جو قلعو}};''Fort of the Daughter''), formally known as '''Fort Ahmadabad''', is a 19th century Talpur-era fort located in the town of [[Kot Diji]] in [[Khairpur District]], [[Pakistan]] about 25 miles east of the [[Indus River]] at the edge of the [[Thar Desert]]. The fort sits above a pre-[[Harappan Civilization]] archaeological site dating to 2500 to 2800 [[Before common era|B.C.E.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rengel|first1=Marian|title=Pakistan: A Primary Source Cultural Guide|date=2004|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9780823940011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Kot Diji Fort was built by Mir Sohrab Khan [[Talpur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Discovering Sindh|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/826576/discovering-sindh/|accessdate=5 March 2017|agency=Tribune|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1785 and 1795.&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Shameen|title=Kot Diji Fort: A symbol of the Talpur dynasty|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1177325|accessdate=5 March 2017|agency=Dawn|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site sits on a hill at the southern end of the Rohri Hills, and sits above a prehistoric mound of the same name, where remains of a pre-[[Harappan civilization]] have been found.&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Mukhtar|title=Ancient Pakistan - an Archaeological History|date=2014|publisher=Amazon|isbn=9781495966439|pages=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The fort sits atop a 110 foot tall high hill that rises above the city of [[Kot Diji]].&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; The fort's 30 foot tall walls encircle the uppermost portion of the fort,&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; resulting a narrow-width fortress with perimeter of 1.8 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baig|first1=Saima|title=A walk on Kot Diji Fort|url=http://nation.com.pk/blogs/20-Feb-2017/a-walk-on-kot-diji-fort|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort contains three strategically placed towers that are each 50 feet tall.&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; The fort contains several sites for cannon placement, and contains numerous inner passages for protection.&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; The fort also contains a water reservoir, munition storage, prison, courtroom, numerous cells for security personnel, and a small regal residence.&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt;

==Conservation==
[[Government of Pakistan]] has declared it a protected heritage site in Pakistan, though it has been noted that portions of the fort are under control of powerful local families.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/03/12/talpur-era-kot-diji-fort-now-home-to-encroachers/, Kot Diji Fort on Pakistan Today newspaper, Published 12 March 2012, Retrieved 8 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lingayen-Lucena corridor''' is the part of [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]], between [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] (in [[Pangasinan]]) to [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]], comprising the province of Pangasinan, and the regions of [[Central Luzon]], [[Metro Manila]] and [[CALABARZON]], where national elections are claimed to be won. The corridor comprises about 40% of the vote.

==About==
Between Lingayen in the north and Lucena in the southern part of [[Luzon]] is the part of the Philippines that is described as the most urbanized. This is where the high concentration of television and radio makes advertising in those mediums to be critical in winning votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/09/13/09/50-prefer-noynoy-vote-rich-luzon-areas-sws-survey |title=50% prefer Noynoy in vote-rich Luzon areas: SWS survey |first=Ricky |last=Carandang |authorlink=Ricky Carandang |work=abs-cbnNEWS.com |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aside from being easily reached by candidates either via television or radio, it also has the highest number of internet connections, is the primary market of national dailies, and is the wealthiest area in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M0xaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ESgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2395%2C15040418 |title= Battle for the corridor |first=Marlen V. |last=Ronquillo |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=2007-04-08 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor, which contains up to 40% of voters in the country, has been used as a sample in [[opinion poll]]s to gauge how candidates are faring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/news/top-news/8427-bam-aquino-lone-lp-in-top-12-binay-no-5 |title=Bam Aquino lone LP in Top 12; Binay No. 5 |work=[[Business Mirror]] |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131154313/http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/news/top-news/8427-bam-aquino-lone-lp-in-top-12-binay-no-5 |archivedate=2013-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voters in the corridor, which has been described as the so-called "market vote", was described in 2003 by Antonio Gatmaitan, political strategist for [[Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.]]'s failed [[Philippine presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential bid]], as the place where anyone can win, and if one can win there, he can win nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.newsbreak-knowledge.ph/2003/06/23/the-reluctant-bet/ |title= The Reluctant Bet |work=[[NewsBreak]] |date=2003-06-23 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market votes are votes which cannot be commanded by political kingpins; this is opposed to the so-called "command votes", which can be delivered by political kingpins.

In 2004, Gatmaitan introduced the corridor plus [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]], [[Cebu City]], [[Bacolod]], [[Iloilo City]], [[Davao City]], [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Zamboanga City]] which together comprises almost 52% of the voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_KZjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aSUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3220%2C35598146 |title= Parties don't make presidents |first=Antonio |last=Gatmaitan |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2004-01-10 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral history ===
[[File:Lingayen-Lucena corridor.png|thumb|350px|Provinces of the Philippines by percentage of the voting population as of 2010. Those within the corridor are in blue shades, and those outside of it in red shades.]]

The only post-[[People Power Revolution]] presidential election where the winner of the Corridor failed to win nationally was [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] in [[Philippine presidential election, 2004|2004]]. In the thirteen provinces/regions of the corridor (Aurora, [[Bataan]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Pampanga]], [[Quezon]], [[Rizal]], [[Tarlac]] and [[Zambales]]), Poe won 40.8% of the total votes cast, or 4.65 million votes, 1.32 million more than did Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who won 29.2% or 3.33 million. GMA more than made up for this deficit in the [[Visayas]]. 

In the 15 provinces ([[Aklan]], [[Antique]], [[Biliran]], [[Bohol]], [[Capiz]], [[Cebu]], [[Eastern Samar]], [[Guimaras]], [[Iloilo]], [[Leyte]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Negros Oriental]], [[Northern Samar]], [[Samar]] and [[Southern Leyte]]) of [[Western Visayas|Western]], [[Central Visayas|Central]] and [[Eastern Visayas]], GMA won 61% or 3.6 million votes, versus 27% or 1.6 million votes for FPJ, an insurmountable wave of more than 2 million votes. (In [[Cebu]] alone, [[Congressional canvass for the Philippine presidential election, 2004|GMA won just under a million votes or 79.9% of the total]], opening up an 842,531 vote lead.) Adding the Visayas results to the Corridor tally, [[Congressional canvass for the Philippine presidential election, 2004|GMA led with 697,039 votes]]. 

Alleged cheating and vote-tampering in the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] does not negate this result. [[Congressional canvass for the Philippine presidential election, 2004|Official results]] from the five provinces of [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|ARMM]] plus [[Sultan Kudarat]] and [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela City]], [[Basilan]], show that GMA won 685,076 votes there. Even if GMA did not win a single vote in ARMM and all of these 685,076 votes were given to Poe, it would still fall short of the 697,000-vote defeat of the Corridor by the Visayas.

What would become [[Metro Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] have all voted for the same candidate starting from the 1961 election.

|In 1801, as reported in the Hull Packet, a fiery object is said to have appeared suddenly over the Humber; an immense moon-like globe with a black bar across the centre of its face. For a moment it bathed Hull and the Humber in a mysterious blue light. Then, it split into seven smaller fireballs and vanished.

|On February 22 (or March 24) in 1803 local fishermen reportedly saw a vessel drifting in close-by waters. They say when they investigated it, "a beautiful young woman" they described as having red and white hair and dressed in strange clothes appeared. The fishermen claim she held a square box "that no one was allowed to touch" and she spoke to them in a language they never heard before. Modern UFO believers think this story was a credible document of a close encounter of the third kind in early Japan. Historians and Ethnologists consider it to be folklore.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

|Constable Jim Blackwood of the [[RCMP]] responded to reports of a flying saucer hovering over a harbour near the town of [[Clarenville]]. When he arrived at the scene, the UFO was present and visible.

|Interception of alleged UFO by [[Sukhoi Su-22]]. The UFO was spherical and around three miles from the base, and around 600 metres (2,000&amp;nbsp;ft) above the ground. The pilot followed the object to an altitude of around 2,500 metres (8,200&amp;nbsp;ft), and aimed his weapons at the UFO, firing sixty four 30mm shells. The pilot followed the object up to around 19,000 metres (63,000&amp;nbsp;ft) feet, when he was able to have a much closer look at the object from around 100 metres, noticing that it was around thirty feet in diameter and had an enamelled cream colour, with a wide circular silver base; similar to an incandescent lightbulb, but with a much wider base. The object had no visible exhaust or obvious means of propulsion. The pilot then broke off the engagement.

'''Long Phuri''', or '''Long Phuri Naga''' (Amimi Naga, Longpfuri, Longpfuru, Mimi), is an unclassified [[Naga language]] of Burma. It is not close to other Naga languages which it has been compared to, though Long Phuri Naga, [[Makuri Naga language|Makuri Naga]], and [[Para Naga language|Para Naga]] may be closest to each other.

Long Phuri is spoken in 6 villages of [[Leshi Township]], [[Hkamti District]], [[Sagaing Region]], Myanmar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1377">The '''Maya''' were a population native to the old [[Wej province]] in [[Ethiopia]]. They were renowned for their skilled archers, the services of which were available as mercenaries. The Maya were primarily pastoralists and their livelihood was with their cattle.

==Futuh al-Habash==
Maya archers initially formed the core of the southern armies of Abyssinian Emperor [[Lebna Dengel]] in resisting the [[Abyssinian–Adal war|Conquest of Abyssinia]] (Futuh al-Habash]] by the forces of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (Gurey or Gran), Imam of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. However, after the fall of their homeland to Ahmed Gurey's armies, in true mercenary fashion, the May bowmen switched sides.&lt;ref&gt;The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century pg 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya bowmen were armed with spears. They  tipped their arrows with [[ouabain]], a poison which caused death by cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.

==Oromo migrations==
The Maya homeland of Wej was one of the first lands to be invaded by the [[Oromo migrations]]. The Maya repelled the weight of the Oromo for years due to their skill with the bow, until the Oromo armies changed tactics and used thick oxhide shields and fixed shield formations.

'''Monogamy''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|g|ə|m|i}} {{Respell|mə|NOG|ə-mee}}) is a form of [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] in which an individual has only one [[Significant other|partner]] during their lifetime — alternately, only one partner at any one time ([[Monogamy#Serial monogamy|serial monogamy]]) — as compared to [[non-monogamy]] (e.g., [[polygamy]] or [[polyamory]]).&lt;ref name="BRIT"/&gt; The term is also applied to the social behavior of some animals, referring to the state of having only one [[Mating|mate]] at any one time.

==Terminology==
The word ''monogamy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μονός, ''monos'' ("alone"), and γάμος, ''gamos'' ("marriage").&lt;ref name="BRIT"&gt;Cf. "Monogamy" in ''Britannica World Language Dictionary'', R.C. Preble (ed.), Oxford-London 1962, p. 1275:''1. The practice or principle of marrying only once. opp. to digamy now ''rare'' 2. The condition, rule or custom of being married to only one [[person]] at a time (opp. to polygamy or bigamy) 1708. 3. [[Zoology|Zool.]] The habit of living in pairs, or having only one mate''; The same text repeats ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', W. Little, H.W. Fowler, J. Coulson (ed.), C.T. Onions (rev. &amp; ed.,) Oxford 1969, 3rd edition, vol.1, p.1275; [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00314586 OED Online]. March 2010. Oxford University Press. 23 Jun. 2010 Cf. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monogamy Monogamy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623232650/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monogamy |date=2015-06-23 }} in Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "monogamy" may be referring to one of various relational types, depending upon context. Generally, there are four overlapping definitions.
* ''marital monogamy'' refers to [[marriage]]s of only two people.
* ''social monogamy'' refers to two partners living together, having sex with each other, and cooperating in acquiring basic resources such as shelter, food and money.
* ''sexual monogamy'' refers to two partners remaining sexually exclusive with each other and having no outside sex partners.&lt;ref name="Reichard,2003"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ulrich H. |last1=Reichard |chapter=Monogamy: past and present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIu2K6KFsXEC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3–25 |year=2003 |editor1-first=Ulrich H. |editor1-last=Reichard |editor2-first=Christophe |editor2-last=Boesch |title=Monogamy: Mating Strategies and Partnerships in Birds, Humans and Other Mammals |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52577-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''genetic monogamy'' refers to sexually monogamous relationships with genetic evidence of paternity.&lt;ref name="Reichard,2003"/&gt;

For instance, biologists, [[biological anthropologist]]s, and [[behavioral ecologist]]s often use ''monogamy'' in the sense of sexual, if not genetic (reproductive), exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"&gt;Low B.S. (2003) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bobbi_Low/publication/237010580_Ecological_and_social_complexities_in_human_monogamy/links/0deec51ae3e528b821000000.pdf Ecological and social complexities in human monogamy]. Monogamy: Mating Strategies and Partnerships in Birds, Humans and Other Mammals:161–176.&lt;/ref&gt; When cultural or social anthropologists and other [[social scientists]] use the term monogamy, the meaning is social or marital monogamy.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reichard,2003"/&gt; 

Marital monogamy may be further distinguished between:
# ''classical monogamy'', "a single relationship between people who marry as virgins, remain sexually exclusive their entire lives, and become celibate upon the death of the partner"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201407/seven-forms-non-monogamy|author=Sheff, Elisabeth|title=Seven Forms of Non-Monogamy|date=July 22, 2014|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[#Serial monogamy|''serial monogamy'']], marriage with only one other person at a time, in contrast to [[bigamy]] or [[polygamy]];&lt;ref name="BRIT"/&gt;

==Frequency in humans==
[[File:Old marriage at Plac Kaszubski.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Bronze sculpture of an elderly [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] married couple located in Kaszubski square, [[Gdynia]], Poland, which commemorates their monogamous fidelity, through the time of their separation, while he temporarily worked in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://krodo.pl/atrakcja/szczegoly/2263/Plac_Kaszubski_W_Gdyni|title= Kaszubski square in Gdynia|accessdate= 2011-11-02|language= pl|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110916205746/http://krodo.pl/atrakcja/szczegoly/2263/Plac_Kaszubski_W_Gdyni|archivedate= 2011-09-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Distribution of social monogamy===
According to the ''Ethnographic Atlas'' by George P. Murdock, of 1,231 societies from around the world noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry.&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/Codebook4EthnoAtlas.pdf ''Ethnographic Atlas Codebook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118232413/http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/Codebook4EthnoAtlas.pdf |date=2012-11-18 }} derived from George P. Murdock’s ''Ethnographic Atlas'' recording the marital composition of 1231 societies from 1960 to 1980&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not take into account the relative population of each of the societies studied, and the actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeitzen|first=Miriam Koktvedgaard|title=Polygamy: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce and remarriage can thus result in "serial monogamy", i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the [[Caribbean]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Brazil]] where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners. In all, these account for 16 to 24% of the "monogamous" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=Reproduction &amp; Succession: Studies in Anthropology, Law and Society|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence of sexual monogamy===
The prevalence of sexual monogamy can be roughly estimated as the percentage of married people who do not engage in extramarital sex. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample describes the amount of extramarital sex by men and women in over 50 pre-industrial cultures.&lt;ref name="Divale,2000"&gt;Divale, W. (2000). [http://worldcultures.org/SCCS1.pdf Pre-Coded Variables for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, Volume I and II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217131745/http://worldcultures.org/SCCS1.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}. Jamaica, NY: York College, CUNY.  Distributed by World Cultures. See Variable 170 and Variable 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murdock,White,1969"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3772907 |author=Murdock, G.P., White, D.R. |title=Standard cross-cultural sample |journal=Ethnology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=329–369 |year=1969 |jstor=3772907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The amount of extramarital sex by men is described as "universal" in 6 cultures, "moderate" in 29 cultures, "occasional" in 6 cultures, and "uncommon" in 10 cultures. The amount of extramarital sex by women is described as "universal" in 6 cultures, "moderate" in 23 cultures, "occasional" in 9 cultures, and "uncommon" in 15 cultures. These findings support the claim{{explain|date=September 2018}} that the reported amount of extramarital sex differs across cultures and across genders.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Surveys conducted in non-Western nations (2001) also found cultural and gender differences in extramarital sex. A study of sexual behavior in Thailand, Tanzania and Côte d'Ivoire suggests about 16–34% of men engage in extramarital sex while a much smaller (unreported) percentage of women engage in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name="O'Conner,2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2673807 |author=O’Connor, M.L. |title=Men who have many sexual partners before marriage are more likely to engage in extramarital intercourse |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=48–9 |year=2001 |jstor=2673807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies in Nigeria have found around 47–53% of men and to 18–36% of women engage in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name="Isiugo-Abanihe,1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Isiugo-Abanihe, U.C. |title=Extramarital relations and perceptions of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria |journal=Health Transition Review |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=111–125 |year=1994 |pmid=10150513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladebo,Tanimowo,2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3583130 |author=Ladebo, O.J., Tanimowo, A.G. |title=Extension personnel's sexual behaviour and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS in South-Western Nigeria |journal=African Journal of Reproductive Health |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=51–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12476716 |jstor=3583130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1999 survey of married and cohabiting couples in Zimbabwe reports that 38% of men and 13% of women engaged in extra-couple sexual relationships within the last 12 months.&lt;ref name="NationalAIDSCouncil,2002"&gt;National AIDS Council, Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, The MEASURE Project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/Zimbabwe). AIDS in Africa During the Nineties: Zimbabwe. A review and analysis of survey and research results. Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples: surveys given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers).{{cn|date=September 2018}} Convenience samples do not accurately reflect the population of the United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These studies (1974, 1983, 1993) reported that 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engaged in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name="Hunt,1974"&gt;Hunt, M.

[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-97237-000 The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior]. New York, NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The only way to get scientifically reliable estimates of extramarital sex is to use nationally representative samples.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Three studies have used nationally representative samples. These studies (1994, 1997) found that about 10–15% of women and 20–25% of men engage in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name="Clements,1994"&gt;{{cite news |author=Clements, M. |title=Sex in America today: A new national survey reveals how our attitudes are changing |publisher=Parade Magazine |pages=4–6 |date=7 August 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laumann,Gagnon,Michael,Michaels,1994"&gt;Laumann, E.

===Prevalence of genetic monogamy===
The incidence of genetic monogamy may be estimated from rates of extrapair paternity. Extrapair paternity is when offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with another male. Rates of extrapair paternity have not been extensively studied in people. Many reports of extrapair paternity are little more than quotes based on hearsay, anecdotes, and unpublished findings.&lt;ref name="Macintyre,Sooman,1991"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)91513-T |author=Macintyre, S., Sooman, A. |title=Non-paternity and prenatal genetic screening |journal=Lancet |volume=338 |issue=8771 |pages=869–871 |year=1991 |pmid=1681226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simmons, Firman, Rhodes, and Peters reviewed 11 published studies of extra-pair paternity from various locations in the United States, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and among the Yanomamo Indians of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.11.013 |author=Simmons, L.W., Firman, R.E.C., Rhodes, G., Peters, M. |title=Human sperm competition: testis size, sperm production and rates of extrapair copulations |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=68 |pages=297–302 |year=2004 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rates of extrapair paternity ranged from 0.03% to 11.8% although most of the locations had low percentages of extrapair paternity. The median rate of extrapair paternity was 1.8%. A separate review of 17 studies by Bellis, Hughes, Hughes, and Ashton found slightly higher rates of extrapair paternity.&lt;ref name="Bellis,Hughes,Hughes,Ashton,2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |author=Bellis, M.A., Hughes, K., Hughes, S., Ashton, J.R. |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–754 |year=2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rates varied from 0.8% to 30% in these studies, with a median rate of 3.7% extrapair paternity. A range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy. Although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or social environments, a large percentage of couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships. A review paper, surveying 67 other studies, reported rates of extrapair paternity, in different societies, ranging from 0.4% to over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson,  Kermyt G. |title=How Well Does Paternity Confidence Match Actual Paternity?

Monogamy exists in many societies around the world,&lt;ref name="Murdock,1981"&gt;Murdock GP (1981) Atlas of world cultures. University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is important to understand how these marriage systems might have evolved.  In any species, there are three main aspects that combine to promote a monogamous mating system: paternal care, resource access, and mate-choice;&lt;ref name="Reichard,2003"/&gt; however, in humans, the main theoretical sources of monogamy are paternal care and extreme ecological stresses.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;  Paternal care should be particularly important in humans due to the extra nutritional requirement of having larger brains and the lengthier developmental period.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy,1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovejoy CO | year = 1981 | title = The Origin of Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 211 | issue = 4480| pages = 341–350 | doi = 10.1126/science.211.4480.341 | pmid = 17748254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marlowe,2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marlowe FW | year = 2000 | title = Paternal investment and the human mating system | url = | journal = Behav Processes | volume = 51 | issue = 1–3| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00118-2 | pmid = 11074311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett,Dunbar,Lycett,2002"&gt;Barrett L, Dunbar RIM, Lycett J (2002) Human evolutionary psychology.

Paleoanthropological estimates of the time frame for the evolution of monogamy are primarily based on the level of [[sexual dimorphism]] seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref name="Møller,2003"&gt;Moller AP (2003) The evolution of monogamy: mating relationships, parental care and sexual selection.

Despite the human ability to avoid sexual and genetic monogamy, social monogamy still forms under many different conditions, but most of those conditions are consequences of cultural processes.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt; These cultural processes may have nothing to do with relative reproductive success. For example, anthropologist [[Jack Goody]]'s comparative study utilizing the ''Ethnographic Atlas'' demonstrated that monogamy is part of a cultural complex found in the broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland that practice social monogamy, sexual monogamy and dowry (i.e. "diverging devolution", that allow property to be inherited by children of both sexes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goody demonstrates a statistical correlation between this cultural complex and the development of intensive plough agriculture in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=27–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of [[Ester Boserup]], Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture.  In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work and is associated with private property; marriage tends to be monogamous to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family ([[endogamy]]) are the preferred marriage partners to keep property within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, and more recently in Africa and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dupanloup I, Pereira L, Bertorelle G, Calafell F, Prata MJ, Amorim A, Barbujani G | year = 2003 | title = A recent shift from polygyny to monogamy in humans is suggested by the analysis of worldwide Y-chromosome diversity | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 85–97 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-003-2458-x | pmid = 12962309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society, the belief in "high gods" to support human morality, and monogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roes|first=Frans L.|title=The Size of Societies, Monogamy, and Belief in High Gods Supporting Human Morality|journal=Tijdschrift voor sociale wetenschappen|year=1992|volume=37|issue=1|pages=53–58|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/size-of-societies-stratification-and-belief-in-high-gods-supportive-of-human-morality/0515A283CCF11A9B6393D1872CDFE211}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ember|first=Carol R.|title=What we know and what we don't know about variation in social organization: Melvin Ember's approach to the study of kinship|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=27–30|doi=10.1177/1069397110383947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betzig postulated that culture/society can also be a source of social monogamy by enforcing it through rules and laws set by third-party actors, usually in order to protect the wealth or power of the elite.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Betzig,1992"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Betzig L. | year = 1992 | title = Roman Monogamy | url = | journal = Ethol Sociobiol | volume = 13 | issue = 5–6| pages = 351–383 | doi = 10.1016/0162-3095(92)90009-S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Betzig L. | year = 1995 | title = Medieval Monogamy | url = | journal = Journal of Family History | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 181–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Augustus Caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs, but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous, legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1992"/&gt;  Similarly—according to Betzig—the [[Christian Church]] enforced monogamy because wealth passed to the closest living, legitimate male relative, often resulting in the wealthy oldest brother being without a male heir.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"/&gt;  Thus, the wealth and power of the family would pass to the “celibate” younger brother of the church.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"/&gt;  In both of these instances, the rule-making elite used cultural processes to ensure greater reproductive fitness for themselves and their offspring, leading to a larger genetic influence in future generations.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"/&gt;  Furthermore, the [[Canon law|laws of the Christian Church]], in particular, were important in the evolution of social monogamy in humans.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"/&gt;  They allowed, even encouraged, poor men to marry and produce offspring which reduced the gap in reproductive success between the rich and poor, thus resulting in the quick spread of monogamous marriage systems in the western world.&lt;ref name="Betzig,1995"/&gt;  According to B. S. Low, culture would appear to have a much larger impact on monogamy in humans than the biological forces that are important for non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;

Other theorists use cultural factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy. During times of major economic / demographic transitions, investing more in a fewer offspring (social monogamy not polygyny) increases reproductive success by ensuring the offspring themselves have enough initial wealth to be successful.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;  This is seen in both England and Sweden during the industrial revolution&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt; and is currently being seen in the modernization of rural Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Gibson,Lawson,2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson MA, Lawson DW | year = 2011 | title = Modernization" increases parental investment and sibling resource competition: evidence from a rural development initiative in Ethiopia | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 97–105 | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in modern industrialized societies, fewer yet better-invested offspring, i.e. social monogamy, can provide a reproductive advantage over social polygyny, but this still allows for serial monogamy and extra-pair copulations.&lt;ref name="Low, 2003"/&gt;

[[Karol Wojtyla|Karol Wojtyła]] (later, Pope John Paul II) in his book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'' postulated that monogamy, as an institutional union of two people being in [[love]] with one another, was an embodiment of an [[ethics|ethical]] ''personalistic norm'', and thus the only means of making true human love possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wojtyla| first=Karol| chapter = Marriage. Monogamy and the indissolubility of Marriage | title = Love and Responsibility |year=1981 | publisher=Ignatius Press| location=San Francisco| isbn=0-89870-445-6|pages=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers have suggested that monogamy may solve the problems associated with non-monogamy and [[hypergamy]] such as [[inceldom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://slate.com/business/2018/05/robin-hanson-the-sex-redistribution-professor-interviewed.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/opinion/incels-sex-robots-redistribution.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandra Kollontai]] in ''Make Way for the Winged Eros''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4edu.info/images/b/b6/Kollontai_Winged_Eros.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; argues that monogamy is an artifact of capitalist concepts of property and inheritance and wrote, "The social aims of the working class are not affected one bit by whether love takes the form of a long and official union or is expressed in a temporary relationship. The ideology of the working class does not place any formal limits on love." Later, "Modern love always sins, because it absorbs the thoughts and feelings of 'loving hearts' and isolates the loving pair from the collective. In the future society, such a separation will not only become superfluous but also psychologically inconceivable." One of the tenets of the new proletarian morality is "mutual recognition of the rights of the other, of the fact that one does not own the heart and soul of the other (the sense of property, encouraged by bourgeois culture)."

===Ancient societies===
The historical record offers contradictory evidence on the development and extent of monogamy as a social practice. Laura Betzig argues that in the six large, highly stratified early states, commoners were generally monogamous but that elites practiced de facto polygyny. Those states included Mesopotamia, Egypt, Aztec Mexico, Inca Peru, India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betzig|first=Laura|title=Social Stratification and socioeconomic inequality Vol. 1|year=1993|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|pages=37–74|chapter=Sex, succession, and stratification in the first six civilizations: How powerful men reproduced, passed power on to their sons, and used power to defend their wealth, women, and children|editor=Lee, Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Mesopotamia and Assyria====
Both the Babylonian and Assyrian families were monogamous in principle but not entirely so in practice since polygyny was frequently practiced by the rulers.

In the patriarchal society of Mesopotamia the nuclear family was called a "house".  In order "to build a house" a man was supposed to marry one woman and if she did not provide him with offspring, he could take a second wife. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] states that he loses his right to do so if the wife herself gives him a slave as concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. R. de Vaux, ''Ancient Israel. Its Life and Institutions'', London 1980 (5th impr.), p. 24 {{ISBN|0-232-51219-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Assyria|Old Assyrian]] texts, he could be obliged to wait for two or three years before he was allowed to take another wife. The position of the second wife was that of a "slave girl" in respect to the first wife, as many marriage contracts explicitly state.&lt;ref name=MES&gt;M. Stol: ''Private Life in Ancient Mesopotamia'', in: ''Civilizations of the Ancient Near East''. J. M. Sasson (ed.), J. Baines, G. Beckman, K. S. Rubinson (assist. ed.). Vol. 1. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, 1995, pp. 488–493. {{ISBN|0-684-19720-0}};  Cf. Martha T. Roth, ''[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/age-at-marriage-and-the-household-a-study-of-neobabylonian-and-neoassyrian-forms/2F3521F910D7A19788DD66FB428620FF Age at Marriage and the Household: A Study of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian Forms]'', “Comparative Studies in Society and History” 29 (1987), and ''Babylonian Marriage Agreements 7th–3rd Centuries BC'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Egypt====
Although an Egyptian man was free to marry several women at a time, and some wealthy men from [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdoms]] did have more than one wife, monogamy was the norm.&lt;ref name= EGY&gt;G. Pinch: "Egyptian society seems to have been based on the "conjugal household." The basic family unit consisted of a man and a woman living together and any children they might have".  ''Private Life in Ancient Egypt'' in: ''Civilizations of the Ancient Near East'', pp. 370–71&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been some exceptions, e.g. a [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] official stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth, even after he had become very successful (P. Leiden I 371). This may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife. Egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife. "His wife X, his beloved" is the standard phrase identifying wives in tomb inscriptions. The instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature, e.g. [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep|Instruction of Ptahhotep]] or [[Instruction of Any]], support fidelity to monogamous marriage life, calling the wife a ''Lady of the house''. The [[Instruction of Ankhsheshonq]] suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch Geraldine, ''Private Life in Ancient Egypt'' in: {{Cite book | title = Civilizations of the Ancient Near East| pages = 371–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Israel====
As against Betzig's contention that monogamy evolved as a result of Christian socio-economic influence in the West, monogamy appeared widespread in the [[Ancient Near East|ancient Middle East]] much earlier. In Israel's pre-Christian era, an essentially monogamous [[ethos]] underlay the Jewish creation story ([[Book of Genesis|Gn]] 2) and the last chapter of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].&lt;ref name = EJUDMO&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Monogamy |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica | volume = 12|pages= 258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =EJUDMA/&gt; During the [[Second Temple period]] (530 BCE to 70 CE), apart from an economic situation which supported monogamy even more than in earlier period, the concept of "mutual fidelity" between husband and wife was a quite common reason for strictly monogamous marriages.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Some marriage documents explicitly expressed a desire for the marriage to remain monogamous. Examples of these documents were found in [[Elephantine]]. They resemble those found in neighbouring [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name = EJUDMO/&gt; Study shows that ancient Middle East societies, though not strictly monogamous, were practically (at least on commoners' level) monogamous.&lt;ref name= MES/&gt;&lt;ref name= EGY/&gt; [[Halakha]] of the [[Dead Sea Sect]] saw prohibition of polygamy as coming from the [[Pentateuch]] ([[Damascus Document]] 4:20–5:5, one of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]). Christianity adopted a similar attitude (cf. [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Tm]] 3:2,12; [[Epistle to Titus|Tt]] 1:6), which conformed with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] approach.&lt;ref name = EJUDMO/&gt; [[Michael Coogan]], in contrast, states that "Polygyny continued to be practised well into the biblical period, and it is attested among Jews as late as the second century CE."&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and Sex.

Under [[Biblical judges|Judges]] and the monarchy, old restrictions went into disuse, especially among royalty, though the [[Books of Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], which cover entire period of monarchy, do not record a single case of bigamy among commoners&amp;nbsp;— except for [[Samuel]]'s father. The wisdom books e.g. [[Book of Wisdom]], which provides a picture of the society, [[Sirach]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes|Qohelet]] portray a woman in a strictly monogamous family (cf. Pr 5:15-19; Qo 9:9; Si 26:1-4 and eulogy of perfect wife, Proverbs 31:10-31). The [[Book of Tobit|Book of Tobias]] speaks solely of monogamous marriages. Also prophets have in front of their eyes monogamous marriage as an image of the relationship of God and Israel. (Cf. [[Book of Hosea|Ho]] 2:4f; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jer]] 2:2; [[Book of Isaiah|Is]] 50:1; 54:6-7; 62:4-5; Ez 16). [[Roland de Vaux]] states that "it is clear that the most common form of marriage in Israel was monogamy".&lt;ref name= EJUDMA&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marriage |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica | volume = 11|pages= 1026–27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= de Vaux R. O.P.|chapter=Marriage - 1. Polygamy and monogamy|title=Ancient Israel. Its Life and Institutions|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mishnah]] and the ''[[baraitot]]'' clearly reflect a monogamist viewpoint within Judaism ([[Nashim|Yevamot]] 2:10 etc.). Some sages condemned marriage to two wives even for the purpose of procreation (Ketubot 62b). R. Ammi, an ''amora'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever takes a second wife in addition to his first one shall divorce the first and pay her ''kettubah'' (Yevamot 65a)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roman customs, which prohibited polygamy, may have enhanced such an attitude{{original research inline|date=March 2014}} -  especially after 212 AD, when all the Jews became Roman citizens.&lt;ref name = EJUDMO/&gt; However, some Jews continued to practice bigamy (e.g. up to medieval times in Egypt and Europe).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Fourth-century Roman law forbade Jews to contract plural marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheidel | first1 = W. | year = 2009 | title = A peculiar institution?

==== Ancient Greece and ancient Rome ====

The ancient Greeks and Romans were monogamous in the sense that men were not allowed to have more than one wife or to cohabit with concubines during marriage.&lt;ref name="Scheidel June 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel W. 2009.

====Early Christianity====

According to Jesus Christ monogamy was a primordial will of the Creator described in Genesis, darkened by the ''hardness of hearts'' of the Israelites. As John Paul II interpreted the dialogue between Jesus and the [[Pharisees]] ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 19:3–8), Christ emphasized the primordial beauty of monogamic spousal [[love]] described in the Book of Genesis 1:26–31, 2:4–25, whereby a man and woman by their nature are each ready to be a beautifying, total and [[person]]al gift to one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jesus avoids entangling himself in juridical or casuistic controversies; instead, he appeals twice to the "beginning". By doing so, he clearly refers to the relevant words of Genesis, which his interlocutors also know by heart. (...) it clearly leads the interlocutors to reflect about the way in which, in the mystery of creation, man was formed precisely as "male and female," in order to understand correctly the normative meaning of the words of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John Paul II | title = Man and Woman He created Them. A Theology of the Body 1,2-4| pages= 132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Contemporary societies===

====International====
Western European societies established monogamy as their marital norm.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald K.

The [[women's rights]] movements in these nations want to make monogamy the only legal form of marriage. The United Nations joined these efforts in 1979 when the General Assembly adopted the [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women], an international bill of rights for women that over 180 nations have agreed to implement. Article 16 of the Convention requires nations to give women and men equal rights in marriage. Polygamy is interpreted as inconsistent with Article 16 when it extends the right of multiple spouses to men but not to women. The United Nations has established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url =https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/  | title =Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women  | deadurl =no  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140103192421/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/  | archivedate =2014-01-03  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor the progress of nations implementing the Convention. The United Nations is thus working through the Convention and CEDAW to promote women's equality by making monogamy the only legal form of marriage worldwide.

====People's Republic of China====
{{Main|Marriage in the People's Republic of China}}
The founders of [[Communism]] determined that monogamous marriage inherently oppressed women and therefore had no place in communist society. [[Friedrich Engels]] stated that compulsory monogamy could only lead to increased prostitution and general immorality, with the benefits of restricting capital and solidifying the class structure. As he spelled out in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884),
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The first class antagonism which appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male. …[T]he wellbeing and development of the one group are attained by the misery and repression of the other.''

''The monogamous family is distinguished from the pairing family by the far greater durability of wedlock, which can no longer be dissolved at the pleasure of either party. As a rule, it is only the man who can still dissolve it and cast off his wife.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingfromtheleft.com/PDF/EngelsOrigin.pdf|author=Engels,Friedrich|title=The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the communist revolutionaries in China chose to take the Western viewpoint, of monogamy as giving women and men equal rights in marriage. The newly formed Communist government established monogamy as the only legal form of marriage.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 1950 Marriage Law called for sweeping changes in many areas of family life. It forbade any 'arbitrary and compulsory' form of marriage that would be based on the superiority of men and would ignore women’s interests. The new democratic marriage system was based on the free choice of couples, monogamy, equal rights for both sexes, and the protection of the lawful interests of women. It abolished the begetting of male offspring as the principal purpose of marriage and weakened kinship ties which reduced the pressure on women to bear many children, especially sons. With arranged marriages prohibited, young women could choose their own marriage partners, share the financial cost of setting up a new household, and have equal status in household and family decision-making. The Government then initiated an extensive campaign of marriage-law education, working jointly with the Communist Party, women’s federations, trade unions, the armed forces, schools and other organizations."&lt;ref name="Cheng,1991"&gt;Cheng, C.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Africa====
The African Union has adopted the ''Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa'' (the [[Maputo Protocol]]). While the protocol does not suggest making polygamous marriage illegal, article 6 of the protocol states that "monogamy is encouraged as the preferred form of marriage and that the rights of women in marriage and family, including in polygamous marital relationships are promoted and protected."&lt;ref name="AmnestyInternational,2006"&gt;Amnesty International, 2006.

==Varieties in biology==
{{anchor|Varieties of monogamy}}
Recent discoveries have led biologists to talk about the three varieties of monogamy: social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy. The distinction between these three are important to the modern understanding of monogamy.

Monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with partners other than their primary mate. This is called [[extra-pair copulation]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Quote box
|quote=Social monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy equals [[monogamous marriage]]. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively.

Whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.

Social monogamy does not always involve marriage in humans. A married couple is almost always a socially monogamous couple. But couples who choose to [[cohabitation|cohabit]] without getting married can also be socially monogamous.  The popular science author Matt Ridley in his book ''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'', described the human mating system as "monogamy plagued by adultery".

===Serial monogamy===
Serial monogamy is a mating practice in which individuals may engage in sequential monogamous pairings,&lt;ref name="Wright,1994"&gt;Wright R (1994) The moral animal: the new science of evolutionary psychology. Pantheon Books, New York.{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of humans, when men or women can marry another partner but only after ceasing to be married to the previous partner.&lt;ref name="Mulder,Mulder,2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulder M, Mulder B | year = 2009 | title = Serial Monogamy as Polygyny or Polyandry? | url = | journal = Human nature | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 130–150 | doi = 10.1007/s12110-009-9060-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that this pattern pacifies the elite men and equalizes reproductive success. This is called the Male Compromise Theory.&lt;ref name="Lagerlof,2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lagerlof N, Lagerlöf  | year = 2010 | title = Pacifying monogamy | url = | journal = Journal of economic growth | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 235–262 | doi = 10.1007/s10887-010-9056-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such serial monogamy may effectively resemble polygyny in its reproductive consequences because some men are able to utilize more than one woman’s reproductive lifespan through repeated marriages.&lt;ref name="Jokela,Rotkrich,Rickard,Pettay,Lummaa,2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jokela M, Rotkirch A, Rickard I, Pettay J, Lummaa V | year = 2010 | title = Serial monogamy increases reproductive success in men but not in women | url = | journal = Behav Ecol | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 906–912 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serial monogamy may also refer to sequential sexual relationships, irrespective of marital status. A pair of humans may remain sexually exclusive, or monogamous, until the relationship has ended and then each may go on to form a new exclusive pairing with a different partner. This pattern of serial monogamy is common among people in Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From Polygyny to Serial Monogamy: A Unified Theory of Marriage Institutions|url = https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v82y2015i2p565-607.html|journal = Review of Economic Studies|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 565–607|volume = 82|issue = 2|first = David|last = de la Croix|first2 = Fabio|last2 = Mariani|doi = 10.1093/restud/rdv001|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160203103110/https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v82y2015i2p565-607.html|archivedate = 2016-02-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McVeigh, Tracy|title=Love hurts more than ever before (blame the internet and capitalism)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/love-marriage-romance-valentine|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102233928/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/love-marriage-romance-valentine|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reproductive success====
Evolutionary theory predicts that males would be apt to seek more mating partners than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from such a strategy.&lt;ref name="Jokela,Rotkrich,Rickard,Pettay,Lummaa,2010"/&gt; Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies that allow them to acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners.&lt;ref name="Jokela,Rotkrich,Rickard,Pettay,Lummaa,2010"/&gt; Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one female’s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because the men have a longer reproductive window.&lt;ref name="Starks,Blackie,2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Starks P, Blackie C | year = 2000 | title = The relationship between serial monogamy and rape in the United States (1960–1995) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1449| pages = 1259–1263 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1136 | pmid=10902693 | pmc=1690656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunz,Kunz,1994"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kunz J, Kunz PR | year = 1994 | title = Social setting and remarriage: ages of husband and wife | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 719–722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakup====
Serial monogamy has always been closely linked to [[divorce]] practices.  Whenever procedures for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy, serial monogamy has been found.&lt;ref&gt;It is said to have been "rife" in ancient Rome ''[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/alternative-forms-of-marriage-serial-monogamy.htm Alternative Forms of Marriage Serial Monogamy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706013632/http://www.trivia-library.com/b/alternative-forms-of-marriage-serial-monogamy.htm |date=2008-07-06 }}'' at Trivia-Library.com.&lt;/ref&gt; As divorce has continued to become more accessible, more individuals have availed themselves of it, and many go on to remarry.&lt;ref&gt;In Canada, 46% of divorcées will remarry according to ''[http://www.slaw.ca/2006/06/28/serial-monogamy-not/ Till death do us part? The risk of first and second marriage dissolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107021623/http://www.slaw.ca/2006/06/28/serial-monogamy-not/ |date=2008-11-07 }}'' by Warren Clark and Susan Crompton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barry Schwartz, author of ''The Paradox of Choice: Why less is more'', further suggests that Western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice. It has been suggested, however, that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce, enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus serial monogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griswold, Robert L. |title=Family and Divorce in California, 1850–1890: Victorian illusions and everyday realities |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany NY |year=1983 |pages=7–8 |isbn=0-87395-634-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2061160 |author=Goldman, Noreen |title=Changes in Widowhood and Divorce and Expected Durations of Marriage |journal=Demography |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=297–307 |year=1984 |pmid=6479390 |jstor=2061160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J.

===Mating system===
{{Main|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
Monogamy is one of several [[mating system]]s observed in animals. However, a pair of animals may be socially monogamous but that does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.&lt;ref name="Reichard2003"/&gt;

Social monogamy refers to the overtly observed living arrangement whereby a male and female share territory and engage in behaviour indicative of a social pair, but does not imply any particular sexual fidelity or reproductive pattern.&lt;ref name="Reichard2003"/&gt;   The extent to which social monogamy is observed in animals varies across taxa, with over 90 percent of avian species being socially monogamous, compared to only 3 percent of mammalian species and up to 15 percent of primate species.&lt;ref name="Reichard2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reichard |first=U.H. |title=Monogamy—A variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–7 |year=2002 |url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514183645/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash2001"&gt;Barash, D.P. &amp; Lipton, J.E. (2001). The Myth of Monogamy. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Social monogamy has also been observed in reptiles, fish, and insects.

Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions.&lt;ref name="Reichard2003"/&gt;  However, scientific analyses can test for paternity, for example by [[DNA paternity testing]] or by [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[pigment]] powder tracing of females to track physical contact. This type of analysis can uncover reproductively successful sexual pairings or physical contact. Genetic monogamy refers to DNA analyses confirming that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other.&lt;ref name="Reichard2003"/&gt;

The incidence of sexual monogamy appears quite rare in other parts of the animal kingdom. It is becoming clear that even animals that are overtly socially monogamous engage in [[extra-pair copulations]]. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, "on average, 30 percent or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male."&lt;ref name="Angier1990"&gt;Angier, Natalie (1990-08-21). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/science/mating-for-life-it-s-not-for-the-birds-of-the-bees.html Mating for Life? It's Not for the Birds of the Bees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314144709/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/science/mating-for-life-it-s-not-for-the-birds-of-the-bees.html |date=2017-03-14 }}" ("of" rather than "or" is how it shows in the article !). The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Adair Gowaty has estimated that, out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds, only 10% are sexually monogamous.&lt;ref name="Morell1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morell | first1 = V. | title = EVOLUTION OF SEX:A New Look at Monogamy | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5385.1982 | journal = Science | volume = 281 | issue = 5385 | pages = 1982–1983 | year = 1998 | pmid =  9767050| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Offspring are far more successful when both the male and the female members of the social pair contribute food resources.

An example of this was seen when scientists studied red winged blackbirds. These birds are known for remaining in monogamous relationships during the course of mating season. During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved like they do every season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity.&lt;ref name="Morell1998"/&gt; These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burnham|first=Terry|title=Mean genes : from sex to money to food, taming our primal instincts|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-200007-8|author2=Phelan, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest known frequency of reproductively successful extra-pair copulations are found among fairywrens
[[Malurus splendens]] and [[Malurus cyaneus]] where more than 65 percent of chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding pair.&lt;ref name="Barash2001"/&gt; This discordantly low level of genetic monogamy has been a surprise to biologists and zoologists, as social monogamy can no longer be assumed to determine how genes are distributed in a species.

[[Elacatinus]], also widely known as neon gobies, also exhibit social monogamy. Hetereosexual pairs of fish belonging to the genus Elacatinus remain closely associated during both reproductive and non-reproductive periods, and often reside in same cleaning station to serve client fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Elizabeth A. Whiteman |author2=Isabelle M.Côté |date=August 2003| title = Social monogamy in the Cleaning goby Elacatinus evelynae: ecological constraints or net benefit?

===Evolution in animals===
{{see also|Social monogamy in mammalian species}}
Socially monogamous species are scattered throughout the animal kingdom: A few insects, a few fish, about nine-tenths of birds, and a few mammals are socially monogamous. There is even a parasitic worm, ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'', that in its female-male pairings in the human body is monogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2008.05.009 |vauthors=Beltran S, Boissier J |title=Schistosome monogamy: who, how, and why? |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=386–91 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18674968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species.

The low occurrence of social monogamy in [[placental mammals]] has been claimed to be related to the presence or absence of estrus—or oestrus—the duration of sexual receptivity of a female. This, however, doesn't explain ''why'' estrus females generally mate with any proximate male nor any correlation between sexual and social monogamy. Birds, which are notable for a high incidence of social monogamy, do not have estrus.

Researchers have observed a mixed mating system of monogamy and polygyny in the [[European pied flycatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Von Haartman Lars | year = 1951 | title = Successive Polygamy | journal = Behaviour | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 256–274 | jstor=4532732 | doi = 10.1163/156853951x00296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Psychological studies of social monogamy have relied heavily on observations of married couples. These studies focus on relationship satisfaction, duration and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].

===Neuroendocrine bases===
The North American microtine rodent's (vole) complex social structure and social behavior has provided unique opportunities to study the underlying neural bases for monogamy and social attachment. Data from studies using the ''Microtis ochrogaster'' or prairie vole indicate that the neuroendocrine hormones, oxytocin (in female prairie voles) and vasopressin (in male prairie voles) play a central role in the development of affiliative connections during mating. The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin and vasopressin have been shown to promote affiliative behavior in the prairie vole but not in similar, but non-monogamous montane voles. This difference in neuropeptide effect is attributed to the location, density, and distribution of OT and AVP receptors. Only in the prairie voles are OT and AVP receptors located along the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, presumably conditioning the voles to their mates odor while consolidating the social memory of the mating episode. This finding highlights the role of genetic evolution in altering the neuroanatomical distribution of receptors, resulting in certain neural circuits becoming sensitive to changes in neuropeptides.

{{Pervez Musharraf sidebar}}
The '''National Reconciliation Ordinance''' ('''NRO'''; [[Urdu language|Urdu]]: '''قومی مفاہمت فرمان 2007ء''') was a controversial ordinance issued by the former [[President of Pakistan]], General [[Pervez Musharraf]], on 5 October 2007.&lt;ref name=TNI2&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=10487 'Corrupt' politicians given a clean slate], [[The News International]], 6 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It granted [[amnesty]] to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], murder, and terrorism between 1 January 1986, and 12 October 1999, the time between two states of [[martial law]] in Pakistan. It was declared [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] on 16 December 2009, throwing the country into a political [[crisis]].&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TGM1/&gt;

==Background==
The ordinance aimed at "promoting national reconciliation, fostering mutual trust and confidence amongst holders of public office and removing the vestiges of political vendetta and victimization, and to make the election process more transparent".&lt;ref name=TNI2/&gt; The NRO states:

{{quote|Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sub-section(1), the Federal Government or a Provincial Government may, before the judgment is pronounced by a trial court, withdraw from the prosecution of any person including an absconding accused who is found to be falsely involved for political reasons or through political victimization in any case initiated between 1st day of January, 1986 to 12th day of October, 1999 and upon such withdrawal clause (a) and clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall apply.}}

It is widely believed that the act was a measure to allow the former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] to return to Pakistan without any legal consequences due to pending politically motivated corruption cases.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8417170.stm |title= Pakistan court voids amnesty shielding Zardari allies |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 December 2009 | date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Musharraf had said that it was necessary to build a reconciliatory theme in the political arena with the removal of such politically motivated cases. Musharraf stated in an interview that cases had been in the courts for a decade without any judgment being passed and were hampering political progress of virtually all political parties.&lt;ref name=DAWN1/&gt;

According to [[Transparency International]], Pakistan is considered one of the corrupt countries in the world.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;  For the year 2009 it was ranked 42nd out of 180 and had a score of 2.4 on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C11%5C18%5Cstory_18-11-2009_pg1_9 Corruption in Pakistan increases: Transparency International], [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]], 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some analyst believe 'US, the UK and Saudi Arabia underwrote a public amnesty which would enable popular politicians such as Benazir Bhutto to return to the country and counter the [[Pakistani Taliban|Taliban]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8425045.stm |work=BBC News | title=Has sleaze ruling left Pakistan more polarised? | date=22 December 2009 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Chief Justice of Pakistan, [[Saad Bashir]], suspended this ordinance on 12 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2007/10/13/top1.htm Court links amnesty law benefits to verdict], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 13 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; But he was soon dismissed after Musharraf [[wikt:abrogate#English|abrogated]] the constitution on 3 November 2007. The new Chief Justice, [[Abdul Hameed Dogar]] revived the NRO on 27 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/02/28/top5.htm Apex court clears NRO], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 28 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release of list of NRO beneficiaries ===

In November 2009, [[Government of Pakistan]] released the list of the beneficiaries of NRO on the directives of Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani]].&lt;ref name=TNI1/&gt; The total list was 8041 beneficiaries most of which were bureaucrats, along with a handful of politicians. Amongst the beneficiaries were only 34 Politicians while others were all personnel of the armed forces and/or bureaucrats. The cases also included some high-ranking politicians, such as the Ex-President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] and Ex-Prime Minister [[Yousuf Raza Gillani]]. The NRO was planned to be presented in the National Assembly but later due to the opposition of several major parties was not presented in the Assembly. According to State Minister for Law [[Afzal Sindhu]] in a news conference, the ordinance affected 8,041 people, including 34 politicians and 03 ambassadors.&lt;ref name=TNI1&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=91919 List of 8041 NRO beneficiaries issues], [[The News International]], 21 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissolution of NRO by Supreme Court ==
On 16 December 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared NRO unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/world/asia/17pstan.html Pakistan Strikes Down Amnesty for Politicians], [[The New York Times]], 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A 17-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]], declared the ordinance null and void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-sc-verdict-expected-nro-qs-01|title= Supreme Court declares NRO null and void |date= 16 December 2009 |work= [[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]]|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court also said that all the cases disposed of because of the controversial ordinance now stand revived as of 5 October 2007 position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://geo.tv/12-16-2009/54900.htm|title= Supreme Court declares NRO unconstitutional|date= 16 December 2009|work= [[GEO News]]|accessdate= 16 December 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091220033632/http://www.geo.tv/12-16-2009/54900.htm|archivedate= 20 December 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-pakistan-court17-2009dec17,0,1859296.story Pakistan declares amnesty law unconstitutional], [[Los Angeles Times]], 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The court opined that the NRO "seems to be against national interests thus it violates the provisions of the constitution."&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; Western diplomats subsequently expressed concern that Pakistan could face further instability due to this ruling, especially if Mr Zardari's political opponents try to remove him from office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/971fc67e-ea7a-11de-a9f5-00144feab49a.html Top court removes Zardari graft amnesty], [[Financial Times]], 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the verdict was widely welcomed in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C12%5C17%5Cstory_17-12-2009_pg7_32 SC verdict against NRO welcomed across the board], [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After this verdict, Pakistan's [[National Accountability Bureau]] asked the Interior Ministry to bar 248 people, including [[Interior Minister of Pakistan]] [[Rehman Malik]], from leaving the country.  The following day an arrest warrant was issued against Malik.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/12/2009121894344483439.html Pakistan minister faces arrest bid], [[Al Jazeera English]], 18 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Defence Minister of Pakistan]] Chaudhry [[Ahmad Mukhtar]] was stopped from departing the country on a trip to China at Islamabad airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/06-defence-minister-stopped-at-islamabad-airport-rs-07 Defence Minister stopped at Islamabad airport], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', columnist [[Cyril Almeida]] stated "It's chaos out there. Nobody knows what's going on. Everyone is trying to work out the ramifications of the court order."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/17/pakistan-exit-ban-corruption Anti-corruption body bars 248 people from leaving Pakistan], [[The Guardian]], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The political crises deepened as the government was paralysed and the country seemed to slide towards a coup with it being increasingly unclear whether the elected politicians, the judiciary or somebody else was running the country.&lt;ref name=TGM1&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/court-ruling-paralyzes-pakistans-zardari-government/article1406408/ Court ruling paralyses Pakistan's Zardari government], [[The Globe and Mail]], 19 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent of the crises led to speculation whether the Army had any role to play in this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/1389500.html Who's in charge of nuclear-armed U.S. ally Pakistan?], [[The Miami Herald]], 18 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation was described as a 'creeping coup'. [[Asma Jahangir]], chairperson of [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] was quoted as saying 'It's complete (judicial) control now, the issue is whether the (democratic) system is going to pack up again.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/world/pakistan-in-crisis-as-creeping-coup-unfolds-20091219-l6lf.html Pakistan in crisis as 'creeping coup' unfolds], [[The Age]], 20 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' she criticised the judiciary and called the judgement a 'witchhunt'. She also remarked 'long-term effects of the judgment could also be counter-productive; perpetrators are often viewed as victims if justice is not applied in an even-handed manner and if administered in undue haste with overwhelming zeal.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/another-aspect-of-the-judgment-929 Another aspect of the judgment], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 19 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In an hearing of NRO Case, the supreme court was told that government was looking for a lawyer upon which it could trust to run the government's side while chief justice of Pakistan has asked the government to adopt all necessary measures otherwise the Prime Minister of Pakistan has to appear and proceed the case himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/04/18/nro-case-govt-wants-to-appoint-lawyer-of-its-choice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some titles of nobility '''outside Europe''' may be considered as '''equivalents of Duke'''.

Like other major Western noble titles, [[Duke]] is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. "Duke" is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.

==China==
In the most general of terms, '''''Gong''''' ([[Wade-Giles]] '''Kung '''（公） was the hereditary title of nobility of the first rank, usually translated as Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James (1875). ''The Chinese Classics: The life and works of Mencius''. Trübner &amp; co. p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under the Manchu (ruling ethnicity of the last imperial dynasty), there were ducal titles in both types of titled nobility.

===Imperial family===
Within the imperial family (extended, but limited; such systematic titulature is unknown in Europe) there were fourteen ranks, arranged in the following descending order: 
#''Heshe Qinwang ([[Wade-Giles]] (Ho Shê Ch'in Wang)'', Prince of the Blood of the first rank, usually conferred on the sons of Emperors by an Empress; 
#''Duoluozhun Wang ([[Wade-Giles]]To Lo Chün Wang)'', Prince of the Blood of the second rank, originally ''Ho Shê To Lo Pei Lê'' or "Prince of the Gift", enjoying the style of His Imperial Highness, with a name or locality (''hao'') attached to the title and the right to a posthumous name (''shi'') after death, usually conferred on the sons of Emperors by Imperial Consorts; 
#''Duoluo beile ([[Wade-Giles]]To Lo Pei Lê)'', Prince of the Blood of the third rank and enjoying the style of His Highness; 
#''Gushanbeizi ([[Wade-Giles]] Ku Shan Pei Tzu)'', "Prince of the Banner", Prince of the Blood of the fourth rank, with the style of His Highness; 
#''Fengenzhen Guogong ([[Wade-Giles]] Fêng Ên Chên Kuo Kung)'', "defender duke": Prince of the Blood of the fifth rank with the style of His Highness; 
#''Fengenfu Guogong ([[Wade-Giles]] Fêng Ên Fu Kuo Kung)'', "bulwark duke": Prince of the Blood of sixth rank, with the style of His Highness; only those six highest ranks carried the right to the eight privileges or ''Pa Fen'' 
##to wear the purple button, 
##to wear a three-eyed peacock's feather, 
##to wear embroidered dragon plaque on court robes, 
##to have red painted spears at the gates of their residences, 
##to attach tassels to the accouterments of their horses, 
##to use purple bridle-reins, 
##to have a servant carry a special teapot, 
##to have a special carpet on which to seat themselves. Below were: 
#''Buruba fenzhen Guogong ([[Wade-Giles]]Pu Ju Pa Fên Chên Kuo Kung)'', "lesser defender duke not to encroach on the Eight Privileges", Prince of the Blood of the seventh rank with the style of His Excellency; 
#''Buruba fenzhen fu Guogong ([[Wade-Giles]] Pu Ju Pa Fên Fu Kuo Kung)'', "lesser bulwark duke not to encroach on the Eight Privileges" Prince of the Blood of the eighth rank with the style of His Excellency; 
#''ZhenGuo jiangzhun ([[Wade-Giles]] Chên Kuo Chiang Chün)'', Noble of the Imperial Lineage of the ninth rank, divided into three grades (or ''Têng''); 
#''FuGuo jiangzhun ([[Wade-Giles]] Fu Kuo Chiang Chün)'', Noble of the Imperial Lineage of the tenth rank, divided into three grades; 
#''FengGuo jiangzhun ([[Wade-Giles]] Fêng Kuo Chiang Chün)'' "supporter-general of the state", Noble of the Imperial Lineage of the eleventh rank, divided into three grades; 
#''Fengen jiangzhun ([[Wade-Giles]] Fêng Ên Chiang Chün)'', "general by grace", noble of the Imperial Lineage of the twelfth rank; 
#''Zongshi ([[Wade-Giles]]Tsung Shih)'', Imperial clansman, the usual rank for male descendants, in the male line, beyond the twelfth generation, entitled to wear an Imperial Yellow Girdle denoting their descent from Emperor Hsien Tsu; 
#''Jiulo ([[Wade-Giles]] Chio Lo)'', collateral relatives of the Imperial clan, entitled to wear a distinctive Red Girdle denoting their descent from the collateral relatives of Emperor Hsien Tsu.

===Non-imperial family===
#'''''Gong''''', divided into three classes or ''Deng'', often translated as Duke, or as Prince (but not of the blood), is the second of ten hereditary titles of Nobility (''Jueyin ([[Wade-Giles]] Chüeh Yin) or Shijue ([[Wade-Giles]] Shih Chüeh'') conferred on subjects and collateral members of the Imperial clan, only under ''Yansheng gong ([[Wade-Giles]] Yen Shêng Kung)'' ('sacred Prince', reserved for Confucius' posterity), but above all other ranks,
#''Hou'' (also three classes, translated as Marquis) (these first three ranks were classed as ''Chaopin ([[Wade-Giles]] Ch'ao P'in'') ("Eminent Ranks", carrying honorific epiphets), 
#''Bo ([[Wade-Giles]] Po'') (three classes, translated as Earl), 
#''Zu ([[Wade-Giles]] Tzu'') (three classes, translated as Viscount), 
#''Nan'' (three classes, translated as Baron), 
#''Qingche duyu ([[Wade-Giles]] Ch'ing Ch'e Tu Yü''), 
#''Qiduyu ([[Wade-Giles]] Ch'i Tu Yü''), 
#''Yunqiyu ([[Wade-Giles]] Yün Ch'i Yü''), 
#''Enqiyu ([[Wade-Giles]] Ên Ch'i Yü'')
All, except the ninth grade, were heritable for a specific number of generations, ranging from twenty-six generations for a first class Kung to one generation for a Yün Ch'i Yü. In certain instances, some titles were held by Right of Perpetual Inheritance ''Shixi wangti ([[Wade-Giles]] Shih Hssi Wang T'i'').

==Ethiopia==
{{Main|Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles}}
Historian Harold G. Marcus equates the Ethiopian title of '''Ras''' (Head) to a Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Harold G. (1994). ''A history of Ethiopia''. University of California Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|0520081218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined title of ''Leul'' (Prince) ''Ras'' was given to the heads of the cadet branches of the [[Solomonic dynasty|Imperial dynasty]], such as the Princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selale.

==Japan==
The highest-ranking of the fives titles of the [[kazoku]] (jp: 華族, literally "flowery lineage"), the hereditary [[peerage]] of Japan between 1869 and 1947, ''kōshaku'', is rendered in Western languages either as prince or as duke.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Donald (2002). ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and his world, 1852–1912''. Columbia University Press p. 832. {{ISBN|023112340X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerbo, Harold R. and McKinstry, John A. (1995). ''Who rules Japan?: the inner circles of economic and political power''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 47. {{ISBN|0275949036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
In [[Goryeo Dynasty]], there were two ranks similar to that of duke. The upper was Gukgong(국공, 國公, means “duke of the nation”). Gukgong was the first rank of Goryeo peerage system, and 3,000 families gave their agricultural production and workforce for Gukgong. The lower was Gungong (군공, 郡公, means “duke of county”), which took 2,000 families' production and workforce. In bureaucratic order, Gukgong was in upper second rank, and Gungong was in lower second rank.

In [[Joseon Dynasty]], there was no title that is equivalent to Duke.

==Vietnam==
Male members of the Imperial clan received, in addition to a birthright-title by degree of parentage, one of nine senior titles of nobility, of which '''''Quan-Cong''''' Duke was the third, under ''Vuong'' King and ''Quoc-Cong'' Grand Duke, but above ''Cong'' Prince, ''Hau'' Marquis, ''Ba'' Count, ''Tu'' Viscount, ''Nam'' Baron and ''Vinh phong'' noble.

{{Spanish language}}
'''Portuñol''' (Spanish spelling) or '''Portunhol''' (Portuguese spelling) ({{Audio|help=no|Br-Portunol.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the name often given to any unsystematic mixture of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] of the words '''Portugués/Português''' ("Portuguese") and '''Español/Espanhol''' ("Spanish").

Portuñol, or Portunhol, is a pidgin, or simplified mixture of the two languages, that allows speakers of either Spanish or Portuguese who are not proficient in the other language to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name="Marcos"&gt;Marcos Marín, Francisco. "De lenguas y fronteras: el espanglish y el portuñol."Nueva revista de política, cultura y arte 74 (2001): 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; When speakers of one of the languages attempt to speak the other language, there is often interference from the native language, which causes the phenomenon of [[code-switching]] to occur.&lt;ref name="Lipski"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lipski | first = John M | title=Too close for comfort? the genesis of "portuñol/portunhol" | editor1-first = Timothy L | editor1-last = Face | editor2-first = Carol A | editor2-last = Klee | pages = 1–22 | location = Somerville, MA | publisher = Cascadilla Proceedings Project | year = 2006 | format= PDF | journal = Selected Proceedings of the 8th Hispanic Linguistics Symposium | url =http://www.lingref.com/cpp/hls/8/paper1251.pdf | accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to conduct a moderately fluent conversation in this way because Portuguese and Spanish are closely related [[Romance languages]]. They have almost identical syntactic structures, as well as overlapping lexicons due to cognates, which means that a single macro-grammar is produced when the two mix.&lt;ref name="Lipski" /&gt; The phrase ''en el hueco de la noite longa e langue'' illustrates a code-switch between the Spanish article ''la'' and the Portuguese noun ''noite''. This example reveals the grammatical possibilities of code-switching between the two languages.&lt;ref name="Lipski" /&gt;

[[Language contact]] between Spanish and Portuguese is the result of sustained contact between the two languages in border communities and multilingual trade environments.&lt;ref name="Lipski" /&gt; Such regions include the border regions between [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as well as the ones between [[Brazil]], whose official language is Portuguese,&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Lewis, M.

"Portuñol y literatura." Revista de estudios extremeños 62.II (2006): 555-577.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one dialect or standard of ''Portuñol''. There does, however, tend to be a stronger presence of Spanish in ''Portuñol''.&lt;ref name="Marcos" /&gt;

==Contemporary==
In recent years, ''Portuñol'' has begun to appear in realms other than everyday speech. It has become a literary medium, especially in [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]. María Jesus Fernández García describes it as a linguistic recreation of the actual language. However, she goes on to say that the literature only occasionally provides a true representation of ''Portuñol'', and that authors often choose to select only some of the features that are characteristic of ''Portuñol''.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt; One important literary work written in ''Portuñol'' is ''Mar paraguayo'' by Brazilian author Wilson Bueno. The following passage shows the mixing of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in his novel.

The appearance of ''Portuñol'' has prompted two opposing opinions or attitudes towards its existence. On the one hand, it is viewed as the product of laziness among speakers unwilling to learn a different language. On the other hand, it is seen as the logical product of globalization.&lt;ref name="Lipski" /&gt; As far as the future of ''Portuñol'' is concerned, according to [[Francisco A. Marcos-Marín]], it is too difficult to evaluate possible repercussions that ''Portuñol'' could have on future linguistic maps because it is not easy to separate linguistic tendencies that are merely in style and those that are permanent.&lt;ref name="Marcos" /&gt;

The Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act, 2064, Act Number 5 of the Year 2064 (2008), criminalises [[prostitution]] and living of the earnings of prostitution by including it in the definition of [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work Law - Countries|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|website=Sexuality, Poverty and Law|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 67,300 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Although there are no laws in Nepal criminalizing sex work specifically, there are some laws that were enacted throughout the 1980s that criminalize trafficking within and outside of Nepal that are used towards sex work.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shukla|first=Rakesh|title=Sex Work and Laws in South Asia: A Monograph|date=April 2010|series=Monograph Ser. 4|pages=21–26|url=http://sangram.org/Download/Laws_in_south_asia.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hennink"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hennink|first=Monique|author2=Padam Simkhada |title=Sex Trafficking in Nepal: Context and Process|journal=Opportunities and Choices Writing Paper|year=2004|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/34733/1/Sex%20trafficking%20WP11.PDF|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws are sometimes interpreted to accuse sex workers as well, which comes from a lack of knowledge in the distinction between the sex trafficking scene and sex work. Sex work is a term used to refer to all aspects of the lawful and unlawful sex industries around the world.&lt;ref name="kimberly"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoang|first1=Kimberly Kay|title=Dealing in Desire - Asian Ascendancy, Western Decline, and the Hidden Currencies of Global Sex Work|date=February 2015|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520275577|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520275577|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various forms of sex work, including physical and verbal forms. This distinction is one that is not truly understood; thus, many of the policies and laws enacted within Nepal against trafficking—many argue—should not be applied to sex work. Authorities and laws trying to stop true slavery—trafficking—get misapplied to sex workers, clients and others involved in the sex industry.

In 1986, the Traffic in Humans (Control) Act was passed in Nepal and was aimed at stopping trafficking in the form of prostitution.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; However, this act, like many others, proved to be ineffective, mainly due to the fact that the act was “largely aimed at criminalizing prostitution rather than curbing trafficking activities.”&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt;

In 2008, the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act, criminalised prostitution and living of the earnings of prostitution by including it in the definition of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

==Reasons for entering the sex industry==
For many, entering into the sex industry is the only way in which they could survive economically in Nepal.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; However, sex work is not officially recognized among the industrial or service sectors of labor. There is a large case of [[sex trafficking]] in Nepal, but voluntary sex work is more common than many believe.

Among the developing poor nations throughout Southeast Asia today, Nepal remains one of the most poverty-stricken. Research shows that about 38% of the Nepali population is living under US$1 per day, and 82% under US$2 per day.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; Due to this high rate of poverty, the rural poor Nepalese people generally have large families, are landless or have very small landholdings, have high rates of illiteracy and are concentrated in specific ethnic, caste and minority groups.&lt;ref name="RuralPoverty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Poverty in Nepal|url=http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/home/tags/nepal|website=Rural Poverty Portal|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues of poverty are part of why many people, including both cisgender and transgender men and women, go into the sex industry in Nepal. Due to their large families, these sex workers need to find a way to help out within the household. More specifically, there are not many opportunities for the women sex workers, and women in general, to break out of the domestic environment and duties which have left them in poverty, so the only option left for them is going into sex work.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt;

Nepal, like many other Southeast Asian countries, has a limited amount of resources for women. Recently, the Nepalese government has recognized more rights for women in terms of family involvement, physical integrity, ownership rights, and overall civil liberties.&lt;ref name="GenderEquality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality and Social Institutions in Nepal|url=http://genderindex.org/country/nepal|website=Social Institutions &amp; Gender Index|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not change the fact that women are still highly underrepresented in Nepalese society, and do not have the same rights that men do.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt;

Women constitute a majority of these sex workers, because they rarely have any opportunities otherwise. These women may feel empowered by the work that they do, in the sense that they can better provide for their families, and be seen for something other than what society treats women. In some cases, girls that are put into the sex industry are forced to migrate to carpet factories outside of Nepal or in more centralized cities by their families to better provide for them. After a while, they are either abducted into the traffic scene, or coerced to join.&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; The issue of poverty has driven many families in Nepal to desperation, to the point of putting their daughters out on the streets to earn money to help out in the home.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Erin|title=Nepal Sex Trade|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/nepalsex.htm|website=TED Case Studies|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=17 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking in Nepal]]—more specifically, sex trafficking—is a common precursor to voluntary sex work. After escaping from the sex trafficking world, women return to sex work when they return to Nepal,&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; for it is the only thing they know.

==Consequences of sex work==
Sex work in Nepal can be a short-term relief to the poverty and struggles encountered by these hundreds of women on a daily basis. The long-term effects bring a new perspective to sex work, and are a big part of the argument against sex work.

===Short-term consequences===
Many people go into the sex work field in hopes of finding a better opportunity for their families and for themselves. This is especially true in Nepal, which is ranked as one of the countries with the lowest human development indicators in the world, ranked 143 in the [[United Nations Human Development Index]],&lt;ref name="Hennink" /&gt; with an HDI of 0.458.&lt;ref name="NepalProfile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepal Country Profile: Human Development Indicators|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/NPL.html|website=International Human Development Indicators|accessdate=14 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415135354/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/NPL.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because sex workers usually belong to the lower castes of the caste system within Nepal (a survey conducted by UN Nepal, showed that the majority of the sex workers were from Tamangs and Dalits), India, and other Southeast Asian countries, they feel as though sex work is the only opportunity that they truly have to better their lives and that of their families. The [[Nepalese caste system]] makes it very difficult for people of any class to rise up to a higher class. There have been rare instances in which members of a specific class have risen, and even in these cases, the members only rise within their own caste (see also [[Nepalese caste system]]). Due to this social trap, sex work is seen as a way to escape from the social organization. Sex work can allow those in lower castes to provide for their family in a different way.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt; In the short-term, going into the sex industry would seem like a logical solution, since the money that many of these sex workers make can go towards the improvement of their families.

===Long-term consequences===
Sex workers are exposed to a variety of serious risks, including: sexually transmitted diseases, a decrease in security, and a loss of human rights.

====Sexually transmitted diseases====
{{Update|section|date=July 2018}}
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Nepal}}
Nepal faces increasing HIV prevalence among most at-risk populations (MARPs) such as sex workers, injecting drug users (IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and migrants.&lt;ref name="Upadhya"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Upadhya|first=Raji|author2=Erik Nora |title=HIV/AIDS in Nepal|journal=The World Bank|date=August 2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSAREGTOPHIVAIDS/Resources/496350-1217345766462/HIV-AIDS-brief-Aug08-NP.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988, when the first case of [[HIV/AIDS in Nepal]] was reported, more than 1,750 cases of AIDS and over 11,000 cases of HIV infection were officially reported. Since Nepal is limited in terms of its public health surveillance system, the actual number of infections throughout the country is said to be more. [[UNAIDS]] estimates that approximately 64,000 people were living with HIV at the end of 2009;&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepal|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/nepal/|website=UNAIDS: Joined United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this number may be higher, because the limitations of Nepal’s public health surveillance system do not allow for the actual number of infections to be found within the population.&lt;ref name="Upadhya" /&gt;

====Compromised security====
The entry of women into sex work can sometimes take an unexpected turn. Although some women go into the sex industry voluntarily, they can end up being taken into the larger sex trafficking scene to India and surrounding areas. The trafficking of women and girls to India is a major problem which has made international news. Every year, a rough estimate of about 7,000 Nepali girls are trafficked to India, where they are forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2009/02/nepali-girls-traffick-india- |title=More than 200,000 Nepali girls trafficked to Indian red light areas — SOS Children |publisher=Soschildrensvillages.org.uk |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepalese women and girls, especially virgins, are favored in India, because of their fair skin and young looks (see also [[Human trafficking in Nepal]]).

Since the policy of an open border between China and Nepal, a large number of Nepalese women in recent years have been sold into prostitution or as brides to Chinese men.&lt;ref name="slavetrade"&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Kathmandu-opens-borders-with-China-and-triggers-slave-trade-27819.html Kathmandu opens borders with China and triggers slave trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being kidnapped into the trafficking scene, sex workers run the risk of being abused sexually against their will. When things like this happen, it is hard for these sex workers to get protection, because they are seen as criminals.&lt;ref name="SexandMoney"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex and Money: A National Search for Human Worth|website=Film|accessdate=14 April 2012|year=2011|url=http://sexandmoneyfilm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the reasons that many are fighting to legalize voluntary sex work. Many argue that these people deserve protection against harm, just like those that are taken into the trafficking scene.

====Loss of human rights====
When living a life in the sex industry, many argue that the risk of losing human rights is common. Many times, especially in Nepal, the sex industry is run by organized crime.&lt;ref name="Pyle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyle|first=Jean L.|title=Sex, Maids, and Export Processing: Risks and Reasons for Gendered Global Productions Networks|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|year=2001|volume=15|issue=1|pages=55–76|jstor=20000175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex industry contributes between 2%-14% of [[gross domestic product]] in countries such as Nepal.&lt;ref name="Pyle" /&gt; Due to this, there is a great incentive for corruption as far as within officials and the police.&lt;ref name="Pyle" /&gt; “This puts women sex workers in vulnerable positions because the institution mandated to protect people either ignores their problems or takes part in the abuse.”&lt;ref name="Pyle" /&gt; If sex workers were to challenge the authority of these officials—even by demanding control over their own bodies—they are running the risk of being punished within the community and even the law. This is another controversial issue, in that the suppliers are always the ones being punished, while the demand sector of this industry seems to get away with their equally incriminating actions.&lt;ref name="SexandMoney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyle" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Nepal}}
Nepal is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Nepali women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Nepal, [[India]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Unregistered migrants, including the large number of Nepalis who travel through India or rely on unregistered recruiting agents, are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Some migrants from [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and possibly other countries transit Nepal en route to employment in the Middle East, using potentially falsified Nepali travel documents, and may be subjected to human trafficking. Some government officials reportedly accept bribes to include false information in Nepali identity documents or provide fraudulent documents to prospective labor migrants, a tactic used by unscrupulous recruiters to evade recruitment regulations.  Many Nepalis, including children, whose home or livelihood was destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 earthquakes]] continue to be vulnerable to trafficking. Traffickers increasingly utilize social media and mobile technologies to lure and deceive their victims.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nepal 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282717.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Nepal as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19388">Generally, in progression to cancer, hundreds of genes are silenced or activated.  Although silencing of some genes in cancers occurs by mutation, a large proportion of carcinogenic gene silencing is a result of altered DNA methylation (see [[DNA methylation in cancer]]).  DNA methylation causing silencing in cancer typically occurs at multiple [[CpG site]]s in the [[CpG site#CpG island|CpG island]]s that are present in the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of protein coding genes.  

Altered expressions of [[microRNA]]s also silence or activate many genes in progression to cancer (see [[MicroRNA#cancer|microRNAs in cancer]]).  Altered microRNA expression occurs through hyper/hypo-methylation of [[CpG site]]s in [[CpG site#CpG island|CpG island]]s in promoters controlling transcription of the [[microRNA]]s.  

Silencing of DNA repair genes through methylation of CpG islands in their promoters appears to be especially important in progression to cancer (see [[DNA methylation in cancer#Likely role of hypermethylation of DNA repair genes in cancer|methylation of DNA repair genes in cancer]]).

==CpG islands in promoters==

In humans, about 70% of [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] located near the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start site of a gene (proximal promoters) contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]].&lt;ref name="pmid16432200"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxonov S, Berg P, Brutlag DL |title=A genome-wide analysis of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome distinguishes two distinct classes of promoters |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=1412–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16432200 |pmc=1345710 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510310103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21576262"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deaton AM, Bird A |title=CpG islands and the regulation of transcription |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1010–22 |year=2011 |pmid=21576262 |pmc=3093116 |doi=10.1101/gad.2037511 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CpG islands are generally 200 to 2000 base pairs long, have a C:G [[base pair]] content &gt;50%, and have regions of [[DNA]] where a [[cytosine]] [[nucleotide]] is followed by a [[guanine]] nucleotide and this occurs frequently in the linear [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of [[Base pair|base]]s along its [[Directionality (molecular biology)|5' → 3' direction]].&lt;ref name="pmid26216839"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okugawa Y, Grady WM, Goel A |title=Epigenetic Alterations in Colorectal Cancer: Emerging Biomarkers |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=149 |issue=5 |pages=1204–1225.e12 |year=2015 |pmid=26216839 |pmc=4589488 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2015.07.011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3656447"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gardiner-Garden M, Frommer M |title=CpG islands in vertebrate genomes |journal=J.

Genes may also have distant promoters (distal promoters) and these frequently contain CpG islands as well.  An example is the promoter of the DNA repair gene ''[[ERCC1]]'', where the CpG island-containing promoter is located about 5,400 nucleotides upstream of the coding region of the ''ERCC1'' gene.&lt;ref name="pmid19626585"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen HY, Shao CJ, Chen FR, Kwan AL, Chen ZP |title=Role of ERCC1 promoter hypermethylation in drug resistance to cisplatin in human gliomas |journal=Int.

==Transcription silencing due to methylation of CpG islands==

In humans, [[DNA methylation]] occurs at the 5' position of the [[pyrimidine]] ring of the cytosine residues within [[CpG site]]s to form [[5-methylcytosine]]s.  The presence of multiple methylated CpG sites in CpG islands of promoters causes stable inhibition (silencing) of genes.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silencing of transcription of a gene may be initiated by other mechanisms, but this is often followed by methylation of CpG sites in the promoter CpG island to cause the stable silencing of the gene.&lt;ref name=Bird /&gt;

==Transcription silencing/activation in cancers==
{{further|DNA methylation in cancer}}

In cancers, loss of [[gene expression|expression of genes]] occurs about 10 times more frequently by transcription silencing (caused by promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands) than by mutations.  As Vogelstein et al. point out, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 [[Somatic evolution in cancer#Glossary|driver]] mutations and 33 to 66 [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] or passenger mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23539594"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW |title=Cancer genome landscapes |journal=Science |volume=339 |issue=6127 |pages=1546–58 |year=2013 |pmid=23539594 |pmc=3749880 |doi=10.1126/science.1235122 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, in colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, there are about 600 to 800 heavily methylated CpG islands in promoters of genes in the tumors while these CpG islands are not methylated in the adjacent mucosa.&lt;ref name=Illingworth&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Illingworth RS, Gruenewald-Schneider U, Webb S, Kerr AR, James KD, Turner DJ, Smith C, Harrison DJ, Andrews R, Bird AP |title=Orphan CpG islands identify numerous conserved promoters in the mammalian genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=e1001134 |year=2010 |pmid=20885785 |pmc=2944787 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001134 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27493446"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei J, Li G, Dang S, Zhou Y, Zeng K, Liu M |title=Discovery and Validation of Hypermethylated Markers for Colorectal Cancer |journal=Dis.

Using [[gene set enrichment]] analysis, 569 out of 938 [[gene set enrichment|gene sets]] were hypermethylated and 369 were hypomethylated in cancers. Hypomethylation of CpG islands in promoters results in increased transcription of the genes or gene sets affected.&lt;ref name=Beggs /&gt;

One study&lt;ref name="pmid22389639"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnekenburger M, Diederich M |title=Epigenetics Offer New Horizons for Colorectal Cancer Prevention |journal=Curr Colorectal Cancer Rep |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |year=2012 |pmid=22389639 |pmc=3277709 |doi=10.1007/s11888-011-0116-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed 147 specific genes with colon cancer-associated hypermethylated promoters and 27 with hypomethylated promoters, along with the frequency with which these hyper/hypo-methylations were found in colon cancers.  At least 10 of those genes had hypermethylated promoters in nearly 100% of colon cancers.  They also indicated 11 [[microRNA]]s whose promoters were hypermethylated in colon cancers at frequencies between 50% and 100% of cancers.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair with sequences in [[messenger RNA]]s to direct [[Post-transcriptional regulation#microRNA mediated regulation|post-transcriptional repression]].  On average, each microRNA represses or inhibits transcriptional expression of several hundred target genes. Thus microRNAs with hypermethylated promoters may be allowing enhanced transcription of hundreds to thousands of genes in a cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid18955434"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman RC, Farh KK, Burge CB, Bartel DP |title=Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs |journal=Genome Res. |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=92–105 |year=2009 |pmid=18955434 |pmc=2612969 |doi=10.1101/gr.082701.108 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription inhibition and activation by nuclear microRNAs==

For more than 20 years, [[microRNA]]s have been known to act in the cytoplasm to degrade transcriptional expression of specific target gene [[messenger RNA]]s (see [[microRNA#History|microRNA history]]).  However, recently, Gagnon et al.&lt;ref name="pmid24388755"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gagnon KT, Li L, Chu Y, Janowski BA, Corey DR |title=RNAi factors are present and active in human cell nuclei |journal=Cell Rep |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=211–21 |year=2014 |pmid=24388755 |pmc=3916906 |doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.12.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that as many as 75% of microRNAs may be shuttled back into the nucleus of cells.

==DNA repair genes with hyper/hypo-methylated promoters in cancers==

DNA repair genes are frequently repressed in cancers due to hypermethylation of CpG islands within their promoters.  In [[Head and neck cancer|head and neck squamous cell carcinomas]] at least 15 DNA repair genes have frequently hypermethylated promoters; these genes are ''XRCC1, MLH3, PMS1, RAD51B, XRCC3, RAD54B, BRCA1, SHFM1, GEN1, FANCE, FAAP20, SPRTN, SETMAR, HUS1,'' and ''PER1''.&lt;ref name="pmid27683114"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieke DT, Ochsenreither S, Klinghammer K, Seiwert TY, Klauschen F, Tinhofer I, Keilholz U |title=Methylation of RAD51B, XRCC3 and other homologous recombination genes is associated with expression of immune checkpoints and an inflammatory signature in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, lung and cervix |journal=Oncotarget |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2016 |pmid=27683114 |doi=10.18632/oncotarget.12211 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About seventeen types of cancer are frequently deficient in one or more DNA repair genes due to hypermethylation of their promoters.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015&gt;Carol Bernstein and Harris Bernstein (2015).

This review article also indicates promoter hypermethylation of ''[[NEIL1]]'' occurs in 62% of [[head and neck cancer]]s and in 42% of [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small-cell lung cancer]]s; promoter hypermetylation of ''[[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]]'' occurs in 47% of [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small-cell lung cancer]]s; promoter hypermethylation of ''[[MLH1]]'' occurs in 48% of  squamous cell carcinomas; and promoter hypermethylation of ''[[FANCB]]'' occurs in 46% of [[head and neck cancer]]s.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015 /&gt;

On the other hand, the promoters of two genes, ''[[PARP1]]'' and ''[[FEN1]]'', were hypomethylated and these genes were over-expressed in numerous cancers.  ''PARP1'' and ''FEN1'' are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway [[microhomology-mediated end joining]].  If this pathway is over-expressed, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer.

{{slavery}}
'''Slavery in Somalia''' existed as a part of the [[Arab slave trade]]. To meet the demand for menial labor, [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] from [[African Great Lakes|southeastern Africa]] captured by [[Somalis|Somali]] slave traders&lt;!-- slaves were exported from the Zanzibar mart --&gt; were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in [[Somalia]] and other areas in [[Northeast Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Gcam"&gt;Gwyn Campbell, ''The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; People captured locally during wars and raids were also sometimes enslaved by [[Somalis]].&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; However, the perception, capture, treatment and duties of both groups of slaves differed markedly.&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"/&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
{{Main|Bantu peoples|Bantu expansion}}
[[File:Servant or slave woman in Mogadishu.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Somali Bantu|Bantu]] slave woman in [[Mogadishu]] (1882–1883).]]
Between 2500–3000 years ago, speakers of the original proto-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language group began a millennia-long series of migrations eastward from their original homeland in the general [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] area of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Adler, Randall L. Pouwels, ''World Civilizations: To 1700 Volume 1 of World Civilizations'', (Cengage Learning: 2007), p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Bantu expansion]] first introduced [[Bantu peoples]] to [[Central Africa|central]], [[Southern Africa|southern]] and [[African Great Lakes|southeastern Africa]], regions where they had previously been absent from.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d9ac1502.pdf |title=Refugees Vol. 3, No. 128, 2002 UNHCR Publication Refugees about the Somali Bantu |publisher=Unhcr.org |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falola"&gt;Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, ''Movements, borders, and identities in Africa'', (University Rochester Press: 2009), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bantus inhabiting Somalia are descended from Bantu groups that had settled in Southeast Africa after the initial expansion from Nigeria/Cameroon, and whose members were later captured and sold into the [[Arab slave trade]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

Bantus are ethnically, physically, and culturally distinct from [[Somali people|Somalis]], and they have remained marginalized ever since their arrival in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Calp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webdev.cal.org/development/co/bantu/sbpeop.html |title=The Somali Bantu: Their History and Culture – People |publisher=Cal.org |accessdate=21 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Randol Barker et al., ''Principles of Ambulatory Medicine'', 7 edition, (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins: 2006), p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, the number of Bantu inhabitants in Somalia before the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] is thought to have been about 80,000 (1970 estimate), with most concentrated between the Juba and Shabelle rivers in the south.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Encyclopædia Britannica, v.20'', (Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.: 1970), p.897&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent estimates place the figure as high as 900,000 persons.&lt;ref name="Tanzacc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3020110.stm |title=Tanzania accepts Somali Bantus |publisher=BBC News  |date=25 June 2003 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab slave trade===
{{Main|Arab slave trade}}
The [[Indian Ocean]] slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labor, Bantu slaves were captured by [[Somalis|Somali]] slave traders from southeastern Africa were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[India]], the [[Far East]], the [[List of islands in the Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean islands]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Refugee Reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gcam"/&gt;

From 1800 to 1890, between 25,000–50,000 Bantu slaves are thought to have been sold from the slave market of [[Zanzibar]] to the Somali coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/bantu/somali_bantu.pdf |title=The Somali Bantu: Their History and Culture |format=PDF |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016024128/http://www.cal.org/co/bantu/somali_bantu.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the slaves were from the [[Majindo]], [[Makua (people)|Makua]], [[Nyasa people|Nyasa]], [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]], [[Zalama]], [[Zaramo]] and [[Zigua people|Zigua]] ethnic groups of [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]]. Collectively, these Bantu groups are known as ''Mushunguli'', which is a term taken from ''Mzigula'', the Zigua tribe's word for "people" (the word holds multiple implied meanings including "worker", "foreigner", and "slave").&lt;ref name="Refugee Reports"&gt;Refugee Reports, November 2002, Volume 23, Number 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bantu adult and children slaves (referred to collectively as ''jareer'' by their Somali masters&lt;ref name="USRCLS"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;) were purchased in the slave market exclusively to do undesirable work on plantation grounds.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt; They were made to work in [[plantation]]s owned by Somalis along the southern [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba River|Jubba]] rivers, harvesting lucrative cash crops such as grain and cotton.&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;Henry Louis Gates, ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', (Oxford University Press: 1999), p.1746&lt;/ref&gt; Bantu slaves toiled under the control of and separately from their Somali patrons.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt;

In terms of legal considerations, Bantu slaves were devalued. Somali social mores strongly discouraged, censured and looked down upon any kind of sexual contact with Bantu slaves. Freedom for these plantation slaves was also often acquired through escape.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt;

As part of a broader practice then common among slave owners in [[Northeast Africa]], some Somali masters in the hinterland near [[Mogadishu]] reportedly used to [[Female circumcision|circumcise]] their female slaves so as to increase the latter's perceived value in the slave market. In 1609, the Portuguese missionary [[João dos Santos]] reported that one such group had a "custome to sew up their females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their masters put in them."&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackie|first=Gerry|title=Ending Footbinding and Infibulation: A Convention Account|journal=American Sociological Review|date=December 1996|volume=61|issue=6|pages=999–1017|url=http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2013|doi=10.2307/2096305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the first fugitive slaves from the Shebelle valley began to settle in the Jubba valley.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Italian colonial administration abolished slavery in Somalia at the turn of the 20th century. Some Bantu groups, however, remained enslaved well until the 1930s, and continued to be despised and discriminated against by large parts of Somali society.&lt;ref name="Laitin1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=David D. Laitin|title=Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR8A4tEYZUAC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1 May 1977|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46791-7|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bantus were also conscripted to forced labor on Italian-owned plantations since the Somalis themselves were averse to what they deemed menial labor,&lt;ref&gt;Laitin, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; and because the [[Italians]] viewed the [[Somali people|Somalis]] as racially superior to the Bantu.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|While upholding the perception of Somalis as distinct from and superior to the European construct of "black Africans", both British and Italian colonial administrators placed the Jubba valley population in the latter category. Colonial discourse described the Jubba valley as occupied by a distinct group of inferior races, collectively identified as the WaGosha by the British and the WaGoscia by the Italians. Colonial authorities administratively distinguished the Gosha as an inferior social category, delineating a separate Gosha political district called Goshaland, and proposing a "native reserve" for the Gosha.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt;}}

===Nilotic slaves===
In the late 19th century, Somalis also captured other ''jareer'' peoples from the coastal regions of [[Kenya]] to work for them as slaves and clients. Referred to as the Kore, these [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Maasai language|Maa]]-speaking [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]] were later emancipated by British colonial troops. They subsequently resettled on the [[Lamu]] seaboard as fishermen and cultivators. Like many Bantus, the Kore reportedly now speak the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Somali language]] on account of their time in servitude.&lt;ref name="Meinhof"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhof|first=Carl|title=Afrika und Übersee: Sprachen, Kulturen, Volumes 62-63|year=1979|publisher=D. Reimer|pages=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzEzAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other slaves==
In addition to Bantu plantation slaves, Somalis sometimes enslaved peoples of [[Oromo people|Oromo]] pastoral background that were captured during wars and raids on Oromo settlements.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Bridget Anderson, ''World Directory of Minorities'', (Minority Rights Group International: 1997), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"/&gt; However, there were marked differences in terms of the perception, capture, treatment and duties of the Oromo pastoral slaves versus the Bantu plantation slaves.&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

On an individual basis, Oromo subjects were not viewed as racially ''jareer'' by their Somali captors.&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"/&gt; The Oromo captives also mostly consisted of young children and women, both of whom were taken into the families of their abductors; men were usually killed during the raids. Oromo boys and girls were adopted by their Somali patrons as their own children. Prized for their beauty and viewed as legitimate sexual partners, many Oromo women became either wives or concubines of their Somali captors, while others became domestic servants.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USRCLS3"/&gt; In some cases, entire Oromo clans were assimilated on a client basis into the Somali clan system.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

Neither captured Oromo children nor women were ever required to do plantation work, and they typically worked side-by-side with the Somali pastoralists. After an Oromo concubine gave birth to her Somali patron's child, she and the child were emancipated and the Oromo concubine acquired equal status to her abductor's other Somali wives. According to the [[Somali Studies]] pioneer [[Enrico Cerulli]], in terms of [[diyya|diya]] ([[Blood money (term)|blood money]]) payments in the Somali [[customary law]] ([[Xeer]]), the life of an Oromo slave was also equal in value to that of an ordinary ethnic Somali.&lt;ref name="USRCLS3"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom for Oromo slaves was obtained through [[manumission]] and was typically accompanied by presents such as a spouse and livestock.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt; During abolition, former Oromo slaves, who generally maintained intimate relations with the Somali pastoralists, were also spared the harsh treatment reserved for the Bantu and Nilotic plantation slaves.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USRCLS3"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Sophia Jane Craine was born in [[Lonan (parish)|Lonan]], [[Isle of Man]], in 1833, to William Craine and Jane (née Quine).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.im/books?id=siV_3YSLlvUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Sophia+Goulden&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=koEHt1hNxA&amp;sig=dIedAJZVN_Q3KW2f29bG66eUimg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5kszxoOLZAhVFuRQKHaI0CSE4ChDoAQhIMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Sophia%20Goulden&amp;f=false|title=Emmeline Pankhurst|last=Bartley|first=Paula|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415206518|location=London|pages=15–21|chapter=Family Background}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptised 3 November 1833.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Manx Worthies|publisher=Manx Heritage Foundation|year=2006|isbn=0 9547 180 4 6|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Dollin|location=Isle of Man|pages=208–209|chapter=Sophia Jane Goulden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although William was a shoemaker by trade, he and his wife came to manage [[boarding house]]s in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], initially Tynwald House at 3 North Quay,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://namanx.blogspot.com/2010/04/sophia-jane-golden-centenary.html|title=Sophia Jane Goulden - Centenary|last=Caine|first=Valerie|date=2010|website=North American Manx Association - blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at Christian Road.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In her youth Sophia was described as being ‘an unusually good-looking young lady’&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1910|title=Mrs. Sophia Jane Goulden|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq09821.htm|journal=The Manx Notebook|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is likely that she met Robert Goulden through the boarding house, whether he visited it on business or on holiday. Six years her elder, Robert Goulden was at that time an errand boy at a [[Manchester]] manufacturers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sophia and Robert were married on 8 September 1853 at Kirk [[Braddan]], when Sophia was 18 and Robert 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p64293.htm#i642923|title=Person Page - 64293|last=|first=|date=|website=The Peerage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The newly married couple moved to Manchester, where Robert Goulden rose to become managing director of his own manufacturing business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the family would visit the Isle of Man regularly through her life, it was in Manchester that Sophia had her eleven children, ten of whom survived into adulthood: Walter, [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Emmeline]], Edmund, [[Mary Jane Clarke|Mary]], Herbert, Effie, Robert, Ada Sophia, Alfred Harold and Eva Gertrude.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Political engagement ==
[[File:Emmeline Pankhurst, c.1880s. (22913724896).jpg|thumb|Sophia Goulden's daughter, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] (née Goulden)]]
Later in her life, Emmeline was to write of her parents:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Those men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great struggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune to have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their time. I am glad and thankful that this was my case.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;Described as having ‘a bright and attractive personality,’&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sophia and her husband established themselves as members of Manchester’s ‘radical elite,’ exposing their family to radical politics and bringing them into contact with ‘the foremost intellectuals of the time.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was amidst this ‘atmosphere of reformist zeal’&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in the Goulden household that Sophia took her eldest daughter, Emmeline, to her first [[suffrage]] meeting in around 1872. Then aged 14, Emmeline left the meeting ‘a confirmed [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]].’&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The speaker they saw that day was [[Lydia Becker]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who was to play an important role in the Isle of Man's becoming the first country in the world to grant votes to women in 1881 (although it is not believed that either Sophia or Emmeline played an active campaigning role in this).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When her children were to go on their important roles in the suffragette movement, it was reported that Sophia ‘naturally approved and was entirely in sympathy with them in the matter, and was greatly enthusiastic to secure the [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[United Kingdom|UK]]] vote for women.’&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Sophia kept up the connection with the Isle of Man, generally visiting the Island for their summer holidays each year throughout her life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By this time Sophia’s mother had moved to 9 Strathallan Crescent, Douglas, which was then bought by Robert Goulden in 1878.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also here at Strathallan Crescent that Robert died on 24 April 1892, leaving Sophia to live on at the property with just her son, Walter, whose health was poor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Emmeline, [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] and others of her family continued to visit her on the Isle of Man, until her death in 1910 at the age of 75.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Having been in poor health for some months, she had ‘an attack of [[Classification of pneumonia|double pneumonia]]’ which led to her death at 5 o’clock on 22 April 1910 at her home.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

She was buried at Braddan New Cemetery, beside her husband.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She left an estate worth £789 15s 1d and a will which stated that ‘the share which any female shall take under this my will shall be for her sole and separate use independently of any husband and of his debts.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.im/books?id=siV_3YSLlvUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Sophia+Goulden&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=koEHt1hNxA&amp;sig=dIedAJZVN_Q3KW2f29bG66eUimg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5kszxoOLZAhVFuRQKHaI0CSE4ChDoAQhIMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Sophia%20Goulden&amp;f=false|title=Emmeline Pankhurst|last=Bartley|first=Paula|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415206518|location=London|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophia did not live to see the success of the [[Suffragette|Suffragette movement]] and the [[Suffrage|enfranchisement]] of women in the UK, an injustice felt all the more having had the vote in the Isle of Man, as a widowed property owner, for nearly thirty years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1981 Sophia Goulden, along with her daughter, Emmeline, was commemorated with a stamp issued by the [[Isle of Man Post Office]] celebrating the enfranchisement of women on the Isle of Man in 1881.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2016, the ''Friends of Sophia Goulden'' was established in order to 'bring Sophia's role in the history of women's suffrage to greater public attention and to raise funds to create a suitable commemorative monument to her on the island.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/SophiaGouldenCampaign/about/|title=Friends of Sophia Goulden|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-36609125|title=Campaign calls for calls for Pankhurst mother memorial|last=|first=|date=23 June 2016|work=BBC Isle of Man|access-date=10 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, a blue plaque in her honour was unveiled at her former home on Strathallan Crescent in Douglas on the [[Isle of Man]] where she lived at the end on her life. She was only the fourth person born on the Isle of Man to receive the honour. Her great-great-granddaughter, [[Helen Pankhurst]] said: "Sophia's role as a campaigner in the movement, and as mother guiding the interest of her more famous daughter, have so far received insufficient recognition. The plaque can start to change this. Moreover, it's fitting that this plaque will be put up on the Isle of Man, where Sophia came from and returned to, but also the nation that led the way in giving women the right to vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-45359138|title=Women's rights activist plaque honour|date=2018-09-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syrian Brazilians''' ({{lang-pt|Sírio-brasileiros}}) are Brazilian citizens of full, partial, or predominantly [[Syria]]n ancestry, or Syrian-born immigrants in [[Brazil]].

The population of Brazil of either full or partial Syrian descent is estimated by the Brazilian government to be around 3 or 4 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/en/templates/mre/pesquisa-postos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6822&amp;Itemid=478&amp;cod_pais=SYR&amp;tipo=ficha_pais&amp;lang=en-GB|title=Syrian Arabic Republic|last=|first=|date=|website=Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|language=|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/syrians-refuge-brazil-latin-america-war-refugees|title=A long way from home: Syrians find unlikely refuge in Brazil|last=Jonathan|first=Jonathan|date=11 March 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 August 2018|quote="Brazil is home to 15 million people of Arabic descent, including 3 million of Syrian heritage"}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research conducted by [[IBGE]] in 2008, 0.9% of White Brazilian respondents said they had familial origins from the [[Middle East]], which equals less than 2 million people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5279">'''Johan Thorsten Sellin''' (26 October 1896 – 17 September 1994)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi  ''Social Security Death Index'' (Social Security Administration)]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Swedish American]] sociologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], a [[Penology|penologist]] and one of the pioneers of scientific [[criminology]].

==Biography==
Sellin was born in [[Örnsköldsvik]] in [[Västernorrland County]], [[Sweden]] and came to [[Canada]] with his parents when he was 17 years old.  He received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in Illinois when he was 19. He went on to receive a [[master's degree]] and [[doctoral degree]] in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania.

He taught at the University of Pennsylvania  from 1922 until he retired in 1967.  Dr. Sellin came to prominence in the 1920s and 30s for his studies in the use of criminal statistics at local, state, national and international levels. He later helped draft the U.S. Uniform Criminal Statistics Act in 1944.

An expert on crime statistics, he advised the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] about statistical matters and was a consultant to the [[Bureau of the Census]] on criminal statistics. He also headed, or was a member of, various [[United Nations]] panels of experts on criminological questions. Dr. Sellin was a visiting professor or lecturer at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[Oxford]] and other universities.&lt;ref name="NYobit"/&gt;

Active in international groups, he was secretary-general of the Bern-based International Penal and Penitentiary Commission (later called the [[International Penal and Penitentiary Foundation]]) from 1949 to 1951. He was president of the [http://societe.internationale.de.criminologie.pagesperso-orange.fr/lasociete/sic_ang.htm International Society of Criminology] from 1956 to 1965. Sellin edited the ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]'' for 39 years, from 1929 to 1968.&lt;ref name="NYobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/20/obituaries/thorsten-sellin-criminology-expert-dies-at-97.html ''Thorsten Sellin, Criminology Expert'' (New York Times. September 20, 1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Sellin died in [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire]] at the age of 97.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charlesworth, James C. (1969) "The Academy Dips Its Colors to Dr. Sellin," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 381: pp. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
*Sellin received numerous honors, including the honorary doctorates of [[Leiden]], [[Copenhagen]] and [[Brussels]] universities. 
*The University of Pennsylvania Sellin Center for Studies in Criminology and Criminal Law is named for him.

'''Vietnamese Cambodians''' refer to ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] living in [[Cambodia]].According to the news said in 2017 there are 2million vietnames are living in Cambodia They mostly reside in southeastern parts of Cambodia bordering Vietnam or on [[boathouse]]s in the [[Tonlé Sap]] lake and [[Mekong]] rivers. The first Vietnamese came to settle modern-day Cambodia from the early 19th century during the era of the [[Nguyễn lords]], and most of the Vietnamese came to Cambodia during the periods of [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial administration]] and the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] administration. During the [[Khmer Republic]] and [[Khmer Rouge]] governments in the 1970s, the Vietnamese were targets of mass genocides; thousands of Vietnamese were killed and many more sought refuge in Vietnam. Ethnic relations between the [[Khmer people|Khmer]]s and Vietnamese are poor, and the Vietnamese have been the main target of [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] attacks by political parties since the 1990s. Most of the Vietnamese are stateless residents of Cambodia, and as a result they face difficulties in getting access to education, employment and housing.

==History==

Vietnamese settlers began to settle in modern-day [[Cochinchina]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] from the 1620s onwards. To the Cambodians, these lands were known as [[Kampuchea Krom]] and traditionally under the control of the [[Khmer Empire]]. From the era of [[Chey Chettha II]] onwards, they came under the control of the [[Nguyễn lords]].&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (2009), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, Emperor [[Gia Long]] sent 10,000 Vietnamese troops into Phnom Penh and some members of the Cambodian royal family came under the control of the Vietnamese court.&lt;ref&gt;Schliesinger (2015), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; The Nguyen court imposed Vietnamese customs upon the Cambodian populace, and names of towns and provinces were changed to Vietnamese ones. Vietnamese settlers were encouraged to settle in Cambodia and official documents from the Vietnamese court recorded an average of 5,000 Vietnamese settlers coming into Cambodia in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhnt-Saptodewo (1997), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The policies imposed by the Nguyen court stirred resentment among the Cambodian populace and provoked occasional rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (2009), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial administration]] to provide [[Citizenship|subject]] status to Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. Over the next fifty years, large numbers of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (2009), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Population censuses conducted by the French recorded an increase in the Vietnamese population from about 4,500 in the 1860s to almost 200,000 at the end of the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Sch259"&gt;Schliesinger (2015), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Japanese invaded Indochina]] in 1940, Vietnamese nationalists in Cambodia launched a brief but unsuccessful attempt to attack the French colonial administrators.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (2009), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a citizenship law was passed on the basis of knowledge in the Khmer language and national origin, and effectively excluded most Vietnamese and [[Chinese Cambodian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  At the grassroots level, Vietnamese also faced occasional cases of violent intimidation from the Cambodians. During a [[Sangkum]] congress in 1962, politicians debated on the issue of citizenship on Cambodia's ethnic minorities and a resolution was passed not to grant naturalization of Vietnamese residents.&lt;ref name="Wil35"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lon Nol]] [[Cambodian coup of 1970|assumed power in 1970]], the [[Khmer Republic]] government launched a propaganda campaign to portray the ethnic Vietnamese as agents of the [[Vietcong]]. About 30,000 Vietnamese were arrested and killed in prison, while an additional 200,000 were repatriated to Vietnam. Five years later in 1975, some 200,000 to 250,000 Vietnamese remained in Cambodia when the [[Khmer Rouge]] seized power. About three quarters of them were expelled to Vietnam, and the remaining 20,000 who remained are those who are of mixed-Vietnamese and Khmer descent. Those who remained were killed by the regime.&lt;ref name="Sch260"&gt;Schliesinger (2015), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia]] in 1979, virtually all of Cambodia's Vietnamese population were either displaced or killed.&lt;ref name="Tabeau48"&gt;Tabeau (2009), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam established a new regime known as the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK), and Vietnamese advisers were appointed in the new government administration. In 1983, the PRK government formulated an official policy to encourage former Vietnamese residents of Cambodia to return and settle down. Vietnamese immigrants who had no family ties to Cambodia also came to settle in the country, as there was little border control to limit Vietnamese migrants from entering the country.&lt;ref name="Eh56"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese were recognised as an official minority under the PRK regime, and Overseas Vietnamese Associations were established in parts of Cambodia with sizeable Vietnamese populations.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The PRK government also identity cards were issued to them until the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese migrant workers started to arrive from 1992 onwards due to the creation of new job opportunities by the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|UNTAC]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as [[FUNCINPEC]] and the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party|BLDP]] began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the [[Cambodian general election, 1993|1993 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1992, the Khmer Rouge which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The first guerrilla-style attacks by the Khmer Rouge on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and Khmer Rouge soldiers justified the killings by claiming that some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The spate of killings by Khmer Rouge prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1994, the [[National Assembly of Cambodia]] introduced an immigration law which authorises the deportation of illegal immigrants. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] perceived the law as targeting Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia, and the Cambodian government later stepped in to assure that no mass deportations of Vietnamese refugees would be implemented. The Khmer Rouge continued to carry out sporadic attacks on Vietnamese civilians until they surrendered in 1999. Ethnic Vietnamese continue to face discrimination from Cambodian society, and encountered physical intimidation from society and government authorities especially during the general elections or when disputes between Cambodia and Vietnam arise.&lt;ref&gt;Amer (2013), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Population===

The Vietnamese are generally concentrated along the river banks of the Tonlé Sap lake and Mekong river which encompass the provinces of [[Siem Reap]], [[Kampong Chhnang Province|Kampong Chhnang]] and [[Pursat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations may be found in Phnom Penh as well as southeastern provinces bordering Vietnam, namely [[Prey Veng Province|Prey Veng]], [[Svay Rieng Province|Svay Rieng]],&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kampot Province|Kampot]], [[Kandal Province|Kandal]], [[Kratié Province|Kratié]]&lt;ref name="Eh71"/&gt; and [[Takeo]].&lt;ref name="Sch260"/&gt; The Vietnamese population was at its largest in 1962 when the government census showed that they were the country's largest minority and reflected 3.8% of the country's population. Demographic researchers returned higher estimated numbers of Vietnamese than government censuses reflect. For example, in the 1960s, the number of resident Vietnamese may be as high as 400,000,&lt;ref name="Tabeau48"/&gt; while another Cambodian-based researcher, Michael Vickery had estimated the Vietnamese resident population to be between 200,000 and 300,000 in 1986. On the other hand, government censuses conducted during the 1980s put the figures to be no more than 60,000.&lt;ref name="Sch261"&gt;Schliesinger (2015), p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The following population figures shows population figures of ethnic Vietnamese based on figures derived from government censuses:

===Religion===
[[File:Kompong luong catholic church.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Vietnamese Catholic church in [[Kampong Luong]]]]

The Vietnamese identify themselves as adherents of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Cao Đài]] or [[Roman Catholic]]ism. Vietnamese Buddhists are mainly found among impoverished communities living in the Tonle Sap or the rural parts of Cambodia. As Vietnamese Buddhists derive their religious doctrines and beliefs from [[Chinese folk religion]], they participate in religious rituals organised by Chinese Cambodians during festive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese communities that have settled down in Cambodia have adopted Khmer [[Theravada Buddhist]] practices to some extent.&lt;ref name="Ang10"&gt;Ang (2014), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese adherents of Roman Catholicism consist of descendants of refugees that fled the religious persecution during the reign of [[Tự Đức]]. They are split between city dwellers based in Phnom Penh&lt;ref name="Wilmott34"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and fishing communities that are based in Tonle Sap.&lt;ref name="VNCatholicPPost"&gt;{{cite web|author=Post Staff|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/vanquished-70s-catholic-church-still-mend|title=Vanquished in the 70s, Catholic Church still on the mend|date=25 March 2005|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese Catholics make up about 90% of Cambodia's [[Roman Catholicism in Cambodia|Roman Catholic community]], and in the 1960s they had about 65,000 adherents in the country. Most of the Vietnamese Catholics were either deported to Vietnam or killed in March 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2008), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only in 1990 that the Catholic church was allowed to re-establish itself in Cambodia. In 2005, there were about 25,000 Catholics in the country.&lt;ref name="VNCatholicPPost"/&gt;

A minority of Vietnamese are also followers of the [[Cao Đài]] faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within the first few years of its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2008), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2008), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===

The Vietnamese as a whole exhibit varying levels of fluency in the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Vietnamese language]]s. Vietnamese that live in self-contained fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills&lt;ref name="Eh79"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and those that are bilingual in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Eh79"/&gt;

===Education===

Field research carried out by [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] such as Stefan Ehrentraut shows that only a minority of Vietnamese children attend public schools, with figures varying across different provinces. In Kampong Chhnang and Siem Reap where the Vietnamese live along the river banks, enrolment into public schools fare below 10%, whereas in other provinces such as Kampot and Kratie the proportion are higher.&lt;ref name="Eh80"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; As the majority of Vietnamese do not carry citizenship papers, they were unable to enrol their children into public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ang (2014), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; For those who send their children to schools, most of them only attend school for a few years and seldom complete [[Grade 12]] as Vietnamese parents were unable to afford school fees. Vietnamese students also faced difficulties in academic work, as classes are taught exclusively in the Khmer language, and Vietnamese children that grew up speaking Vietnamese at home have limited competency in Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In some Vietnamese communities based in the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, there are private schools that are run by Vietnamese community associations and Christian organisations. The private schools cater the teaching of the Vietnamese language, and are mostly attended by children of impoverished families.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

During the French colonial administration, educated Vietnamese were employed in the civil service administration as secretaries, clerks and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased out most of the Vietnamese civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river,&lt;ref name="Wilmott34"/&gt; and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (2009), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As most Vietnamese are stateless residents, they seek a living through ad-hoc various industries such as the construction, recycling and prostitution industries or as street pedlars. Vietnamese that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; A sizeable number of these stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Vietnamese still live below the poverty line,&lt;ref name="Eh85"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; although a very small number of Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector. One example is Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate [[Sokimex]] which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Olszewski |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/siem-reap-insider/man-about-town-16|title=Man About Town|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=7 March 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with community and society==

===Government===

Almost 90% of ethnic Vietnamese are stateless residents of Cambodia, and do not carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates.&lt;ref name="Ang10"/&gt; The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses.&lt;ref name="Eh71"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their citizenship papers.&lt;ref name="Eh72"/&gt; As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry officials would confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes in order to allow them to carry out fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Ang (2014), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-ethnic relations===

Ethnic Khmers have a poor perception of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon high school students in Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion.&lt;ref name="Wil35"/&gt; Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the [[Cham people|Cham]] and Chinese Cambodians.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Vietnamese are unrepresented in the Cambodian [[Commune council|commune]] councils as they lack Cambodian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; According to respondents from Ehrentraut's field research, the majority of Cambodian commune chiefs and officials express support in excluding Vietnamese representatives from getting citizenship and participating in commune elections and meetings due to contempt.&lt;ref name="Eh85"/&gt; The Vietnamese appoint their own village heads, and convey community concerns Vietnamese community associations ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Tổng hội người Campuchia gốc Việt) that was first established in 2003. The community associations own limited assets and obtains funding from membership fees, donations from the Vietnamese embassy in Cambodia and sale of cemetery land from the Vietnamese communities.&lt;ref name="Eh72"&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The funds are subsequently used to address Vietnamese communal concerns which includes supporting religious places of worship and teaching of the Vietnamese language, as well as providing assistance to disadvantaged families. While the community associations have the tacit support of the Vietnamese community, the majority do not accept membership for fear of getting social stigma from mainstream Cambodian society. As of 2013, branches of these associations are established in 19 out of 23 provinces across Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

The issue of Vietnamese presence in Cambodia has been used as a topic by political parties to shore up electorate support since the 1993 general elections.  Mainstream political parties that participated in the 1993 election included [[FUNCINPEC]], [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party|BLDP]] and [[Moulinaka|MOLINAKA]], and they broached on topics concerning the presence of Cambodia's Vietnamese population and perceived Vietnamese interference in the government during campaign trails. These political parties also charged that the presence of Vietnamese in the country were the cause of economic failures, and promises were made to expel the Vietnamese in the situation that they win the elections.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period of time, the Khmer Rouge which has earlier refused to participate in the elections also espoused similar anti-Vietnamese sentiments with mainstream political parties albeit on a more extreme form. The Khmer Rouge would issue statements and radio broadcasts accusing UNTAC of collaborating with Vietnam, and called for expulsion of the Vietnamese population through force. They would follow up with attacks upon Vietnamese civilians, which continued even after the end of the 1993 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Heder (1995), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 1998 general elections were held, FUNCINPEC and the then-newly formed [[Sam Rainsy Party]] repeated the use of anti-Vietnamese rhetoric in their campaigns. The leaders of these two parties, [[Norodom Ranariddh]] and [[Sam Rainsy]] charged that some stateless Vietnamese had bribed state officials to obtain citizenship and the Vietnamese government still maintained political influence over the ruling party, the [[Cambodian People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, number of incidences of violent attacks against Vietnamese civilians rose, which are carried out by both the Khmer Rouge remnants and Cambodian civilians alike.&lt;ref&gt;Amer (2013), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The number of politically motivated acts of violence against Vietnamese civilians reduced after 2000, and in the subsequent 2003 and 2008 general elections opposition political parties the use of anti-Vietnamese rhetoric was also reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Amer (2013), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, Sam Rainsy charged Vietnam of encroaching into Cambodian territory in their border demarcation exercise, and led a group of activists to uproot Cambodian-Vietnamese border posts in Svay Rieng. Although Sam Rainsy was sentenced to imprisonment in absentia over this incident,&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; the incident became a major focus in electoral campaigns by the [[Cambodia National Rescue Party]] (CNRP) for the [[Cambodian general election, 2013|2013 general elections]]. CNRP leaders also stoked claims on historical ties of [[Kampuchea Krom]],  and led to more anti-Vietnamese sentiments among CNRP supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ALEX WILLEMYNS|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/kampuchea-krom-protests-speak-to-larger-fears-66462/|title=Kampuchea Krom Protests Speak to Larger Fears|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=The Cambodia Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bennett Murray|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/nowhere-call-home|title=Nowhere to call home|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the CNRP narrowly lost the 2013 elections, they launched a series of [[2013–14 Cambodian protests|anti-government protests between 2013-2014]] which resulted in incidents of Vietnamese shops in Phnom Penh being ransacked.&lt;ref name="Ang20"&gt;Ang (2014), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The vast majority of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within the rank and file of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, while at the same time maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrentraut (2013), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge&lt;ref&gt;Amer (2013), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Ang (2014), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Peter Kampiles'''  (born December 21, 1954) is a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee during the [[Cold War]].

== Early life == 
Kampiles was born into an immigrant family. Kampiles grew up in Hegewisch, on the far south side of Chicago. Kampiles' family was poor and lived in a small rental apartment. Kampiles had dreams of becoming wealthy.

== Career ==
Kampiles was disappointed with his low-ranking status as a CIA clerk, and he decided to steal a top-secret [[KH-11]] [[spy satellite]] manual from his employers in 1977 for monetary gain. In November 1977, Kampiles resigned from his job from CIA in Langley, Virginia. &lt;ref name="jonathanpollard_1978"&gt;Zimmer, Robert Lee (November 13, 1978) {{cite web | url=http://www.jonathanpollard.org/7890/111378.htm |title=CIA Official Testifies at Spy Trial | work = JonathanPollard.org |accessdate = June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Espionage and Prison ===
Kampiles flew to [[Greece]], and sold the manual to the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] embassy in [[Athens]] in return for $3,000. Kampiles subsequently returned to the United States and informed his former CIA bosses of what he had done, in the mistaken belief that he would be recruited as a [[double agent]]; instead, he was charged with [[espionage]] by the US Government, put on trial in 1978, and convicted. He was arrested before he could leave the country with his mother.  He had told friends he had plans to buy a restaurant/bar in Athens and had purchased tickets for himself and his mother. He was originally sentenced on November 17, 1978, to 40 years imprisonment; however, his prison sentence was later reduced to 19 years, and he was released on 16 December 1996, after serving 18 years as [[Federal Prison]] inmate "04028-164".&lt;ref name="jonathonpollard_kampiles"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Kampiles Case | work = JonathanPollard.org | url = http://www.jonathanpollard.org/kampiles.htm | accessdate = 30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bop_kampiles"&gt;{{cite web | title = Record of William Peter Kampiles | work = Inmate Locator | publisher = Federal Bureau of Prisons | url = http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=william&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Kampiles&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=&amp;x=36&amp;y=17 | accessdate = 30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
