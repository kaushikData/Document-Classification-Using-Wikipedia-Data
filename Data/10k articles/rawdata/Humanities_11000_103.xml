'''Asian values''' was a political ideology of the 1990s, which defined elements of society, culture and history common to the nations of Southeast and East Asia. It aimed to use commonalities – for example, the principle of [[collectivism]] – to unify people for their economic and social good and to create a [[Pan-Asianism|pan-Asian identity]]. This contrasted with perceived European ideals of the [[universal rights]] of man. The concept was advocated by [[Mahathir Mohamad]] ([[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], 1981–2003, 2018–present) and by [[Lee Kuan Yew]] ([[Prime Minister of Singapore]], 1959–1990), as well as other Asian leaders. The popularity of the concept waned after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], when it became evident that Asia lacked any coherent regional institutional mechanism to deal with the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gred L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tc9dt6eqk9jj1ll0/  "Asian Values revisited"] ''Asia Europe journal'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Various definitions of ''Asian values'' have been put forth. Generally, the phrase alludes to  influences by [[Confucianism]]&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} – in particular, [[filial piety]] or loyalty towards the family, corporation, and nation; the forgoing of personal [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] for the sake of society's stability and prosperity; the pursuit of academic and technological excellence; and, a strong work ethic together with [[Frugality|thrift]].

Proponents of so-called "Asian values", who tend to support Asian-style [[authoritarian]] governments,&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"/&gt;{{rp|page=13}} claim these values are more appropriate for the region than [[Western democracy]] with its emphasis on individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R Thompson, [http://sites.asiasociety.org/asia21summit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PacificAsia.pdf "Pacific Asia after 'Asian values'"], ''Third World Quarterly'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Asian values" were codified and promoted in the [[universal declaration of human rights#Bangkok Declaration|Bangkok Declaration of 1993]], which re-emphasized the principles of sovereignty, self-determination, and non-interference in civil and political rights. They included:
*Preference for [[social]] harmony;
*Concern with [[socio-economic]] prosperity and the collective well-being of the community;
*Loyalty and respect towards figures of authority;
*Preference for [[collectivism]] and [[communitarianism]].

== History ==
Historically, there has been no shared "Asian" identity, and the concept of unified geographical regional identity at the time of its popularity in the 20th century was not strictly limited to Asia.&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"&gt;De Bary W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pg5z-ho6Y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Asian Values and Human Rights: A Confucian Communitarian Perspective."] Harvard University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0674049551}}, 9780674049550.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=2}} Asian values gained popularity in the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Malaysia]] (under [[Mahathir Mohamad]]), [[Singapore]] (under [[Lee Kuan Yew]]), [[Indonesia]] and in [[Japan]] (perhaps as early as the pre World War II era).&lt;ref&gt;Bar M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBXMOLjOVAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Cultural Politics and Asian Values: The Tepid War."] Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0415338263}}, 9780415338264.&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the study of Asian values was seen as a way to understand Asia and foster a closer relationship with the region.&lt;ref&gt;Cauquelin J. et al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A42sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Asian Values: Encounter with Diversity."] Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|1136841253}}, 9781136841255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents in Malaysia and Singapore claim the concept helped reconcile [[Islam]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Hinduism]] and was unifying because it was different to the philosophy of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Nishida K ''Nishida Kitaro Zenshu'' (Complete Works of Nishida Kitaro in 19 volumes), 4th ed., Iwanami Shoten, Tokyo 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee maintained that, more than economics or politics, a nation's culture would determine its fate.&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria F [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/49691/fareed-zakaria/a-conversation-with-lee-kuan-yew "A Conversation with Lee Kwan Yu"] ''Foreign Affairs'', Journal of the Council on Foreign Affairs, a non-partisan organisation, Florida, US. March - April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Japan, a concept of "Ideals of the East" was embraced in some [[nationalist]] circles because it challenged the West and also because it offered the possibility of Japanese leadership in a ''new Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;Okakura K ''The Ideals of the East'', Tuttle Publishing, North Clarenton 1904, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some attribute the economic success of East and Southeast Asian nations in the 1960s to 1980s to  "Asian values"; a ''third-way'', Asian political model that was an alternative to [[totalitarianism]] and [[liberal democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}{{who|date=May 2014}}

"Asian values" was also evident in the planning of the handover of [[Hong Kong]] to China in 1997.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Beatty B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbBFOPMKrAkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Democracy, Asian Values, and Hong Kong: Evaluating Political Elite Beliefs."] Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 p14 {{ISBN|0275976882}}, 9780275976880.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the concept did not persist. Some speculate it might have contributed to the religious, social, cultural and economic changes occurring in Asia in that time; for example, the [[Asian financial crisis]] and the [[Fall of Suharto|collapse]] of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto regime]] in [[Indonesia]] may have been successfully counteracted by liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Milner A. [http://dspace.anu.edu.au/html/1885/41912/values.html "What's Happened to Asian Values?"] Faculty of Asian Studies, ANU, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krugman P. [http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/swansong.html "Latin America's Swan Song"] An MIT web page article, unsourced and date not stated. Accessed 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama F. "The End of History and the Last Man". Free Press 1992. {{ISBN|0-02-910975-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jusuf Kalla]], the vice-president of Indonesia, linked Asian values with the proposed East Asian Free Trade Agreement and the East Asian Community arising from the [[East Asia Summit]]. He partly defended Asian values by placing emphasis on co-operation over competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200612/01/eng20061201_327303.html "Indonesia calls for countries to bear Asian values."] People's Daily Online, an English language Chinese online news website. Accessed 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Asian values" continues to be discussed in academe with reference to the question of the universality [[human rights]] (as opposed to a position of [[cultural relativism]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Studies of rice farming have indicated how large-scale agriculture affected the collectivist mindset of East Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=T. Talhelm|title=Large-Scale Psychological Differences Within China Explained by Rice Versus Wheat Agriculture|journal=Science|date=2014|pages=603–608|doi=10.1126/science.1246850|display-authors=etal|volume=344|pmid=24812395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to wheat farming, rice farming is a labor-intensive practice that requires cooperation among many people.&lt;ref name="Outliers: The story of success"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gladwell|first1=Malcolm|title=Outliers: The story of success|date=2008|publisher=New York: Little, Brown and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A number of criticisms of Asian values have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Bruun O. and Jacobsen M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=89CPAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false " Routledge, 2003]. {{ISBN|1135796262}}, 9781135796266.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] argues these so-called Asian values cannot operate because of the overriding cultural diversity found in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry J. Heung W. (ed.) ''Dismantling the East-West Dichotomy: Essays in Honour of Jan van Bremen'', New York: Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-39738-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amartya | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = Democracy as a Universal Value | url = | journal = Journal of Democracy | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 3–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lung Ying-tai]], a Taiwanese social and political critic, supported by [[Kim Dae Jung]] (former President of South Korea) and [[Lee Teng-hui]] (former President of Taiwan), argues that "Asian values" is [[doublespeak]] for suppressing universal values such as [[freedom of speech]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim D. [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/50557/kim-dae-jung/is-culture-destiny-the-myth-of-asias-anti-democratic-values "Is Culture Destiny? The Myths of Asia's Anti-Democratic Values."] ''Foreign Affairs'', Florida, US, November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A common criticism of the concept of Asian values is the perceived success of many Asian democratic societies such as [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1783">In [[linguistics]], '''attested languages''' are languages (living or [[dead language|dead]]) that have been documented and for which the evidence (attestation) has survived to the present day. Evidence may be [[Archaeological record|recordings]], [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcriptions]], [[literature]] or [[inscription]]s. In contrast, '''unattested languages''' may be names of purported languages for which no direct evidence exists, languages for which all evidence has been lost or hypothetical [[proto-languages]] proposed in [[linguistic reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_XJRT43MXRgC&amp;pg=PA24|title=A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology|last=Baxter|first=William Hubbard|date=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110123241|location=|pages=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within an attested language, particular [[word form]]s which are directly known to have been used – because they appear in the literature, inscriptions or documented speech – are called '''attested forms'''. These contrast with '''unattested forms''', which are reconstructions hypothesised to have been used based on indirect evidence (such as etymological patterns). In linguistic texts, unattested forms are commonly marked with a preceding [[asterisk]] (*).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bSxHgej4tKMC&amp;pg=PA4|title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction|last=IV|first=Benjamin W.

[[Image:BLB W 1935 LAR2.JPG|thumb|right|450px|[[Darrell McClure]]'s ''[[Little Annie Rooney|Little Annie Rooney on the Highway to Adventure]]'' (Whitman, 1935)]]
The '''Big Little Books''', first published during 1932 by the [[Western Publishing Company|Whitman Publishing Company]] of [[Racine, Wisconsin]], were small, compact books designed with a captioned illustration opposite each page of text. Other publishers, notably [[Saalfield Publishing|Saalfield]], adopted this format after Whitman achieved success with its early titles, priced initially at 10¢ each (later 15¢).

==Format==
A Big Little Book was typically 3⅝&amp;Prime; wide and 4½&amp;Prime; high, with 212 to 432 pages making an approximate thickness of 1½&amp;Prime;. The interior book design usually displayed full-page black-and-white illustrations on the right side, facing the pages of text on the left. Stories were often related to radio programs (''[[The Shadow]]''), comic strips (''[[The Gumps]]''), children's books (''[[Uncle Wiggily]]''), novels (''[[John Carter (character)|John Carter of Mars]]'') and movies (''[[Bambi]]''). Later books of the series had interior color illustrations.

==History==
After the first Big Little Book, ''[[Dick Tracy|The Adventures of Dick Tracy]]'', was published (December 1932), numerous titles were sold through [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s and other retail store systems during the 1930s. With a name change to Better Little Books during 1938, the series continued into the 1960s. Variations such as Dime Action Books were produced by other publishers, as noted by the Collecting Channel's Andy Hooper:

:While the format was pioneered by Whitman Publishing, other firms including Van Wiseman, Saalfield, Goldsmith, Lynn and World Syndicate Publishing all produced big little books between 1934 and 1960. Whitman was also the last to abandon the form, publishing big little books about boomer characters like Major Matt Mason into the mid-1960s. Not all big little books adhered to the original format of text on the left side and a large graphic on the right of each page spread, and the earlier, more heavily illustrated books are more valuable as a result... [[Dick Tracy]] was the hero of the first big little book, and he was followed by almost every major [[cartoon]], [[comic]] and [[radio]] character of the 1930s, including [[Alley Oop]], [[Buck Rogers]], [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] and [[Dagwood Bumstead|Dagwood]], [[Li'l Abner]], [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Popeye]], [[Captain Midnight]], [[Tarzan]] and dozens more. There were also numerous books published that featured original characters created particularly for the Big Little series, and those are now little remembered, usually selling for $10 or less each in any condition. A few titles were ostensibly non-fiction works about famous people, as with Whitman’s ''Billy The Kid'' (1935) and ''The Story of [[Jackie Cooper]]'' (1933), which proves that biographies of child movie stars are no recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Andy. Collecting Channel, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Robert Thibadeau's &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquebooks.net/ Antique Book]&lt;/ref&gt; project at Carnegie Mellon has made at least two Big Little Books available online. Thibadeau attempts to "capture the entire production" of an old book with facsimile images showing pages with wear and tear. "We're basically trying to eternalize that book as it is," says Thibadeau. The Antique Books Digital Library offers two free Big Little Book titles, ''Tim McCoy on the Tomahawk Trail'' and ''[[Bronc Peeler]] The Lone Cowboy''. [[Fred Harman]]'s ''Bronc Peeler'' was a Western comic strip character who was a precursor to another comic strip drawn by Harman, the more successful ''[[Red Ryder]]''.

[[Sam Mendes]]' film ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002) showed a boy reading ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' Big Little Book, but this was an [[anachronism]] since the movie is set during 1931, a year prior to the first Big Little Books and two years before ''The Lone Ranger'' premiered January 31, 1933 on radio.

More than 1,300 Big Little Books and the many publishers are mentioned in Arnold T. Blumberg's ''The Big Big Little Book Book'' (Gemstone, 2004).

==Mighty Midgets==
From 1939 the British [[Woolworths Group]] sold "Mighty Midgets", 32-page books that measured 3¾ inches by 2½ inches (10 x 7&amp;nbsp;cm) and were sold at the artificially low price of threepence; the price subsidised by a full page advertisement on the back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woolworthsmuseum.co.uk/stat-mightymidgets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in [[Jamaica]]''' is illegal, but possession of small amounts was reduced to a petty offense in 2015. Cannabis is locally known as ''ganja'', and internationally cannabis consumption plays a prominent role in the nation's public image, being tied to cultural touchstones such as [[Rastafari]] and [[reggae music]].&lt;ref name="Veal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Veal|title=Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP33|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-7442-8|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cannabis was introduced to Jamaica in the 1850s–1860s by [[indentured servants]] imported from India during British rule of both nations; many of the terms used in [[cannabis culture]] in Jamaica are based on Indian terms, including the term ''ganja''.&lt;ref name="IssittMain2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Micah Issitt|author2=Carlyn Main|title=Hidden Religion: The Greatest Mysteries and Symbols of the World’s Religious Beliefs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmFhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|date=16 September 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-478-0|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

===Prohibition===
Cannabis was banned in Jamaica under the 1913 [[Ganja Law]], supported by the white elites and the Council of Evangelical Churches in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/The-ganja-law-of-1913--100-years-of-oppressive-injustice_15548584 |title=The ganja law of 1913: 100 years of oppressive injustice - Columns |publisher=JamaicaObserver.com |date=2013-12-02 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drug Abuse in the Caribbean: Report of the Drug Seminar Held in Trinidad, November 26-28, 1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjFIAAAAYAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Bustamante Institute of Public and International Affairs|page=43|quote=they were used to justify criminalization of the drug in 1913 at the instigation of the Council of Evangelical...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were gradually tightened over time, with academics noting that the harsh 1941 and 1961 restrictions occurred during periods where the authorities feared unrest in the lower classes.&lt;ref name="KleinDay2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Axel Klein|author2=Marcus Day|author3=Anthony Harriott|title=Caribbean Drugs: From Criminalization to Harm Reduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlJyez-Nr70C&amp;pg=PA20|date=13 November 2004|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-499-1|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce===
While cannabis use had been customary in Jamaica for over a century, in the 1960s cannabis farmers began to take advantage of the growing demand in Europe and North America, leading to increased police enforcement, but also corruption of the security and political systems by the profits from international trafficking.&lt;ref name="Hamid2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ansley Hamid|title=The Ganja Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyoqwS_89ckC&amp;pg=PA79|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0360-9|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decriminalization==
In February 2015, Jamaica's legislature voted to amend the nation's cannabis laws:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Kingston |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/25/jamaica-decriminalises-marijuana |title=Jamaica decriminalises marijuana &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) is a petty offence, and will not "result in a criminal record"
*Cultivation of five or fewer plants is permitted
*Practitioners of the [[Rastafari]] faith may use cannabis for religious purposes
*Tourists with a prescription for [[medical marijuana]] may apply for permits to purchase small amounts
*The amendments open the possibility of a licensing authority to deal with cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana
*Jamaica will continue to prosecute traffickers and target the international cannabis trade

==Cannabis industry==
In April 2015, Jamaica planted its first legal cannabis plant, at the [[University of the West Indies]] Mona campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curacaochronicle.com/region/jamaica-just-planted-its-first-legal-marijuana-plant/ |title=Jamaica just planted its first legal marijuana plant - Curaçao Chronicle |publisher=Curacaochronicle.com |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[Balram Vaswani]], a long time advocate for the legalization of marijuana, opened the first legal medical marijuana dispensary, Kaya Herbhouse, in Drax Hall, St. Ann.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dopemagazine.com/jamaica-cannabis-dispensary-kaya/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS)'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/20520?archive=DSDR&amp;classification=DSDR.V]&lt;/ref&gt; was designed to study the adaptation process of the [[immigrant]] second generation. Immigrant second generation is defined broadly as United States-born children with at least one foreign-born parent, or children born abroad but brought at an early age to the United States. The original survey was conducted with large samples of second-generation immigrant children attending the 8th and 9th grades in public and private schools in the metropolitan areas of Miami/Ft. Lauderdale in Florida and San Diego, California. Conducted in 1992, the first survey had the purpose of ascertaining baseline information on immigrant families, children's [[demographic]] characteristics, language use, self-identities, and academic attainment. The total sample size was 5,262. Respondents came from 77 different nationalities, although the sample reflects the most sizable immigrant nationalities in each area. Three years later, corresponding to the time in which respondents were about to graduate from high school, the first follow-up survey was conducted. Its purpose was to examine the evolution of key adaptation outcomes including language knowledge and preference, ethnic identity, self-esteem, and academic attainment over the [[adolescent]] years. The survey also sought to establish the proportion of second-generation youths who dropped out of school before graduation. This follow-up survey retrieved 4,288 respondents or 81.5 percent of the original sample. Together with this follow-up survey, a parental survey was conducted. The purpose of this interview was to establish directly characteristics of immigrant parents and families and their outlooks for the future including aspirations and plans for the children. In total, 2,442 parents or 46 percent of the original student sample were interviewed. During 2001-2003, or a decade after the original survey, a final follow-up was conducted. The sample now averaged 24 years of age and, hence, patterns of adaptation in early adulthood could be readily assessed. The original and follow-up surveys were conducted mostly in schools attended by respondents, greatly facilitating access to them. Most respondents had already left school by the time of the second follow-up so they had to be contacted individually in their place of work or residence. Respondents were located not only in the San Diego and Miami areas, but also in more than 30 different states, with some surveys returned from military bases overseas. Mailed questionnaires were the principal source of completed data in this third survey. In total, CILS-III retrieved complete or partial information on 3,613 respondents representing 68.9 percent of the original sample and 84.3 percent of the first follow-up. Relevant adaptation outcomes measured in this survey include educational attainment, employment and occupational status, income, civil status and ethnicity of spouses/partners, political attitudes and participation, ethnic and racial identities, delinquency and incarceration, attitudes and levels of identification with American society, and plans for the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">'''Confederate History Month''' is a month designated by six state governments in the [[Southern United States]] for the purpose of recognizing and honoring the history of the [[Confederate States of America]]. April has traditionally been chosen, as [[Confederate Memorial Day]] falls during that month in many of these states.

== State declarations ==
Although [[Confederate Memorial Day]] is a holiday in most Southern states, the tradition of having a Confederate History Month is not uniform. State governments that have regularly declared Confederate History Month are as follows:
* [[Alabama]]&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanton|first=Dahleen|title=Southerners share confederate history|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-22/news/0903210133_1_confederate-flag-confederate-history-month-sons-of-confederate-veterans|work=Chicago Tribune|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Confederate History Month and related celebrations have  been controversial due to the contentious place of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the [[history of the United States]].&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Katherine|title=United, Regardless, and a Bit Regretful: Confederate History Month, the Slavery Apology, and the Failure of Commemoration|journal=American Nineteenth Century History|year=September 2008|volume=9|issue=3|pages=315–338|issn=1466-4658|doi=10.1080/14664650802288431}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Virginia Governor [[Bob McDonnell]] issued a proclamation resurrecting Confederate History Month in 2010, controversy arose due to the proclamation's omission of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20040130-105141-2159r.htm Confederate history month rises again - Washington Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell later announced, "The proclamation issued by this Office designating April as Confederate History Month contained a major omission. The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake, and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed. The abomination of slavery divided our nation, deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights, and led to the Civil War. Slavery was an evil, vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property, and it has left a stain on the soul of this state and nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/apr/07/mcdonnell_statement_on_omission_of_slavery_in_conf-ar-163834 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121005233543/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/apr/07/mcdonnell_statement_on_omission_of_slavery_in_conf-ar-163834 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 October 2012 |work=Richmond Times Dispatch |author=Times Dispatch Staff |title=McDonnell statement on omission of slavery in confederate history proclamation |date=7 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell has indicated that he will not issue a proclamation in future years. In 2007, the Virginia General Assembly approved a formal statement of “profound regret” for the Commonwealth's history of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/02/AR2007020201203.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Tim | last=Craig | title=In Va. House, 'Profound Regret' on Slavery | date=3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2010, Mississippi Governor [[Haley Barbour]] defended McDonnell on CNN's ''[[State of the Union with Candy Crowley|State of the Union]]'', calling the controversy raised by McDonnell's proclamation "just a nit". "It's trying to make a big deal out of something that doesn't matter for diddly," Barbour said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/11/haley-barbour-defends-bob_n_533358.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Alexander | last=Belenky | title=Haley Barbour Defends Bob McDonell's Confederate History Proclamation, Slavery Omission (VIDEO) | date=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Virginia proclamation, the 2010 Alabama proclamation noted, "our recognition of Confederate history also recognizes that slavery was one of the causes of the war, an issue in the war, was ended by the war and slavery is hereby condemned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governorpress.alabama.gov/pr/proc-2010-03-22-confhistoryheritagemo.asp|title=Confederate History and Heritage Month|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of '''East Slavic honorifics''' is used by the speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] to linguistically encode relative social status, degree of respect and the nature of interpersonal relationship. Typical linguistic tools employed for this purpose include using different parts of a person's full name, [[name suffix]]es, and [[T–V distinction|honorific plural]].

==History==

{{Empty section|date=January 2015}}

==Linguistic instruments==

===T–V distinction===
The most important, grammaticalized distinction is between plain (T) and honorific (V) form, the latter being expressed through honorific second person plural, reflected both in personal pronouns and verb declension. Historically, it used to be accompanied by ''slovoyers'' (enclitic -s added to one or several words of a phrase) and analytic verb form “''изволить'' + infinitive”, both of which gradually fell out of use.

The choice between T and V forms is influenced by a number of factors, such as relative age and position, relationship between the speaker and the addressee, as well the general formality of the situation.
Generally, T-form is reserved to informal communication between friends and family members. Depending on the corporate culture, it may also be used between colleagues of the same age. Sometimes T-form is used unilaterally to address one’s inferiors, e.g. by a boss addressing employees or by a teacher addressing students, or by and elder addressing junior.

V-form is used in all formal circumstances, to address elders and superiors, or just to express respect and politeness. It is characterized by using second plural form of second person pronoun (often capitalized in writing to distinguish from actual plural) and second person plural verb forms in all moods. Hortative mood has special polite form ending with –те (-te): пойдёмте (poydemte) instead of пойдём (poydem).

===Appellations===

====Name====
:''For more information about East Slavic names, see [[Eastern Slavic naming customs|this article]]''
Modern East Slavic names are tripartite, consisting of family name, given name, and patronymic. Each of these components can be used alone or in different combinations; additionally, most given names have suppletively derived short form, which can be further suffixed to produce a number of diminutives conveying different emotional meaning and applicable in different contexts.

====Other appellations====
Much like other languages, in East Slavic one can address a person by words other than name or nickname, which can be divided into polite (e.g. ''господин (gospodin)'', “sir”), vernacular (e.g. ''братан (bratan)'', “bro”) and codified (such as military ranks and styles of office). Some of them may serve as titles, prefixing a person’s name.

'''Styles in Russian Empire'''
{{main article|Forms of address in the Russian Empire}}

Since the time of [[Peter the Great]], forms of address in the Russian Empire had been well-codified, determined by a person’s [[title of honor]], as well as [[military rank|military]] or [[civil rank]] (see [[Table of Ranks]]) and ecclesiastical order. One’s position within the clergy was considered most important, followed by title, and then by civil/military rank, e.g. a commoner in rank of Privy Councilor would be styled His Excellency, a prince of the same rank would retain the style of His Highness, while the same prince serving as an archbishop would be referred as His High Eminence. All of these styles are now obsolete and are only used in historical context.

'''Modern Styles of Office'''

Unlike English and many other languages, addressing a person by their office is highly uncommon outside of [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] context (e. g. even during an official meeting it is very unlikely for anybody to personally address a chairman as “Mr. Chairman”). On the other hand, military or paramilitary rank is commonly used, either as a title before one’s name, or by itself, usually preceded by the title ''товарищ (comrade)'', e.g. ''лейтенант Петров (lieutenant Petrov)'', or ''товарищ лейтенант'' (lieutenant, sir; literally “comrade lieutenant”).

'''Common titles and appellations'''

During the Soviet era, the word товарищ (comrade) served as a universal form of address. Later it fell out of use due to its sexlessness and political connotations, while pre-soviet styles seemed either archaic or too pompous (with the possible exception of Ukrainian language, where the old honorific ''пан (pan)'' seems to be successfully readopted). Eventually, such words as девушка ''(lady)'', ''молодой человек (young man)'', and even ''мужчина (man)'' and ''женщина (woman)'' have been adopted as default forms of addressing strangers, which may seem awkward or even rude to a foreigner.

Below is the list of common East Slavic titles given in Russian Cyrillic spelling and English transcription. Note that some of them can be only used alone, while others can become prefixes before names or other appellations.

===Forms of address===
By using different parts of a person’s name in different forms, combined with T- or V-addressing, with or without titles and honorifics, one can produce at least 20 forms of address, all of which are fairly common, but used in different circumstances, as explained below:

'''Full name + Patronymic + Surname'''

Highly formal, used in documents or official setting. Surname-first order is considered bureaucratic, and name-first order more organic

:Example:
:::Кузнецов Иван Петрович, согласны ли Вы взять в жёны Смирнову Марию Ивановну?
:::''Kuznetsov Ivan Petrovich, do you agree to take Smirnova Mary Ivanovna to be your wife''
::English equivalent:
:::Ivan Kuznetsov, do you agree to take Mary Smirnova to be your wife?

'''Full name + Patronymic'''

General polite form of addressing, comparable to English Mr./Ms. + Surname

:Example:
:::[to Ivan Petrovich Kuznetsov]: Мы согласны с Вашим предложением, Иван Петрович
:::''We agree to your (pl.) offer, Ivan Petrovich''
::English equivalent:
:::We agree to your offer, Mr. Kuznetsov

'''Title + Surname'''

Feature of bureaucratic speech used in certain official contexts

:Example
:::Гражданин Сидоров, Вы арестованы!
:::''Citizen Sidorov, you are under arrest!''
::English equivalent:
:::Mr. Smith, you are under arrest

NB: the above three forms sound unnatural with T-form of address, but may be used ironically or sarcastically

'''Appellation only'''

'''''T-form:''''' Used to informally address strangers in certain situations

:Example A
:::Мужик, смотри, куда прёшь!
:::''Hey man (brute), watch where you are going''
::English equivalent:
:::Watch your step, man!

:Example B
:::[to a police officer]: Отпусти меня, начальник
:::''Let go (sing.) of me, boss!''
::English equivalent:
:::Let me go, officer

'''''V-form:''''' Used to address strangers politely

:Example
:::Мужчина, вы куда?!
:::''Man, where are you (pl.) [going] to?''
::English equivalent:
:::Where are you going, mister?

'''Title + Given name'''

Common feature of baby-talk with ''тётя (tyotya)'' and ''дядя (dyadya)'' titles and either full or short form of given name, T and V  forms both acceptable; also used towards and between clergy with such titles as ''отец (otets, "father"),'' ''брат (brat, "brother")''. Marginal examples of other usage exist, e.g. a renowned revolutionary [[Fyodor Sergeyev|Theodor Sergeyev]] used a nickname “Comrade Artyom” (Artyom being a male given name).

:Example A:
:::[a child to a family friend Ivan]: Дядя Ваня, ты ещё приедешь?
:::''Uncle Vanya (short form of male given name Ivan), will you (sg.) come (sg.) again?''
::English equivalent:
:::Will you come again, uncle Ivan?
:Example B:
:::[exempt from a satirical poem about Soviet bureaucrats] Товарищ Надя, // К празднику прибавка
:::''Comrade Nadya (short form of female given name Nadezhda), [I’ve got] a pay rise on account of a [state] holiday''
:Example C:
:::Исповедуйте меня, отец Василий!
:::''Hear (pl.) my confession, father Basily''

'''Military rank'''

Regulations of most military and paramilitary organizations require their members to address each other in V-from; subordinates shall address commanders  as ''товарищ (tovarisch, "comrade)'' + military rank, while higher-ups address subordinates by military rank and surname.

:Example
::[colonel to sgt. Sidorov] Сержант Сидоров, ко мне!
::''Sergeant Sidorov, front and center!''
::[sgt. Sidorov to colonel] По вашему приказанию прибыл, товарищ полковник!
::''Reporting for duty [lit. arrived at your (pl.) request], comrade colonel!''

Military men sometimes use same forms of address, albeit in singular, in friendly conversation

:Example
::Сержант, дай сигарету
::''Give (sing.) me a cigarette, Sarge''

'''Surname only'''

May be used as a rather impolite way to address one’s subordinates, pupils, students, etc. Especially rude when used with T-form

:Example A (T-form)
::Cидоров, выходи к доске
::''Sidorov, come (sing.) to the blackboard''
:Example B (V-form)
::Сидоров, почему Вы не рабочем месте?
::''Sidorov, why are you (pl.) away from your workplace?''

'''Full given name only'''

May be used in V-form between colleagues of the same age. This form became used more often recently to mimic the corporate culture of Western companies, but is not very natural, as one would normally use either ''имя-отчество (imya-otchestvo)'' &amp;mdash; name &amp; patronimic &amp;mdash; or short name

:Example
::Иван, передайте мне документы
::''Ivan, give (pl.)  me the documents''

'''Short name only'''

'''''T-form:''''' Default way of informally addressing acquaintances, colleagues, friends etc. Generally considered impolite when used towards people older than oneself (except close family members, though in the Ukraine it is common to address one's parents with V-form)

:Example
::Ваня, ты куда?
::''Vanya, where are you (sing.) [going] to?''

'''''V-form:''''' Polite way to address one’s juniors and subordinates, or distantly known acquaintances, in moderately formal context

:Example
::[Ivan's boss to Ivan] Ваня, почему Вы не рабочем месте?
::''Vanya, why are you (pl.) away from your workplace?''

'''Affectionate diminutive'''

'''''T-form:''''' Demonstrates care and affection, though may be considered baby-talk. Commonly used towards children, between lovers and intimate friends, though generally not between male friends

:Example
::[Ivan's girlfriend to Ivan] Ванечка,  не уходи!
::''Vanechka, don’t leave (sing.)''

'''''V-form:''''' May be used same way as short name + plural, especially to address one’s juniors or people of the opposite sex. In Russian classics, it is commonly depicted to be used by aristocrats, who remained polite even with intimate friends.

:Example
::[Ivan’s female boss to Ivan] Ванечка, почему Вы не на рабочем месте?
::''Vanechka, why are you (pl.) away from your workplace?''

'''Vernacular diminutive'''

Only used with T-form, expressing familiar, highly informal attitude. May be used by elders within a family or close friends, rude otherwise

:Example
::[Ivan's father to Ivan] Ванька, иди матери помоги
::''Vanka, go help your mother''

'''Slang diminutive'''
Expresses informal, brotherly attitude. May be used between male friends

:Example
::[Ivan's friend to Ivan] Ванёк, наливай!
::''Fill the glasses, Vanyok!''

'''Patronimic only'''

Same as slang diminutive, but used mostly within older generations and not limited to males. In this particular case, some patronymics assume vernacular form with the suffixes –ych/vna- rather than –ovich/ovna-, e.g. ''Ivanovich'' becomes ''Ivanych''. Sometimes an even more informal patronymic may be derived by using person’s father’s short name as a base, e.g. ''Kolyanych'' instead of ''Nikolaich'' ''(Kolya'' being short form of ''Nikolay)''

:Example
::[Mary Ivanovna] Петрович, наливай!
::''Fill the glasses, Petrovich!''
::[Ivan Petrovich] Уже налито, Ивановна!
::''They’re full already, Ivanovna!''

'''Electrical disruptions caused by squirrels''' are common and widespread, and can involve the disruption of [[power grid]]s. It has been [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the threat to the internet, [[infrastructure]] and services posed by [[squirrel]]s may exceed that posed by [[terrorist]]s. Although many commentators have highlighted the lighter side of the concern, squirrels have proven consistently able to cripple [[Electrical grid|power grid]]s in the U.S. and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komando.com/happening-now/342853/the-most-dangerous-cyberterrorists-are-squirrels|first1=Meredith|last1=Cunningham|website=Komando.com|title=The most dangerous cyberterrorists are squirrels|date=January 11, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/24/cyber_terror/|title=Cyber-terror: How real is the threat?

==Scope==
Electrical disruptions caused by squirrels are common and widespread. Between [[Memorial Day]] and August 31, 2013, 50 [[power outage]]s caused by squirrels (POCBS) were recorded in 24 U.S. states. Cities affected by POCBS included [[Mason City, Iowa]] and [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=hickman2013/&gt; Most media coverage of such events has compared the number of electrical grid shutdowns due to squirrels and those due to terrorists. Commentators often embellish and parody descriptions of the squirrels responsible for interrupting electrical service with [[allusion]]s to military action or concerns, for example: "Squirrels mobilize, plot acts of [[cyber terrorism]] against humankind—And they're not acting alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/squirrels-mobilize-plot-acts-cyber-terrorism-against-humankind|title=Squirrels mobilize, plot acts of cyber terrorism against humankind|first=Matt|last=Hickman|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Squirrelus interruptus: 5 things shut down by squirrels—How can a squirrel bring a nuclear weapons site to its knees?"&lt;ref name=hickman2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Squirrelus interruptus: 5 things shut down by squirrels—How can a squirrel bring a nuclear weapons site to its knees|url=https://www.mnn.com/family/protection-safety/stories/squirrelus-interruptus-5-things-shut-down-by-squirrels|first=Matt|last=Hickman|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=[[Mother Nature Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical grids are not the only types of infrastructure at risk from squirrels, but nuclear weapons sites have also been described as targets of squirrel attention. [[Ground squirrel]]s have interfered with underground nuclear missile sites at [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] in Montana. The squirrels are able to tunnel under fences, bypassing [[motion detector]]s. Like their [[arboreal]] relatives, they can damage [[electrical cables]] by biting them. In addition, those that do take above-ground routes onto the base trigger thousands of false alarms each year.&lt;ref name=hickman2013/&gt;

==Prevention==
Squirrels damage electrical distribution facilities by tunneling, by chewing through electrical insulation, or by simultaneously coming into contact with two conductors at different electrical potentials.&lt;ref name=wp2017&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/01/12/are-squirrels-a-bigger-threat-to-the-power-grid-than-hackers/|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=Are squirrels a bigger threat to the power grid than hackers?|website=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dri&gt;{{cite news|url=https://drinews.org/2016/01/15/squirrels-or-hackers-whos-the-bigger-threat-to-the-power-grid/|title=Squirrels or Hackers: Who's the Bigger Threat to Power Grid?|date=January 15, 2016|author=dridrive|website=drinews.org|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the animal is killed by the passage of current through its body.&lt;ref name="Mooallemaug"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/squirrel-power.html|title=Squirrel Power!|first=Jon|last=Mooallemaug|date=August 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention  is complicated by the ability of squirrels to bypass plastic animal guards, gnaw through insulation and squeeze through small openings into substations.&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bushy-tailed-nut-loving-menace-coming-after-americas-power-grid/2015/12/25/d4b4c2b6-a8db-11e5-9b92-dea7cd4b1a4d_story.html|last=Shaver|first=Katherine|title=The bushy-tailed, nut-loving menace coming after America’s power grid|work=The Washington Post|date=December 25, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some utilities are beginning to prevent animals from compromising the power supply by developing automated switching capabilities and other features designed to forestall service disruptions caused by squirrel damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/squirrel-related_power_outage.html|title=Can squirrels bring down the grid?

==Metrics==
Squirrel-caused grid disruption in the U.S. is monitored by the [[American Public Power Association]] (APPA).&lt;ref name="Shaver"/&gt; The APPA has developed a data tracker called "The Squirrel Index" (TSqI) to analyze the pattern and timing of "squirrel attacks" on electrical power systems. The TSqI is a metric that quantifies the rate per 1,000 customers over a period of time, and indicates two peak periods of highest "squirrel activity" or "squirrel peaking months" (SqPMS) in the year, in May–June and October–November, when disruption is greatest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Public Power Association Official Association Blog|url=http://blog.publicpower.org/sme/?p=730|last=Hofmann|first=Alex|title=Power outages and the squirrel connection|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytics==
{{Quote box|width=40em|align=right|quote=According to a survey made by One Security Expert, the real threat to critical infrastructure located around the globe is from the squirrels. It has been discovered that squirrels are causing more damage to critical infrastructure than cyber wars launched by enemy states or organizations.&lt;ref name=cybersec/&gt;}}

Intentional damage by human terrorists is often the first concern in assessing threats to the U.S. power supply; some cybersecurity experts believe a country's infrastructure, such as its power grid, is a likely terrorist target. But according to the security researcher [[Cris Thomas]], also known by the pseudonym SpaceRogue, "We've had power outages caused by squirrels in all 50 states&amp;nbsp;... [including] Hawaii, where they don't even have squirrels, but they do have chickens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/cyberwar-squirrels-shmoocon,news-24283.html|title=Worried About Cyberwar?

==Specific cases==
A squirrel took out power to [[Nasdaq]]'s automated trading computer in 1987. The stock exchange went without power for 90 minutes. Twenty million trades were affected.&lt;ref name=wp2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/01/18/most-cybersecurity-experts-are-worried-about-russian-hackers-one-says-look-a-squirrel/|title=Most cybersecurity experts are worried about Russian hackers.

[[John C. Inglis]], the former deputy director of the U.S. National Security Agency, said in 2015 that he judged the electrical grid was as likely to be paralyzed by a [[natural disaster]] as by a cyberattack and added: "[F]rankly, the No. 1 threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/18/accused-iran-dam-hack-cyber-squirrel/ |title=America accuses Iran of hacking the dam, cyber-squirrels rejoice|quote=While America is worrying about nation states, our infrastructure is being terrorized by rodents |website=Engadget |first=Violet|last=Blue|date=March 18, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/3024873/security/how-much-at-risk-is-the-uss-critical-infrastructure.html|title=How much at risk is the U.S.'s critical infrastructure?|first=Taylor|last=Armerding|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with squirrels, [[Baby monitor|baby-monitoring devices]] have also have been exposed as potential threats to cyber security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/clapper-americas-greatest-threat-is-internet-things|title=Clapper: America’s Greatest Threat Is The Internet of Things|quote=Encrypt toasters and win the cyberwar|first=Kelsey D.|last=Atherton|date=February 9, 2016|work=[[Popular Science]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concerns exist in Germany, where in 2005, a "cyber squirrel" crippled the entire electrical grid south of the River Elster for an hour. This squirrel was described as "a furry suicide bomber" ("pelzige[r] Selbstmordattentäter").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.de/collection/life/cybersquirrel-sammelt-alle-eichhoernchen-angriffe-auf-die-netz-infrastruktur|title=Eichhörnchen vs. the Internet |website=Wired.de |date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ewenny Priory Church.jpg|thumb|250px|Ewenny Priory Church ]]
'''Ewenny Priory''' ({{lang-cy|Priordy Ewenni}}), in [[Ewenny]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], was a [[monastery]] of the [[Benedictine]] order, founded in the 12th century.

The priory was unusual in having military-style defences and is widely regarded as one of the finest fortified religious buildings in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Over the centuries the priory has sustained some damage, and following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], was, like many of its kind, converted into a private house, [[Ewenny Priory House]], which is still inhabited by its current owners, the Turbervill family. The priory is not open to the public apart from the church, where restoration work has been carried out by [[Cadw]].  The nave serves as the parish church ([[Church in Wales]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewenny.org.uk Website for the Priory Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Turner, J. M. W. - Transept of Ewenny Priory, Glamorganshire.jpg|thumb|left|Transept of Ewenny Priory by [[J. M. W. Turner]] ]]
[[File:Arches &amp;c. at Ewenny in Glamorganshire.jpeg|thumb|Arches at Ewenny, 1806 [[engraving]]]]
[[File:Ewenny Priory exterior 062415.jpg|thumb|Ewenny Priory exterior.]]
[[File:Ewenny Priory interior 062415.jpg|thumb|Ewenny Priory interior.]]
The priory was founded in 1141 by Maurice de Londres when he granted the nearby [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church of [[St. Michael]] to the [[abbey]] of [[St. Peter]] at [[Gloucester]] (now Gloucester cathedral), together with the churches of [[St Brides Major]], St. Michael at [[Colwinston]] and the [[manorialism|manor]] at Lampha. The church had been built in the 12th century by his father, William de Londres, one of the Norman [[knight]]s of [[Glamorgan]]. The village of Ewenny grew around the Priory and church.

The priory was dissolved in 1536, and leased in the same year to [[Sir Edward Carne]]. In 1545 he purchased the priory, along with its possessions. The estate descended in the Carne family to Edward Carne (died 1650) who was succeeded by his two daughters and co-heirs, Blanche and Martha. Blanche (d 1685) inherited Ewenny, and married her cousin Colonel Sir John Carne (died 1682), of Corntown, near Bridgend. Their son Richard Carne (c.1669-1713) of Ewenny was succeeded by his two sisters and co-heirs, Frances (d 1714) the wife of Edward Turbervill of Sutton, and Jane (d 1741). Edward and Frances Turbervill were succeeded by their son Richard Turbervill, who became the sole owner of the Ewenny estate on the death of his aunt Jane in 1741.

From Richard the estate descended to Richard Turbervill Picton, who changed his name to Richard Turbervill Turbervill and died in 1819. He was succeeded by his son Richard Turvervill Turbervill (d 1848), who was succeeded in turn by his brother Colonel Gervase Powell Turberville, who died childless c.1862. The estate then passed to his great-nephew Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton-Warlow (died 1892), who changed his name to Thomas Picton-Turbervill in 1867 and from him passed down in the Picton-Turbervill family for several generations.

The church is a Grade I [[listed building]], the house is Grade II*.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11249-ewenny-priory-house-ewenny Ewenny Priory (house), Ewenny], British Listed Buildings.Retrieved 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11250-ewenny-priory-church-ewenny Ewenny Priory Church, Ewenny], British Listed Buildings.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knowledge of Italian EU map.svg|thumb|upright=1.59|Knowledge of Italian according to EU statistics]]
Italian is an official language of [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries' populations. Italian is also used in administration and official documents in [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican City State appendix to the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] is entirely in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian is also recognized as an official language in [[Istria County]], Croatia, and [[Slovenian Istria]], where there are significant and historic Italian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/E01_01_04/e01_01_04_zup18.html|title=Central Bureau of Statistics|website=www.dzs.hr|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527053431/http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/E01_01_04/E01_01_04_zup18.html#|archive-date=2016-05-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/usp_03_EN.htm|title=POPULATION BY ETHNICITY, 1971–2011 CENSUSES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121131555/https://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/usp_03_EN.htm#|archive-date=2017-11-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=l silenzio di una minoranza: gli italiani in Istria dall'esodo al post-comunismo 1945–2004|last=Pradelli|first=A.|publisher=Lo Scarebeo|year=2004|isbn=|location=Bologna|pages=38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In central-east Europe Italian is first in Montenegro, second in Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine after English, and third in Hungary, Romania and Russia after English and German.&lt;ref name="esteri.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/IT/Politica_Estera/Cultura/PromozioneLinguaItaliana/DatiStatisticheInsegnamentoLingua.htm |title=Dati e statistiche |publisher=Esteri.it |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807061658/http://www.esteri.it/MAE/IT/Politica_Estera/Cultura/PromozioneLinguaItaliana/DatiStatisticheInsegnamentoLingua.htm# |archive-date=2011-08-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But throughout the world, Italian is the fifth most taught foreign language, after English, French, German, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iic-colonia.de/italiano-2000/Indice.htm |title=Parte prima – Quadro generale |publisher=www.iic-colonia.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125235444/http://www.iic-colonia.de/italiano-2000/Indice.htm# |archive-date=2009-11-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]] statistics, Italian is spoken as a native language by 13% of the EU population, or 65 million people,&lt;ref name="europa2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf |title= Eurobarometer – Europeans and their languages |access-date= 2018-11-08 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430202903/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf# |archive-date= 2011-04-30 |dead-url= no |df=  }} {{small|(485&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in Italy. In the EU, it is spoken as a second language by 3% of the EU population, or 14 million people. Among EU states, the percentage of people able to speak Italian well enough to have a conversation is 66% in [[Malta]], 15% in [[Slovenia]], 14% in [[Croatia]], 8% in [[Austria]], 5% in [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]], and 4% in the former [[West Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |title=Eurobarometer pool (2006), page 152 |format=PDF |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803015530/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf# |archive-date=2008-08-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
In [[Albania]], it is one of the most spoken languages.

===Malta===
Italian is widely spoken in [[Malta]], where nearly two-thirds of the population can speak it fluently.&lt;ref name=Europoll&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeans and their Languages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|work=Europeans and their Languages|publisher=European Commission: Directorate General for Education and Culture and Directorate General Press and Communication|accessdate=28 June 2013|format=PDF|date=February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803015530/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf#|archive-date=2008-08-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian served as Malta's official language until 1934, when it was abolished by the British colonial administration amid strong local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Geoffrey, ''The Malta Language Question: A Case Study in Cultural Imperialism'', Valletta: Said International, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as the official language of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], a Roman Catholic chivalric order which, while not a nation per se, is still recognized as a sovereign subject of international law.

===Switzerland===
Italian is official, together with French, German and [[Romansch language|Romansch]] in [[Switzerland]], with most of the 0.7 million speakers concentrated in the south of the country, in the cantons of [[Ticino]] and southern [[Graubünden]] (predominately in [[Italian Graubünden|Italian Grigioni]]). Italian is the third most spoken language in Switzerland (after German and French), and its use has modestly declined since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="offstat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/infothek/lexikon/bienvenue___login/blank/zugang_lexikon.Document.52217.pdf |title=Recensement Fédéral de la Population 2000 — Le Paysage Linguistique en Suisse |accessdate=5 January 2006 |author1=Lüdi, Georges |author2=Werlen, Iwar |date=April 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=Office fédéral de la statistique |location=[[Neuchâtel]] |language=French, German, Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129182415/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/infothek/lexikon/bienvenue___login/blank/zugang_lexikon.Document.52217.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
Due to heavy Italian influence during the [[Italian Empire|Italian colonial period]], Italian is still understood by some in former colonies.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729043245/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita# |date=2011-07-29 }} – Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

Although it was the primary language in [[Libya]] since [[Italian Libya|colonial rule]], Italian greatly declined under the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|rule of Muammar Gaddafi]], who expelled the [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian Libyan]] population and made [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] the sole official language of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/21/news/italy.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217024247/http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/21/news/italy.php|date=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Italian continues to be used in economic sectors in Libya. 

===Somalia===
Italian was also introduced to [[Somalia]] through colonialism and was the sole official language of administration and education during the [[Italian Somaliland|colonial period]] but fell out of use after government, educational and economic infrastructure were destroyed in the [[Somali Civil War]]. Italian is still understood by some elderly and other people. The official languages of the Somali Republic are [[Somali language|Somali]] (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic. The working languages during the Transitional Federal Government were Italian and English.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Briton Putman, Mohamood Cabdi Noor, ''The Somalis: their history and culture'', (Center for Applied Linguistics: 1993), p. 15.: "Somalis speak Somali. Many people also speak Arabic, and educated Somalis usually speak English. [[Swahili language|Swahili]] may also be spoken in coastal areas near Kenya."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], Italian is the second most spoken non-official language when [[varieties of Chinese]] are not grouped together, with over 660,000 speakers (or about 2.1% of the population) according to the 2006 Census.&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=837928 |title=Statistics Canada 2006 |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818230831/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=837928# |archive-date=2009-08-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Rica===
In [[Costa Rica]], [[Central America]], Italian is one of the most important immigration community languages, after [[English language|English]]. It is spoken in the southern area of the country in cities like [[San Vito (Costa Rica)|San Vito]] and other communities of Coto Brus, near the south borderline with [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;Sansonetti V.

{{Synthesis|date=October 2007}} 
This article examines '''Israeli views of the peace process''' that is ongoing concerning the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. There are a multitude of opinions and views of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]] elicited at various points during [[Israel]]'s history and by a variety of people. A popular understanding of the origins of the conflict from the Israeli point of view is that it began following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] with Israel's occupation of the territories and consequently the peace process negotiations should stem from this.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004"&gt;Pappe, I., 2004, ''A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other understandings of the conflict and therefore the solution for [[peace]], including some Israeli academics' and peace activists' understanding that a much longer history is involved, differing from the popular narrative often recited.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"&gt;Slater, J., 2001, "What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Volume 116 (2), pp 171–199&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions for how to achieve peace in the region include a two state solution where an Israeli [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[sovereign state|state]] and a [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] sovereign state exist side by side, or the suggestion of a one state [[secular]] solution where power is shared by Israelis and Palestinians. Hardliners believe that Israel should maintain sovereignty over the land it currently occupies and give no concessions to Palestinians,&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; others believe keeping up the military campaign, occupation of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]] and separation from Palestinians is the only current way forward. There is also a note of despair and uncertainness as to how to proceed among some, particularly following the failure of peace summits in the 1990s and early 21st century and the [[second Intifada]], as Kaufman ''et al.'' have stated; "there is a growing consensus that the current political leadership are not able to build a stable peace and resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people".&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, E., Salem, W. &amp; Verhoeven, J., 2006, Introduction, in Kaufman, E., Salem, W. &amp; Verhoeven, J. (eds), ''Bridging the Divide: Peacebuilding in the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict'', London, Lynne Rienner Publishers, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  As Cowen says "almost everyone wants peace [but] on his or her terms" and this is the crux of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, T., 2004, A road map to Middle Eastern peace – a Public Choice perspective, ''Public Choice'', volume 118, pp 1–10, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The article looks at the views demonstrated in Israel following particular attempts to create peace between Israel and Palestinian groups; such as the [[Oslo Accords]], the [[Camp David 2000 summit]] and the [[Road Map for Peace]]. Also scrutinized are the views of key [[Politics of Israel|Israeli political figures]] and public opinions at particular points. This article intentionally only focuses on Israeli points of view and not Palestinian views (see: [[Palestinian views of the peace process]]), it is not a history of the peace process (see: [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]) or the conflict (see: [[history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]) and it specifically looks at the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and peace process and not Israel's relations more generally with the [[Arab]] world (see: [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]; [[history of the Arab–Israeli conflict]]).

Almost every Israeli prime minister has called for peace talks with moderate Arab leaders over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olmert Seeks Regional Peace Conference|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040200247.html|author=Karin Laub|agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-03-06|date=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Palestinian views on the peace process}}

==Narratives of the conflict==
The understanding given to the history of events between Israelis and Palestinians has a bearing on the solutions sought for peace and how far each side is prepared to compromise to create a peace deal.

===Traditional narrative===
What Slater terms the "traditional [[narrative]]" and Pappe calls the "common version" essentially refer to where Israelis place themselves in relation to Palestinians and the wider Arab world and in a particular version of past events.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; This "traditional" or "common" narrative, as the terms suggest, is both popular and well established in the mindset of many Israelis, both civilians and politicians alike and others outside of the state, particularly in [[Western world|the West]]. The narrative broadly holds that in the 1940s the Arabs were unwilling to negotiate and it was they who instructed their people to flee in 1948 creating the refugee problem that persists today.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; That there are a group of Palestinians who are terrorists who wish to destroy Israel and that the Palestinians are too demanding in their peace negotiations which reflects extremism within Palestinian society, and although the destruction of Israel was initially an aim of groups such as the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and remains one for some such as [[Hamas]], just as the idea of creating an Israeli state covering the occupied territories remains an aim for some Israelis, this has largely been rejected as an aim now and the PLO officially recognised Israel in 1988.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005"&gt;Ben-Ami, S., 2005, ''Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: the Israeli–Arab Tragedy'', London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this traditional narrative is the belief that the causes of the conflict lie in the 1967 Six-Day War and consequently peace discussions should form around the discussion of territorial negotiation.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004" /&gt; Such a narrative leads to certain assumptions about what is acceptable in peace creation and influences how Israelis who hold this perception view the peace process. Slater goes as far as to say that, in his opinion, the conflict continues partly as a result of this "mythology" of Israel's situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian "other".&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, "What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Volume 116 (2), pp 171–199, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===New narrative===
There is an alternative to this traditional narrative: a growing scholarship from Israeli academics and peace activists looking at the history of relations between Israel and Palestine has developed what has become known as a "[[New Historians|new history]]".&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; Ilan Pappe's work referenced here can be considered part of this trend. It has reassessed Israel's role in conflict creation and continuation, demonstrating an awareness of both Israeli and Palestinian roles in the process. As a result of its understanding that the conflict reaches back beyond the Six-Day War, the narrative recognises different causes for the conflict to be beyond Palestinian [[anti-Semitism]] and towards [[Zionism]]'s insistence on creating a [[Jewish]] state in Palestine for example, and consequently views the peace process differently; less fearfully of Palestinian intentions and more sympathetically to Palestinian wishes.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt;

==Responses to peace attempts==
The response by Israeli politicians and the general public to high-profile peace attempts give an indication of how these events, and therefore the peace process, have been viewed.  Although separated here these peace process events are part of an ongoing process of negotiations, changing events and opinions.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

===The Oslo Accords===
''See [[Oslo Accords]] for details of the agreement.''
[[Image:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993]]
The agreement made in [[Oslo]] in August 1993 between Israel and the PLO was seen as a great step forward by many, although views of the Accords were not homogeneous. Some hailed [[Rabin]]'s concession to consider the option of Palestinian self-rule as a welcome move towards peace and away from his hardliner background, others, both within rightwing Israeli politics and sections of society saw it as too great a concession on Israel's behalf. This view is demonstrated by the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by a rightwing radical [[Yigal Amir]] who opposed his signing the Oslo Accords and served to highlight the differences in opinion held within Israeli society as to the direction the peace process and consequently Israel should take.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997"&gt;Yakan, M.Z., 1997, "From War to Peace: Obstacles, Prospects, and Implications of the Middle East Peace Process", in Karsh, E. (ed), ''From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda'', London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion of the reason for Palestinian agreement was held by a few who maintained the view that Palestinians wanted to destroy the state of Israel and that they would not attempt to keep the peace.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997" /&gt; The continued and increased attacks by some sectors of Palestinian society did nothing to aid the view that the Palestinians would not keep their side of the deal.

Israeli commentators lay blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords at Yasser Arafat's door believing his leadership to be corrupt and dictatorial rather than looking at events of Israel's making.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004" /&gt; The Oslo Accords, like previous talks had avoided key issues and the view of peace put forward by Israeli negotiators remained based on the notion of limited sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank without resolving the right to return of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 conflict avoided the longer term view of the causes of the conflict.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004" /&gt; The issue of [[Israeli settlements]] was not concluded, and the extensive building that took place following the Oslo Accords was cited as evidence that the views of Rabin and Israelis in power who did not act in the "spirit of Oslo".&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, "What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Volume 116 (2), pp 171–199, page 177&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of settlements throws up the particular and fairly extreme view of the religious-right in Israel at the time that believed negotiating over territory and the possibility of Palestinian self-rule in the religiously symbolic territories undermined what it meant to be Israeli.&lt;ref name="Jones 1997"&gt;Jones, C., 1997, "Ideo-Theology: Discourse and Dissonance in the State if Israel", in Karsh, E. (ed), ''From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda'', London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers also viewed the peace process at this point as a threat due to the possibility that their homes and livelihoods would be at risk.&lt;ref name="Jones 1997" /&gt; The initial building of settlements and the continuation of such schemes, despite the Oslo Accords rhetoric demonstrates that those at the top of Israeli politics did not seriously envisage creating a viable Palestinian state as part of the peace process.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; For citizens outside the nationalist right the period around the Oslo Accords represented a time when negotiation over territory became acceptable on the understanding that the alternative was the probability that Israel would have to lose either its liberal democracy or Zionist identity.&lt;ref name="Barnett. M. 1999, pp 5-36"&gt;Barnett. M., 1999, "Culture, Society and Foreign Policy Change: Israel's Road to Oslo", ''European Journal of International Relations'', Volume 5 (1), pp 5–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camp David 2000 Summit===
''See [[Camp David 2000 Summit]] for detail of the summit.''

The Camp David summit in the summer of 2000 involving United States President [[Bill Clinton]], [[Ehud Barak]] and Yasser Arafat, was an attempt to agree a deal to finalise issues that would create a peace settlement. Its outcome however was a deadlock and a rejection by Arafat of Barak's offer which offered most of Arafat's demands, withholding only the demand for sole Arab control over the temple mount, the demand for complete repatriation of millions of Arabs into Israel proper, and about 30% of the contested territory. According to Ben-Ami the left in Israel believed Barak and his team had not offered enough to the Palestinian’s to make it a viable option, and the right believed too many concessions were offered and that the failure of the peace process was what they had expected.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; A conflict of views on the peace process was clearly evident within Israel due mainly to traditional views on the character of Israel as a Jewish state, and a newfound desperation among some for peace at any cost.

Israeli left wing analysts have since put forward a version of events that imply Barak and his team did not go far enough to allow Arafat to comply and that far from blaming Arafat for rejecting a reasonable offer they hold empathy with the Palestinian predicament.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; Slater's view is that: "despite the widespread misrepresentation that Ehud Barak offered Palestinians 'generous' peace proposals at Camp David, Israel is still resisting the creation of a genuinely viable and independent Palestinian state."&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, "What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Volume 116 (2), pp 171–199, page 174&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting the consistency throughout the peace process for him of a desire to maintain control over any threat to a Jewish state the Palestinians might have by controlling them. Barak did not acknowledge the role of Israel in the Palestinian refugee situation, highlighting his view of the peace process remains based in the traditional narrative understandings discussed at the top of this article. The collapse of the peace talks and the subsequent Second Intifada uprising left many Israelis to view the peace process as failing and having led to lives of greater insecurity and an increasing sense that the Palestinians ask for too much and offer violence in return and thus the two state solution with Israel's withdrawal to something like the 1967 borders that had seemed to be becoming a possibility became far more unlikely save for some academics and peace activists.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt;

===Road Map for Peace===
''See [[Road Map for Peace]] for detail of the negotiations.''

The Road Map for Peace was introduced by [[George W. Bush]]’s administration in co-operation with [[Russia]], the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]] to try and instigate a phased path to peace. However the Road Map receive little genuine attention from either side of the conflict, other than, as Ben-Ami says, to keep the Americans onside, the real gain Israel received was the assurance of a removal of the military threats from other states in the region.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; Sharon’s rightwing government were not keen to see a true revival of the peace process after a couple of years of the violence of the Second Intifada and paid it little more than lipservice.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

==Political figures' view points==
The views of the peace process held by these figures, articulated by their political action or inaction, all of whom have held the office of Israeli Prime Minister, complement and contrast with each other, often while working in conjunction with each other at the top of Israeli politics.

===Shamir===
[[Yitzhak Shamir]], Israeli Prime Minister from 1983 to 1984 and again from 1986 to 1992 following a two-year spell as part of a coalition government between his [[Likud]] Party and the [[Labor (Israel)|Labor Party]], is considered one of the most hard-line Prime Ministers Israel has had.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; Accordingly, in a period of time where relations between Israel and other Arab states were beginning to shift and global changes were being witnessed towards the end of the [[Cold War]], Shamir opposed shifts or compromise on the situation in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. His view of the peace process at a time when the PLO were moving towards recognition of Israel and a two state solution was that territory should not be part of the negotiation and consequently with the moving times and relations obvious at the peace talks in Madrid he felt both under siege and indifference according to Ben-Ami.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

===Rabin===
[[Yitzhak Rabin]], a hardliner who had two terms as Prime Minister, was instrumental in the continuation of settlements and did not wish for the peace process to go in the direction of Israeli and Palestinian states existing next door to each other.  However it was he who suggested an exchange of an end to the first intifada in return for Palestinian autonomy at the end of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; When Prime Minister for the second time, it was also his role in negotiations at Oslo that led to the so-called breakthrough in the peace process, acknowledging the PLO and the move towards Israeli withdrawal from the territories.&lt;ref name="Barnett. M. 1999, pp 5-36"/&gt;  His plans after the Oslo accords of continued settlement and road building in the occupied territories demonstrated his true views on the peace process; not a desire to return to 1967 borders but a separation in some form of Palestinians from Israelis.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997" /&gt; However it is suggested by Slater that towards the end of his life he was moving toward the idea of some kind of Palestinian state.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; Rabin also saw peace as essential for Israel to build up its economy and not only that but peace to increase regional development and standards of living not just in Israel.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

===Peres===
[[File:Shimon Peres in Brazil-cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Shimon Peres]]
[[Shimon Peres]] has held many posts within Israeli politics, including the role of Prime Minister. He is credited as being a key instigator in the occurrence of the Oslo Accords and held many similar views towards the peace process as Rabin.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Siman-Tov, Y., 1997, "Peace-Making with the Palestinians: Change and Legitimacy," in Karsh, E. (ed), ''From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel’s Troubled Agenda'', London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; The Camp David negotiations in 2000 brought Peres' criticism for the making of too many concessions for the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; For he held that a viable Palestinian state should not be formed and consequently stepped up the move to make inroads into Palestinian territories.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt;

===Netanyahu===
[[File:Benjamin_Netanyahu_2012.jpg|thumb|150px|Benjamin Netanyahu]]
[[Benjamin Netanyahu]] became Prime Minister as leader of the Likud Party in 1996 and had an immediate effect, and an adverse one according to Yakan, on the peace process.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997" /&gt; He attempted to slow down the Oslo process in order to create better security and due to his severe reservations of it.&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, E., 1997, "Peace Despite Everything," in Karsh, E. (ed), ''From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda'', London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Netanyahu is a recognised opponent of territorial negotiation and land for peace deals and he wanted results rather than declarations.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997" /&gt; The regard he and other Likud members held Rabin and Peres in following their negotiations with the PLO during the Oslo process demonstrates his view of the peace process as undesirable and as abandoning the notion of what Israel should be.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bar-Siman-Tov]], Y., 1997, "Peace-Making with the Palestinians: Change and Legitimacy," in Karsh, E. (ed), ''From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda'', London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;  He, like his successors in office, Barak and Sharon, believed that if the creation of some form of Palestinian state was completely unavoidable it should only be in the Gaza Strip, part of the West Bank, and Israel should remain the military and sovereign ruler over the settlements, all of Jerusalem and important points such as the [[aquifers]].&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt;

===Barak===
[[Ehud Barak]] took office as Prime Minister in 1999 as leader of the Labor Party. His time in office and the decisions he made have been described as "schizoid" by Slater for the apparent changes in direction he took.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, "What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process," ''Political Science Quarterly'', Volume 116 (2), pp 171–199, page 179&lt;/ref&gt; He went further than any other Israeli Prime Minister in the deals he offered the Palestinians at Camp David, but he has himself described his loyalties to the rightwing—he had opposed the Oslo agreements—only making such peace offers out of pragmatism for the knowledge that controlling Palestinians was only going to lead to continued violence.  After the failed negotiations and the concessions he offered, he continued to make reference to his desire for a [[Greater Israel]].&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt;  His view of the peace process therefore seem fairly contradictory and included placing importance on dealing with Israel’s relations with its neighbours such as [[Syria]] over dealing directly with Israel's relations with the Palestinians in a hope that the Palestinians would become isolated if peace was secured between Israel and Syria. It was only once this channel was exhausted that Barak would deal with Arafat and the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; An important view point of Barak's regarding the peace process is that there were no preconceived solutions to the process and negotiations; for him there was not an expectation that Israel would definitely withdraw to the 1967 borders for example, everything was under discussion in an open ended process.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

===Sharon===
[[File:sharon bush abbas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|President [[George W. Bush]], center, discusses the peace process with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, left, and Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in [[Aqaba]], Jordan, 4 June 2003.]]

[[Ariel Sharon]] succeeded Barak as Prime Minister in 2001 and brought with him a rightwing government in the face of the violent period of the second intifada. His reluctance to implement the goals of the 'Road Map for Peace' demonstrated his unwillingness to negotiate and make gestures towards developments in the peace process.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; Indeed, Ben-Ami says that Sharon has always harboured a hidden agenda: "the sterilization of the Palestinian national movement…and the confinement of a Palestinian homeland within scattered enclaves surrounded by Israeli settlements, strategic military areas and a network of bypass roads for the exclusive use of the Israeli occupier."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, S., 2005, ''Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: the Israeli–Arab Tragedy'', London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, page 297&lt;/ref&gt; As Sharon views a Palestinian national movement as a threat to Israel and its 'Jewishness'’ and consequently would rather allow an independent state, although militarily weak.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; The dismantling of settlements in Gaza, instigated by Sharon, represents not only an unprecedented step by Israel but also that Sharon had decided unilateral action rather than a two state negotiation was the way forward to move towards peace.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;

==Views from Israeli society==
Israel is characterised by a multitude of opinions and views of the peace process that vary across time as well as across society. There are right-wing opinions (both secular and religious) which believe Israel should not concede to Palestinian demands and instead should maintain the original Zionist vision of Israel.&lt;ref name="Jones 1997" /&gt; There are those that hold left-wing viewpoints that believe Palestinians should have a sovereign state and Israel needs to go further in compromising to create peace; and there is a spread of people in between with varied views.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt; For example, Israeli elites wanted peace in the 1990s so as to build Israel's economy and integrate into the global economy that was opening up in the post–Cold War period.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett. M., 1999, "Culture, Society and Foreign Policy Change: Israel's Road to Oslo", ''European Journal of International Relations'', Volume 5 (1), pp 5–36&lt;/ref&gt; The slowing down and deterioration of peace relations with Palestinians under Netanyahu's leadership frustrated many Israelis who view peace as a path to stability.&lt;ref name="Yakan 1997" /&gt; Public opinions change, as Slater says, the notion of a withdrawal from the territories and Palestinians gaining their own state was unthinkable in most circles prior to the 1990s, however a decade later it was an accepted central theme of the peace process for many.&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, pp 171-199"/&gt; The violence of the second intifada however has altered this opinion to a popular belief that this may no longer be a viable solution as military responses rather than negotiation has taken precedence.&lt;ref name="Pappe 2004" /&gt;

'''La Joya''' is a [[mesoamerica]]n prehispanic archeological site, located in the municipality of [[Medellín, Veracruz]] in central [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], about 15 kilometers from the Veracruz City, near the confluence of the Jamapa and Cotaxtla Rivers.

The site, discovered and registered in 1935, is known as “La Joya de San Martin Garabato” and comprises several earthen structures from an alleged early Olmec origin.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

Remains of a continued human occupation throughout the classical period (200 BCE – 1000 CE) have been found), about 95% of the structures are destroyed by the common human carelessness and destruction.&lt;ref name=Liberal&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date= August 16, 2008 |title= Rescatan pirámide de barro.

This city probably was an important political center in Veracruz, similar to Cerro de las Mesas, with monumental stamped earthen architecture.&lt;ref name=Annick1&gt;{{cite web |first= Annick J.E. |last= Daneels |title= Project Grant Report, La Joya pyramid, Central Veracruz, Mexico: Classic Period Earthen Architecture |url= http://www.doaks.org/research/pre_columbian/doaks_pco_project_grant_report_2007.html |publisher= Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |location=  |language=  |trans-title=  |accessdate= 23 Feb 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123115640/http://doaks.org/research/pre_columbian/doaks_pco_project_grant_report_2007.html |archivedate= 2010-11-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Two monumental platforms, apparently palatial residences, revealed a chronology during the first millennium CE, suggesting a well-organized society, providing new information on the Protoclassical (epi-Olmec) and Classical society.&lt;ref name=Annick&gt;{{cite web |first= Annick J.E. |last= Daneels |title= La Joya, Monumental Earthen Architecture at La Joya, Veracruz, México |url= http://www.famsi.org/reports/07021/ |publisher= FAMSI |location= |language= |year= 2008|accessdate=23 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The history of the native peoples of the state of Veracruz is complex. In the pre-Columbian period, the modern-day state of Veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures. The [[Huasteca|Huastecos]] and [[Otomi people|Otomis]] occupied the north, while the [[Totonac]]s resided in the north-center. The [[Olmec]]s, one of the oldest cultures in the Americas, became dominant in the southern part of Veracruz.&lt;ref name="schmal"/&gt; Remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as Pánuco, [[Castillo de Teayo (Mesoamerican site)|Castillo de Teayo]], El Zapotal, Las Higueras, Quiahuiztlán, [[El Tajín]], [[Cempoala]], [[Tres Zapotes]] and [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] .&lt;ref name="enchistoria"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/ |title= Historia |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title= History |accessdate= August 3, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191401/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/ |archivedate= June 16, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology studies of archaeological sites in northern Veracruz show that the area has been occupied at least since 5600 B.C. and show how nomadic hunters and gatherers eventually became sedentary farmers, building more complex societies, even before the rise of the city of El Tajín.&lt;ref name="wilkerson23"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K. |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pace of this societal progression became more rapid with the rise of the neighboring [[Olmec]] civilization around 1150 B.C., although the Olmecs were never here in great numbers.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wilkerson |first1= S Jeffrey K. |date=August 1980 |title= Man’s Eighty Centuries in Veracruz |journal= National Geographic |volume=158 |issue=2 |pages=214–217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Olmecs===
The first major civilization in territory of the current state is that of the Olmecs, whose origin is unknown. Theories vary, including [[Olmec alternative origin speculations|a fringe speculation which lacks scientific credibility]] in which Africans arrive in Campeche then northward to Veracruz over 3,500 years ago. The Olmecs settled in the Coatzacoalcos River region and it became the center of Olmec culture. The main ceremonial center here was San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán. Other major centers in the state include Tres Zapotes in the city of Veracruz and [[La Venta]] in Tabasco. The culture reached its height about 2600 years ago, with its best-known artistic expression being the [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal stone heads]].&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt; These ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period. For this reason, many anthropologists consider the Olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many Mesoamerican cultures that followed it. By 300 BCE, this culture was eclipsed by other emerging cultures in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="schmal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/veracruz.html |title= The History of Veracruz |first=John P. |last=Schmal |year=2004 |publisher=Houston Institute for Culture |accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|right|thumb|350px|The [[Olmec heartland]] where the Olmecs reigned from 1400 - 400 BCE.]]
The "[[Olmec heartland]]" is an area in the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] lowlands that is generally considered the birthplace of the Olmec culture. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]] rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]]. Here the Olmecs constructed permanent city-temple complexes at [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]], [[La Venta]], [[Tres Zapotes]], and [[Laguna de los Cerros]]. In this region, the Mesoamerican civilization would emerge and reign from c.1400&amp;ndash;400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from Pool, p. 1. Diehl gives a slightly earlier date of 1500 BCE (p. 9), but the same end-date. Any dates for the start of the Olmec civilization or culture are problematic due to the fact that their rise was a gradual process, that most Olmec dates are based on radiocarbon dating (see e.g. Diehl, p. 10) which is only accurate within a given range (e.g. ±90 years in the case of early [[El Manati]] layers), and that there is much to be learned concerning early Gulf lowland settlements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
What we today call Olmec first appears within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features appear around 1400 BCE. Although Olmec civilization traces have been found all around Mesoamerica and it is considered that the Olmecs were [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures|a main influence on]] all regional civilizations.

The rise of civilization here was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered [[alluvial]] soil, as well as by the transportation network that the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] basin provided. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the [[Nile]], [[Indus]], and [[Yellow River]] valleys, and [[Mesopotamia]]. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population which in turn triggered the rise of an [[elite]] class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

Naylor |author5=Dahia Ibo Shabaka | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this elite class that provided the social basis for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, pp. 26-27, provides a great overview of this theory, and says: "The generation of food surpluses is necessary for the development of social and political hierarchies and there is no doubt that high agricultural productivity, combined with the natural abundance of aquatic foods in the Gulf lowlands supported their growth".&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these luxury artifacts, such as [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and [[magnetite]], came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|source of the most valued jade]], for example, is found in the [[Motagua River]] valley in eastern [[Guatemala]],&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and [[San Martín Jilotepeque]], or in [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]],&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 132, or Pool, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; distances ranging from 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;km away (120 – 250 miles away) respectively.&lt;ref name="Pool, p. 103"&gt;Pool, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Site==
Site studies have been conducted since about 2004 to establish a more accurate chronological setting of the site, as well as its function and purpose of the structures.&lt;ref name=Liberal /&gt;

For many years, the existence of thousands of sites is known, distributed across the Veracruz coastal plains, from the Antigua River down to the Coatzacoalcos and Grijalva Rivers, and even down to Campeche; although this type of construction is part of a little known tradition.&lt;ref name=Liberal /&gt;

Therefore, these findings are unique, there is no information about earthen structures construction techniques in Central Veracruz.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

==Structures==
Extensive stratigraphic excavations results provide that, although the platforms existed from the late preclassical period, during the early classical the main plaza had been constructed, bordered by the pyramid and the monumental north and east platforms, that had palaces probably with administrative, ritual and residential functions.&lt;ref name=Liberal /&gt;

Ongoing exploration shows a complex building sequence, with evidence of refined architecture, and human burials with ceramic vessels and figurines offerings.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

Excavations are only being conducted on the Pyramid, North Platform and East Platform.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

===Main Pyramid===
The pyramid construction probably commenced in the early classical period (100 BCE–300CE), based on ceramic evidence comparisson with findings on the second stage of the North Platform. The three structures have a chronology spanning the first CE millennium.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The structure was 26 m high, and at least had two building stages, from ceramic remains dated between 100BCE–300CE, early classical and 800–1000 CE, late classical.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The pyramid, in 1999 was still a 22 m high structure, with 32 degree angle slopes, indicating the use of some technology to control structural pressures of the earthen fill.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The excavations show that the solution to this problem was alternating fill blocks (approximately 1 m high and more than 6 m on the side) made from clays and sandy loams, readily available in the site surrounding areas. The clay blocks due to their cohesiveness, would form buttresses containing the blocks of sandy loam. Inversely, the sandy loam blocks had better compaction, therefore providing a more stable surface.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The building had access stariways from the plaza level, the staircase had containment walls with sloping sides.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

===Ballgame Court===
It is located to the south of the main plaza.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

===North-east Platform===
No details or information is available.

===North Platform===
This platform contains five buildings, from the second constructive stage; these were part of one of the palaces and probably were used for administrative purposes, with restricted access, with some residential and ceremonial areas.&lt;ref name=Liberal /&gt;

===East Platform===
Located on the east side of the plaza, were the other palace was possibly erected, at about the same time as the other. Many ceramic figures of “nosed” characters have been found, these were not found on the northern palace.&lt;ref name=Liberal /&gt;

Two structures surround the east plaza; these are believed to have been elite residences (palaces), suggesting an organized type of government, at least by 100BCE–100CE, providing new information on the late preclassical (epi-Olmec) and classical period society.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

==Burials==
A series of paleosoil samples containing organic matter was found below the structures, possibly part of offerings.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The excavations revealed the existence burials containing offerings in all platforms, the burials contained human remains, ceramic vessels and figurines.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

The earliest burial was found at the center of the pyramid, apparently deposited on top of paleosoil immediately before the construction. The ceremonial burials seems to have involved the burning of organic material, large patches of carbonized organic matter were located immediately on top of the paleosoil, below the sand fill of the structure.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

Other deposits were found in a roughly symmetrical pattern along the central east-west axis. There are two deposits of human bones and a skull covered by a bowl, a complete vessel buried upside down, and lenticular patches of carboniferous earth.&lt;ref name= Annick1 /&gt;

[[File:Champollion table.jpg|thumb|The table of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[demotic script|demotic]] and [[hieroglyphics|hieroglyphic]] phonetic characters that appears as an illustration in the ''Lettre à M. Dacier'']]
'''''{{lang|fr|Lettre à M. Dacier}}''''' (full title: ''{{lang|fr|Lettre à M. Dacier relative à l'alphabet des hiéroglyphes phonétiques}}'': "Letter to M. Dacier concerning the alphabet of the phonetic hieroglyphs") is a scientific communication in the form of a letter sent in [[1822]] by [[Egyptology|egyptologist]] [[Jean-François Champollion]] to [[Bon-Joseph Dacier]], secretary of the French ''[[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]''. It is the founding text upon which [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyphics]] were first systematically deciphered by Champollion, largely on the basis of the multilingual [[Rosetta Stone]].

==History==

While on September 14, 1822 visiting his brother [[Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac|Jacques-Joseph]], great supporter of his ideas, Champollion made a crucial breakthrough in understanding the phonetic nature of [[hieroglyphics]], and proclaimed ''"Je tiens l'affaire!"'' ("I've got it!") and then fainted away from his excitement.&lt;ref name="adkins181"&gt;Adkins, Lesley and Roy, &lt;cite&gt;The Keys to Egypt: The Obsession to Decipher Egyptian Hieroglyphs&lt;/cite&gt;. p.181 Harper Collins. 2000. {{ISBN|0-06-019439-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 1822, he exhibited at the ''Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres'' a draft containing eight pages of text to a packed room. The final version was published in late October 1822 by [[Firmin-Didot]] in a booklet of 44 pages with 4 illustrated plates.&lt;ref name="adkins190"&gt;Adkins, Lesley and Roy, &lt;cite&gt;The Keys to Egypt: The Obsession to Decipher Egyptian Hieroglyphs&lt;/cite&gt;. p.190 Harper Collins. 2000. {{ISBN|0-06-019439-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display at the Louvre==
On the 150th anniversary of the ''Lettre'' in October 1972, the Rosetta Stone was displayed next to it at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="focus47"&gt;Parkinson, Richard B. (2005). The Rosetta Stone. British Museum objects in focus. p.&amp;nbsp;47 British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-5021-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French text of the Letter==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same word."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Champollion]], &lt;cite&gt;Letter to [[Bon-Joseph Dacier|M. Dacier]]&lt;/cite&gt;, September 27, 1822&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10040">There are about 3,000 [[runestones]] in Scandinavia (out of a total of about 6,000 runic inscriptions).&lt;ref name="Zilmer38"&gt;{{citation |last=Zilmer|first=Kristel|url=http://www.utlib.ee/ekollekt/diss/dok/2005/b1734458x/zilmer.pdf |format=PDF|title="He Drowned in Holmr's Sea": Baltic Traffic in Early Nordic Sources |year=diss. 2005 |publisher=Tartu University Press |isbn=9949-11-089-0}} p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also runestones in other areas reached by the [[Viking expansion]], especially in the [[British Isles]] ([[Manx runestones]],&lt;ref name="page"&gt;[[Raymond Ian Page|Page, Raymond I.]] (1995).

The vast majority of runestones date to the Viking Age and the period immediately following the [[Christianisation of Scandinavia]] (9th to 12th centuries). A small number predates the 9th century; one of the last runestones was raised in memory of the archbishop [[Absalon]] (d. 1201).&lt;ref name="jansson166"&gt;Jansson 1997:166&lt;/ref&gt;
A small number of runestones may date to the late medieval to early modern period, such as the [[Fámjin stone]] (Faroer Islands), dated to the Reformation period. Modern runestones (as imitations or forgeries of Viking Age runestones) began to be produced in the 19th century [[Viking Revival]].

The  ''Scandinavian Runic-text Data Base'' (''{{lang|sv|Samnordisk runtextdatabas}}'') is a project involving the creation and maintenance of a database of [[runestone]]s in the   ''[[Rundata]]'' database.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elder Futhark runestones==
The vast majority of runestones date to the [[Viking Age]].
There is only a handful [[Elder Futhark]] (pre-Viking-Age) runestones (about eight, counting the transitional specimens created just around the beginning of the Viking Age).
*[[Einang stone]] (4th century)
*[[Tune Runestone]] (250-400)

==Modern runestones==
A number of notable runestones of modern origin exist. Some of them are intended as hoaxes, their creators attempting to imitate a Viking Age artefact. Especially since the late 20th century, runestones in the style of the Viking Age were also made without pretense of authenticity, either as independent works of art or as replicas as museum exhibits or tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;  "In December 1997 I moved to Adelsö, the Island there the kings lived in the viking period, near the Island of Birka [...] My capabilities to live on my handicraft became bigger and I extend with guided tours in the ancient area, protected by UNESCO.  On a piece of land, near this area, I build up my place of work and exhibition.  [...] The year 2000 I got honored to carve a runestone as a memory of Leif Eriksson who did the exploration of North America, thousand year ago. The runestone was carved here at Adelsö. When the work was completed, the stone transferred to Canada and became raised at the northern point of Newfoundland / Vineland." (Kalle Dahlberg, [http://www.runestonecarver.com/gallery/01-index.html runstonecarver.com]) 
"The three types of contemporary runestone carvings highlighted in the article are those that are "exact copies of existing stones", "explicitly contemporary", and "new, but with Old Norse"." ([http://ireadrunes.blogspot.com/2012/10/defining-runestones-and-runes.html ireadrunes.blogspot.com] 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

This concerns especially runestones found in North America. There is also a limited set of early modern runestones created after the end of the Viking Age but before the "[[Viking Revival]]".

The '''''Maestà''''', or '''''Maestà of Duccio''''' is an [[altarpiece]] composed of many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio|Duccio di Buoninsegna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' by Christopher Kleinhenz (Nov 2003) [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0415939305}} page 310&lt;/ref&gt;  The front panels make up a large enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]] with saints and angels, and a [[predella]] of the ''Childhood of Christ'' with prophets.  The reverse has the rest of a combined cycle of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in a total of forty-three small scenes; several panels are now dispersed or lost. The base of the panel has an inscription that reads (in translation): "Holy Mother of God, be thou the cause of peace for Siena and life to Duccio because he painted thee thus." &lt;ref&gt;"Art History: Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art" by Marilyn Stokstad (2011) page 543&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of [[Byzantine art]] towards more direct presentations of reality.

==History==

The painting was installed in the [[cathedral of Siena]] on 9 June 1311. One person who witnessed this event wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And on that day when it was brought into the cathedral, all workshops remained closed, and the bishop commanded a great host of devoted priests and monks to file past in solemn procession. This was accompanied by all the high officers of the Commune and by all the people; all honorable citizens of Siena surrounded said panel with candles held in their hands, and women and children followed humbly behind. They accompanied the panel amidst the glorious pealing of bells after a solemn procession on the [[Piazza del Campo]] into the very cathedral; and all this out of reverence for the costly panel… The poor received many alms, and we prayed to the Holy Mother of God, our patron saint, that she might in her infinite mercy preserve this our city of Siena from every misfortune, traitor or enemy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Besides the Virgin Mary and the Baby Jesus, saints depicted in the painting include [[John the Evangelist]] (to the left of the throne); [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]; [[Catherine of Alexandria]]; [[John the Baptist]] (to the right of the throne); [[Saint Peter]]; and [[Saint Agnes]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abcgallery.com/D/duccio/maesta.html The Maestà by Duccio di Buoninsegna – Olga's Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the foreground are Siena’s various [[patron saints]]: [[Saint Ansanus]]; [[Sabinus of Spoleto|Saint Sabinus]]; [[Crescentius of Rome|Saint Crescentius]]; and [[Victor and Corona|Saint Victor]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=stockstad&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn. ''Art History'', 2011, 4th ed., {{ISBN|0-205-79094-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece remained in place until 1711, when it was dismantled in order to distribute the pieces between two altars. The five-metre high construction was dismantled and sawn up, and the paintings damaged in the process. Partial restoration took place in 1956. The dismantling also led to pieces going astray, either being sold, or simply unaccounted for. Extant remains of the altarpiece not at Siena are divided among several other museums.

==Stylistic analysis==

*Deposition
Christ's followers, Joseph and John, remove him from the cross while Nicodemus removes nails from his feet. The Virgin Mary looks into his closed eyes while Mary Magdalene holds his arm, and you can see the painful expression in everyone’s eyes as they tend to the dead Christ. The background has the same gold texture as in the "Crucifixion" and the cross that held Christ has blood running onto the ground, increasing the sense of realism in the scene. This panel aroused the emotions of its audiences and the story helped to symbolize the birth of Christianity.

*Burial
Immediately following the "Deposition," is the depiction of Christ as he is prepared for burial, surrounded by his mourning followers. His mother leans in close to him and kisses him one last time and Mary Magdalene throws her arms towards the sky in anguish. The background retains the gold setting of the "Deposition" and "Crucifixion," and the mountains in the background are similar to the mountains portrayed in previous and subsequent panels. These mountains lead the viewer’s eye to Mary who is accompanying him, and then to Christ’s face. This scene also elicits an intense emotional response from its viewers and you can see the close connection that the burial party has to Christ, and especially to the Virgin Mary.

'''Malaysian Americans''' (Orang Malaysia di Amerika) are [[United States|Americans]] of [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] ancestry. Rather than a single ethnic group, Malaysian Americans descend from a variety of ethnic groups that inhabit the [[Southeast Asia]]n country of [[Malaysia]], all of which speak different languages and profess different cultures, including [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]], [[Malaysian Chinese]], and [[Malaysian Indian]], as "''Malaysian''" is primarily a national identification. According to answers provided to an open-ended question included in the [[2010 United States Census]], 26,179 people said that their ancestry or ethnic origin was Malaysian.&lt;ref name="ancestry2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the actual number of Malaysians and their descendants is most likely considerably higher, since Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians are likely to identify simply as "[[Chinese American]]" and "[[Indian American]]" on the census; thus Malaysian Americans are predominantly made up of the ethnic Malays. Malaysian Americans are growing both in population and in [[socioeconomic status]].

== History and associations ==
Malaysians have been coming to [[New York City]], the West Coast of the U.S., and [[Chicago]] since the 1970s for job and educational opportunities, partly because of political and economic tensions in [[Malaysia]]. Although some students later found jobs in U.S. companies, many students from Chicago returned to Malaysia after their education ended. Community leaders in 2001 estimated that the Malaysian population of metropolitan Chicago had decreased to 600-700 individuals.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/781.html | title=Malaysians | publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago | author=Tracy Steffes | accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three Malaysian government offices in the U.S. whose goal is to assist and supervise Malaysian students.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; One of them is the Malaysian Student Department (MSD) in [[Evanston, Illinois]], which covers the midwestern part of the U.S. MSD sponsors several events each year for students in the region, including the celebration of Malaysian independence, the Midwest Games (a three-day sporting competition), and Ambassador Award Night, whose function is recognizing the academic achievements of Malaysian students.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Malaysian Americans have created several [[community association]]s in the U.S. The Malaysian American Society was founded in 1967 to promote cultural exchanges between Malaysia and the U.S.&lt;ref name="everymaly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Le-Pa/Malaysian-Americans.html#ixzz2WTGMmlqo|title=Malaysian Americans - History, Modern era, Acculturation and Assimilation, Cuisine, Traditional costumes, Holidays|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other community organizations include the Malaysian Association of Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-ga.org|title=Welcome malaysia-ga.org - BlueHost.com|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Malaysian Association of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mascusa.com|title=Malaysian Association of Southern California (MASC) USA|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian Americans also have created several educational associations. The Malaysian Students Association at the University of Michigan fosters friendships among Malaysian students.&lt;ref name="everymaly"/&gt; The objective of the Malaysia Student Association of St. Louis, Missouri is to maintain close relationships among students after their college graduation.&lt;ref name=everymaly/&gt; The Malaysian Students Association at [[The Ohio State University]] is an organization that represents the Malaysian student community while promoting Malaysia's unique cultural identity at Ohio State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://masa.osu.edu Malaysian Students Association at The Ohio State University (MASA OSU)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other educational associations include the University of California-Berkeley Alumni Club of Malaysia&lt;ref name="everymaly"/&gt; and the Harvard Club of Malaysia&lt;ref name="everymaly"/&gt; plus associations at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

== Malaysian Americans today ==
The Malaysia Association of America, based in the area of the [[Chinatown, Flushing]] in New York City, was credited by the [[consul general|Consul General]] of Malaysia in New York for getting the [[New York State Assembly]] to declare August 31, 2008, to be "Malaysian American Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.gov.my/web/usa_new-york/n2008/-/asset_publisher/ME2g/blog/malaysia-association-of-america-annual-dinner?redirect=%2Fweb%2Fusa_new-york%2Fn2008|title=Malaysia Association of America Annual Dinner|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia|accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malaysian Islamic Study Group ==

The Malaysian Islamic Study Group (MISG) was founded in [[Peoria, Illinois]] in 1976 with the main objective to assist the Malaysian students in walking the path of success whilst they are in America/Canada, fulfilling their responsibilities as students, as members of their communities and as servants of God. After more than 30 years of its establishment, MISG has a sizeable number of members in almost each university in America which has Malaysian students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misgonline.com/history.html MISG Online - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308023344/http://www.misgonline.com/history.html |date=2008-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to all the other Islamic organizations in America, MISG is viewed as a foreigners-based Muslim student group that emerged from the [[Islamic Society of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Y (1997) ''A Century of Islam in America'', Hamdard Islamicus Vo. XXI, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims that MISG's founding was influenced by the ideology of [[Abul Ala Maududi]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Kamal Hassan (2003) ''The Influence of Mawdūdī's Thought on Muslims in Southeast Asia: A Brief Survey'', The Muslim World 93 (3-4) , 429–464 {{doi|10.1111/1478-1913.00031}}&lt;/ref&gt; no evidence indicates such opinions. MISG is by and large an independent organization without binding allegiances to any other organizations.

The '''malcontent''' is a character type that often appeared in [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern]] [[drama]]. The character is discontent with the social structure and other characters in the play—and is often an outsider who observes and comments on the action, and may even acknowledge they are in a play. [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Iago]] in ''[[Othello]]'', and [[Jaques (As You Like It)|Jaques]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'' are typical malcontents.

The role is usually both political and dramatic, with the malcontent voicing dissatisfaction with the usually [[Machiavellian]] political atmosphere and often using [[asides]] to build up a kind of self-consciousness and awareness of the text itself that other characters in the play lack.{{sfn|Stoll|1906|p=282}}

Important malcontents include Bosola in Webster's ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', Vindice in Middleton's ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'', Malevole in Marston's ''[[The Malcontent]]'', and Hamlet in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''.

The morality and sympathy of the malcontent is highly variable, as in the examples above. Sometimes, as in ''Hamlet'' and ''The Malcontent'', they are the sympathetic centre of the play, whereas Iago is a very unsympathetic character. The most important thing about the malcontent is that the character is malcontent—unhappy, unsettled, displeased with the world of the play, eager to change it somehow, or to dispute with it.{{sfn|Spencer|1948|pp=529–535}}

The malcontent is an objective or quasi-objective voice that comments on the play's concerns as though somehow above or beyond them.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The concept has much to do with the Renaissance idea of [[humorism]] and a surfeit of "[[bile|black bile]]" which caused [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Stoll|1906|p=281}}

There is an ontological argument regarding Iago: if a malcontent is dissatisfied due to a displacement from their place in the social order, then Iago does not fit. His scheming and disaffection is not clearly motivated by resentment stemming from an injustice done to him.{{sfn|Stoll|1952}}

L. A. Hart]], and developed an interest in legal philosophy. In 1982 he was awarded the research degree of LLD by the [[University of Edinburgh]].

MacCormick was a lecturer in Jurisprudence at the School of Law, University of Dundee [which was attached to University of St Andrews at that time] from 1965-67.

In addition, he held the position of Dean of Law Faculty between 1973–76 and was sometime Provost of the Faculty Group of Law and Social Science, and Vice-Principal for International Affairs.

Professor MacCormick retired from the Regius Chair on 1 February 2008 after completing 36 years as Professor (and later Senior Professor) at the University of Edinburgh. He was accorded with the honour of a series of lectures in his name by the University's [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|School of Law]], and delivered the School of Law's opening Tercentenary Lecture, introduced by former Lord President [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]], on 18 January 2007. He gave his final lecture as Regius Professor, entitled 'Just Law', on Monday 28 January 2008. He continued thereafter in his role as President of the International Association for [[Philosophy of Law]] and Social Philosophy.

He was president of the [[International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12454642.Law_professor_still_doing_his_job_justice/|title=Law professor still doing his job justice |last=Dorsey|first=Kristy |date=10 December 2007 |work=The Herald |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCormick was a member of the [[Broadcasting Council for Scotland]], of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], of the Research Council of the [[European University Institute]], and of the [[European Science Foundation]], as well as of various government departmental committees inquiring into matters of public concern.

== Political career ==
MacCormick stood for the SNP in the [[Edinburgh Pentlands (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], coming in fourth place both times. He stood for [[Argyll and Bute (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll and Bute]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] and came second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/016.stm |title=Vote 2001: Results &amp; Constituencies: Argyll &amp; Bute |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP's conference as a candidate for the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/179343.stm |title=SNP chooses Euro candidates |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 September 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament]], taking a leave of absence from the University of Edinburgh. Professor MacCormick was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] from 2002–3, drafting the proposed [[Constitutional Treaty for the European Union]]. He was voted Scottish Euro MP of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] Awards, and retired from elected office in 2004 to complete his Leverhulme Research Professorship at Edinburgh.

He was elected vice president of the SNP in 1999 and remained in the position until 2004.&lt;ref name="BBC 6 Apr2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7985544.stm |title=Prominent SNP figure dies aged 67 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|newly elected SNP-led]] [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6704673.stm |title=Advocate becomes Salmond adviser |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic works ==
MacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on Law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as ''Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy'' (1984), ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' (1978), ''Rhetoric and The Rule of Law'' (2005) and ''Institutions of Law'' (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' answers many of the [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]]ian critiques of the [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]]ian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two. His final book was ''Practical Reason in Law and Morality'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Natural Law, Practical Reason and Autonomous Persons — A Critical Review of Neil MacCormick: Practical Reason in Law and Morality. |first=Jes |last=Bjarup |journal=[[Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie]] (ARSP) (Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy) |volume=95 |number=3 |date=2009 |pages=428–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In 1999, MacCormick was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] 'honoris causa', and was knighted in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] in 2001 in recognition of services to scholarship in Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2001/birthday_honours_2001/1391003.stm |title=Birthday honours 2001: Honours in Scotland |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2001|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he was a recipient of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Royal Society of Edinburgh's]] Royal Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/royal-medal-awards-1-551717|title=Royal Medal awards |work=The Scotsman |date=3 September 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the recipient of honorary degrees from [[Queen’s University]] (Canada), [[Uppsala University]] (Sweden), [[University of Macerata]] (Italy) and [[Saarland University]] (Germany), as well as from Glasgow University, [[Queen Margaret University]] and the University of Edinburgh.

==Illness and death==
Just after retiring from his chair at the University of Edinburgh in 2008, MacCormick was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pendreigh |first=Brian |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/premiere-brings-stone-of-destiny-home-to-dying-son-of-king-john-1-1438189 |title=Premiere brings Stone of Destiny home to dying son of 'King John' |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Nordic Stone Age''' refers to the [[Stone Age]] of [[Scandinavia]]. During the [[Weichselian glaciation]], almost all of Scandinavia was buried beneath a thick permanent ice cover and  the Stone Age came rather late to this region. As the climate slowly warmed up at the end of the ice age, nomadic hunters from central Europe sporadically visited the region, but it was not until around 12,000 BCE before permanent, but nomadic, habitation took root. 

==Late Upper Paleolithic==
[[File:Spitsbergen reindeer02.jpg|thumb|Reindeer in tundra landscape]]
{{Main|Upper Paleolithic}}
As the ice receded, [[reindeer]] grazed the emerging [[tundra]] plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. This was the era of the [[Hamburg culture]], tribes who hunted over territories 100,000&amp;nbsp;km² vast and lived as nomads in [[teepee]]s, following the reindeer seasonal migrations across the barren tundra. On this land there was little plant cover, except for occasional [[white birch|arctic white birch]] and [[rowan]]. Slowly a [[taiga]] forest appeared. 

Around 11,400 BCE, the [[Bromme culture]] emerged in Southern Scandinavia. This was a more rapidly warming era providing opportunity for other substantial hunting game animals than the ubiquitous reindeer. As former hunter-gather cultures, the Bromme culture was still largely dependent on reindeer and lived a nomadic life, but their camps diversified significantly and they were the first people to settle Southern Scandinavia (and the Southern Baltic area) on a permanent, yet still nomadic, basis.

Local climate changes around 10,500 BCE, initiated both cultural changes and the first settling of the northern parts of Scandinavia. Initially, a thousand year long climate cooldown replaced the taiga with the former tundra and the local culture reverted to former times focus on the reindeer hunt. This culture is now referred to as the [[Ahrensburg culture]]. Around 9,500 BCE, the local climate warmed yet again, as the [[pre-Boreal]] era emerged, and this triggered the Ahrensburg to settle the emerging tundra of northern Scandinavia. For the next two thousand years, the climatic phase known as the [[Boreal (age)|Boreal]] reigned in the Scandinavian region.

==Mesolithic==
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
In the [[7th millennium BCE]], the climate in Scandinavia was warming as it transitioned from the former [[Boreal (age)|Boreal age]] to the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic period]]. Reindeer and their hunters had already migrated and inhabited the lands of northern Scandinavia, and forests had established. A culture called the [[Maglemosian culture]] lived in the areas of Denmark and southern Sweden. To the north, in Norway and along the coast of western Sweden, the [[Fosna-Hensbacka culture]] was living mostly in changing seasonal camps along the shores and close to the now thriving forests. Utilizing fire, boats and stone tools, these [[Stone Age]] tribal cultures managed to survive in northern [[Europe]]. The northern hunter-gatherers followed the herds and the [[salmon run]]s, moving south during the winters, moving north again during the summers. These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practiced throughout other regions in the far north &amp;ndash; areas including modern [[Finland]], [[Russia]], and across the [[Bering Strait]] into the northernmost strip of [[North America]] (comprising portions of today's [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]]).

During the [[6th millennium BCE]], the climate of Scandinavia was generally warmer and more humid than today and the southern regions were clad in lush [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. Large animals like [[aurochs]], [[wisent]], [[moose]] and [[red deer]] roamed freely in the forests and were game for tribes of what we now call the [[Kongemose culture]]. Like their predecessors, the Kongemose tribes also hunted marine animals such as seals and fished in the rich shallow waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other [[hunter-gatherers]] in most of southern Norway and Sweden, now dubbed the [[Nøstvet and Lihult cultures]], descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. By the end of the [[6th millennium BCE]], as the sea levels rose gradually, these northerly tribal cultures continued their way of life, while the Kongemose culture was replaced by the [[Ertebølle culture]], adapting to the [[Atlantic (period)|climatic changes]] affecting their low lying southern regions more severely.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Doggerland]] as an extreme example of the consequence of the rising sea levels.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Neolithic==
[[File:Burial mound Mols.jpg|thumb|Dolmens]]
{{Main|Neolithic}}
During the [[5th millennium BCE]], the Ertebølle people learned pottery from neighbouring tribes in the south, who had begun to cultivate the land and keep animals. Soon, they too started to cultivate the land and, ca 4000 BCE, they became part of the [[megalith]]ic [[Funnelbeaker culture]]. During the [[4th millennium BCE]], these Funnelbeaker tribes expanded into Sweden up to [[Uppland]]. The Nøstvet and Lihult tribes learned new technology from the advancing farmers, but not agriculture, and became the [[Pitted Ware culture]]s, towards the end of the [[4th millennium BCE]]. These Pitted Ware tribes halted the advance of the farmers and pushed them south into south-western Sweden, but some say that the farmers were not killed or chased away, but that they voluntarily joined the Pitted Ware culture and became part of them. At least one settlement appears to be mixed, the [[Alvastra pile-dwelling]].

It is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke, but towards the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, they were overrun by new tribes who many scholars think spoke [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (or more exactly, the "[[Germanic parent language|Pre-Germanic Indo-European]]" dialect), the [[Battle-Axe culture]]. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the [[Oslofjord]], and they probably provided [[Proto-Germanic language|the language]] that was the ancestor of the [[North Germanic languages|modern Scandinavian languages]]. These new tribes were individualistic and clearly patriarchal with the battle axe as a [[status symbol]]. They were cattle herders and with them most of southern Scandinavia entered the Neolithic. Ultimately, the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia.

'''''Respect des fonds''''', or '''''le respect pour les fonds''''', is a principle in archival theory that proposes to group collections of archival records according to their [[fonds]] – that is to say, according to the administration, organization, individual, or entity by which they were created or from which they were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duchein|first=Michael|title=Theoretical Principles and Practical Problems of Respect des fonds in Archival Science|journal=Archivaria|date=Summer 1993|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle has largely guided how archival materials are arranged and described in late-19th- and 20th-century archives. The theory posits that ordering groups of records by creatorship provides authenticity and context by evidencing the relationships between records and better manifesting the environment of their creation.

A closely related concept is that of '''archival integrity''', which holds that records emanating from the same source should be kept together.

==Origins==
''Respect des fonds'' originated from the circular titled "Instructions pour la mise en ordre et le classement des archives departementales" (commonly known as "Circular No. 14") issued by the French Ministry of the Interior on April 24, 1841 and authored by [[Natalis de Wailly]], head of the Administrative Section of the ''[[Archives nationales]]''.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartlett|first=Nancy|title=The Origins of the Modern Archival Principle of Provenance |journal=Bibliographical Foundations of French Historical Studies |year=1992 |pages=106–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circular instructed archivists "to assemble the different documents by fonds, that is to say, to form a collection of all the documents which originate from a body, an organization, a family, or an individual, and to arrange the different fonds according to a certain order."&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; This method of arrangement was a break from previous ways of arranging archival materials which were largely based on library classifications or idiosyncratic facets such as date, place, subject, kings, and pre- or post-revolutionary origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner|first=Ernst |title=Some Aspects of Archival Development since the French Revolution|journal=The American Archivist |year=1940 |volume=3 |issue=3|pages=159–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
The principle of ''respect des fonds'' gained widespread acceptance across Europe, informing the development of the related German concept, ''[[:de:Provenienzprinzip|Provenienzprinzip]]''. The principle was also promoted in the widely influential ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' (also known as [[Archival appraisal#Muller, Feith &amp; Fruin – Dutch Manual, 1898|The Dutch Manual]]) in 1898, further codified by its ratification at the First International Congress of Archivists  and Librarians meeting in Brussels in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Internet Archive|title = International Congress of Archivists and Librarians: Brussels, 1910|url = https://archive.org/details/BrusselsCongress1910|accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured prominently in the work of eminent British archivist Sir [[Hilary Jenkinson]], who described it as "[t]he most important of all principles of Archive Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hilary |last=Jenkinson |authorlink=Hilary Jenkinson |title=A Manual of Archive Administration |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=P. Lund, Humphries &amp; Co. |year=1937 |page=101 |url=https://archive.org/stream/manualofarchivea00iljenk#page/100/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Respect des fonds'' is often seen as being composed of the twin principles of [[provenance]] and [[original order]]. The principle of provenance dictates that archival records are grouped by the organization or individual that created them, whereas the principle of original order dictates that the records within those groupings be maintained in the order fashioned by their creator. Provenance and original order are foundational concepts in [[archival processing]]. These dual principles are also described as the "external" and "internal" order, respectively, of records ("external" meaning how records are grouped within an archive; "internal" meaning how individual records are arranged within those groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=Terry|title=The Archival Fonds: From Theory to Practice|date=1992|publisher=Bureau of Canadian Archivists, Planning Committee on Descriptive Standards|location=Ottawa|isbn=0969079761|page=4}}{{cite journal|last1=Eastwood|first1=Terry|title=Putting the Parts of the Whole Together: Systematic Arrangement of Archives|journal=Archivaria|date=Fall 2000|volume=50|pages=98-99|url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12767-13959|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives of the United States]] of their Records Group concept demonstrates the influence and legacy of the principle of ''respect des fonds.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NARA|title=The Record Group Concept|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/index-numeric/concept.html|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''respect des fonds'' is generally considered a core concept of the archival enterprise, some critics have noted both the historical contingency of its creation and also the impracticality of its execution. For instance, critics have shown that ''respect des fonds'' may have arisen from the need to find a simplistic method for novice archivists to manage a growing volume of archival materials.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; As well, political influences and contestations of historical methods of arranging and describing materials may have influenced the theory's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Lara|title=Restoring Order: The Ecole Des Chartes and the Organization of Archives and Libraries in France, 1820-1870|year=2008|publisher=Litwin Books|location=Duluth, Minnesota|isbn=0977861791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued that grouping records by ''fonds'' does not adequately capture the dynamic, changing nature of contemporary bureaucratic institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenyo|first=Mario|title=The Records Group Concept: A Critique|journal=The American Archivist|date=April 1966|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that maintaining original order prioritizes inscrutable or meaningless arrangement systems of records creators over the usability and accessibility of records by researchers and other users of an archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boles|first=Frank|title=Disrespecting Original Order|journal=The American Archivist|year=1982|volume=45|issue=1|pages=26–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Slavery}}

In the [[history of the United States]], a '''slave state''' was a [[U.S. state]] in which the practice of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was legal, and a '''free state''' was one in which slavery was prohibited or being legally phased out. Historically, in the 17th century, slavery was established in a number of [[English overseas possessions]]. In the 18th century, it existed in all [[First British Empire|the British colonies]] of North America. In the [[Thirteen Colonies]], the distinction between slave and free states began during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783). Slavery became a divisive issue and was the primary [[Origins of the American Civil War|cause of the American Civil War]]. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865, abolished slavery throughout the United States, and the distinction between free and slave states ended.

==Early history==
[[File:US SlaveFree1789.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]
[[File:US SlaveFree1800.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]
Historically, slavery in Eastern North America in the 17th and 18th century began in [[English overseas possessions|the English colonies]]. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery in the colonial US]] was established in each of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. During British colonization, the number of people in slavery expanded, primarily drawn from the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Betty Wood, ''Slavery in Colonial America, 1619–1776'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/Slavery-Colonial-1619-1776-American-ebook/dp/B00C0WEEUS/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Painter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|authorlink=Nell Irvin Painter|title=Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|pages=70–72|isbn=978-0195137569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiments of the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783) and the equality evoked by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order. Thousands also joined the British army, encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service.&lt;ref name="Painter" /&gt; (''See [[Black Patriot]] and [[Black Loyalist]]'').

In the 1770s, blacks throughout [[New England]] began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom. Five of the Northern self-declared states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery: [[Pennsylvania]] (1780), [[New Hampshire]] and [[Massachusetts]] (1783), [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]] (1784). [[Vermont]] had abolished slavery in 1777, while it was still independent, and when it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791, it was the first state to join untainted by slavery. These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc |author= Foner, Eric |year=2010 |location= New York |ISBN= 978-0-19-513755-2 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1804 (including, New York (1799), New Jersey (1804)), all of the northern states had abolished slavery or set measures in place to gradually abolish it.&lt;ref name="Painter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson15&gt;Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 15. "By 1775, inspired by those 'self-evident' truths which were to be expressed by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a considerable number of colonists felt that the time had come to end slavery and give the free Negroes some fruits of liberty. This sentiment, added to economic considerations, led to the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery in six northern states, while there was a swelling flood of private [[manumission]]s in the South. Little actual gain was made by the free Negro even in this period, and by the turn of the century the downward trend had begun again. Thereafter the only important change in that trend before the Civil War was that after 1831 the decline in the status of the free Negro became more precipitate."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south, [[Kentucky]] was created a slave state from [[Virginia]] (1792), and [[Tennessee]] was created a slave state from [[North Carolina]] (1796). By 1804, before the creation of new states from the federal western territories, the number of slave and free states was eight each. In popular usage, the geographic divide between the slave and free states was called the [[Mason-Dixon line]] (between Maryland and Pennsylvania or Delaware).

The 1787, United States [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] debated slavery, and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. As a compromise, the institution was acknowledged though never mentioned directly in the constitution, as in the case of the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]]. In 1808, the United States [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|outlawed the international slave import trade]], but the domestic trade in half the states continued.

==New territories==
[[File:US SlaveFree1821.gif |upright=1.40|right|thumb|The Missouri Compromise of 1820, traded the admission of Missouri (slave) for Maine (free), it also drew a line extending west from Missouri's southern border, which was intended to divide any new territory into slave (south of the line) and free (north of the line)]]
[[File:US SlaveFree1837.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|With the statehood of Arkansas (1836), the number of slave states grew to 13, but the statehood of Michigan (1837) maintained the numbers of slave and free states equal.]]
[[File:US SlaveFree1846 Wilmot.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|The 15 slave states had Texas (1845) and Florida (1845), outnumbering the 14 free states, which gained Iowa (1846).]]
[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|The 17 free states included Wisconsin (1848), California (1850) and Minnesota (1858), to outnumber the 15 slave states.]]

The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, passed just before the [[U.S. Constitution]] was ratified, had prohibited slavery in the federal [[Northwest Territory]]. The southern boundary of the territory was the [[Ohio River]], which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason-Dixon line. The territory was generally settled by [[New England]]ers and [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans granted land there. The 6&amp;nbsp;states created from the territory were all free states: [[Ohio]] (1803), [[Indiana]] (1816), [[Illinois]] (1818), [[Michigan]] (1837), [[Wisconsin]] (1848), and [[Minnesota]] (1858).

During the [[War of 1812]], the British accepted as free all slaves who came into their hands, with no conditions as to military service such as had been made in [[Dunmore's Proclamation]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. By the end of the War of 1812, the momentum for antislavery reform, state by state, appeared to run out of steam, with half of the states having already abolished slavery (Northeast), prohibited from the start ([[Midwest]]) or committed to eliminating slavery, and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely (South).

The potential for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the [[United States Senate]], where each State was represented by two Senators. With an equal number of slave states and free states, the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by free states, the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states.

===Missouri Compromise===
Controversy over whether [[Missouri]] should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which specified that [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north of latitude 36° 30', which described most of Missouri's southern boundary, would be organized as free states and territory south of that line would be reserved for organization as slave states. As part of the compromise, the admission of [[Maine]] (1820) as a free state was secured to balance Missouri's admission as a slave state (1820).

===Texas and the Mexican Cession===
{{Further|Wilmot Proviso}}
The admission of [[Texas]] (1845) and the acquisition of the vast new [[Mexican Cession]] territories (1848), after the [[Mexican–American War]], created further North-South conflict. Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor, the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery.

As part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[California]] was admitted as a free state (1850), without a slave state pair. To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate, California agreed to send one pro-slavery and one anti-slavery senator to Congress.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Last battles===
The difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement, while slave state politicians sought a solution, with efforts being made to acquire [[Cuba]] (see: [[Ostend Manifesto]], 1852) and to annex [[Nicaragua]] (see: [[Walker affair]], 1856–57), both to be slave states.

In 1854, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody fighting]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson. ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006). ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; An effort was initiated to organize [[Kansas]] for admission as a slave state, paired with [[Minnesota]], but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because of questions over the legitimacy of its [[Lecompton Constitution|slave state constitution]]. Anti-slavery settlers in "[[Bleeding Kansas]]" in the 1850s were called ''[[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]]'' and ''Free-Soilers'', because they fought (successfully) to include Kansas in the Union as a free state in 1861.

When the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858, the balance in the Senate was lost; a loss that was compounded by the subsequent admission of [[Oregon]] as a free state in 1859.

===Slave and free state pairs===

Before 1812, the concern about balancing slave-states and free states was not profound. This is how the states lined up in 1812. The year column is the year the state ratified the US Constitution or was admitted to the Union:

After 1812, and until 1850, maintaining the balance of free and slave state votes in the Senate was considered of paramount importance if the Union were to be preserved, and states were typically admitted in pairs:

==West Virginia==
During the Civil War, a [[Restored Government of Virginia|Unionist government]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]], presented a statehood bill to Congress in order to create a new state from 48 counties in western Virginia. The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate [[Charles Sumner]] objected to the admission of a new slave state, while [[Benjamin Wade]] defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;James Oakes, ''Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865'', W.W. Norton, 2012, pgs. 296-97&lt;/ref&gt; Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, [[John S. Carlile]] and [[Waitman T. Willey]]. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on [[West Virginia]], while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment. President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31, 1862. Voters in western Virginia approved the Willey Amendment on March 26, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/statehood15.html|title=West Virginians Approve the Willey Amendment|author=|date=|work=wvculture.org|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln had issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, which exempted from emancipation the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] (four slave states loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]) as well as some territories occupied by Union forces within Confederate states. Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863, [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson]]. The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County. As of the census of 1860, the 49 exempted counties held some 6000 slaves over 21 years of age who would not have been emancipated, about 40% of the total slave population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/index.html|title=University of Virginia Library|author=|date=|work=virginia.edu|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the Willey Amendment only freed children, at birth or as they came of age, and prohibited the importation of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/willeyamendment.html|title=Willey Amendment|author=|date=|work=wvculture.org|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the Civil War, there were 34 states in the United States, 15 of which were slave states.

Abolition of slavery became a condition of the return of local rule and restoration in those states that had declared their secession.

A '''spear-thrower''' or '''''atlatl''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|l|æ|t|əl}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|atlatl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|l|ɑː|t|əl}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;; {{lang-nah|ahtlatl}}; {{IPA-nah|ˈaʔt͡ɬat͡ɬ}}) is a [[tool]] that uses [[lever]]age to achieve greater velocity in [[Dart (missile)|dart]]-throwing, and includes a [[Plain bearing|bearing]] surface which allows the user to store [[energy]] during the throw.

It may consist of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the dart. The spear-thrower is held in one hand, gripped near the end farthest from the cup. The dart is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever. The spear-thrower is a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever. This extra length allows the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus imparting more energy and ultimately higher speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tasigh.org/ingenium/atlatl.html |title=Atlatl History and Physics |publisher=Tasigh.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common modern ball throwers (molded plastic shafts used for throwing tennis balls for dogs to fetch) use the same principle.

A spear-thrower is a long-range weapon and can readily impart to a projectile speeds of over {{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Girls on top"&gt;{{cite news

Spear-throwers appear very early in human history in several parts of the world, and have survived in use in traditional societies until the present day, as well as being revived in recent years for sporting purposes. In the United States the [[Nahuatl]] word ''atlatl'' is often used for revived uses of spear-throwers, and in Australia the [[Australian aborigine|Aboriginal]] word ''[[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]]''.

The ancient Greeks and Romans used a leather thong or loop, known as an ''ankule'' or ''[[amentum]]'', as a spear-throwing device.&lt;ref&gt;Howard L. Blackmore. (2000) ''Hunting Weapons: From the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century'', page 103 "...&amp;nbsp;the air'.31 A device which enabled all but the heaviest of spears to be cast a respectable distance was the spear thrower. ... It was known to the Greeks as the ankuli and to Romans as the amentum.3 The spear was rested in the hand and ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Bannerstone.jpg|thumb|[[Bannerstone]] atlatl weight, c. 2000 BC. Archaic peoples; Ohio. ]]
Spear-thrower designs may include improvements such as thong loops to fit the fingers, the use of flexible shafts, stone balance weights, and thinner, highly flexible [[Dart (missile)|darts]] for added power and range. Darts resemble large arrows or thin spears and are typically from {{convert|1.2|to|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in length and 9 to 16&amp;nbsp;mm (3/8" to 5/8") in diameter.

Another important improvement to the spear-thrower's design was the introduction of a small weight (between 60 and 80&amp;nbsp;grams) strapped to its midsection. Some atlatlists maintain that stone weights add mass to the shaft of the device, causing resistance to acceleration when swung and resulting in a more forceful and accurate launch of the dart. Others claim that spear-thrower weights add only stability to a cast, resulting in greater accuracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Based on previous work done by William S. Webb, William R. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onagocag.com/atlatl1.html |title=Atlatls &amp; Primitive Technology |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that spear-thrower weights, commonly called "[[bannerstone]]s", and characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone, shaped wide and flat with a drilled hole and thus a little like a large [[Wingnut (hardware)|wingnut]], are a rather ingenious improvement to the design that created a silencing effect when swung. The use of the device would reduce the telltale "zip" of a swung atlatl to a more subtle "woof" sound that did not travel as far and was less likely to alert prey. Robert Berg's theory is that the bannerstone was carried by hunters as a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] weight to produce string from natural fibers gathered while hunting, for the purpose of tying on [[fletching]] and [[hafting]] stone or bone points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunderbirdatlatl.com/2005/06/17/bannerstones-and-how-they-relate-to-the-atlatl/ |title=Bannerstones And How They Relate To The Atlatl |accessdate=2018-03-08 |author=Robert S. Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woomera===
The [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] design is distinctly different from most other spear-throwers, in that it has a curved, hollow shape, which allows for it to be used for other purposes.

===Artistic designs===
Several [[Stone Age]] spear-throwers (usually now incomplete) are decorated with carvings of animals: the [[British Museum]] has a [[Mammoth spear thrower|mammoth]], and there is a [[hyena]] in France. Many pieces of decorated bone may have belonged to [[Bâton de commandement|Bâtons de commandement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Aztec atlatl was often decorated with snake designs and feathers,&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt; potentially evocative of its association with [[Ehecatl]], the Aztec wind deity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/artefacts/atlatl Mexicolore's page on the atlatl, and its connection with Ehecatl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Wells Reindeer Age articles.png|thumb|[[Upper Paleolithic]] articles]]

Wooden [[dart (missile)|darts]] were known at least since the Middle [[Paleolithic]]  ([[Schöningen]], [[Torralba (site)|Torralba]], [[Clacton-on-Sea]] and [[Kalambo Falls]]). While the spear-thrower is capable of casting a dart well over one hundred meters, it is most accurately used at distances of twenty meters or less. The spearthrower is believed to have been in use by ''Homo sapiens'' since the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (around 30,000 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Stratification (archeology)|stratified]] European finds come from the [[Magdalenian]] (late upper Palaeolithic). In this period, elaborate pieces, often in the form of animals, are common. The earliest secure data concerning atlatls have come from several caves in France dating to the Upper Paleolithic, about 21,000 to 17,000 years ago. The earliest known example is a 17,500-year-old Solutrean atlatl made of reindeer antler, found at Combe Saunière (Dordogne), France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Peregrine|first1=Peter N.|authorlink1=Peter N.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the atlatl was invented earlier than this, as [[Lake Mungo remains|Mungo Man]] from 42 000 BP displays arthritis in his right elbow, a pathology referred today as the "Atlatl elbow," resulting from many years of forceful torsion from using an atlatl. &lt;ref name="Visit Mungo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmungo.com.au/who-was-mungo-man |title=Mungo Lady and Mungo Man|publisher=mungo |date=n.d. |access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present there is no evidence for the use of atlatls in Africa. Peoples such as the Maasai and Khoi San throw spears without any aids, but its use in hunting is limited in comparison to the spear thrower since the animal must be very close and already immobile. 

In Europe, the spear-thrower was supplemented by the [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]] in the [[Epi-Paleolithic]]. Along with improved ease of use, the bow offered the advantage that the bulk of elastic energy is stored in the throwing device, rather than the projectile; arrow shafts can therefore be much smaller, and have looser [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] for [[spring (device)|spring]] constant and weight distribution than atlatl darts. This allowed for more forgiving [[flint (tool)|flint]] knapping: dart heads designed for a particular spear thrower tend to differ in mass by only a few percent. By the Iron Age, the [[amentum]], a strap attached to the shaft, was the standard European mechanism for throwing lighter javelins. The amentum gives not only range, but also spin to the projectile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The spear-thrower was used by early [[Native American (Americas)|Americans]] as well. It seems to have been introduced to America during the immigration across the [[Bering Land Bridge]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and despite the later introduction of the [[bow and arrow]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} atlatl use was widespread at the time of first European contact{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Complete wooden spear-throwers have been found on dry sites in the western United States and in waterlogged environments in [[Florida]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Several [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] tribes also used the atlatl for fishing and hunting. Some even preferred this weapon over the bow and arrow, and used it not only in combat but also in sports competitions. Such was the case with the [[Tarairiu]], a [[Tapuya]] tribe of migratory foragers and raiders inhabiting the forested mountains and highland savannahs of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] in mid-17th-century Brazil. Anthropologist [[Harald Prins]] offers the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The atlatl, as used by these Tarairiu warriors, was unique in shape. About {{convert|88|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|to|4.5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide, this spear thrower was a tapering piece of wood carved of brown hard-wood. Well-polished, it was shaped with a semi-circular outer half and had a deep groove hollowed out to receive the end of the javelin, which could be engaged by a horizontal wooden peg or spur lashed with a cotton thread to the proximal and narrower end of the throwing board, where a few scarlet parrot feathers were tied for decoration. [Their] darts or javelins ... were probably made of a two-meter long wooden cane with a stone or long and serrated hard-wood point, sometimes tipped with poison. Equipped with their uniquely grooved atlatl, they could hurl their long darts from a great distance with accuracy, speed, and such deadly force that these easily pierced through the protective armor of the Portuguese or any other enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prins |first=Harald E.L. |year=2010 |title=The Atlatl as Combat Weapon in 17th-Century Amazonia: Tapuya Indian Warriors in Dutch Colonial Brazil |journal=The Atlatl |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.worldatlatl.org/Articles/Tapuya%20Atlatl%20Article%20by%20Harald%20Prins%2025%20May%202010.pdf |access-date=2013-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229062650/http://www.worldatlatl.org/Articles/Tapuya%20Atlatl%20Article%20by%20Harald%20Prins%2025%20May%202010.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Tlingit]] of Southeast Alaska, approximately one dozen very old elaborately carved specimens they call "shee áan" (sitting on a branch) remain in museum collections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.fenimoreartmuseum.org/items/show/984 |title=Fenimore Art Museum &amp;#124; Atlatl |publisher=Collections.fenimoreartmuseum.org |date=1992-12-08 |accessdate=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923073816/http://collections.fenimoreartmuseum.org/items/show/984 |archive-date=2013-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and private collections, one having sold at auction for more than $100,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In September 1997, a atlatl dart fragment, carbon dated to 4360 ± 50 14C yr BP (TO 6870), was found in an ice patch on mountain [[Thandlät]], the first of the southern [[Yukon Ice Patches]] to be studied.&lt;ref name="kusawapark"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kusawapark.ca/park/traditional-homeland |title=Traditional Homeland |publisher=Kusawa Park Steering Committee |date=n.d. |access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arctic_1999_Kusyk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuzyk |first1=G.W. |last2=Russell |first2=D.E. |last3=Farnell |first3=R.S. |last4=Gotthardt |first4=R.M. |last5=Hare |first5=P.G. |last6=Blake |first6=E. |year=1999 |title=In pursuit of prehistoric c caribou on Thandlät, southern Yukon |url=http://www.tc.gov.yk.ca/publications/kuzyk_et_al_1999.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Arctic |volume=52 |number=2 |pages=214–219 |doi=10.14430/arctic924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cadena_Indigenous_2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Indigenous Experience Today |editor-first1=Marisol |editor-last1=de la Cadena |editor-first2=Orin |editor-last2=Starn |isbn=1845205197 |pages=384 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |date=September 15, 2007 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1GqtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA363 |access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|363}}&lt;ref name="Hare_frozenpast_2011"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.tc.gov.yk.ca/publications/The_Frozen_Past_the_Yukon_Ice_Patches_2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Frozen Past: The Yukon Ice Patches |isbn=978-1-55362-509-4 |last1=Hare |first1=Greg |year=2011 |pages=36 |publisher=Government of the Yukon |access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

The people of [[New Guinea]] and [[Australian Aborigine]]s also use spear-throwers. In the mid Holocene,&lt;ref&gt;Laet, Sigfried J. de &amp; International Commission for the New Edition of the History of the Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind &amp; International Commission for a History of the Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind. History of mankind (1994). History of humanity. Routledge; Paris : Unesco, London; New York, p.1064&lt;/ref&gt; Australians developed spear-throwers, known as ''[[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomeras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, John L. "Design and construction of Australian spear-thrower projectiles and hand-thrown spears." Archaeology &amp; Physical Anthropology in Oceania (1977): 161-172. APA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cundy, B. J. (1989). Formal variation in Australian spear and spearthrower technology (Vol. 546). British Archaeological Reports Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as its practical use as a hunting weapon, it may also have had social effects. John Whittaker, an anthropologist at Grinnell College, Iowa, suggests the device was a social equalizer in that it requires skill rather than muscle power alone. Thus women and children would have been able to participate in hunting,&lt;ref name="Girls on top"/&gt; although in recent Australian societies, spear-throwers are restricted by custom to male use.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Whittaker said the stone-tipped projectiles from the Aztec atlatl were not powerful enough to penetrate Spanish [[steel plate]] armor, but they were strong enough to penetrate the [[mail (armour)|mail]], leather and cotton armor that most Spanish soldiers wore.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=aaa&amp;id=432&amp;typ=reg |title=Mexicolore |publisher=Mexicolore |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker said the Aztecs started their battles with atlatl darts followed with [[melee]] combat using the [[macuahuitl]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt;

=={{lang|fr|Bâtons de commandement}}==
Another type of Stone Age artefact that is sometimes excavated is the {{lang|fr|[[bâton de commandement]]}}. These are shorter, normally less than one foot long, and made of antler, with a hole drilled through them. When first found in the nineteenth century, they were interpreted by French archaeologists to be symbols of authority, like a modern [[Field Marshal]]'s baton, and so named {{lang|fr|bâtons de commandement}} ("batons of command"). Though debate over their function continues, tests with replicas have found them, when used with a cord, very effective aids to spear or dart throwing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlwUo0IccoMC&amp;pg=PT192 |title=Primitive Technology: A Book of Earth Skills |via=Google Books |publisher=Society of Primitive Technology, Gibbs Smith |editor-first=David |editor-last=Wescott |date=1999 |isbn=9780879059118 |accessdate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that they were "arrow-straighteners".{{citation needed |date=December 2014}}

==Modern times==
[[File:Poised to launch a dart from an atlatl.jpg|thumb|The thrower is checking to see that the dart has been correctly located on the spur of the spear-thrower; next she will turn her head in the other direction, aim and throw]]
[[File:Today is World Atlatl Day (4952910401).jpg|thumb|An [[Aleut]] atlatl from [[Nikolski, Alaska|Nikolski]], made in 1976]]
In modern times, some people have resurrected the dart thrower for [[sport]]s, often using the term atlatl, throwing either for distance and/or for accuracy. The [http://worldatlatl.org/ World Atlatl Association] was formed in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://worldatlatl.org/about-us/|title= The World Atlatl Association: About Us |access-date= 2017-02-10|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the atlatl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://worldatlatl.org/about-atlatls/modern-sport/|title= The World Atlatl Association: Modern sport |access-date= 2017-02-10|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throws of almost {{cvt|260|m}} have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flight-toys.com/atlatl.html |title=The Atlatl |publisher=Flight-toys.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleges reported to field teams in this event include [[Grinnell College]] in [[Iowa]], [[Franklin Pierce University]] in [[New Hampshire]], [[Alfred University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], and the [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/news/our-towns/2010/0530-a-college-team-takes-aim.html |title=Our Towns: A College Team Takes Aim |publisher=Parade.com |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlatls are sometimes used in modern times for hunting. In the U.S., the [[Pennsylvania]] Game Commission has given preliminary approval for legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/oddities/303737/pennsylvania_may_let_hunters_use_prehistoric_weapon/index.html|title=Pennsylvania May Let Hunters Use Prehistoric Weapon |publisher=RedOrbit.com |date=2005-11-13 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animals that would be allowed to atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but particular consideration has been given to deer. Currently, [[Alabama]] allows the atlatl for deer hunting, while a handful of other states list the device as legal for [[rough fish]] (those not sought for sport or food), some game birds and non-game mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/general/columns/story?columnist=absher_jr&amp;page=g_blog_Absher_JR_archive_thru-060424|title=Spear near in Pennsylvania? from espn.com |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2007, Missouri allowed use of the atlatl for hunting wildlife (excluding deer and turkey), and starting in 2010, also allowed deer hunting during the firearms portion of the deer season (except the muzzleloader portion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdc.mo.gov/hunting-trapping/regulations/deer-regulations/2010-firearms-deer-hunting |title=2013 Firearms Deer Hunting &amp;#124; Missouri Department of Conservation |publisher=Mdc.mo.gov |date=2013-09-15 |accessdate=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521053221/http://mdc.mo.gov/hunting-trapping/regulations/deer-regulations/2010-firearms-deer-hunting |archive-date=2011-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wang |first=Regina |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/09/28/atlatl-fall-season-hunting-legal-missouri/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006125607/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/09/28/atlatl-fall-season-hunting-legal-missouri/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-10-06 |title=Atlatl makes debut for Missouri deer season |publisher=Columbia Missourian |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2012, Missouri allowed the use of atlatls during the fall archery deer and turkey hunting seasons and, starting in 2014, allowed the use of atlatls during the spring turkey hunting season as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdc.mo.gov/about-us/get-know-us/leaders-and-organizational-structure/conservation-meetings-and-actions/2011-me-1 |title=Conservation Action: Meeting of the May 2011 Conservation Commission {{! }} Missouri Department of Conservation |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116065330/http://mdc.mo.gov/about-us/get-know-us/leaders-and-organizational-structure/conservation-meetings-and-actions/2011-me-1 |archivedate=November 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri also allows use of the atlatl for fishing, with some restrictions (similar to the restrictions for [[spearfishing]] and [[bowfishing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri Department of Conservation, Wildlife Code: Sport Fishing: Seasons, Methods, Limits |url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/csr/current/3csr/3c10-6.pdf|publisher=Sos.mo.gov|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission allows the use of atlatls for the taking of deer {{as of| 2013|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Whitetail and Mule Deer Hunting"&gt;{{cite web | title=Whitetail and Mule Deer Hunting | publisher=State of Nebraska | url=http://outdoornebraska.ne.gov/hunting/guides/biggame/deer/BGdeerseasons.asp | accessdate=December 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221230638/http://outdoornebraska.ne.gov/hunting/guides/biggame/deer/BGdeerseasons.asp | archive-date=December 21, 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] is still used today by some Australian Aborigines for hunting in remote parts of [[Australia]]. Yup'ik Eskimo hunters still use the atlatl, known locally as "nuqaq" (nook-ak), in villages near the mouth of the Yukon River for seal hunting.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Competitions===
There are numerous atlatl competitions held every year, with spears and spear-throwers built using both ancient and modern materials. Events are often held at parks, such as [[Letchworth State Park]] in New York, [[Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site]] in Illinois, or [[Valley of Fire State Park]] in Nevada.&lt;ref name="Girls on top"/&gt; Atlatl associations around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thunderbirdatlatl.com/?page_id=82 |title=Atlatl Associations |publisher=Thunderbird Atlatl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; host a number of local atlatl competitions.  [[Chimney Point, Vermont|Chimney Point State Historic Site]] in Addison, Vermont hosts the annual Northeast Open Atlatl Championship. In 2009, the Fourteenth Annual Open Atlatl Championship was held on Saturday and Sunday, September 19 and 20. On the Friday before the Championship, a workshop was held to teach modern and traditional techniques of atlatl and dart construction, flint knapping, hafting stone points, and cordage making.&lt;ref name="cp1"&gt;[http://www.historicvermont.org/chimneypoint/atlatl/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905030419/http://www.historicvermont.org/chimneypoint/atlatl/index.htm |date=September 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions may be held in conjunction with other events, such as the [[Pawpaw Festival|Ohio Pawpaw Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiopawpawfest.com/events.html |title=2013 Ohio Pawpaw Festival |publisher=Ohiopawpawfest.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the Bois D'Arc Primitive Skills Gathering and Knap-in, held every September in southern Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boisdarc.info |title=Bois D' Arc Primitive Skills Gathering and Knap-in |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlatl events commonly include the International Standard Accuracy Competition (ISAC), in which contestants throw ten times at a bull's-eye target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://worldatlatl.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Revised-2016-ISAC-Rules-with-appendices.pdf|title= ISAC Rules Package|access-date= 2017-02-10|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contests involving different distances or terrain may also be included, usually testing the atlatlist's accuracy rather than distance throwing.

In the sixth episode of the fourth season of the television competition ''[[Top Shot]]'', the elimination round consisted of two contestants using the atlatl at ranges of 30, 45 and 60 feet.

A '''spoke card''', or '''spokecard''', is a [[:wikt:card|card]] placed in the [[spokes]] of a [[bicycle wheel]]. They lie parallel to the entire wheel. Most spoke cards are [[laminated]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, [[playing cards]] were placed in such a way as to make a [[noise]] as the card flaps against the spokes; however, there is no evidence that these were called "spoke cards."

==Origins==
One origin of the spoke card was laminated cards inserted in spokes with numbers used to identify competitors in competitive races held by [[bicycle messenger]]s, in official competitions and in unofficial [[alleycat races]].&lt;ref&gt;FixedGearGallery. [http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/spokecards.htm Subject: Spoke Cards.] (retrieved 8 Jan 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tarot]] cards with the racers number written on them were used initially,&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Phillip. [http://www.phillipdillon.com/?p=185 "The Tarodome Alleycat."] 17 July 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but nowadays cards are often custom printed.

Another influence was the practice of placing [[playing card]]s found on the street in bicycle spokes in a game known in 1990s San Francisco as [[Spokepoker]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Parté. "Spokepoker." ''Mess Press.'' Issue 1, 1991: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The spoke card is wedged between the spokes of the wheel at the point where they cross each other. Although the spoke card is hard to read while the bicycle is in motion, it provides a cheap way to label them in the absence of a proper race number plaque under the top tube, and is less likely to attract the attention of the authorities than a number on the rider's back.

Maps for social bicycle rides have been printed on spokecards for the riders's reference.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many messengers retain spoke cards after the event, accumulating several on the wheel. Other city riders sometimes fix spoke cards to their wheels as an affectation of messenger culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindycog.com/labels/alleycat.html "Oaks Day Alleycat."] ''IndyCog.'' 18 March 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Many times participants of large group rides, such as those organized by groups like the [[Midnight Ridazz]] or [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] receive spoke cards and affix them to their spokes.

Spoke cards have evolved to serve such diverse functions as [[memorial]]s for fallen messengers, as [[Works of art|artwork]], and as political [[placard]]s in bike messenger association elections, and even in the [[2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obamaspoke.com/ "One Man Spoke."] (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044848/http://obamaspoke.com/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Amy Walker advocates using spoke cards as advertising fliers,&lt;ref&gt;Amy Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7OHlBI4xCLMC&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''On Bicycles: 50 Ways the New Bike Culture Can Change Your Life.''] New World Library, 2011. Page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this can be controversial since many cyclists do not appreciate strangers touching their bicycles.

[http://www.BikeIndex.org Bike Index], a bike registration service, provides instructions for printing spoke cards with [[QR codes]] that contain information about the particular bicycle and its registration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bikeindex.org/spokecard "Spoke cards."] ''Bike Index'' (retrieved February 16, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8183">"'''Swamp Yankee'''" is a colloquial pejorative for rural [[Yankee]]s (northeastern Americans with English colonial ancestry). The term "Yankee" connotes [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|urbane]] [[Protestant work ethic|industriousness]], whereas the term "Swamp Yankee" suggests a [[Conservatism in the United States|more countrified, stubborn, independent, and less-refined]] subtype.

==Usage==
Ruth Schell claims that the phrase is used predominantly in [[Rhode Island]] by immigrant minority groups to describe a rural person "of stubborn, old-fashioned, frugal, English-speaking [[Yankee]] stock, of good standing in the rural community, but usually possessing minimal formal education and little desire to augment it." 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Swamp Yankees themselves react to the term with slight disapproval or indifference…. The term is unfavorably received when used by a city dweller with the intention of ridiculing a country resident; however, when one country resident refers to another as a swamp Yankee, no offense is taken, and it is treated as good-natured jest.… [Swamp Yankees] were not among the religious and ambitious [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] who had sailed to America on the ''Mayflower''; but rather they were more often among the undesirables who had left England as the result of some form of misconduct and who retreated to the swamps when they arrived here.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Schell, "Swamp Yankee", ''American Speech'', 1963, Volume 38, No. 2 (The [[American Dialect Society]], Duke University Press), pp. 121–123. Accessed through [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one time, swamp Yankees had their own variety of isolated country music, according to Harvard professor Paul Di Maggio and Vanderbilt University professor Richard Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 499&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Arthur Miller]] uses the term in his play ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' to refer to a New England carpenter who was a descendant of one of the Founding Fathers. Rhode Island cartoonist [[Don Bousquet]] often parodies the Swamp Yankee in his cartoons. Kerry W. Buckley describes President [[Calvin Coolidge]] as a swamp Yankee in a 2003 article in ''New England Quarterly'', defining it as the "scion of an old family that was no longer elite or monied".&lt;ref&gt;Kerry W. Buckley, "A President for the 'Great Silent Majority': Bruce Barton's Construction of Calvin Coolidge", ''The New England Quarterly''. Vol. 76, No. 4 (Dec. 2003), p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt; "The term swamp Yankee is becoming less known and may be unknown in a few generations…. Probably the best reason for its disappearance is the vanishing of the swamp Yankee himself as society moves toward urban and suburban life."&lt;ref&gt;Schell, 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Richmond, Rhode Island]] sponsors a festival every September named "Swamp Yankee Days". It features traditional fare such as [[clam chowder]], [[clamcakes]], and [[johnnycakes]]. Various local bands play during the event, and activities include an antique tractor parade, a baked bean eating contest, cow chip bingo, a flea market, and assorted activities for children.

==History==
The origin of the term "Swamp Yankee" is unclear. The term "Yankee" originated in the mid-17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Etymonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; but the variation "Swamp Yankee" is not attested until the 20th century, according to {{cite web
 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=swamp
 | title = Etymology Online
 | last =
 | first =
 | date =
 | website =
 | publisher =
 | access-date =
 | quote = }}. Several theories speculate that "Swamp Yankees" were the undesirable, troublemaking New Englanders who moved to the "swamps" of southeastern New England upon arriving in the New World in the 17th century. It is possible that the term also meant that a person was unwanted in an unestablished town for having a relationship with an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]]. Others{{who?|date=November 2016}} speculate that the original "Swamp Yankees" were colonial-era [[indentured servants]] who were paid for their service with swamp land from the farmers to whom they were indentured. Still others{{who?|date=November 2016}} claim that "Swamp Yankees" had relatives who fought in the [[Great Swamp Fight]] of [[King Philip's War]].

Another theory claims that the term originated during the [[American Revolution]] when residents of [[Thompson, Connecticut]] fled to the surrounding swamps to escape a feared British invasion in 1776. When the refugees arose from the swamps several weeks later, they were ridiculed and called "Swamp Yankees".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curbstone.org/index.cfm?webpage=80&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1912 ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' article describes the son of a New England mill owner as a "Swamp Yankee".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ZPLVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA14&amp;dq=%22swamp+yankee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XYHATIKBDsOqlAfM6PnGCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22swamp%20yankee%22&amp;f=false] William Burns Weston, "Jimmie Pulsifer Walks Home"], ''The Metropolitan'', July 1912, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Modern Connecticut Homes and Homecrafts describes a "swamp yankee" living in an old unpainted home in New England but caring about his beds of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Connecticut Homes and Homecrafts: A Book of Representative Houses, Interiors, Gardens, Decorations, Furnishings and Equipment Appropriately Described and Illustrated by Several Hundred Beautiful Engravings, (American Homecrafts Company, 1921) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; A bowling team in a 1922 Norwich, Connecticut newspaper was named the "Swamp Yankees".&lt;ref&gt;Norwich bulletin, March 23, 1922, Image 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, the ''New York Times'' labeled "Swamp Yankees" as those driven out of a New England mill town by immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;"Out of the Whirlwind", ''New York Times'', May 26, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symbolism in the French Revolution''' was a device to distinguish and celebrate (or vilify) the main features of the [[French Revolution]] and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" CD-ROM with {{Cite book|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|year=2001|location = Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|first =Jack|last = Censer|author2=Lynn Hunt }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fasces==
[[File:Armoiries république française.svg|thumb|The unofficial but common [[National Emblem of France]] is backed by a fasces, representing justice.]]
[[Fasces#Fasces in France|Fasces]], like many other symbols of the French Revolution, are Roman in origin. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic.  The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;


During the Revolution, the fasces image was often used in conjunction with many other symbols. Though seen throughout the French Revolution, perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state; rather, it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==''Tricolore'' cockade==

{{main|tricolore cockade}}
Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' - thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]]. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.
[[File:The french tricolor cockade.svg|thumb|left|250px|The tricolore cockade was created in July 1789. White (the royal color) was added to nationalise an earlier blue and red design.]]

The tricolore flag is derived from the cockades used in the 1790s. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. [[Camille Desmoulins]] asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.&lt;ref name="Crowdy"&gt;Crowdy, Terry, ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', p. 42 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The blue and red cockade was presented to King [[Louis XVI]] at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] on 17 July.  Lafayette argued for the addition of a white stripe to "nationalise" the design.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), ''Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette,'' vol. 2, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, a tricolore cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], the national police force that succeeded the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Dale, "Can the Uniform Make the Citizen? Paris, 1789-1791," ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 2001, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Militant feminism in the French Revolution|The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]], a militant group on the far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolore cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic.  The law was passed but was violently opposed by other groups of women. The Jacobins in charge of the government decided that women had no place in public affairs, and disbanded all women's organizations in October 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds.  ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1795''  (1981) pp 143-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty cap==

In revolutionary France, the cap or ''[[:fr:bonnet rouge|bonnet rouge]]'' was first seen publicly in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harris, "The Red Cap of Liberty: A Study of Dress Worn by French Revolutionary Partisans 1789-94." ''Eighteenth Century Studies'' (1981): 283-312. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2738492 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day the [[national emblem]] of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a Phrygian cap.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, "Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the french Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The caps were often knitted by women known as [[Tricoteuse]] who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris in the French Revolution, supposedly continuing to knit in between executions.

[[File:Sans-culotte.jpg|thumb|250px|Early depiction of the tricolour in the hands of a ''[[sans-culotte]]'' during the French Revolution.]]
The Liberty cap, also known as the [[Phrygian cap]], or [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The cap implies ennobling effects, as seen in its association with Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the mythical twins, [[Castor and Pollux]]. The emblem's popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome: its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty. The Roman tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Cooper, and John McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees." ''Past and Present'' 146.1 (1995): 66-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pileus cap is often red in color. This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille. According to the Revolutions de Paris, it became "the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes, the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" LEF CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt; The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap, a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck, for popularity. The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism, becoming synonymous with republican liberty.

==Clothing==
{{main|1775–95 in Western fashion|1795–1820 in Western fashion}}
As the radicals and Jacobins became more powerful, there was a revulsion against high-fashion because of its extravagance and its association with royalty and aristocracy.  It was replaced with a sort of "anti-fashion" for men and women that emphasized simplicity and modesty.  The men wore plain, dark clothing and short unpowdered hair. During the Terror of 1794, the workaday outfits of the sans-culottes symbolized Jacobin egalitarianism. High fashion and extravagance returned under the Directory, 1795–99, with its [[Directoire style|"directoire" styles]]; the men did not return to extravagant customs.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Leith, "Fashion and Anti-Fashion in the French Revolution," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750-1850: Selected Papers'' (1998) pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty Tree==

The Liberty Tree, officially adopted in 1792, is a symbol of the everlasting Republic, national freedom, and political revolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America, as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it symbolizes fertility in French folklore,&lt;ref&gt;Ozouf, "Festivals and the French Revolution" 123&lt;/ref&gt; which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another. The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British, starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree. The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 88&lt;/ref&gt;   It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing, along with the Republic. To that end, the tree is portrayed as a sapling, usually of an oak tree in French interpretation. The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom.

==Hercules==

The symbol of [[Hercules]] was first adopted by the [[Old Regime]] to represent the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power. The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchs]].&lt;ref name="Hunt 1984, 101–102"&gt;Hunt 1984, 101–102&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power.

During the Revolution, the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals. The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly's]] victory over federalism on 10 August 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Federalism" was a movement to weaken the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Edmonds, "'Federalism' and Urban Revolt in France in 1793," ''Journal of Modern History'' (1983) 55#1 pp 22-53&lt;/ref&gt; This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty, unity, and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of [[Louis XVI]], symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. The statue's foot was placed on the throat of the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new [[French First Republic|Republic]] had vanquished. In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people.  The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system. Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France: the French people.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 97, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

This transition was made easily for two reasons. First, because Hercules was a famous mythological figure, and had previously been used by the monarchy, he was easily recognized by educated French observers.   It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol. Additionally, Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans, a period which the revolutionaries identified with [[Republicanism|republican]] and democratic ideals. These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France.&lt;ref name="Hunt 1984, 101–102"/&gt;

During the more [[Reign of Terror|radical phase]] of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794, the usage and depiction of Hercules changed. These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens.  The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent. In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic, the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of [[Marianne]].&lt;ref name="Hunt 1984, 113"&gt;Hunt 1984, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Hercules was on the coin of the Republic. However, this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre-Terror phases of the Revolution. The new image of Hercules was more domesticated. He appeared more paternal, older, and wiser, rather than the warrior-like images in the early stages of the French Revolution. Unlike his 24-foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being, he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality.&lt;ref name="Hunt 1984, 113"/&gt;

Also the language on the coin with Hercules was very different from the rhetoric of pre-revolutionary depictions. On the coins the words, "uniting Liberty and Equality" were used. This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy. By 1798, the [[Council of Ancients]] had discussed the "inevitable" change from the problematic image of Hercules, and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image.&lt;ref name="Hunt 1984, 113"/&gt;

[[File:Pils - Rouget de Lisle chantant la Marseillaise.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Rouget de Lisle, composer of the Marseillaise, sings it for the first time in 1792]]

"La Marseillaise" ({{IPA-fr|la maʁsɛjɛːz}}) became the [[national anthem]] of France.  The song was written and composed in 1792 by [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]], and was originally titled "''Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin''". The [[French National Convention]] adopted it as the [[French First Republic|First Republic's]] anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by [[Fédéré|volunteers]] from [[Marseille]] marching on the capital.

The song is the first example of the "European march" anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. Cerulo says, "the design of "La Marseillaise" is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said
to have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'"&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Cerulo, "Symbols and the world system: national anthems and flags." ''Sociological Forum'' (1993) 8#2 pp. 243-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guillotine==
{{main|Guillotine}}
[[File:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|right|As shown in this British cartoon by [[Isaac Cruikshank]], the guillotine became a disparaging symbol of violent excess during the Reign of Terror. The tricolor ribbon on top is inscribed "No God! No Religion! No King! No Constitution!" Below the ribbon, and its Phrygian cap with tricolor cockade, are two bloody axes, attached to a guillotine, whose blade is suspended above a world aflame. An emaciated man and drunken woman dressed in ragged clothes serve as heraldic "supporters", gleefully dancing on discarded royal and clerical regalia.]]
Hanson notes, "The guillotine stands as the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=The A to Z of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYJ4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger and cursed as the symbol of the [[Reign of Terror]] by the right.&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340'', (2nd ed., 2007), p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programs listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women ([[tricoteuse]]s) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Opie, ''Guillotine'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

What it is that horrifies people changes over time. Doyle comments:
:Even the unique horror of the guillotine has been dwarfed by the gas chambers of the Holocaust, the organized brutality of the gulag, the mass intimidation of Mao's cultural revolution, or the killing fields of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEi4bYIUP1sC&amp;pg=PT22|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast''''' was an [[NBC]] television special show hosted by entertainer [[Dean Martin]] in 1974&amp;ndash;1984. For a series of 54 specials and shows, Martin and his friends would "[[Roast (comedy)|roast]]" a celebrity. The roasts were patterned after the roasts held at the [[New York Friars' Club]].

==History==
In 1973, ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' was declining in popularity. In its final season, to pick up the ratings and to require less of Martin's involvement, it was retooled into a series of celebrity roasts by adding a feature called "Man of the Week Celebrity Roast" . The roasts seemed to be popular among television audiences and are often marketed in post-issues as part of the official ''Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts'' and not ''The Dean Martin Show''. After ''The Dean Martin Show'' was cancelled in 1974, NBC drew up a contract with Martin to do several specials and do more roast specials. Starting with [[Bob Hope]] in 1974, the roast was taped in California and turned out to be a hit, leading to many other roasts to follow.&lt;ref&gt;''Memories Are Made of This: Dean Martin Through His Daughter's Eyes''. Deana Martin, Wendy Holden Random House Digital, Inc., 2005 {{ISBN|1-4000-9833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1974, the roasts moved permanently to the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]]'s Ziegfeld Room in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and mainly aired Thursdays on NBC. The televised roasts were popular in the ratings; however Martin and NBC declined to extend the 10-year contract. Some segments were taped prior to or after the roast, due to considerations with the performer or technical aspects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rat Pack: Neon Nights with the Kings of Cool''. Lawrence J. Quirk, William Schoell. HarperCollins, 1999. {{ISBN|0-380-73222-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; No roasts were broadcast between 1980 and 1983 (partly due to the [[MGM Grand fire]] of 1980), with the specials returning for a few final installments in 1984. The show's official title as a television special would change based on the celebrity, in [[James Stewart]]'s case for instance, it would be the ''Dean Martin Celebrity Roast: Jimmy Stewart''.

The roastmaster (Martin), the roastee, and the roasters would be seated on a dais. The roastees were also referred to as "Man of the Hour", "Woman of the Hour", or "Man of the Week" in earlier episodes.

== Trivia ==
In two instances, a pair of celebrities were roasted at the same time: [[Jack Klugman]] and [[Tony Randall]], and [[Dan Rowan]] and [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]]. Only one person was honored posthumously, [[George Washington]], who was honored for the upcoming [[United States bicentennial]] (veteran historical impersonator [[Jan Leighton]] portrayed Washington for the episode while [[Audrey Meadows]] portrayed his wife, [[Martha Washington|Martha]]). [[Michael Landon]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Joe Namath]], and [[Jack Klugman]] were the only celebrities roasted twice; Landon's second time in 1984, being the final roast. [[Don Rickles]] hosted the roast of Dean Martin and assumed the role of Roastmaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of African-American Television''. Volume 7 of Historical dictionaries of literature and the arts. Kathleen Fearn-Banks, Scarecrow Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8108-5335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Nipsey Russell]] and impressionist [[Rich Little]] appeared the most often on the roast with each appearing 24 times. While most of the participants were comedians known for their work in such events, occasionally unexpected participants would be featured, such as British pop singer [[Petula Clark]] who was recruited to help roast TV actor [[William Conrad]] in 1973.

==Home media==
''The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts'' were released on DVD through [[Guthy-Renker]] with some of ''The Dean Martin Show'' roasts selected as part of the package. The show is one of the most sold video sets of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;''Memories Are Made of This: Dean Martin Through His Daughter's Eyes''. Deana Martin, Wendy Holden Random House Digital, Inc., 2005 {{ISBN|1-4000-9833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC Universal]] brought suit against producer [[Greg Garrison]] and Guthy-Renker for selling ''The Dean Martin Show'' DVDs; the suit did not affect the ''Celebrity Roasts''. All 54 of the ''Celebrity Roasts'' are now being sold via television infomercial by [[Time–Life]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://timelife.com/products/the-dean-martin-celebrity-roasts-complete-dvd-collection The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts: Complete DVD Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104030833/http://timelife.com/products/the-dean-martin-celebrity-roasts-complete-dvd-collection |date=January 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''The Familiar of Zero'''''|ゼロの使い魔|Zero no Tsukaima|lead=yes}} is a [[fantasy]] and comedy-oriented series of Japanese [[light novel]]s written by [[Noboru Yamaguchi (author)|Noboru Yamaguchi]], with illustrations by [[Eiji Usatsuka]]. [[Media Factory]] published 20 volumes between June 2004 and February 2011. The series was left unfinished due to the author's death on April 4, 2013,&lt;ref name="ANN-death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-04-10/zero-no-tsukaima-author-noboru-yamaguchi-passes-away|title=Zero no Tsukaima Author Noboru Yamaguchi Passes Away|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later concluded in two volumes released in February 2016 and February 2017 with a different author, making use of notes left behind by Yamaguchi. The story features several characters from the second year class of a magic academy in a fictional magical world with the main characters being the inept mage Louise and her [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] from Earth, Saito Hiraga.

Between 2006 and 2012, the series was adapted by [[J.C.Staff]] into four [[anime]] television series and an additional [[original video animation]] episode. The first anime series was licensed by [[Geneon Entertainment]] in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re-released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A [[manga]] version drawn by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in [[Media Factory]]'s manga magazine ''[[Monthly Comic Alive]]'' between August 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created, as were three [[visual novel]]s.

{{main|List of The Familiar of Zero characters}}
Louise is a noble girl who is terrible at magic, as her attempts usually result in an explosion. She is nicknamed "Louise the Zero" by her classmates, due to the inability to use any of the four magic elements. Early in the school year at the Tristain Academy of Magic, the second year students perform a special ritual where they summon their [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], which serves as their eternal protector and partner, and is usually some sort of magical creature. But Louise summons Saito Hiraga, an ordinary teenage boy from Japan, leaving her totally humiliated.

Due to the sacredness of the ritual, Louise reluctantly accepts Saito as her familiar, but proceeds to treat Saito as any other familiar, only worse, making him wash her clothes, sleep on a bed of hay, and whipping him with a riding crop when he upsets her. ''The Familiar of Zero'' follows the adventures of Louise and Saito as they help their classmates and friends, while occasionally blundering into situations where they risk their lives to save one another. Saito tries to find a way to get back to Japan, but he also has a mysterious power that allows him to wield swords and other weapons to perform heroic feats. They also eventually learn the truth behind Louise's magic inabilities. As Saito's and Louise's friendship grows and they start to work together, they ultimately fall in love with each other.[[File:Halkeginia map.png|left|thumb|The fictional continent of Halkeginia bears similarities to Europe.]]

===Setting===
;Halkeginia
:{{Nihongo|Halkeginia|ハルケギニア|Harukeginia}} is the continent that the story of ''The Familiar of Zero'' takes place on. Halkeginia's social structure is similar to the feudal class systems of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], with magic-users being considered nobles. The continent itself is vaguely reminiscent in shape to western Europe, with many of the countries carrying ancient and Roman names.

;Tristain
:{{Nihongo|Tristain|トリステイン|Torisutein|also "Tristein"}} is the nation in which the majority of the story takes place. It is a small [[Monarchy|monarchical]] country located in the northwest of Halkeginia. It is under threat from Albion. Tristain is home to a highly acclaimed magical academy which attracts students from nearby countries known as the Tristain Academy of Magic. Militarily, the country is weak, with only a small permanent force, which forces it to make marriage alliances with other countries. The capital city is {{Nihongo|Tristania|トリスタニア|Torisutania}}. The country resembles [[Belgium]].

;Germania
:{{Nihongo|Germania|ゲルマニア|Gerumania}} is the largest kingdom in Halkeginia, and is also regarded as the strongest in terms of military might. It is regarded as a more barbaric and down-to-earth type of country, with its men considered to be brutish. Germania is located to the northeast of Tristain. Germania is the ancient Roman name for the region that is now Germany; the natives were at the time considered by the Romans to be barbarians. The country resembles [[Germany]].

;Gallia
:{{Nihongo|Gallia|ガリア|Garia|also "Galia"}} is another kingdom in Halkeginia, located to the southeast of Tristania. Germania is on its eastern border, in the Alden Forest. It is the second largest country in Halkeginia. Within the Gallia Royal Family, murders and assassination attempts have led to an unstable royalty. There is a city named La Rochelle in the mountains, which is a major port. The capital city is Beautis. Gallia is reminiscent of modern-day [[France]], which in the Roman era was called Gaul (Gallia in Latin).

;Albion
:{{Nihongo|Albion|アルビオン|Arubion}}, nicknamed the white country, is an island nation which is in a period of political strife. According to the storyline, a group of nobles known as Reconquista initiated a coup d'etat against the royalty, and over the course of the story, succeed in killing the entire Albion Royal Family. Cromwell, the leader of the Albion rebellion, seeks to spread his power elsewhere, and begins by attacking Tristain. Albion is the ancient Greek name for the main island of [[Great Britain]] upon which are the modern nations [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]]. The capital city of Albion is Londinium.

:Cromwell is named after the leader of the [[Roundheads]] during the English Civil War, [[Oliver Cromwell]], who successfully ousted the Monarchy, and establishing a brief reign as Lord Protector until the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

;Romalia
:{{Nihongo|Romalia|ロマリア|Romaria}} is a holy empire, located to the south of Gallia. There lies a city called Aquileia. Reminiscent of Italy, and specifically the [[Papal States]] (and the Vatican City, it is mentioned, that they have a pope and officials who are bound to celibacy), which once controlled much of central and northern [[Italy]].

===Magic===
:The nobles of Halkeginia are [[Magician (fantasy)|magicians]] known as "magi", and must use a wand or a staff to cast spells. Not all magi are nobles as some have given up their nobility to use their magic for thievery or to work as mercenaries.

:There are four primary magic elements: Ignis (''Fire''), Aqua (''Water''), Ventus (''Air''), and Terra (''Earth''). Magi have an affinity to one of those elements. There is a fifth element, the legendary lost branch of element, known as void. Magi can combine different magical elements or even stack the same element on top of itself to make spells more powerful. The power of a mage is determined by how many elements he or she can combine. There are four ranks of magician based upon this factor. Those who cannot combine any element together have the first rank, which is symbolized as a dot. Most magic students are in this class. The ability to combine two, three or four elements together leads to a magic user being referred to as a line, triangle, or square mage. In myths, there is a fifth rank called pentagram mage.

:One of the major themes is that humans and technology from Earth displaced into the world of Halkeginia are considered to be highly magical since Halkeginia itself has relatively primitive science and technology. For example, a magical item called the "Staff of Destruction" is, in reality, a human-made [[Vietnam War|Vietnam-era]] [[M72 LAW]] [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]. Other examples of Earth technology, often weaponry, appear throughout the story, such as a [[World War II]] era [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter plane.

==Media==
===Light novels===
''The Familiar of Zero'' began as a series of [[light novel]]s written by [[Noboru Yamaguchi (author)|Noboru Yamaguchi]] and illustrated by [[Eiji Usatsuka]] under the original title ''Zero no Tsukaima''. [[Media Factory]] published 20 volumes in Japan between June 25, 2004 and February 25, 2011. Further publication was threatened by Yamaguchi's advanced cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-07-15/zero-no-tsukaima-yamaguchi-confirms-he-has-cancer|title=''Zero no Tsukaima''{{'}}s Yamaguchi Confirms He Has Cancer|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he succumbed to on April 4, 2013, leaving the series [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished]].&lt;ref name="ANN-death"/&gt; Yamaguchi had planned the series to end with 22 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-07-08/zero-no-tsukaima-author-noboru-yamaguchi-plans-surgery|title=''Zero no Tsukaima'' Author Noboru Yamaguchi Plans Surgery|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later decided by the publisher to continue the series in the author's absence, due in part to calls from fans to continue the series, as well as Yamaguchi's family wanting to see it completed. Yamaguchi had dictated the remaining plot of the series, including its ending, and entrusted it to the editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-25/the-familiar-of-zero-light-novels-to-continue-after-author-passing/.89697|title=The Familiar of Zero Light Novels to Continue After Author's Passing|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media Factory released volume 21 on February 25, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-24/the-familiar-of-zero-light-novels-1st-volume-after-creator-passing-scheduled/.95778|title=The Familiar of Zero Light Novels' 1st Volume After Creator's Passing Scheduled|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final volume 22 on February 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-03/the-familiar-of-zero-final-novel-volume-cover-art-book-previewed/.111809|title=The Familiar of Zero's Final Novel Volume Cover, Art Book Previewed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 3, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the series in 2007 under the title ''Zero's Familiar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011320/http://www.gomanga.com/manga/zerosfamiliar.php|url=http://www.gomanga.com/manga/zerosfamiliar.php|title=Zero's Familiar English light novel|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|archivedate=2007-09-27|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later cancelled the release of the novels.

A side-story, ''Zero no Tsukaima Gaiden: Tabatha no Bōken'', initially available as a mobile phone online serial, was released in three volumes between October 25, 2006 and March 25, 2009. It centers on the adventures of the character Tabitha, Louise's classmate. Another side story, ''Kaze no Kishihime'', was released in two volumes on October 23, 2009 and March 25, 2010. It is a prequel about Louise's mother youth. A companion volume, ''Zero no Tsukaima Memorial Book'', was released on June 24, 2017. It collected various short stories and illustrations previously unpublished in book format, as well as character designs and other information, such as outlines for volumes 21 and 22 left behind by Yamaguchi. It also revealed that the last two volumes of the series were written by Yū Shimizu, author of ''[[Bladedance of Elementalers]]'', using Yamaguchi's notes.

'''''The Librarian''''' is an [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] in the collection of [[Skokloster Castle]] in [[Sweden]].  It is thought to be a portrait of [[Wolfgang Lazius]], a humanist and historian who served [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;

Arcimboldo became official portraitist to Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1562 and later to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].&lt;ref name="TNC"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Arcimboldo 1527&amp;ndash;1593: Nature &amp; Fantasy | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihmUGf5qOIIC&amp;pg=PA50 | title=[[The New Criterion]] | date=December 2010 | last=Greggs | first=Jeffrey | pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Librarian'' is one of a series of paintings by Arcimboldo of members of Maximilian's entourage.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;  Skokloster Castle dates the painting to 1562,&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; though the painting is more often dated circa 1566.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegeskorte2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2009"/&gt;

Arcimboldo created a number of portraits of people by painting an assemblage of objects such as fruits and vegetables, flowers, or in this case, books; the objects typically had some connection to the person's life or depiction. Benno Geiger called it a "triumph of [[abstract art]] in the 16th century".&lt;ref name="Kriegeskorte2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kriegeskorte|title=Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRdQzBJckdYC|year=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-5993-3|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, art historian Sven Alfons was the first to conclude that this was specifically a portrait of Lazius.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann|title=Arcimboldo: Visual Jokes, Natural History, and Still-Life Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRuI5laxCZIC&amp;pg=PA259|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42686-0|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work has been interpreted as both a celebration and a satirical mocking of librarians and scholarship.  K. C. Elhard suggests that it may be specifically a parody of "materialistic book collectors more interested in acquiring books than in reading them."&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;

Elhard notes that ''The Librarian'' has become "a fixture in the visual history of the library profession".&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;  However, the original title, if any, is unknown, and its current title first appears (in Swedish as "Bibliotekarien") in an early 20th-century inventory.&lt;ref name="KCE"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=25541905 | title=Reopening the Book on Arcimboldo's "Librarian" | author=Elhard, K.C. | journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |date=Spring 2005 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=115–127 | doi=10.1353/lac.2005.0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Librarian'' is one of two works by Arcimbolodo in the collection of Skokloster Castle. The painting was brought to Sweden following the looting of [[Prague Castle]] by the Swedish army during the 1648 [[Battle of Prague (1648)|Battle of Prague]] and was owned by General [[Hans Christoff von Königsmarck]].&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=32632&amp;viewType=detailView | title=Livrustkammaren och skoklosters slott med stiftelsen hallwylska museet: En myndighet tre museer | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three other extant versions of the painting whose attributions are uncertain.&lt;ref name="KCE"/&gt;  A scientific study published in 2011 concluded that ''The Librarian'' was a later copy of Arcimbolodo's original painting, whose whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="MakesBrunskog2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frantisek Makes|author2=Maria Brunskog|title=Enzymatic Restoration and Authentication of Giuseppe Arcimboldo's "Vertumnus"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmJhtwAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Gotland University|isbn=978-91-86343-08-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theological veto''' is the [[concept]] in [[philosophy of religion]] that [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] are impious and that [[God]], not [[reason]], is sovereign.&lt;ref name="ferre"&gt;[[Frederick Ferré]], ''Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2013}} This concept is held as true by some [[Theism|theists]], especially [[Religious fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]].

The idea is derived from a belief that mankind is [[Total depravity|depraved]], and its [[intellect]] is a flawed product of this [[Fall of man|fallenness]]. In this view [[religious conversion|conversion]], not reason, is the way to the truth; [[preaching]], not [[argument]], is the way to [[persuasion|persuade]]; and [[divine grace|grace]], not [[evidence]] is the way [[belief]] is confirmed. In this view, natural reason is so profoundly hostile to the divine that holding it above [[faith]] is tantamount to worshiping a sinful creature as an [[idolatry|idol]]. Even the use of [[reason]] on behalf of faith is rejected under the theological veto, as it shows faithlessness. It presupposes by practice that faith can be benefited by reason.

==Usage==
An early use of the phrase is reported from a 1925 critique of opponents of [[evolution]]: "They meet the accumulating evidences of the descent of man with a theological veto. They set the limit to science by the quotation of a verse from the creation legend "Genesis.""&lt;ref&gt;American Ethical Union, ''The Ethical Outlook'', Volume 12, 1925, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rejecting the theological veto ==
There are several reasons put forth by those who reject the theological veto. One way to reject the theological veto is to assert that one cannot isolate reason from faith. Intelligible use of language is claimed to commit one to [[consistency]], so to reject reason is to refuse to make sense. This argument asserts that even the theological veto itself must be consistent with itself and inconsistent with reason. Another way the theological veto is rejected is to assert that rejection of critical control over one's beliefs, as for instance by the requirement of evidence, lowers the barrier against [[bigotry]], [[fanaticism]], and [[persecution]]. While its high aspiration is to warn against human [[pride]], some say its supporters are guilty of what they themselves claim is the highest form of pride: They claim that they know the mind of God.&lt;ref name="ferre" /&gt;

A dangerous storm rips through Florida, where an evacuation notice has been spread throughout part of the state. Beth Henson, a woman whose husband, Keith has been sent to rescue an elderly woman, stays in her house during the evacuation progress. A man stumbles in seeking shelter, but Beth suspects that he is a serial killer. Keith enters the elderly woman's home, only to find that she is unconscious inside the trunk of her car. A youth found around the woman's house claims to be her nephew; Keith also suspects that he is a serial killer. Back in the house, Beth attacks her guest with a frying pan. She flees to the shed where the youth catches her, holding a knife to her neck. Keith arrives at the house and whilst searching for the youth, bumps into the man who was hit by a frying pan.

==="Empathy" by [[James Siegel]]===
The author, whose name is unmentioned, has an affair with a hotel masseuse, Kelly. Kelly tells him she is an empath, someone who can sense one's emotions by touch. She also tells him of a man in whom she sensed a very strong evil, and that the man is a pedophile. The author is very moved, because he feels responsible for his younger brother's suicide, because the narrator had not said anything about the pedophile priest who, it is implied, abused both of them. He seeks out the man Kelly mentioned, and after killing him, meets with a friend of Kelly's, who informs the narrator that Kelly was divorced, was a drug addict, and had poisoned her son against his father. The narrator, realizing he had killed Kelly's innocent ex-husband, set out to kill Kelly and avenge the man he had wrongfully killed. In the end it is implied that the author commits suicide.

==="Kowalski's In Love" by [[James Rollins]]===

Shay had entered the island to retrieve the only antidotes to the virus; an evac helicopter  will pick her up at 0855 hours. However, the island is scattered with booby traps, and it isn't long until Shay falls into one, breaking her leg. Kowalski offers to retrieve the antidotes himself, whilst Shay makes for the evac dropsite. Shay reluctantly agrees but becomes treed by apes on her way. Kowalski encounters Gabriella Salazar, who has already collected the antidotes. Kowalski shoots and killed Gabriella in self-defense and retrieves the antidotes. Kowalski could escape on the evac chopper, but opts not to, as it will lift off the island on schedule, with or without Shay. Kowalski rescues Shay, and they escape on the water vehicle that was meant for Gabriella.

The three of them engage in a violent struggle, resulting in one of their being rendered unconscious and harmless.

Weaver and his friend, Thomas Lane, are attacked by Fisher and his crime partner, Ruddy Dick. After Lane was knocked out, Weaver beheaded Dick, Fisher grabbed the money and both fled the scene. A year later, Fisher befriends a man known as Farting Dan. Whilst robbing an equipage, Weaver kills Dan, but is shot by Fisher. Fisher returns home with the equipage's horseman, Phillip, trying to get him to pick a valuable lock. Phillip revealed himself to be Weaver, and that in their encounter a year ago Fisher had mistaken Lane for Weaver and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8298">'''''Verlan''''' ({{IPA-fr|vɛʁˈlɑ̃}}) is an [[argot]] in the [[French language]], featuring inversion of [[syllable]]s in a word, and is common in [[slang]] and youth language.  It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words.&lt;ref name=Lefkowitz&gt;{{cite book |last=Lefkowitz |first=Natalie |title=Talking Backwards, Looking Forwards: The French Language Game Verlan |date=1991 |publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag |isbn=3823340735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOk9Pldx7i0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} The name ''verlan'' is an example: it is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in ''l'envers'' ({{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ˈvɛʁ|}}, "the inverse", frequently used in the sense of "back-to-front").

== General characteristics and structure ==

===Word formation===
{{Wiktionary category|moredescriptivetext=examples of ''verlan'' words|category=Verlan}}
Words in ''verlan'' are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced.  For example, ''français'' {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃ˈsɛ|}} becomes ''céfran'' {{IPA-fr|sefˈʁɑ̃|}}.

''Verlan'' generally retains the pronunciation of the original syllables.  In particular, French words that end in a ''[[e muet|⟨e⟩ muet]]'' (such as ''[[wikt:femme|femme]]'') and words that end in a pronounced consonant and which usually have an ''⟨e⟩ muet'' added at the end (such as ''[[wikt:flic|flic]]'') retain the sound of the ''⟨e⟩ muet'' in ''verlan''. In addition, ''verlan'' often drops the final vowel sound after the word is inverted, so ''femme'' and ''flic'' become ''meuf'' and ''keuf,'' respectively.

Different rules apply for one-syllable words, and words with multiple syllables may be verlanised in more than one way.  For example, ''cigarette'' may yield ''garetsi'' or ''retsiga''.&lt;ref name=Valdman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valdman |first=Albert |title=La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire |journal=The French Review |volume=73 |issue=6 |year=2000 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocabulary===
Some ''verlan'' words, such as ''meuf'', have become so commonplace that they have been included in the ''[[Petit Larousse]]''&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Petit Larousse]] itself. These words are also given on the Larousse website:  [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/keuf keuf] [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/meuf meuf] [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/ripou ripou]&lt;/ref&gt; and a doubly "verlanised" version was deemed necessary, so the singly verlanised ''meuf'' became ''feumeu''; similarly, the ''verlan'' word ''[[beur]]'', derived from ''arabe'', has become accepted into popular culture such that it has been re-verlanised to yield ''rebeu''.&lt;ref name=Valdman/&gt;&lt;ref name=LefkowitzReview&gt;{{cite journal |title=Verlan: talking backwards in French |first=Natalie J |last= Lefkowitz |journal=[[The French Review]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some verlan words, which are now well incorporated in common French language, have taken on their own significance, or at least certain connotations that have changed their meaning.&lt;ref name=LefkowitzReview/&gt; For example, the word ''meuf'', which can still be used to refer to any woman, also refers to the speaker's girlfriend, when used in the possessive form (''ma meuf'' → my girl); while the original word ''femme'' would refer to the speaker's wife when used in the same way (''ma femme'' → my wife). Such words retain a cultural significance from the time at which they appeared in common language. Widely spread in the second half of the 20th century, ''beur'' generally refers to first-generation immigrants from northern Africa in France. The re-verlanised word ''rebeu'' is much more recent, and is used to refer rather to second-generation Arab immigrants in France, and their social attitude.{{Check|date=September 2014}}

In theory, any word can be translated into ''verlan'', but only a few expressions are used in everyday speech. Verbs translated into ''verlan'' cannot be conjugated easily. There is no such thing as a ''verlan'' grammar, so generally verbs are used in the infinitive, past participle or [[Imperfect|progressive]] form.  For example:
*''J'étais en train de pécho une bebon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionnairedelazone.fr/dictionary/definition/bebon |title=Définition de bebon |work=dictionnairedelazone.fr |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("I was hitting on a hot chick") is said, but not ''je pécho[ais]''.

===Spelling===

The study of written ''verlan'' is difficult as it is primarily passed down orally, without standardized spelling. While some still argue that the letters should be held over from the original word, in the case of ''verlan'', most experts agree that words should be spelled as to [[pronunciation spelling|best approximate pronunciation]].  ''Verlan'' is preferred to ''versl'en''.
The French author [[Auguste Le Breton]] uses numerous examples of ''verlan'', for instance in ''[[Du rififi chez les hommes]]''.

==Cultural significance==

''Verlan'' is less a language than a way to set apart certain words.&lt;ref name=Valdman/&gt; Many verlan words refer either to [[sex]] or [[recreational drug use|drug]]s, related to the original purpose of keeping communication secret from institutions of social control. ''Verlan'' is generally limited to one or two key words per sentence. ''Verlan'' words and expressions are mixed within a more general ''[[argot]]ique'' language.

''Verlan'' is used by people to mark their membership in, or exclusion from, a particular group (generally young people in the cities and ''[[banlieue]]s'', although some French upper-class youth have also started using it as their slang); it is a tool for marking and delineating group identity.&lt;ref name=Valdman/&gt;  Speakers rarely create a ''verlan'' word on the fly; rather, their ability to use and understand words from an accepted set of known ''verlan'' terms allows them to be identified as part of a ''verlan''-speaking group. Lefkowitz claims that the best speakers of the language are often the worst students, those most needing to hide from authority.&lt;ref name=Lefkowitz/&gt;{{rp|61}}

Some ''verlan'' words have gained mainstream currency. Examples of ''verlan'' in cultural mainstream include the 1984 comedy ''Les Ripoux'' (''[[My New Partner]]'') (''ripou'' is verlan for ''pourri'', or rotten, and refers to a corrupt policeman); and the 1977 hit "[[Laisse béton]]" by singer [[Renaud]] (''béton'' is ''verlan'' for ''tomber'' and the phrase means "drop it").

''Verlan'' is popular as a form of expression in [[French hip-hop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosen | first=Jody | date=10 November 2005 | title=David Brooks, Playa Hater | work=[[Slate Magazine]] | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2130120 | accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists claim that it fits well with the musical medium because "form ranks way over substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=St. Alse | first=Yaka | date=21 January 2005 | title=Notes to 'Wardsback'  | work=Open Brackets: Lost in Translation | url=http://openbrackets.com/article/640/wardsback | accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage name of Belgian pop artist and songwriter [[Stromae]] (real name Paul Van Haver) is ''verlan'' for "[[wikt:maestro#French|maestro]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sayare | first=Scott | date=10 October 2013 | title=Stromae: Disillusion, With a Dance Beat  | work=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/arts/15iht-stromae15.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voltaire'', the nom-de-plume of [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet]], is possibly a ''verlan'' word for [[Airvault]].

The municipality population in 2011 was 11,772,&lt;ref name=ine&gt;[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&amp;xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0005889&amp;contexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0 Instituto Nacional de Estatística]&lt;/ref&gt; in an area of {{convert|141.55|km²|2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=dgt&gt;[http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Obidos April 2009-4b.jpg|thumb|The castle and wall of Óbidos, view from the west.]]
[[File:Azulejo IMG 2002.JPG|thumb|Azulejo on Óbidos city gate]]
[[File:Óbidos, Blick auf die Santa Maria.JPG|thumb|Top view of the Santa Maria]]
The name "Óbidos" is a Latinised (oppidum, citadel) derivation of the older Celtic "Eburobricio". The municipality had its growth from a Roman settlement near the foothills of an elevated escarpment. The region of Óbidos, extending from the Atlantic to the interior of [[Estremadura Province (1936–76)|Estremadura Province]] along the rivers and lakes has been inhabited since the late [[Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name="TourObid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obidos.pt/CustomPages/ShowPage.aspx?pageid=43e9626a-4494-4dae-a3ff-1cb1c20b35d1|title=Resumo Histórico|editor=Óbidos Patrimonium|publisher=Câmara Municipal de Óbidos|location=Óbidos, Portugal|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was constructed by early [[Celt]] tribes, that was later a centre of trade for the [[Phoenicia]]ns.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; Archeological evidence from the base of the medieval tower (south of Facho) at [[Castle of Óbidos|Óbidos Castle]] indicates Roman construction linked to an outpost of the Roman [[civitas]] of ''Eburobrittium'', a large urban area that has been under excavation.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; Archeological surveys determined the remains of a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[Roman baths|baths]] and other Roman structures near the settlement.

After the [[Migration Period|fall of Rome]], the region came under the influence of the [[Visigoths]], although specific records are missing. The Roman town of ''Eburobrittium'' was abandoned in the 5th century for the more secure hilltop where today the principal settlement is located. Sometime after 713 the [[Moors]] established a fortification on this mountain, while a Christian community of [[Mozarabs]] lived in the ''Moncharro'' neighbourhood.

The area was [[Reconquista|taken from the Moors]] by the first King of Portugal, [[Afonso Henriques]], in 1148. Tradition states that one knight, [[Gonçalo Mendes da Maia]], was responsible for the successful storming of the Moorish castle.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; The retaking of Óbidos was a final stage in the [[Reconquista|conquest]] of the [[Estremadura Province (1936–76)|Estremadura Province]] region, after the settlements of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Torres Vedras]]. Following the control of the region, the settlement received its first ''[[foral]]'' ([[charter]]) in 1195, during the reign of King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]]. In 1210, [[Afonso II of Portugal|King Afonso II]] gave the title of this village to Queen Urraca. Since then, Óbidos has often been patronized by the Queens of Portugal, giving rise to its informal title as ''Vila das Rainhas'' ({{lang-en|town of the Queens}}); several royal consorts enriched the village with donations from the [[Middle Ages]] until the 16th century.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt;

The castle and walls of Óbidos were remodelled during the reign of King [[Dinis I of Portugal|Dinis I]].&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; The limestone and marble structure was strengthened and elaborated, while the [[keep]] was created in the 14th century, by King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando]]. By the time of the first remodelling project, the settlement had also grown beyond the gates of the castle.

The Church of Santa Maria in Óbidos was the setting for the wedding of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] to his cousin, Princess [[Isabella of Coimbra]], on 15 August 1441, when they were both still children aged 9 and 10, respectively.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; Administrative reforms conducted by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] at Óbidos in 1513, included the institution of a formal [[foral|charter]] and major requalification of the urban area.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt;

The 1755 earthquake caused damage to the village walls, a few churches, and many buildings, and resulted in the loss of architecture of Arab or Medieval inspiration.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; Similarly, the Peninsular Wars were fought in the vicinity of Óbidos, including the Battle of Roliça.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt; More recently, the village was a centre of government and meeting place for those involved in the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], linking it to the armed forces movement revolt.&lt;ref name=TourObid/&gt;

==Tourism==
The area of the town of Óbidos is located on a hilltop, encircled by a fortified wall. Óbidos remains a well-preserved example of medieval architecture; its streets, squares, walls and its castle are a popular tourist destination. The castle now houses a [[pousada]]. The municipality is also home to the famous Praia D'el Rey golf complex, one of the top golf resorts in Europe, and Royal Óbidos - Spa &amp; Golf Resort.

===Óbidos Medieval Market===
Each July Óbidos castle hosts a traditional 'Medieval Market'. For two weeks the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of medieval Europe.

Flowing banners and [[heraldic flag]]s set the mood together with hundreds of entertainers and stall holders dressed as merchants, [[juggler]]s, [[jester]]s, wandering [[minstrel]]s, soldiers and more. Visitors can shop at the traditional handcrafts fair or watch medieval shows, horse displays and a costumed parade that winds its way through the streets. There are also displays of [[Jousting|jousting knights]] and armed combat.

Spit roasted hog, hearty soups, rabbit, lamb, cod, quail, sausages and other grilled meats are just some of the many medieval style meals on offer from dozens of "taverns" and stalls spread throughout the market. Drinking from pewter [[tankard]]s and eating from wooden [[trencher (tableware)|trencher]] all adds to the experience.
