'''Academic art''', or '''academicism''' or '''academism''', is a style of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]] produced under the influence of European [[academies of art]].  Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which was practiced under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]], and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Thomas Couture]], and [[Hans Makart]]. In this context it is often called "academism", "academicism", "[[L'art pompier|art pompier]]" (pejoratively), and "eclecticism", and sometimes linked with "[[historicism (art)|historicism]]" and "[[syncretism]]".

== The academies in history ==
The first academy of art was founded in [[Florence]] in Italy by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect [[Giorgio Vasari]] who called it the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']] (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the Company was a kind of corporation which every working artist in Tuscany could join, the Academy comprised only the most eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo's court, and had the task of supervising the whole artistic production of the medicean state. In this medicean institution students learned the "arti del disegno" (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on [[anatomy]] and [[geometry]]. Another academy, the [[Accademia di San Luca]] (named after the patron saint of painters, [[St. Luke]]), was founded about a decade later in [[Rome]]. The Accademia di San Luca served an educational function and was more concerned with [[art theory]] than the Florentine one. In 1582 [[Annibale Carracci]] opened his very influential ''Academy of Desiderosi'' in [[Bologna]] without official support; in some ways this was more like a traditional artist's workshop, but that he felt the need to label it as an "academy" demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.

Accademia di San Luca later served as the model for the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] founded in [[France]] in 1648, and which later became the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]. The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was founded in an effort to distinguish artists "who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art" from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.

After the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was reorganized in 1661 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France, a controversy occurred among the members that dominated artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This "battle of styles" was a conflict over whether [[Peter Paul Rubens]] or [[Nicolas Poussin]] was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called "poussinistes", argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called "rubenistes", argued that color (colore) should dominate art, because of its appeal to emotion.

The debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] typified by the artwork of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Romanticism]] typified by the artwork of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or to learn by looking at the artistic masters of the past.

Academies using the French model formed throughout Europe, and imitated the teachings and styles of the French Académie. In [[England]], this was the [[Royal Academy]]. The [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the [[Danish Golden Age]] of roughly 1800-1850 were nearly all trained there, and many returned to teach and the history of the [[art of Denmark]] is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.

One effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for [[women artists]], who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century (1861 for the Royal Academy). This was partly because of concerns over the impropriety presented by nudity. Special arrangements were often made for female students until the 20th century.

== Development of the academic style ==
Since the onset of the poussiniste-rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of [[Neoclassicism]] with the color of [[Romanticism]]. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them [[Théodore Chassériau]], [[Ary Scheffer]], [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], and [[Thomas Couture]]. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing "color and line as the same thing".
Thomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method &amp;mdash; arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the "value" of form.

Another development during this period included adopting historical styles in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted, called [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. This is best seen in the work of Baron [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]], a later influence on [[James Tissot]]. It's also seen in the development of the [[Neo-Grec]] style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dusk (Bouguereau).jpg|thumb|left|''Evening''. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1863.]]  --&gt;
The art world also grew to give increasing focus on [[allegory]] in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke [[Platonic form]]s, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, [[John Keats|Keats']] famous musing "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". The paintings were desired to be an "idée", a full and complete idea. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau|Bouguereau]] is known to have said that he wouldn't paint "a war", but would paint "War". Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like ''Dawn'', ''Dusk'', ''Seeing'', and ''Tasting'', where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.

The trend in art was also towards greater [[idealism (arts)|idealism]], which is contrary to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.

Because history and mythology were considered as plays or [[dialectic]]s of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was considered the most serious form of painting. A [[hierarchy of genres]], originally created in the 17th century, was valued, where [[history painting]]—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, next [[Genre works|genre painting]], then [[portrait]]ure, [[still-life]], and [[Landscape art|landscape]]. History painting was also known as the "grande genre". Paintings of [[Hans Makart]] are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a [[historicism (art)|historicism]] in decoration to dominate the style of 19th century [[Vienna]] culture. [[Paul Delaroche]] is a typifying example of French history painting.

All of these trends were influenced by the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.

Towards the end of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, and the most popular exhibition was the [[Paris Salon]] and beginning in 1903, the [[Salon d'Automne]]. These [[Salon (gathering)#Public salons|salons]] were sensational events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of pictures were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as "Salon style". A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]], [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] were leading figures of this art world.

During the reign of academic art, the paintings of the [[Rococo]] era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]] were popular again. The academic art world also idolized [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], for the [[idealism (art)|ideality]] of his work, in fact preferring him over [[Michelangelo]].

Academic [[Art in Poland]] flourished under [[Jan Matejko]], who established the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]]. Many of these works can be seen in the
[[Sukiennice Museum|Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice]] in [[Kraków]].

Academic art not only held influence in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This was especially true for [[Latin America]]n nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the [[French Revolution]], sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is [[Ángel Zárraga]] of [[Mexico]].

== Academic training ==
[[File:École des beaux-arts (from the live).jpg|thumb|315px|''Students painting "from life" at the École''. Photographed late 1800s.]]

Young artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy's school, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Drawings and paintings of the nude, called "académies", were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of art making. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.
[[File:Sykes-demos.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Demosthenes at the Seashore'', a Royal Academy prize winning drawing, 1888.]]
If approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each students' progress.

The most famous art competition for students was the [[Prix de Rome]]. The winner of the Prix de Rome was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française's [[French Academy in Rome|school at the Villa Medici]] in [[Rome]] for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.

As noted, a successful showing at the Salon was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement "on the line," or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were "skyed," or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician.

== Criticism and legacy ==
[[File:This Year Venuses Again (Daumier).jpg|thumb|241px|[[Caricature]] (French [[bourgeoisie]]): ''This Year Venuses Again… Always Venuses!''. [[Honoré Daumier]], No. 2 from series in ''Le Charivati'', 1864.]]

Academic art was first criticized for its use of [[idealism (art)|idealism]], by [[realism (arts)|Realist]] artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the "[[Licked finish|false surface]]" of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist [[Théodule Ribot]] worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.

Stylistically, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], who advocated quickly [[plein air|painting outdoors]] exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting [[oil paint|oil sketches]] of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic "fini," changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] is constructed geometrically on a flat surface and is not really the product of sight, Impressionists disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.

Realists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. It is important to note that most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]]. [[Claude Monet]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Édouard Manet]], and even [[Henri Matisse]] were students under academic artists.

As [[modern art]] and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, [[bourgeois]], and "styleless". The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' (''pompier'' means "fireman") alluding to the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]] (who was held in esteem by the academy) which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. The paintings were called "grandes machines" which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.

This denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] who stated that all academic art is "[[kitsch]]". Other artists, such as the [[Symbolist painters]] and some of the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], were kinder to the tradition{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the [[allegory|allegorical]] nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.

With the goals of [[Postmodernism]] in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the [[Classical Realism|Classical Realist]] [[Atelier Method|atelier]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James: "The New Old School", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, September 2006, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.

{{Wiktionary|adage}}
An '''adage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|ᵻ|dʒ}}; Latin: '''adagium''') is a concise, memorable, and usually [[philosophical]] [[aphorism]] that communicates an important truth derived from experience, [[Convention (norm)|custom]], or both, and that many persons consider true and credible because of its longeval tradition, i. e. being handed down generation to generation, or [[memetics|memetic replication]].

An adage sometimes implicates a failure to plan, such as "do not count your chickens before they hatch" and "do not burn your bridges".{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Adages may be interesting observations, [[ethics|ethical]] rules, or [[skeptical]] comments on life in general.

Some adages are products of [[folklore|folk wisdom]] that attempt to summarize a basic truth; these are generally known as "[[Proverb|proverbs]]" or "bywords". An adage that describes a general [[morality|moral]] rule is a "[[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]". A pithy expression that has not necessarily gained credibility by tradition, but is distinguished by especial depth or excellent style is denominated an "[[aphorism]]", while one distinguished by [[wit]] or [[irony]] is often denominated an "[[epigram]]".

Through overuse, an adage may become denominated a "[[cliché]]", "[[truism]]", or "old saw". Adages originating in modernity are often given proper names and denominated  "laws", in imitation of the nomenclature of [[physical law]]s, or "principles".{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some adages, such as [[Murphy's Law]], are first formulated informally and given proper names later, while others, such as the [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]], are given proper names when formulated; it might be argued that the latter do not represent ''true'' adages, but the two are often difficult to distinguish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Adages that were collected and used by ancient writers inspired [[Dutch people|Dutch]]  [[humanism|humanist]] [[Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus]] to publish his own collection. He revised his moderate volume of 800 adages multiple times until the final edition of ''[[Adagia]]'' published in 1536 included over 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speroni|first1=Charles|title=Wit and wisdom of the Italian Renaissance|date=1964|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many such collections since, usually in vernacular languages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Adages formulated in popular works of [[fiction]] often find their way into [[popular culture]], especially when a [[subculture]] devoted to the work or its [[genre]] exists, as in the case of novels of [[science fiction]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Many [[profession]]s and subcultures create their own adages, which are cognizable as a kind of [[jargon]]; such adages may find their way into popular use, sometimes being altered in the process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Virtual community|Online communities]], such as those that develop in [[Internet forum]]s or [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s, often generate their own adages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|year= 1994|isbn=0-87779-132-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Studies Association''' ('''ASA''') is an association of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] with an interest in the continent of [[Africa]]. Started in 1957, the ASA is the leading organization of African Studies in [[North America]]. The associations headquarters are [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]]. The ASA holds annual conferences

As a result of racial and political disputes over exclusion from leadership positions of black academics and ASA leaders' ties with the US intelligence and military, the ASA split in 1968, when the Black Caucus of the ASA, led by [[John Henrik Clarke]], founded the '''African Heritage Studies Association''' (AHSA).&lt;ref name=co/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiley|first1=David|title=Militarizing Africa and African Studies and the U.S. Africanist Response |journal=African Studies Review|volume=55|issue=02|year=2013|pages=147–161|issn=0002-0206|doi=10.1353/arw.2012.0041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
{{Quotation|That so many writers have been prepared to accept a kind of martyrdom is the best tribute that flesh can pay to the living spirit of man as expressed in his literature. One cannot doubt that the martyrdom will continue to be gladly embraced. To some of us, the wresting of beauty out of language is the only thing in the world that matters.| [[Anthony Burgess]], ''English Literature'' (ch. 21 of 1974 edition)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6883">'''Archaeological looting in Romania''' refers to illegal digging and removal of ancient artifacts from [[Romanian archaeology|archaeological sites in Romania]] in order to be sold on the [[black market]] of antiquities in Western Europe and the United States.

Notable among the treasure looted are two dozen [[Dacian bracelets]] which were dug up and stolen around 1999-2001 from the archeological site at [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]]. Twelve of which were recovered by the Romanian state and at least another twelve are still missing.&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Transylvanians Rich in Gold, Treasure Shows |author=Traci Watson |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/110113-transylvanians-gold-bracelets-treasure-dracula-vampires-science/ |newspaper=National Geographic News |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWF2LMZr?url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/110113-transylvanians-gold-bracelets-treasure-dracula-vampires-science/ |archivedate= 8 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting groups==
In Romania, unauthorized digs are illegal around the areas designated archeological sites. Some looters use flocks of sheep in order to justify their presence in the area: they camp near the archeological sites and use donkeys to carry their equipment.&lt;ref name="oi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Braconierii arheologici folosesc turmele de oi pentru a se apropia de siturile din muntii Orastiei |author= |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-7322157-braconierii-arheologici-folosesc-turmele-pentru-apropia-siturile-din-muntii-orastiei.htm |newspaper=hotnews.ro |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, twelve looters (among which [[Iulian Ceia]]) were convicted to between 7 and 12 years in jail for looting Dacian bracelets and selling them on the international black market; they have however appealed and the trial is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Procurorii au cerut arestarea lui Iulian Ceia în dosarul aurului dacic.

In 2012, four looters (Liviu Darius Baci, Mircea Mihăilă, Florin Sebastian Zvîncă, Romică Hîndorean) were sent to trial for looting from Sarmisegetusa Regia between 1998 and 2009. They looted 3600 Greek coins (estimated at €3,794,550), a necklace (estimated at €100,000) and 35 Roman denarii (from [[Dâncu Mare]]).&lt;ref name="furat"/&gt;

==Artifacts looted==
[[File:Dacian Gold Bracelets at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011 - 1.jpg|thumb|Dacian Gold Bracelets at the National Museum of Romanian History]]

===Dacian bracelets===

The golden bracelets, weighing between 800 and 1200 grams each, were discovered by looters in the Sarmisegetusa Regia Dacian fortress (UNESCO World Heritage site) in the [[Orăștie Mountains]] and they were illegally exported. They were recovered by the Romanian authorities from the international market through a collaboration with the German authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Constantinescu et al., "[http://www.acad.ro/sectii2002/proceedings/doc2012-1/03-Constantinescu.pdf Archaeometallurgical Characterization Of Ancient Gold Artifacts From Romanian Museums Using XRF, Micro-pixe And Micro-SR-XRF Methods]", in ''Proceedings Of The Romanian Academy'' Series A, Volume 13, Number 1/2012, pp. 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Koson 79000126.jpg|thumb|A Koson Dacian coin]]

===Dacian coins===

Following the looting, gold Koson coins have been dispersed around the world, being sold at coin auctions.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; The Romanian police began an international investigation which resulted in seizures in Hamburg and London (2010) and Dublin (2011), the source of the two coins seized in the Dublin auction being a New York auction.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gardaí suspect gold coins from looted treasure trove |author=Jim Cusack |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gardai-suspect-gold-coins-from-looted-treasure-trove-26712970.html |newspaper=Independent |date=March 13, 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such coins have an estimated value of €800 each.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; The Romanian authorities have so far, recovered 700 gold Kosons and 202 silver Kosons.&lt;ref name="furat"/&gt;

A treasure containing 3600 Greek coins (bearing the names of [[Lysimachus]], [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnakes]] and [[Asander]]) weighing 30&amp;nbsp;kg was looted in August 1998 from the Sarmizegetusa Regia site of [[Șesu Căprăreței]].&lt;ref name="furat"/&gt; It was taken illegally out of the country and sold on the Triton III auction (November/December 1999) in the United States.&lt;ref name="viata"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vănătorul de comori a cheltuit o avere pe maşini de lux şi a sponsorizat Primăria Deva.

The Romanian authorities recovered only 28 Lysimachus coins.&lt;ref name="furat"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vânătorii de comori au furat tezaure dacice de patru milioane de euro.

On 21 May 2013 three Lysimachus coins minted on [[Constanța|Tomis]] and [[Callatis]] were recovered from looters among other Roman and medieval coins.&lt;ref name="furat2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.realitatea.net/doi-hunedoreni-ascundeau-in-casa-o-adevarata-comoara-politistii-i-au-prins_1186236.html | title=Doi hunedoreni ascundeau în casă o adevărată COMOARĂ.

===Other artifacts===

In 2009, the Romanian authorities recovered from Germany an ancient golden necklace with pendants that has been looted around 2002-2003 from the archeological site of [[Dacian fortress of Căpâlna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tezaur antic recuperat din Germania |author=Mihaela Moraru |url=http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/tezaur-antic-recuperat-din-germania-837541.html |newspaper=Evenimentul Zilei |date=January 29, 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities also recovered three royal Dacian iron shields.&lt;ref name="furat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5991">'''Audience design''' is a sociolinguistic model outlined by [[Allan Bell (Sociolinguist)|Allan Bell]] in 1984 which proposes that linguistic [[Style shifting|style-shifting]] occurs primarily in response to a speaker's audience. According to this model, speakers adjust their speech primarily towards that of their audience in order to express solidarity or intimacy with them, or away from their audience's speech to express distance.

==History==
Earlier sociolinguistic research was primarily influenced by [[William Labov]], who studied style-shifting as a function of attention paid to speech, and who developed techniques for eliciting various styles of speech during research interviews. Some sociolinguists have questioned whether Labov's categories of speech style apply outside the confines of the sociolinguistic interview, and some have suggested that attention to speech alone does not account for all types of style-shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A. (1984) Language Style as Audience Design. In Coupland, N. and A. Jaworski (1997, eds.) ''Sociolinguistics: a Reader and Coursebook'', pp. 240-50. New York: St Mattin's Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allan Bell's research==
The audience design model was inspired by Giles' [[communication accommodation theory]] and Bell's own research on the speech of radio news broadcasters in [[New Zealand]]. The study focused on two radio stations which shared the same recording studio and some of the same individual newsreaders. One station, [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]], attracted an audience from higher socioeconomic brackets. The other, a local community station, drew a broader range of listeners including those from lower socioeconomic brackets.

Bell's analysis of the newsreaders' speech revealed that they spoke differently based on the intended radio audience. He identified relationships in the frequency of [[Sociolinguistics#Sociolinguistic variables|sociolinguistic variables]], such as postvocalic [t], which corresponded to the speech of the radio audiences. Bell proposed that because the topic of speech (identical news topics), speaker, and speech activity were the same, the most plausible way of accounting for the variation was that the newscasters were attuning their speech to what they perceived to be the norms for the respective radio audiences.

==Audience types==
The audience design framework distinguishes between several kinds of audience types based on three criteria from the perspective of the speaker: known (whether an addressee is known to be part of a speech context), ratified (the speaker acknowledges the listener's presence in the speech context), or addressed (the listener is directly spoken to). The impact of audience members on the speaker's style-shifting is proportional to the degree to which the speaker recognizes and ratifies them. Bell defined the following audience types:

*Addressee – listeners who are known, ratified, and addressed
*Auditor – listeners who are not directly addressed, but are known and ratified
*Overhearer – non-ratified listeners of whom the speaker is aware
*Eavesdropper – non-ratified listeners of whom the speaker is unaware

==Referee design==
In addition to audience design, Bell introduces an additional component of style shifting which he terms 'referee design'. This type of style-shifting refers to situations where the speaker does not accommodate to the speech style of their immediate audience, but rather "creatively uses language features ... from beyond the immediate speech community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Style and Sociolinguistic Variation|last=Bell|first=Allan|publisher=CUP|year=2001|isbn=|editor-last=Eckert|editor-first=Penelope|location=Cambridge|pages=147|chapter=Back in style: Reworking Audience Design|editor-last2=Rickford|editor-first2=John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with audience design which can be defined as a responsive style-shift where the speaker ''responds'' to specific factors of the speech context, referee design is characterised as an ''initiative'' shift. In such situations, speakers may use styles associated with non-present social groups to signal hypothetical allegiances with these speakers.

For instance, Rickford and McNair-Knox (1994) examined the speech of Foxy Boston, an African-American teenager. Whilst on the whole they found that Foxy showed higher levels of AAVE features when communicating with African-American interviewers than with the European interviewer, thereby demonstrating the effect of audience design, in one situation Foxy showed considerably lower levels of AAVE features when interacting with the African-American interviewers. Interpreting these patterns, Rickford and McNair-Knox argue that Foxy's speech can be interpreted in terms of referee design. At the time, Foxy was attending a mainstream American High School where Standard American English was likely to be overtly prescribed. Thus, it is possible that Foxy was designing her speech to reflect the norms of a non-present speech community with which she identifies.

'''''Between the Sheets''''' is a one-act play written by Jordi Mand. It received its first full production with [[Nightwood Theatre]] in Toronto in 2012, and it has also been produced by The Basement Theatre in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basementtheatre.co.nz/whats-on/between-the-sheets/ What's On: Between the Sheets]&lt;/ref&gt; and Pi Theatre in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pitheatre.com/between-the-sheets/ Pi Theatre: Between the Sheets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124034/http://pitheatre.com/between-the-sheets/ |date=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play deals with both special-needs children and sexual affairs, and includes drama and occasional suspense.

The script was released in print in 2014 by the [[Playwrights Canada Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/between-the-sheets.html Between the Sheets (print)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bizarro Fiction''' is a contemporary [[literary genre]], which often uses elements of [[absurdism]], [[satire]], and the [[grotesque]], along with pop-surrealism and [[genre fiction]] staples, in order to create subversive, weird, and entertaining works. The term was adopted in 2005 by the [[small press|independent publishing companies]] Eraserhead Press, [[Raw Dog Screaming Press]], and Afterbirth Books. Much of its community revolves around Eraserhead Press, which is based in [[Portland, Oregon]], and has hosted the [[BizarroCon]] yearly since 2008. The introduction to the first ''Bizarro Starter Kit'' describes Bizarro as "literature's equivalent to the [[cult film|cult]] section at the video store" and a genre that "strives not only to be strange, but fascinating, thought-provoking, and, above all, fun to read."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizarro Starter Kit.'' Bizarro Books, 2006. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rose O'Keefe of Eraserhead Press: "Basically, if an audience enjoys a book or film primarily because of its weirdness, then it is Bizarro. Weirdness might not be the work's only appealing quality, but it is the major one."&lt;ref name="Bizarro FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondobizarro.yuku.com/topic/362|title=Bizarro FAQs – What is BIZARRO? – Discussion Areas – Mondo Bizarro – Message Board|first=Rose|last=O'Keefe|date=2 October 2005|work=|publisher=[[Yuku]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Bizarro has more in common with [[speculative fiction]] genres (such as [[science-fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]]) than with [[avant-garde]] movements (such as [[Dadaism]] and [[surrealism]]), which readers and critics often associate it with.&lt;ref name="Fantasy Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/2010/04/bizarro-fiction-101-not-just-weird-for-weirds-sake/|title=Fantasy Magazine » Bizarro Fiction 101: Not Just Weird for Weird’s Sake|author=Randy Henderson|date=21 April 2010|work=|publisher=''[[Fantasy Magazine]]''|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the genre may place an emphasis on the cult and outré, it is not without critical praise. Books by authors who have identified or have been identified as Bizarro have been praised by [[Lloyd Kaufman]],&lt;ref name="horroryearbook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horroryearbook.com/549985/ass-goblins-of-auschwitz|title=Ass Goblins of Auschwitz at horroryearbook.com|author=Kevin Touch|date=21 May 2010|work=|publisher=horroryearbook|accessdate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722130803/http://www.horroryearbook.com/549985/ass-goblins-of-auschwitz|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Moorcock]]&lt;ref name="The Velocity Gospel review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview28/print|title=Curiouser and curiouser|author=Michael Moorcock|author-link=Michael Moorcock|date=15 June 2010|work=|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[guardian.co.uk]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jul/16/bizarro-fiction-terribly-good|title=Bizarro fiction: it's terribly good|author=Damien G Walter|date=16 July 2010|work=|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bizarro novels have been finalists for the [[Philip K.

==Origins==

Bizarro literature can trace its roots at least as far back as the foundation of Eraserhead Press in 1999,&lt;ref name="About « Eraserhead Press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eraserheadpress.com/about/|title=About « Eraserhead Press|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Eraserhead Press|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the description of the literature as "Bizarro" is a more recent development. Previous terms used to refer to the burgeoning scene include "[[Irrealism (the arts)|irreal]]"&lt;ref name="Dark Scribe Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darkscribemagazine.com/feature-interviews/d-harlan-wilson-keeping-it-irreal.html|title=Dark Scribe Magazine – Feature Interviews – D. Harlan Wilson: Keeping It Irreal|author=Blu Gilliand|date=1 August 2009|work=|publisher=Dark Scribe Magazine|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Specusphere - Irrealism and the Bizarro movement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specusphere.com/feature-articles/irrealism-and-the-bizarro-movement.html|title=The Specusphere – Irrealism and the Bizarro movement|author=Stephen Thompson|date=19 August 2008|work=|publisher=The Specusphere|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[absurdist fiction|new absurdism]]",&lt;ref name="The Specusphere - Irrealism and the Bizarro movement"/&gt; but neither of these was used broadly. On 19 June 2005, Kevin Dole II released "What The Fuck is This All About", a sort of manifesto for the then unnamed genre.&lt;ref name="Bizarro FAQs-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondobizarro.yuku.com/forum/viewtopic/id/968|title=What the Fuck is This All About? – Articles &amp; Essays – Discussion Areas – Mondo Bizarro – Message Board|author=Kevin Dole 2|date=28 June 2005|work=|publisher=[[Yuku]]|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="So What the Fuck Is This All About?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizarrocentral.com/article_detail.asp?articleID=8 |title=So What the Fuck Is This All About?|author=Kevin Dole 2|date=24 August 2007|work=|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=22 October 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824114545/http://www.bizarrocentral.com/article_detail.asp?articleID=8 |archivedate = 24 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kevin Dole 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizarrocentral.com/authors/25-kevin-dole-2.html|title=Kevin Dole 2|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Bizarro Central|accessdate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729042919/http://bizarrocentral.com/authors/25-kevin-dole-2.html|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the essay does not feature the word "Bizarro," subsequent discussion about the essay led to the name as well as the inauguration of the Mondo Bizarro Forum.

In his essay, "The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized",&lt;ref name="Nab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bizarrocentral.com/2013/06/22/a-blast-from-the-bizarro-past|title=The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized|last=Bradley|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Bradley (author)|date=|website=Bizarro Central|work=|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;!-- Text included as part of the ref, should it be a separate one? : see also ''Fission Among the Fanatics'' by Tom Bradley, Spuyten Duyvil Books (NYC), pages 231-245.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tom Bradley (author)|Tom Bradley]] traces the genre's roots back in literary history to the time of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s "gogolization," and his cry of despair and horror at having his central nervous system colonized: "...after reading [[Gogol]], one's eyes become gogolized. One is apt to see bits of his world in the most unexpected places."&lt;ref name="The Overcoat and The Nose"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Overcoat and The Nose|last=Gogol |first=Nikolai |authorlink=Nikolai Gogol |translator=Ronald Wilks |year=1995 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradley claims the Bizarro movement is continuing and fulfilling that gogolization process, under the name "Bizarroization": "...we have been completing the preposterous project which [Nabokov] took over from Gogol nearly a hundred years ago.."&lt;ref name="Nab"/&gt; Bradley further asserts that Bizarro writers can trace their spiritual roots back to the [[Epistulae ex Ponto|letters]] which [[Ovid]] wrote while exiled on the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Notable Bizarro Works&lt;!-- This is a work in progress --&gt; ==
Most notable Bizarro works generally tend to come from the major Bizarro presses, most notably Eraserhead Press. Although there are many books that have qualities of Bizarro, such as William Burroughs [[Naked Lunch]] or Daniel Z Lewinski's [[House of Leaves]], a Bizarro work tends to be defined by its publication inside of the Bizarro scene, from between the years 2001, when the first Carlton Mellick III book was published, to the present. 

Although Bizarro is a DIY genre that gets little media attention, a notable Bizarro work is often one that has broken past the barriers of the genre and received wider attention in literature and media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">The '''Cloward&amp;ndash;Piven strategy''' is a political strategy outlined in 1966 by [[United States|American]] sociologists and political activists [[Richard Cloward]] and [[Frances Fox Piven]] that called for overloading the [[United States welfare state|U.S. public welfare system]] in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to a replacement of the welfare system with a national system of  "[[Guaranteed minimum income|a guaranteed annual income]] and thus an end to poverty". &lt;ref name="nyt196605" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the weight" /&gt;

==History==
Cloward and Piven were both professors at the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]. The strategy was outlined in a May 1966 article in the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' titled  "The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty".&lt;ref name="nyt196605"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/business/media/08nation.html | title=Bad News for Liberals May Be Good News for a Liberal Magazine | first=Jeremy W. | last=Peters | date=November 7, 2010 | accessdate=2010-06-17 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the weight"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty |last=Cloward |first=Richard |author2=Piven, Frances |date=May 2, 1966 |publisher=(Originally published in ''The Nation'') |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/03/24-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two stated that many Americans who were eligible for welfare were not receiving benefits, and that a welfare enrollment drive would strain local budgets, precipitating a crisis at the state and local levels that would be a wake-up call for the federal government, particularly the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. There would also be side consequences of this strategy, according to Cloward and Piven. These would include: easing the plight of the poor in the short-term (through their participation in the welfare system); shoring up support for the national Democratic Party-then splintered by pluralistic interests (through its cultivation of poor and minority constituencies by implementing a national "solution" to poverty); and relieving local governments of the financially and politically onerous burdens of public welfare (through a national "solution" to poverty).&lt;ref name="the weight"/&gt;

==Strategy==
Cloward and Piven's article is focused on forcing the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which in 1966 controlled the presidency and both houses of the [[United States Congress]], to take federal action to help the poor. They stated that full enrollment of those eligible for welfare "would produce bureaucratic disruption in welfare agencies and fiscal disruption in local and state governments" that would: "...deepen existing divisions among elements in the big-city Democratic coalition: the remaining white middle class, the working-class ethnic groups and the growing minority poor. To avoid a further weakening of that historic coalition, a national Democratic administration would be constrained to advance a federal solution to poverty that would override local welfare failures, local class and racial conflicts and local revenue dilemmas."&lt;ref name="Cloward and Piven, p. 510"&gt;Cloward and Piven, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

They further wrote:

{{cquote|The ultimate objective of this strategy—to wipe out poverty by establishing a guaranteed annual income—will be questioned by some. Because the ideal of individual social and economic mobility has deep roots, even activists seem reluctant to call for national programs to eliminate poverty by the outright [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution of income]].&lt;ref name="Cloward and Piven, p. 510"/&gt;}}

Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews wrote that Cloward and Piven "proposed to create a crisis in the current welfare system &amp;ndash; by exploiting the gap between welfare law and practice &amp;ndash; that would ultimately bring about its collapse and replace it with a system of guaranteed annual income. They hoped to accomplish this end by informing the poor of their rights to welfare assistance, encouraging them to apply for benefits and, in effect, overloading an already overburdened bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Road Not Taken|last=Reisch|first=Michael|author2=Janice Andrews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0iC56biZOgC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=cloward+piven+crisis+strategy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=FS1gpmnk4K&amp;sig=6u84VMirF97Qjb0x4lb6PYZNxgo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result|pages=144&amp;ndash;146|year=2001|publisher=Brunner Routledge|isbn=1-58391-025-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on Democrats ===
The authors pinned their hopes on creating disruption within the Democratic Party: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Conservative Republicans are always ready to declaim the evils of public welfare, and they would probably be the first to raise a hue and cry. But deeper and politically more telling conflicts would take place within the Democratic coalition...Whites &amp;ndash; both working class ethnic groups and many in the middle class &amp;ndash; would be aroused against the ghetto poor, while liberal groups, which until recently have been comforted by the notion that the poor are few... would probably support the movement. Group conflict, spelling political crisis for the local party apparatus, would thus become acute as welfare rolls mounted and the strains on local budgets became more severe.”&lt;ref&gt;Cloward and Piven, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
[[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]], chairman of [[The Conservative Caucus]], was quoted in 1982 as saying that the strategy could be effective because "[[Great Society]] programs had created a vast army of full-time liberal activists whose salaries are paid from the taxes of conservative working people."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Drive to Sign Up Poor for Voting Meets Resistance |author=Robert Pear |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1984-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal commentator [[Michael Tomasky]], writing about the strategy in the 1990s and again in 2011, called it "wrongheaded and self-defeating", writing: "It apparently didn't occur to [Cloward and Piven] that the system would just regard rabble-rousing black people as a phenomenon to be ignored or quashed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/jan/24/us-politics-fox-news Glenn Beck and Fran Piven], Michael Tomasky, ''Michael Tomasky's Blog'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of the strategy==
In papers published in 1971 and 1977, Cloward and Piven argued that mass unrest in the United States, especially between 1964 and 1969, did lead to a massive expansion of welfare rolls, though not to the guaranteed-income program that they had hoped for.&lt;ref name="albritton"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1953984 |title=Social Amelioration through Mass Insurgency? A Reexamination of the Piven and Cloward Thesis |last=Albritton |first=Robert |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |date=December 1979 |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=1003–1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Robert Albritton disagreed, writing in 1979 that the data did not support this thesis; he offered an alternative explanation for the rise in welfare caseloads.

In his 2006 book ''Winning the Race'', political commentator [[John McWhorter]] attributed the rise in the welfare state after the 1960s to the Cloward–Piven strategy, but wrote about it negatively, stating that the strategy "created generations of black people for whom working for a living is an abstraction".&lt;ref name="mcwhorter"&gt;McWhorter, John, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5628075 John McWhorter: How Welfare Went Wrong]", ''NPR'', August 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Robert E. Weir in 2007: "Although the strategy helped to boost recipient numbers between 1966 and 1975, the revolution its proponents envisioned never transpired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YS69fMlIUX0C&amp;pg=PA616&amp;dq=%22cloward-piven+strategy%22&amp;client=firefox-a|last=Weir|first=Robert|title=Class in America|pages=616|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-33719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. ten Have]] has defined geneticization as "...a [[heuristic]] tool that can help to re-focus the moral debate on the implications of new genetic knowledge towards interpersonal relations, the power of medicine, the cultural context and social constraints, rather than emphasizing issues as personal autonomy and individual rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=ten Have |first=Henk A.M.J. |date=2001 |title=Genetics and culture: The geneticization thesis |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1023/A:1012090810798 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |language=en |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=295–304 |doi=10.1023/a:1012090810798 |issn=1386-7423}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is common for social scientists and bioethicists to argue that geneticization leads to a growing belief in [[genetic determinism]] and [[essentialism]] in the general public, and that this, in turn, increases [[discrimination]], [[social stigma|stigma]], and [[social inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name=hedgecoe/&gt;&lt;ref name=phelan/&gt; When Lippman originally coined the term "geneticization", for example, she was concerned about the potential for geneticization to increase public belief in biological essentialism, thereby reinforcing racism and discrimination against people with [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myWDPdQFapQC |title=An Anthropology of Biomedicine |last=Lock |first=Margaret |last2=Vinh-kim |first2=Nguyen |last3=Nguyen |first3=Vinh-Kim |date=2010-04-26 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405110723 |pages=310 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of the heuristic of geneticization also argue that the media's coverage of genetics contributes to geneticization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Árnason |first=Vilhjálmur |last2=Hjörleifsson |first2=Stefán |date=2007-08-18 |title=Geneticization and bioethics: advancing debate and research |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11019-007-9088-9 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |language=en |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=417–431 |doi=10.1007/s11019-007-9088-9 |issn=1386-7423}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical evidence on the link between geneticization and genetic determinism, and between genetic determinism, discrimination and inequality, is ambiguous, suggesting that the phenomenon of geneticization may not always follow the simple pattern that proponents of the concept ascribe to it.&lt;ref name=hedgecoe&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hedgecoe |first=Adam M |date=2009-12-15 |title=Geneticization: Debates and Controversies |url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9780470015902.a0005849.pub2 |journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |location=Chichester, UK |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0005849.pub2 |isbn=0470016175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grim's Ditch in High Scrubs Wood - geograph.org.uk - 1184627.jpg|thumb|Grim's Ditch near Hastoe]]
'''Grim's Ditch''' is a series of linear [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] in the [[Chilterns]] (southeast England). A complete outline cannot be identified but separate sections exist over a {{convert|30|km|adj=on}} span between [[Bradenham, Buckinghamshire]], [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]] and as far as [[Pitstone]] and [[Ivinghoe]] Buckinghamshire. Pottery shards have been unearthed in excavations during the 1970s and 1980s suggesting that its origin may have been during the [[Iron Age]] and was believed to have been during a period when the landscape was clearer of scrub and the dense woodland than today as the straighter sections would have required clear lines of sight. The first mention of Grim's Ditch was a grant of 1170–90 in the [[Missenden Abbey|Missenden]] [[Cartulary]] referring to it as ''Grimesdic''. The Anglo Saxons commonly named features of unexplained or mysterious origin ''Grim''. The word derives from the Norse word ''grimr'' meaning devil and a nickname for [[Odin]] or [[Wodin]] the God of War and Magic. Another mention is to be found in a 10th-century [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] boundary charter for the Mongewell area.

Its size varies considerably. At [[Hastoe]] the ditch is {{convert|3.5|m}} wide and {{convert|2|m}} deep with a bank of {{convert|2|m}} and an overall spread of {{convert|13.5|m}}.  The purpose of the earthwork is uncertain. It is thought by the [[Ordnance Survey]] (1974) that it may be a set of local boundaries used to control the movement of cattle and carts and dating back to the Iron Age, as no [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] event is connected with it. It is not seen as having a defensive function due to the way that the banks have been constructed. It may in fact be a collection of structures with two or more purposes, with the hilltop section near [[Cholesbury]] being associated with the nearby Iron Age [[Hillfort]] whilst other sections lower down towards [[Aylesbury Vale]] may demarcate areas where pig and cattle grazing occurred. Sections are scheduled as [[Scheduled Ancient Monument|ancient monuments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1005258 |desc=Grim's Ditch|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla (Spanish for "little war"), as applied to theatrical events, describes the act of spontaneous, surprise performances in unlikely public spaces to an unsuspecting audience. Typically these performances intend to draw attention to a political/social issue through [[satire]], [[protest]], and carnivalesque techniques. Many of these performances were a direct result of the radical [[social movement]]s of the late 1960s through mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster’s College Dictionary.

==Origins==
The term ''Guerrilla Theater'' was coined by Peter Berg, who in 1965 suggested it to [[R.G. Davis]] as the title of his essay on the actions of the  [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], an essay that was first published in 1966.&lt;ref name="BraunsteinDoyle02"&gt;Peter Braunstein, Michael William Doyle (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R178zShWUtIC ''Imagine nation: the American counterculture of the 1960s and '70s''], p.93 note #9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"&gt;{{cite book

Republished in ''[[The SFMT]]'', 149-53. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisRethinking"&gt;Davis (1971) ''Rethinking guerrilla theater, 1971, 1985'' in Donald Lazere [https://books.google.com/books?id=pT8X-YnxOHwC ''American media and mass culture: left perspectives'']  p.599&lt;/ref&gt; The term "guerrilla" was inspired by a passage in a 1961 [[Che Guevara]] essay, which read:&lt;ref name="Gordon07"&gt;Gordon, Kelly Carolyn (2007) ''Guerrilla theater'', in Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1''], pp.568-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernesto Guevara]] ''Guerrilla Warfare'', Thomas M. Davies, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8420-2678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The guerrilla fighter needs full help from the people.... From the very beginning he has the intention of destroying an unjust order and therefore an intention... to replace the old with something new.}}

Davis had studied [[Mime artist|mime]] and modern dance in the 1950s and had discovered [[commedia dell'arte]]. In autumn 1966 around 20 members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe broke off and started their own collective called [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]], who took their name from [[Diggers|a group of 17th century radicals in England]].

== Guerrilla theater in practice ==

Guerrilla theater shares its origins with many forms of political protest and street theatre including [[agitprop]] (agitation-propaganda), [[carnival]], [[parades]], [[Procession|pageants]], [[political protest]], [[performance art]], [[happening]]s, and, most notably, the Dada movement and [[street art|guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;Random House ''Webster's College Dictionary''.  New York: Random House, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this movement is widely studied in Theater History classrooms, the amount of research and documentation of guerrilla theater is surprisingly lacking.  The term, "Guerrilla Theater" seems to have emerged during the mid-1960s primarily as an upshot of activist [[Radical Theater]] groups such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], El [[Teatro Campesino]], and the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Cruz, Jan, ed.  ''Radical Street Performance''.  New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has important roots in [[Allan Kaprow]]'s "happenings".

The first widely documented guerrilla performances were carried out under the leadership of [[Abbie Hoffman]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies).  One of their most publicized events occurred on August 24, 1967, at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] where Hoffman and other Yippies threw dollar bills onto the trading floor below.  Creating a media frenzy, the event was publicized internationally.  In his later publication, ''Soon to be a Major Motion Picture'' (1980), Hoffman refers to his television appearances with specially planned subversive tactics as "guerrilla theater."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar.  ''History of the Theatre''.  7th ed.  Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pg. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla theater was used as a protest demonstration by the anti-war organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. An article from the summer of 1971 published in the glossy magazine ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' detailed one such performance in [[Washington, D.C.]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A squad of soldiers moved through the part adjoining the U.S. Capitol. They were grubby looking troopers, clad in jungle fatigues and "boonie hats" with wide brims turned up. Jumping a low fence, they began shouting at a group of tourists. 'All right. Hold it. Hold it. Nobody move. Nobody move.' Their voices were full of tension and anger. A man broke out of the crowd and started running. Several soldiers fired at once, and the man fell, clutching his stomach. Blood could be seen on the clean sidewalk. The tourists turned away in horror. 'Get a body count,' a soldier yelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Another squad of soldiers emerged from under the Capitol steps. 'All right. ID. ID,' they screeched. 'You got no ID and you [[Viet Cong|VC]].' They quickly grabbed a young woman and led her away, binding her wrists behind her back and prodding her with their rifles.... They grabbed [a] young man and threw him on the ground, tying his hands behind his back. Several of the soldiers kicked him, seeming to aim for his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Then someone took out a long, thick hunting knife and lifted up the man's shirt, holding the knife to his bare stomach, and pushed against it slightly. 'You VC? You VC?' The man said nothing. He was pushed to his feet and shoved down again. Then he was told to get up. This time the knife was pushed to the side of his neck, and the same question was repeated. Still no answer. The man was dragged away.... Then the soldiers left, and a smaller, less angry group of men dressed in khaki fatigues passed out leaflets to the astonished tourists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"''"A US Infantry platoon just passed through here!"'' the pink colored piece of paper read in big bold letters. ''"If you had been Vietnamese... We might have burned your house. We might have shot your dog. We might have shot you... HELP US END THE WAR BEFORE THEY TURN YOUR SON INTO A BUTCHER OR A CORPSE."''&lt;ref&gt;Art Goldberg, "Vietnam Vets: The Anti-War Army," ''Ramparts,'' vol. 10, no. 1 (July 1971), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Post-1970s performance theater==

Another guerrilla performance group that continued the use of the term was the [[Guerrilla Girls]].  This group of feminist artist-activists was established in New York City in 1985 with the purpose of bringing attention to the lack of female artists in major [[art galleries]] and [[museum]]s.  The Guerrilla Girls began their work through guerrilla art tactics which broadened to include guerrilla theater.  Some common practices in their guerrilla theater techniques that have been replicated by other groups include appearing in costume, using assumed names, and disguising their identity.

==Guerrilla theater groups==

The origins and legacy of guerrilla theater can be seen in the work of these political/performance groups:

* [[ACT UP]]
* [[Billionaires for Bush]]
* [[Billionaires for Wealthcare]]
* [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]
* [[The Church of Euthanasia]]
* [[Circus Amok]]
* [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]
* [[El Teatro Campesino]]
* [[Free Southern Theater]]
* [[Reclaim the Streets]]
* [[Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping]]
* [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]
* [[Situationism]]
* [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]
* [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies)
* [[FEMEN]]

== Theoretical Contribution ==

=== Religious-Social Shaping of Technology ===

Campbell developed the Religious-Social Shaping of Technology (RSST) approach to assist scholars seeking to examine religious user communities negotiation processes related to media technologies. This approach builds upon ideas drawn the [[social shaping of technology]] (SST), which sees technological change and user innovation as a social process. RSST views the interrelationship between religious groups and new technologies as a dialectical process, in which the ethos and identity of a religious groups dictates expectations regarding members’ engagement with new media. This approach was developed by Campbell in her book When Religion Meets New Media (Routlege 2010).

A key premise underlying the RSST is that religious communities typically do not reject new forms of technology outright, rather they undergo a sophisticated negotiation process based on their communal background and beliefs. This informs their response to the various affordances offered by a given technology and potential impacts they perceive it may have on their community. The RSST approach employs four layers of investigation:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UykFd5cBsrYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=info:G3eZzH0jvGcJ:scholar.google.com&amp;ots=yS-TBcYdgB&amp;sig=xEnpJHhaU54NTMitIzTByE3QjS4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Campbell, H. (2010). When religion meets new media.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History and Tradition ====

A researcher must first uncover aspects of the community’s history and tradition which inform their response to media.  Special attention should be given to how they define what constitutes community, authority and their relationship to textual media.

==== Core Beliefs ====

Next the core religious and social values of the community must be revealed and examined.  Values underlie key religious practices and determine a group’s identity and priorities, also become the basis that guides their response towards and beliefs about a given technology.

==== Negotiation ====

Identifying a community’s background and beliefs become a basis for understanding how and why they respond to various media in particular ways. This leads to considering the process of acceptance, rejection and/or re-configuring. If a technology runs counter to their values and priorities they must make choices regarding what aspects of the technology they can accept, need to reject and to what extent its use or design needs to be innovated in order for it to fit into the moral economy of the community.

==== Communal Framing ====

Finally it becomes important to pay attention not only to how communities use but also talk about media.  This layer focuses on analyzing the ways in which community members and leaders talk about new media through official policy statements, religious materials, sermons and in interviews. Studying technology talk reveals important identity narratives about the community and how they seek to frame themselves in contemporary society.

The RSST approach to studies of new media has been applied to varied religious context including the [[Amish faith]] and tradition influence on their response to technology; The case of [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews]] use of the “[[Kosher]]” phone ; Religious Christian use of the Internet; Modern Islamic discourses about computers and [[Baha’í]] Negotiation with the Internet.

== New Media, Religion and Digital Culture Studies ==

The study of the intersection between new media, religion and digital culture is often referred to as the study of “digital religion”. Digital religion is defined as “Religion that is constituted in new ways through digital media and cultures… this recognizes that the reformulation of existing religious practices have both online and offline implications. It also means digital culture negotiates our understandings of religious practice in ways that can lead to new experiences, authenticity and spiritual reflexivity” (Campbell, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KtEXQLTF2iYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=info:CItktp6EWpsJ:scholar.google.com&amp;ots=Bo5b1IZH-C&amp;sig=3zV8q08VaK6wk4sNPTSmEMeZNN4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Campbell, H. (2013). Digital religion. Understanding religious practice in new media worlds. London: Routledge.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital religion research has become an emerging sub-field within Internet Studies, and display interest not only in the performance of religion online, but also in how religious communities interact with media and negotiate their online and the offline existence. The initial research of digital religion focused on describing and documenting online communities. Throughout the years this sub-field has evolved to investigate online worship spaces and offline institutions and use and response to online environments. The current approaches to digital religion studies focuses on the integration of online-offline use of social media and mobile media. As an effort to create an international interdisciplinary conversation related Digital religion research, The Network for New Media, Religion and Digital Culture Studies &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalreligion.tamu.edu/ Network for New Media, Religion and Digital Culture Studies at Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt; was established.

The project was established in 2010 through a grant from the Evans/Glasscock Digital Humanities Project, at Texas A&amp;M University and brought to fruition with the assistance of TAMU's Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture &lt;ref&gt;[http://idhmc.tamu.edu Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture].&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell serves as the project Director.

The Network for New Media, Religion and Digital Culture Studies brings together scholars from not only religious studies, [[theology]] and [[sociology of religion]], but those in fields such as [[area studies]], [[media studies]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]]. The Network serves as the leading repository and connection point for scholars, students and independent researchers studying the intersection between new media, religion and digital culture. It provides access to an interactive online bibliography of research works, profiles of scholars actively working in this area, blog reviews of recent published scholarship and an up-to-date list of news items and events related to the study of Digital Religion.

'''''Het Gulden Cabinet vande Edel Vry Schilder-Const''''' or '''''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting''''' is a book by the 17th-century Flemish notary and ''[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijker]]'' [[Cornelis de Bie]] published in Antwerp.  Written in the [[Dutch language]], it contains artist biographies and [[panegyric]]s with engraved portraits of 16th- and 17th-century artists, predominantly from the [[Southern Netherlands]].  The work is a very important source of information on the artists it describes.  It formed the principal source of information for later art historians such as [[Arnold Houbraken]] and [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].  It was published in 1662, although the work also mentions 1661 as date of publication.

==Background==
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' stands in a long tradition of artist biographies. This tradition goes back to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and was revived during the [[Renaissance]].  In 1550, the Italian [[Giorgio Vasari]] published his ''[[Vite]]'' on the lives of famous artists. [[Karel van Mander]] was the first author to introduce this genre in the Dutch language with his ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' of 1604.  Cornelis de Bie explicitly placed himself in the tradition of van Mander and did what van Mander did for 15th and 16th Netherlandish artists for 17th-century artists.

In his ''Het Gulden Cabinet'', de Bie presents himself as a ''rederijker'' whose duty it is to broadcast the fame of the artists.  By doing so he followed an existing tradition already seen in [[Dominicus Lampsonius]]' 1572 ''Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae Inferioris effigies'' and the Antwerp painter and rederijker [[Alexander van Fornenbergh]]'s 1658 ''Antwerpschen Proteus ofte Cyclopschen Apelles'', which sang the praises of the painter [[Quinten Matsys]].

The concept of ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' did not come from Cornelis de Bie himself, but from the [[Antwerp]] printer [[Jan Meyssen]].  In 1649 Meyssen had already published ''Image de divers hommes'', which contained engraved portraits of famous men, including painters, in imitation of [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''.  Most of the artist portraits in ''Het Gulden Cabinet'' are taken from this ''Image de divers hommes'' and only a few new engravings were made especially for de Bie's work.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

==The work==

===General===
The full title of the work is ''Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const: inhoudende den lof vande vermarste schilders, architecten, beldthouwers ende plaetsnyders, van dese eeuw'', which translates as ''The Golden Cabinet of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting: Containing the Praise of the Most Famous Painters, Architects, Sculptors and Engravers of This Century''.  Despite its title, the book also deals with artists from the 16th century.

The work was dedicated to the Antwerp art collector Antoon van Leyen who had provided some of the information for the book and may also have helped finance the publication.&lt;ref name=chr&gt;Christiaan Schuckman. "Bie, Cornelis de." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toon Houdt, ''On the Edge of Truth and Honesty: Principles and Strategies of Fraud and Deceit in the Early Modern Period'', BRILL, 1 Jan, 2002, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Other persons who had provided information on contemporary artists included de Bie’s own father, [[Erasmus Quellinus II]], [[Luigi Primo]] and [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]]’s son Richard.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;

===Structure and style===
The book has three parts. The first deals with artists who had died before de Bie's time and relies heavily on van Mander's ''Schilder-boeck''. The second part deals with artists living at the time of de Bie and is mostly based on original research by de Bie and on the comments added to the engravings borrowed from Meyssens' ''Image de divers hommes''. The third part deals with artists who had been omitted in the first two parts and also includes engravers, sculptors, architects, and painters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flandrica.be/items/show/1025/ Het Gulden Cabinet] on Flandrica.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A general treatise on the art of painting is woven into the entire work.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

The book is mainly written in verse, some of them in Latin, and is as a result rather difficult to read today.  There are also some prose sections.  It is over 500 pages long and contains engravings of more than 50 painters derived mainly from Meyssen's earlier work.

==Influence==
While ''The Gulden Cabinet'' never gained the level of popularity of van Mander’s ''Schilder-boeck'', it is an important source of information on Flemish artists of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dic&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/biec Cornelis de Bie] in the Dictionary of Art Historians.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Bie’s most important contribution was to provide a theoretical basis for his appreciation of (then) less valued painting genres such as [[still life]]s, [[genre art|genre painting]], [[portrait]]s and [[landscape art|landscapes]].  He unreservedly praised the artists who practised in these genres.&lt;ref name=chr/&gt;
 
''Het Gulden Cabinet'' is included in the ''Basic Library'' of the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]], which contains 1000 works of Dutch-language literature from the Middle Ages to today, which are deemed by its compilers to be of particular importance to Dutch-language literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second edition==
De Bie seems to have planned a second edition of the work, but this was never published.  The hand-written manuscript of de Bie is still extant and is kept at the [[Royal Library of Belgium]].  The manuscript is dated 1672.  In it de Bie mentioned his intention to have a second edition published.  The reason why the second edition was never published is unclear.  It may have been due to the fact that the publisher and promotor of the first edition [[Jan Meyssen]] had died in 1670 and de Bie had difficulty finding another publisher.

==Historical reliability==
Like Vasari and Van Mander before him, de Bie's biographies are interspersed with amusing anecdotes. Although such literary motifs belong to a long rhetorical tradition, many of these stories were labelled "historically unreliable" by leading historians in the 19th century.  Only recently have some of the stories been reinstated.  Since the book was often the only surviving source of information on certain painters, these stories have often been repeated as hard facts about the lives of the painters described.

For instance, Cornelis de Bie postulates certain apprenticeships, which are now considered improbable because the pupil painted in a completely different genre than the teacher.  De Bie's statement that [[Philips Wouwerman]] trained with [[Frans Hals]] was deemed implausible by later historians since Wouwerman painted landscapes with horses and Hals was principally a portrait painter. Some scholars still consider this apprenticeship as unlikely, but in view of Hals' large workshop it cannot be entirely excluded.

'''Holland Island''' was a [[marsh|marshy]], rapidly [[erosion|eroding]] island in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]], [[Maryland]], west of [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]]. The island was once inhabited by [[Watermen#Watermen in the United States|watermen]] and farmers, but has since been abandoned and submerged. It is located in the Holland Strait, between [[Bloodsworth Island]] and [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]], six miles west of [[Wenona, Maryland]].

== History ==
Holland Island was originally settled in the 1600s, taking its name from early colonist Daniel Holland, the original purchaser of the property from the Dorchester County Sheriff. By 1850, the first community of fishing and farming families developed on the island. By 1910, the island had about 360 residents, making it one of the largest inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. The island community had 70 homes, stores and other buildings. It had its own post office, two-room school with two teachers, a church, baseball team, community center, and a doctor. The islanders supported themselves mainly by dredging for [[oysters]], fishing for [[shad]] and [[crabbing]]. Their fleet of workboats included 41 [[skipjack (boat)|skipjack]]s, 10 [[schooner]]s and 36 [[bugeye]]s, some of which were built on the island.&lt;ref name="disappearing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=William B.|title=The disappearing islands of the Chesapeake|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itFf6wHY_D4C&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=October 29, 2010|year=2005|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7435-2|pages=4, 95–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/24/AR2010102402996.html|title=Last house on sinking Chesapeake Bay island collapses|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=October 26, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind and tide began to seriously erode the west side of the island, where most of the houses were located, in 1914. This forced the inhabitants to move to the mainland. Many disassembled their houses and other structures and took them to the mainland, predominantly [[Crisfield, Maryland|Crisfield]]. Attempts to protect the island by building stone walls were unsuccessful. The last family left the island in 1918, when a tropical storm damaged the island's church. A few of the former residents continued living on the island during the fishing season until 1922, when the church was moved to [[Fairmount, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="disappearing"/&gt;

Stephen White, a minister, cared for the island for many years and formed The Holland Island Preservation Foundation. In June 2010, White sold the island to the Concorde Foundation. In October 2010, the last remaining house on Holland Island, built in 1888, collapsed.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/bs-gr-bay-vanishing-island-20101022,0,6319144.story?page=1|title=Holland Island house collapse 'end of an era'|last=Wheeler|first=Timothy B.|date=October 22, 2010|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighthouse===
The [[Holland Island Bar Light]], a [[lighthouse]] originally built to the south of Holland Island in 1889, was dismantled and replaced with an automated light in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite uscghist|MD|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and ecology==
The land of the island has been submerged as a result of erosion exacerbated by sea level rise associated with the sinking of the lands surface associated with isostatic [[subsidence]].&lt;ref name="Baltimore Mag"&gt;{{cite-web|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2015/1/5/the-sea-also-rises|title=The Sea Also Rises|publisher=The Baltimore Magazine|date= January 5, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite-web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1392/pdf/circ1392.pdf|title=Land Subsidence and Relative Sea-Level Rise in the Southern Chesapeake Bay Region|publisher=US Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has caused a major loss of land on the island. Like other Chesapeake Bay islands, Holland Island is primarily made up of [[clay]] and [[silt]].&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt; The western ridge of the island is very exposed to waves in the bay, making it prone to erosion as well. The island's size was reduced by half, from approximately {{convert|160|acre|km2}} in 1915 to {{convert|80|acre|km2}} in 2005.&lt;ref name="Highroad"/&gt;&lt;!--in how much time?--&gt;&lt;!--Note: This source gives a significantly different acreage than the other book, much of this difference in measurement depends on tides--&gt;

Most of the remaining land on the island is now marsh,&lt;ref name="disappearing"/&gt; but Most of the time the entire island is underwater. Many birds, including [[terns]], [[herons]], [[songbirds]], and [[brown pelican]]s used to be found on the island. A survey in 1995 counted 609 nesting pairs in a heron rookery on the island. [[Hurricane Isabel]], a tropical storm by the time it reached Maryland in September 2003, destroyed 60 percent of the trees that previously served the rookery.&lt;ref name="disappearing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Pelican Census Finds Largest Number of Nesting Pairs in Bay’s History |url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/dnrnews/pressrelease2008/091908d.html |publisher=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |date=September 19, 2008  |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''induction''' in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] is an explanatory scene, summary or other text  that stands outside and apart from the main action with the intent to comment on it, moralize about it or in the case of [[dumb show]] to summarize the plot or underscore what is afoot. Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the [[Renaissance]] period, including those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the address to the audience by Puck in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Another example, in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by [[Thomas Kyd]], is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1015">'''Internal history''' of a language refers to the historical development of its linguistic forms ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[lexicon]]) and [[semantics]].  It is contrasted with "[[external history]]", which refers to the social and geopolitical history of the language.

The history of any language can be divided into external and internal history. The former aspect concerns the political and social developments in the community speaking the language while the latter involves the changes which take place over time within the language itself.

'''Intersectionality''' is an [[analytic framework]] that attempts to identify how interlocking systems of power impact those who are most marginalized in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intersectionality|volume = 1|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality considers that various forms of [[social stratification]], such as [[Social class|class]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, creed, [[disability]] and [[gender]], do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis is potentially applied to all social categories (including social identities usually seen as dominant when considered independently).

==Historical background==
{{external media|width=210px|align=right | topic = [[Women of the World Festival|Women of the World Festival 2016]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA ''Kimberlé Crenshaw – On Intersectionality''] via [[Southbank Centre]] on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberlé Crenshaw]] | date= 14 March 2016 |accessdate= 31 May 2016 | title= Kimberlé Crenshaw – On Intersectionality – keynote – WOW 2016 | medium= Video | publisher= [[Southbank Centre]] via YouTube| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked in feminist movements and theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thompson | first = Becky | title = Multiracial feminism: recasting the chronology of Second Wave Feminism | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | page = 337 | doi = 10.2307/3178747 | jstor = 3178747 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As articulated by [[bell hooks]], such an approach "challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate".&lt;ref name="bell hooks 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Feminist Theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | origyear = 1984 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781138821668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration stemmed from a historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement that had been challenged since the 19th century by black feminists such as [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]]. 
The movement led by women of color disputed the idea, common to earlier feminist movements, that women were a homogeneous category who shared the same life experiences. This argument stemmed from the realization that white middle-class women did not serve as an accurate representation of the feminist movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Angela Y. | author-link = Angela Davis | title = Women, Race &amp; Class | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780394713519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the forms of oppression experienced by white middle-class women were different from those experienced by black, poor, or disabled women, feminists sought to understand the ways in which gender, race, and class combined to "determine the female destiny".&lt;ref name="bell hooks 2014"/&gt;

First wave feminism focused on gaining political equality between men and women; however, racial inequality was a factor that was largely ignored by the movement. Consequently, early women's rights movements are often seen as exclusively pertaining to white women's membership, concerns, and struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture|last=Fixmer-Oraiz,and Wood|first=Natalie, and Julia|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-305-28027-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third wave feminism is noted for its efforts to understand the multiple layers of oppression present within injustice towards women. Third wave feminism notes the lack of attention to race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity in early feminist movements, and tries to provide a channel to address political and social disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture|last=Fixmer-Oraiz, and Wood|first=Natalie, and Julia|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-305-28027-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these factors were not part of the main stream feminism movement, they were seen as struggles that were independent of each other. Intersectionality is a concept that recognizes these issues that were not a part of early social justice movements. 
Leslie McCall argues that the introduction of the intersectionality theory was vital to sociology, claiming that before its development there was little research that specifically addressed the experiences of people who are subjected to multiple forms of subordination within society.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McCall | first = Leslie | title = The complexity of intersectionality | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 1771–1800 | doi = 10.1086/426800 | date = Spring 2005 | jstor = 10.1086/426800 | ref = harv }} [http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp270-us15/files/2015/05/The-Complexity-of-intersectionality-McCall-2005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has historical and theoretical links to the concept of "simultaneity" advanced during the 1970s by members of the [[Combahee River Collective]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiegman, Robyn (2012), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PAC_r_0nXFsC&amp;pg=PA244 Critical kinship (universal aspirations and intersectional judgements)]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Wiegman | editor-first = Robyn | title = Object lessons | page = 244 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, North Carolina | isbn = 9780822351603 | ref = harv | date = 2012-01-11 }}

Other writers and theorists were using intersectional analysis in their work before the term was coined. For example, Chicana feminist theorist [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]]'s work is described by [[Gloria Wekker]] as exemplifying how, "Existent categories for identity are strikingly not dealt with in separate or mutually exclusive terms, but are always referred to in relation to one another."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture: A Comprehensive Guide to Gender Studies|last=Buikema, Plate &amp; Thiele|first=R., L., K.|publisher=Routeledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415493833|location=|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wekker also points to the words and activism of [[Sojourner Truth|Sojourner Truth]] as an example of an intersectional approach to social justice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Feminist thought==
{{Feminism sidebar}}
In 1989, [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] became the first person to use the word "intersectionality" in the context of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could|title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on intersectionality: 'I wanted to come up with an everyday metaphor that anyone could use'|date=2 April 2014 |work=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first use of the term was in a crucial 1989 paper written by Crenshaw for the University of Chicago Legal Forum, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/DemarginalizingTheIntersectionOfRaceAndSexABlackFeminis/Demarginalizing+the+Intersection+of+Race+and+Sex_+A+Black+Feminis_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Demarginalizing The Intersection Of Race And Sex A Black Feminis"|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberlé | author-link = Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw | title = Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: a Black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics | journal = [[University of Chicago Legal Forum]] | volume = 1989 | pages = 139–168 | date = 1989| url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uchclf1989&amp;div=10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Crenshaw discussed [[Black feminism]], which argues that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in terms of being black and of being a woman considered independently, but must include interactions between the two identities, which frequently reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Sheila | last2 = Crenshaw | first2 = Kimberlé | author-link2 = Kimberlé Crenshaw | title = Intersectionality: the double bind of race and gender | work = Perspectives Magazine | date = Spring 2004 | page = 2 | publisher = [[American Bar Association]] | url =http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to show that women of color have a vastly different experience from white women due to their race and/or class and that their experiences are not easily voiced or pinpointed, Crenshaw explores two types of male violence against women: [[domestic violence]] and [[rape]]. Through her analysis of these two forms of male violence against women, Crenshaw says that the experiences of women of color consist of a combination or intersection of both racism and sexism.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberlé | author-link = Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw |title=Mapping the margins: intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1241–1299 |jstor=1229039 |doi=10.2307/1229039 |date=July 1991 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.695.5934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that because women of color are present within discourses that have been designed to address either race or sex, but not both at the same time, women of color are marginalized within both of these systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

In her work, Crenshaw identifies three aspects of intersectionality as affecting the visibility of women of color: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality deals with how women of color experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different from the ways that white women experience them. Political intersectionality examines how [[Feminist legal theory|feminist]] and [[Anti-racism legislation|anti-racists]] laws and policies have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against women of color. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of women of color can obscure the actual, lived experiences of women of color.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

The term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of sociologist [[Patricia Hill Collins]]'s further development of Crenshaw's work in her writings on [[black feminism]]. Crenshaw's term replaced her previous coinage "black feminist thought," and "increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = Susan A. | last2 = Huffman | first2 = Douglas J. | title = The decentering of second wave feminism and the rise of the third wave | journal = [[Science &amp; Society]] | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–91 | jstor = 40404229 | date = January 2005 | ref = harv | doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Much like Crenshaw, Collins argued that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Collins described this as "interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill (2009) [1990], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=icWTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277 Towards a politics of empowerment]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Collins | editor-first = Patricia Hill | editor-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment | page = 277 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780415964722 | title-link = Black Feminist Thought | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality. The final branch formulates intersectionality as a critical praxis to determine how [[social justice]] initiatives can use intersectionality to bring about social change.&lt;ref name="Collins 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins|first=Patricia H. | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Intersectionality's definitional dilemmas | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 41 | pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas behind intersectional feminism existed long before the term was coined. For example, in 1851 [[Sojourner Truth]] delivered her famous "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]" speech, in which she spoke from her racialized position as a former slave to critique essentialist notions of femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brah |first1=Avtar |last2=Phoenix |first2=Ann |title=Ain't I A Woman? Revisiting intersectionality |journal=Journal of International Women's Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 75–86 | date = 2004 | url = http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol5/iss3/8/| ref = harv }} [http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1543&amp;context=jiws Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in her 1892 essay, "The Colored Woman's Office", [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]] identifies black women as the most important actors in social change movements, because of their experience with multiple facets of oppression.&lt;ref name=Cooper2009&gt;Cooper, Anna Julia (2017) [1892], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ONFVDgAAQBAJ The colored woman's office]", in {{cite book |editor-last = Lemert|editor-first = Charles | title = Social theory: the multicultural, global, and classic readings | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado | edition = 6th | isbn = 9780813350448 |date = 2016-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though intersectionality began with the exploration of the interplay between gender and race, over time other identities and oppressions were added to the theory. For example, in 1981 [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]] published the first edition of ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]''. This anthology explored how classifications of sexual orientation and class also mix with those of race and gender to create even more distinct political categories. Many black, Latina, and Asian writers featured in the collection stress how their sexuality interacts with their race and gender to inform their perspectives. Similarly, poor women of color detail how their socio-economic status adds a layer of nuance to their identities, ignored or misunderstood by middle-class white feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Moraga|editor-first1=Cherríe|editor-last2=Anzaldúa|editor-first2=Gloria |editor-link1=Cherríe Moraga|editor-link2=Gloria E.

According to black feminists and many white feminists, experiences of class, gender, and sexuality cannot be adequately understood unless the influence of racialization is carefully considered. This focus on racialization was highlighted many times by scholar and feminist [[bell hooks]], specifically in her 1981 book ''Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | author-link = bell hooks | title = Ain't I a Woman: black women and feminism | publisher = Pluto Press South End Press | location = London, Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-86104-379-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists argue that an understanding of intersectionality is a vital element of gaining political and social equality and improving our democratic system.&lt;ref&gt;D'Agostino, Maria; Levine, Helisse (2011), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkOypf17LjgC&amp;pg=PA8 Feminist theories and their application to public administration]", in {{cite book| editor-last1 = D'Agostino | editor-first1 = Maria | editor-last2 = Levine | editor-first2 = Helisse | title = Women in Public Administration: theory and practice | page=8 | publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | location = Sudbury, Massachusetts | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780763777258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins's theory represents the sociological crossroads between [[second-wave feminism|modern]] and [[Post-modern feminism|post-modern feminist thought]].&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Gender, black feminism, and black political economy | journal = [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 568 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1177/000271620056800105 | date = March 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie-Claire Belleau argues for "strategic intersectionality" in order to foster cooperation between feminisms of different ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"&gt;Belleau, Marie-Claire (2007), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IuzvBBhq7-IC&amp;pg=PA51 'L'intersectionalité': Feminisms in a divided world; Québec-Canada]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Orr | editor-first1 = Deborah | title = Feminist Politics: identity, difference, and agency| pages = 51–62 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | isbn = 978-0-7425-4778-0 | ref = harv |display-editors=etal| year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} She refers to different ''nat-cult'' (national-cultural) groups that produce unique types of feminisms. Using [[Culture of Quebec|Québécois]] nat-cult as an example, Belleau says that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves, arguing that there are endless ways in which different feminisms can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and that these partnerships can help bridge gaps between "dominant and marginal" groups.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"/&gt;{{rp|54}} Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult feminisms are neither essentialist nor universal, but should be understood as resulting from socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult feminisms are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"/&gt;

Similarly, Intersectional theorists like Vrushali Patil argue that intersectionality ought to recognize transborder constructions of racial and cultural hierarchies. About the effect of the state on identity formation, Patil says: "If we continue to neglect cross-border dynamics and fail to problematize the nation and its emergence via transnational processes, our analyses will remain tethered to the spatialities and temporalities of colonial modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patil|first=Vrushali|date=1 June 2013|title=From Patriarchy to Intersectionality: A Transnational Feminist Assessment of How Far We've Really Come|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=38|issue=4|pages=847–867|doi=10.1086/669560|jstor=10.1086/669560|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxist feminist critical theory ===
{{Marxism}}
[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. Collins writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Du Bois omitted gender from his theory and considered it more of a personal identity category.

Cheryl Townsend Gilkes expands on this by pointing out the value of centering on the experiences of black women. Joy James takes things one step further by "using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Collins uses a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]] approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the "work/family nexus and black women's poverty". In her 2000 article "Black Political Economy" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of [[consumer racism]], gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences. Considering this from a historical perspective and examining interracial marriage laws and property inheritance laws creates what Collins terms a "distinctive work/family nexus that in turn influences the overall patterns of black political economy".&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|45–46}} For example, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] effectively suppressed the upward economic mobility of black women.

The intersectionality of race and gender has been shown to have a visible impact on the labor market. "Sociological research clearly shows that accounting for education, experience, and skill does not fully explain significant differences in labor market outcomes."&lt;ref name="arjournals.annualreviews.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Browne | first1 = Irene | last2 = Misra | first2 = Joya | title = The intersection of gender and race in the labor market | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 29 | pages = 487–513 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016 | date = August 2003 |jstor=30036977| ref = harv }} [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249558187_The_Intersection_of_Gender_and_Race_in_the_Labor_Market Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|506}} The three main domains in which we see the impact of intersectionality are wages, discrimination, and domestic labor. Those who experience privilege within the social hierarchy in terms of race, gender and socio-economic status are less likely to receive lower wages, to be subjected to stereotypes and discriminated against, or to be hired for exploitative domestic positions. Studies of the labor market and intersectionality provide a better understanding of economic inequalities and the implications of the multidimensional impact of race and gender on social status within society.&lt;ref name="arjournals.annualreviews.org"/&gt;{{rp|506–507}}

==Key concepts==
===Interlocking matrix of oppression===
Collins refers to the various intersections of social inequality as the [[matrix of domination]]. This is also known as "vectors of oppression and privilege".&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ritzer|first1= George|author1-link = George Ritzer |last2=Stepinisky |first2=Jeffrey|title = Contemporary sociological theory and its classical roots: the basics|pages = 204–207|publisher = McGraw-Hill|location = New York|edition = 4th|year = 2013|isbn = 9780078026782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204}} These terms refer to how differences among people (sexual orientation, class, race, age, etc.) serve as oppressive measures towards women and change the experience of living as a woman in society. Collins, [[Audre Lorde]] (in ''[[Sister Outsider]]''), and [[bell hooks]] point towards either/or thinking as an influence on this oppression and as further intensifying these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dudley | first = Rachel A. | title = Confronting the concept of intersectionality: the legacy of Audre Lorde and contemporary feminist organizations | journal = McNair Scholars Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | page = 5 | date = 2006 | url = https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Collins refers to this as the construct of dichotomous oppositional difference. This construct is characterized by its focus on differences rather than similarities.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Learning from the outsider within: the sociological significance of black feminist thought | journal = [[Social Problems]] | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = s14–s32 | doi = 10.2307/800672 | jstor = 800672 | date = December 1986 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S20}}

===Standpoint epistemology and the outsider within===
Both Collins and [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]] have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of [[standpoint theory]]. A standpoint is an individual's unique world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location. In turn, knowledge becomes distinctly unique and subjective; it varies depending on the social conditions under which it was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = Susan A. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = Lori R. | title = Standing at the crossroads of modernist thought: Collins, Smith, and the new feminist epistemologies | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–408 | doi = 10.1177/089124397011004002 | date = August 1997 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392}}

The concept of the outsider within refers to a unique standpoint encompassing the [[Self (sociology)|self]], family, and society.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}} This relates to the specific experiences to which people are subjected as they move from a common cultural world (i.e., family) to that of modern society.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|207}} Therefore, even though a woman—especially a Black woman—may become influential in a particular field, she may feel as though she does not belong. Their personalities, behavior, and cultural being overshadow their value as an individual; thus, they become the outsider within.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}}

===Resisting oppression===
Speaking from a [[critical theory|critical]] standpoint, Collins points out that Brittan and Maynard say "domination always involves the [[objectification]] of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed."&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} She later notes that self-valuation and self-definition are two ways of resisting oppression. Practicing [[self-awareness]] helps to preserve the self-esteem of the group that is being oppressed and allow them to avoid any dehumanizing outside influences.

Marginalized groups often gain a status of being an "other".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} In essence, you are "an other" if you are different from what [[Audre Lorde]] calls the [[Normality (behavior)|mythical norm]]. "Others" are virtually anyone that differs from the societal [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of an average white male. [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] theorizes that the sociological term for this is "[[othering]]", or specifically attempting to establish a person as unacceptable based on a certain criterion that fails to be met.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|205}}

For example, in the period immediately after [[9/11]] researchers noted [[low birth weight]]s and other poor birth outcomes among Muslim and Arab Americans, a result they connected to the increased racial and religious discrimination of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lauderdale | first = Diane S. | title = Birth outcomes for Arabic-named women in California before and after September 11 | journal = [[Demography (journal)|Demography]] | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 185–201 | doi = 10.1353/dem.2006.0008 | date = February 2006 | ref = harv }} [http://www.rwj.harvard.edu/papers/Lauderdale.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also argued that immigration policies can affect health outcomes through mechanisms such as [[Stress (biology)#Overview|stress]], restrictions on access to health care, and the [[social determinants of health]].&lt;ref name="Viruell-Fuentes et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viruell-Fuentes |first1=Edna A. |last2=Miranda |first2=Patricia Y. |last3=Abdulrahim |first3=Sawsan | title = More than culture: Structural racism, intersectionality theory, and immigrant health | journal = [[Social Science &amp; Medicine]] | volume = 75 | issue = 12 | pages = 2099–2106 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.037 | pmid = 22386617 | date = December 2012 | ref = harv }} [http://sph.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/che/Viruell%20Fuentes%20et%20al%202012%20SSM%20More%20than%20Culture%20Structural%20Racism.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, applications with regard to property and wealth can be traced to the American historical narrative that is filled "with tensions and struggles over property—in its various forms. From the removal of Native Americans (and later [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]]) from the land, to military conquest of the Mexicans, to the construction of Africans as property, the ability to define, possess, and own property has been a central feature of power in America&amp;nbsp;... [and where] social benefits accrue largely to property owners".&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings Tate 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ladson-Billings | first1 = Gloria | last2 = Tate IV | first2 = William F. | title = Toward a critical race theory of education (''id: 1410'') | journal = [[Teachers College Record]] | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–68 | date = 1995 | url = https://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=1410 | ref = harv }} [http://hs.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Toward_a_Critical_Race_Theory_of_Education.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One could apply the intersectionality framework analysis to various areas where race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are affected by policies, procedures, practices, and laws in "context-specific inquiries, including, for example, analyzing the multiple ways that race and gender interact with class in the labor market; interrogating the ways that states constitute regulatory regimes of identity, reproduction, and family formation";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Sumi |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé Williams |last3=McCall |first3=Leslie | title = Toward a field of intersectionality studies: theory, applications, and praxis | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 785–810 | doi = 10.1086/669608 | jstor = 10.1086/669608 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and examining the inequities in "the power relations [of the intersectionality] of whiteness&amp;nbsp;...

===Intersectionality in a global context===
Over the last couple decades in the European Union, there has been discussion regarding the intersections of social classifications and the need to acknowledge their functions. Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was debate on what these societal categories were, and how they played a role in the lives of many minorities. What was once a more cut and dry categorization between gender, race, and class has turned into a multidimensional intersection of “race” including religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK they refer to these intersections under the notion of multiple discrimination. The EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; however, there is debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Anna. European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality : Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination, edited by Dagmar Schiek, Routledge, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is not the only organization that is acknowledging this concept. People around the world are taking a new approach when identifying others identities as well as their own; although, there are still places that follow the traditional process of categorization as stated in the following quote. “The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell).”. &lt;ref&gt;Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities : Global, Transnational and Local Contexts, edited by Esther Ngan-ling Chow, and Tan Lin, Emerald Publishing Limited, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central&lt;/ref&gt; This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe, than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.

===Social work===
In the field of [[social work]], proponents of intersectionality hold that unless service providers take intersectionality into account, they will be of less use for various segments of the population, such as those reporting domestic violence or disabled victims of abuse. According to intersectional theory, the practice of [[domestic violence]] counselors in the [[United States]] urging all women to report their abusers to police is of little use to [[women of color]] due to the history of racially motivated [[police brutality]], and those counselors should adapt their counseling for women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Bent-Goodley, Tricia B.; Chase, Lorraine; Circo, Elizabeth A.; Antá Rodgers, Selena T. (2010), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiRKrWlceK0C&amp;pg=PA77 Our survival, our strengths: understanding the experiences of African American women in abusive relationships]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Lockhart | editor-first1 = Lettie | editor-last2 = Danis | editor-first2 = Fran S. | title = Domestic violence intersectionality and culturally competent practice | page = 77 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 9780231140270 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with disabilities encounter more frequent domestic abuse with a greater number of abusers. Health care workers and personal care attendants perpetrate abuse in these circumstances, and women with disabilities have fewer options for escaping the abusive situation.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131"&gt;Cramer, Elizabeth P.; Plummer, Sara-Beth (2010), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiRKrWlceK0C&amp;pg=PA131 Social work practice with abused persons with disabilities]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Lockhart | editor-first1 = Lettie | editor-last2 = Danis | editor-first2 = Fran S. | title = Domestic violence intersectionality and culturally competent practice | pages = 131–134 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York| isbn = 9780231140270 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a "silence" principle concerning the intersectionality of women and disability, which maintains an overall social denial of the prevalence of abuse among the disabled and leads to this abuse being frequently ignored when encountered.&lt;ref name="Chenoweth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chenoweth | first = Lesley | title = Violence and women with disabilities: silence and paradox | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–411 | doi = 10.1177/1077801296002004004 | date = December 1996 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A paradox is presented by the overprotection of people with disabilities combined with the expectations of promiscuous behavior of disabled women.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chenoweth" /&gt; This leads to limited autonomy and social isolation of disabled individuals, which place women with disabilities in situations where further or more frequent abuse can occur.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{POV|Section|date=October 2018}}

=== Methods and ideology ===
According to [[political theorist]] Rebecca Reilly-Cooper intersectionality relies heavily on [[standpoint theory]], which has its own set of criticisms. Intersectionality posits that an oppressed person is often the best person to judge their experience of oppression; however, this can create paradoxes when people who are similarly oppressed have different interpretations of similar events. Such paradoxes make it very difficult to synthesize a common actionable cause based on subjective testimony alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Reilly-Cooper | first = Rebecca |url=https://rebeccarc.com/2013/04/15/intersectionality-and-identity-politics/|title=Intersectionality and identity politics|date=15 April 2013|publisher=More Radical With Age|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other narratives, especially those based on multiple intersections of oppression, are more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kofi Bright | first1 = Liam  | last2 = Malinsky | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Thompson | first3 = Morgan |title= Causally interpreting intersectionality theory | journal = [[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–81 | doi = 10.1086/684173 | date = January 2016 | ref = harv }} [http://www.liamkofibright.com/uploads/4/8/9/8/48985425/causally_interpreting_intersectionality_theory_final.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Davis (2008) asserts that intersectionality is ambiguous and open ended, and that its "lack of clear-cut definition or even specific parameters has enabled it to be drawn upon in nearly any context of inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Kathy | title = Intersectionality as buzzword: A sociology of science perspective on what makes a feminist theory successful | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–85 | doi = 10.1177/1464700108086364 | date = April 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekia Jibrin and Sara Salem argue that intersectional theory creates a unified idea of anti-oppression politics that requires a lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. They also say that intersectional philosophy encourages a focus on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large, and that intersectionality is "a call to complexity and to abandon over simplification... this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures."&lt;ref name="Rekia Jibrin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jibrin | first1 = Rekia | last2 = Salem | first2 = Sara |title=Revisiting intersectionality: reflections on theory and praxis | journal = Trans-Scripts: An Interdisciplinary Online Journal in the Humanities and Social Sciences | volume = 5 | date = 2015 | url = http://sites.uci.edu/transscripts/2015-archives-2/ }} [http://sites.uci.edu/transscripts/files/2014/10/2015_5_salem.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|''See ''[[hegemony]] and [[cultural hegemony]].}}

Writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Helen Lewis adds that in emphasizing internal differences over hegemonic structures, and having complex and at times contradictory recommendations, it can create paralysis because it is not very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Lewis | first = Helen |title=The uses and abuses of intersectionality |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/helen-lewis/2014/02/uses-and-abuses-intersectionality |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=20 February 2014|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[moral psychologist]] [[Jonathan Haidt]], in a speech at the [[American conservative]] think tank [[Manhattan Institute]], criticized the theory by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;[In intersectionality] the binary dimensions of oppression are said to be interlocking and overlapping. America is said to be one giant matrix of oppression, and its victims cannot fight their battles separately. They must all come together to fight their common enemy, the group that sits at the top of the pyramid of oppression: the straight, white, cis-gendered, able-bodied Christian or Jewish or possibly atheist male. This is why a perceived slight against one victim group calls forth protest from all victim groups. This is why so many campus groups now align against Israel. Intersectionality is like NATO for social-justice activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/age-outrage-15608.html|title=The Age of Outrage|date=17 December 2017|work=City Journal|author=Jonathan Haidt|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barbara Tomlinson, a PhD employed at the Department of Women's Studies at UC Santa Barbara, has been critical of the applications of intersectional theory, and identified several ways in which the conventional theory has been destructive to the movement. She asserts that the common practice of using intersectionality to attack other ways of feminist thinking and the tendency of academics to critique intersectionality instead of using intersectionality as a tool to critique other conventional ways of thinking has been a misuse of the ideas it stands for. Tomlinson argues that in order to use intersectional theory correctly, intersectional feminists must not only consider the arguments but the tradition and mediums through which these arguments are made, Conventional academics are likely to favor writings by authors or publications with prior established credibility instead of looking at the quality of each piece individually, contributing to negative stereotypes associated with both feminism and intersectionality by having weaker arguments in defense of feminism and intersectionality become prominent based on renown. She goes on to argue that this allows critics of intersectionality to attack these weaker arguments, “[reducing] intersectionality’s radical critique of power to desires for identity and inclusion, and offer a deradicalized intersectionality as an asset for dominant disciplinary discourses”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tomlinson | first = Barbara | title = To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 993-1017 | doi = 10.1086/669571 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===

{{Main|Biases|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}
Researchers in psychology have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s{{Example needed|date=September 2018}}, long before the work of Patricia Hill Collins. Psychology incorporates these effects via the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person by situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy; even if an objective definition of oppression were reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed. For instance, black men are stereotypically perceived as violent, which may be a disadvantage in police interactions, but also as physically attractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Michael B. | title = A facial attractiveness account of gender asymmetries in interracial marriage | journal = [[PLOS ONE]] | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0031703  | date = 9 February 2012 | ref = harv | volume=7 | issue = 2 | pages=e31703 | pmid=22347504 | pmc=3276508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Michael B. | title = Who is the fairest of them all?

Psychological studies have shown that the effect of multiplying "oppressed" identities is not necessarily additive, but rather interactive in complex ways. For instance, black gay men may be more positively evaluated than black heterosexual men, because the "feminine" aspects of gay stereotypes temper the hypermasculine and aggressive aspect of black stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Pedulla | first = David S. | title = The positive consequences of negative stereotypes: race, sexual orientation, and the job application process | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–94 | doi = 10.1177/0190272513506229 | date = March 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Remedios | first1 = Jessica D. | last2 = Chasteen | first2 = Alison L. | last3 = Rule | first3 = Nicholas O. | last4 = Plaks | first4 = Jason E. | title = Impressions at the intersection of ambiguous and obvious social categories: Does gay + Black = likable? | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1312–1315 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.015 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | hdl = 1807/33199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]], scholar of United States constitutional law and criminal law, answering a question on the [[criticism of Israel]] by intersectional movements he stated that the concept of intersectionality is an oversimplification of reality that makes LGBT activists stand in solidarity with advocates of [[Sharia]], even though Islamic law denies the rights of the former. He feels that identity politics does not evaluate ideas or individuals on the basis of the quality of their character. Dershowitz argues that in academia, intersectionality is taught with a large influence from antisemitism. He states that Jews are actually more liberal and supportive of equal rights than many other religious sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Frommer | first = Rachel | title= Alan Dershowitz derides theory of intersectionality in Columbia lecture |url= http://freebeacon.com/culture/alan-dershowitz-derides-theory-intersectionality-columbia-lecture|date=28 September 2017|work = [[The Washington Free Beacon]] |access-date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer and political pro-Israel activist [[Chloé Valdary]] considers intersectionality "a rigid system for determining who is virtuous and who is not, based on traits like skin color, gender, and financial status". Valdary also states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Intersectionality's greatest flaw is in reducing human beings to political abstractions, which is never a tendency that turns out well—in part because it so severely flattens our complex human experience, and therefore fails to adequately describe reality. As it turns out, one can be personally successful and still come from a historically oppressed community—or vice versa. The human experience is complex and multifaceted and deeper than the superficial ways in which intersectionalists describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Valdary, Chloé.

===Compared to abiding religious faiths===
Intersectionality's premises have been characterized by some [[right-libertarian]]-leaning skeptics as manifested similarly to religious faith. Notably, for example, conservative [[political commentator]] [[Andrew Sullivan]] has argued that intersectionality manifests itself "almost as a religion. It posits a classic orthodoxy through which all of human experience is explained—and through which all speech must be filtered. Its version of original sin is the power of some identity groups over others. To overcome this sin, you need first to confess, i.e., 'check your privilege,' and subsequently live your life and order your thoughts in a way that keeps this sin at bay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = 10 March 2017|title = Is Intersectionality a Religion?|author = [[Andrew Sullivan]]|publisher = [[New York magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hotair.com/archives/2018/03/04/portland-state-university-panel-discussion-intersectionality-religion/|title=Portland State University panel discussion: 'Is Intersectionality a Religion?'|date=4 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David A. French]], writer for the ''[[National Review]]'', also agrees with Sullivan's conclusion, equating intersectionality's proponents to extremist Christian fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician [[David A. French|David French]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180307030606/https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/intersectionality-the-dangerous-faith/ "Intersectionality, the Dangerous Faith"] (6 March 2018), ''National Review Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jiří Kolář 1979 foto Hana Hamplová.jpg|thumb|Jiří Kolář 1979&lt;br /&gt; foto Hana Hamplová]]
'''Jiří Kolář''' {{Audio|Jiri kolar.ogg|Czech pronunciation}} (24 September 1914, [[Protivín]] &amp;ndash; 11 August 2002, [[Prague]]) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] poet, writer, painter and translator. His work included both literary and visual art.

== Life ==
Kolář was born in Protivín on September 29, 1914 in a working-class environment. His father was a baker and his mother a seamstress, and he himself trained early in life as a cabinet maker (which cost him a finger).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.cz/umelec.php?art_id=524 www.artmuseum.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/10/guardianobituaries.books www.theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed trades several times, working as a construction worker, security guard, and bartender, among other jobs. In 1943 he became a full-time writer while living and working in [[Kladno]]. He moved to the capital Prague in 1945 to work as an editor of the publishing house Družstvo Dílo. Kolář joined the [[Communist]] Party in 1945 but left the Party the same year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Because of his critical stance towards the regime he was not allowed to publish after communists took control in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948. He married [[Běla Kolářová|Běla Helclová]] in 1949. When in 1952 police found his manuscript, ''Prométheova játra'', in the property of [[Václav Černý]] he was arrested and spent several months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Panorama ceské literatury, p. 339,&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolář was one of a group of several artists, among whom [[Václav Havel]], [[Václav Černý]], [[Jan Vladislav]] and [[Josef Hiršal]], who met and discussed in [[Café Slavia]], both during the period leading up to the Prague Spring when the communist regime grew more permissive, and in the period of normalization after the [[Prague Spring]]. Kolář's wild behavior lost him former friends (e.g. he threw coffee on Josef Hiršal's shirt and had his [[soda water]] poured on him in return).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The failure of the Prague Spring in 1968 brought Kolář and his work into disrepute again. In 1970 cerebral [[apoplexy]] stiffened his right arm. Kolář signed [[Charter 77|Charta 77]] and while on a scholarship to [[West Berlin]], the government decided to force him to emigrate; he was therefore not allowed to return home. From 1980 on he lived in [[Paris]]. After 1989 he visited his homeland more and more often. In 1999 Kolář injured his spine and he spent his last years in a Prague hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slovnikceskeliteratury.cz/showContent.jsp?docId=22 Slovník české literatury]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary work ==
Kolář's poetry was first published in 1938 in a private edition; these early poems are not included in his complete work, probably because they are openly erotic, describing oral sex (''Ústnice''), sex positions (''Svícen a trakař'') and sex with a prostitute (''Růže Večernice'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artmuseum.cz/umelec.php?art_id=524&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''Křestný list'' (Baptism Certificate, 1941) is considered his debut. ''Křestný list'' and Kolář's three other collections of poems from the 1940s (''Sedm kantát'', ''Limb a jiné básně'', ''Ódy a variace'') belong stylistically to the [[existentialist]] artistic movement of [[Group 42|Skupina 42]] of which Kolář was a member; other members included [[Jindřich Chalupecký]], [[Ivan Blatný]], [[Josef Kainar]], [[Jiřina Hauková]] and [[Kamil Lhoták]].

During the years of [[Stalinism]] in Czechoslovakia (1948-1953) Kolář wrote poetic diaries - ''Očitý svědek'' (Eyewitness, 1949), ''Prométheova játra'' ([[Prometheus]]' Liver, 1950). In 1957 he wrote a creative re-interpretation of [[Sun Zi]]'s [[The Art of War]], an ancient Chinese classic on the art of warfare, under the name ''Mistr Sun o básnickém umění'' (Master Sun on the Poetic Arts). In 1964 ''Náhodný svědek'' (Accidental Witness), a selection of his work from the 1940s was published, and in 1966 a censored selection from his 1950s work came out under the name ''Vršovický Ezop'' ([[Aesop]] from [[Districts of Prague|Vršovice]]).  In the 1960s he started writing experimental poetry, creating new forms of poetry which he gave names such as analfabetogram and cvokogram. In these new forms of poetry the line between the literary and the visual increasingly started to blur, which ultimately led to his experiments in visual art.

== Visual Art ==
His first exhibitions in 1937 focused on his collages. In the 1960s Kolář first combined painting and poetry but he gradually turned completely to experiments in visual art. In his work he used a scalpel to cut pictures out of magazines. He produced colors in his collages by gluing on printed fragments of paper from various different sources.

His collages were intended to influence the viewer's outlook on life; the technique of using fragments of text and images from various different sources was well suited to achieve the effect Kolář wanted, by showing the destruction and fragmentation of the world Kolář inhabited. Simultaneously, by juxtaposition and contrasting of these different fragments the technique of the collage served to create surprising and visually striking new combinations; for instance, the combination of astronomical maps with Braille writing. Kolář invented or helped to develop new techniques of collage - [[confrontage]], [[froissage]], [[rollage]] etc.

Since the 1960s Kolář's visual artwork was featured regularly in exhibitions by galleries and museums, . Some of the more prominent exhibitions of his work were in the New York Guggenheim museum in 1975, and in Prague in 1994 in Dům U Černé Matky Boží.&lt;ref&gt;Slovník českých spisovatelů od roku 1945 I. díl, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Like most great artists of the past century, Kolář was both an anarchist and a reactionary. In order to "make it new," the artist must systematically reject every aesthetic tendency that's come before; the artist can either accomplish this task via exclusion or destruction. Witnessing first-hand the steady self-destruction of European civilization throughout his life, it seems only natural that Kolář would go the latter route – picking through the debris and disfiguring all that he came across, granting his objects a novel significance that certainly would've baffled their original creators."'' [[Travis Jeppesen]]

'''LAGEOS''', '''Laser Geodynamics Satellite''' or '''Laser Geometric Environmental Observation Survey''', are a series of two scientific research [[satellite]]s designed to provide an orbiting [[satellite laser ranging|laser ranging]] benchmark for [[geodynamics|geodynamical]] studies of the [[Earth]]. Each satellite is a high-density passive laser reflector in a very stable [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO).

== Function and operation ==
The spacecraft are [[aluminum]]-covered [[brass]] spheres with diameters of 60&amp;nbsp;cm (23.62&amp;nbsp;in) and masses of 400 (881.849 lbs) and 411&amp;nbsp;kg, covered with 426 cube-corner [[retroreflector]]s, giving them the appearance of giant [[golf ball]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/missions/lageos-1-2/ |title=Missions - LAGEOS 1&amp;2 - NASA Science |website=Science.nasa.gov |date=1976-05-04 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Herbert J. (2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3v1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 ''Observation of the Earth and its Environment: Survey of Missions and Sensors''] Springer {{ISBN|9783662090381}} p149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol3/table4.166.htm LAGEOS Characteristics] ''NASA Historical Data Book'' Volume III Table 4-166 SP-4012&lt;/ref&gt;  422 of the retroreflectors are made from fused silica glass while the remaining 4 are made from germanium to obtain measurements in the infrared for experimental studies of reflectivity and satellite orientation.&lt;ref name="ILRSLageos"/&gt; They have no on-board sensors or  electronics, and are not altitude-controlled.

They orbit at an altitude of {{convert|5900|km}},&lt;ref name="LageosQL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/lageosQL.html |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |title=JPL Mission and Spacecraft Library, Lageos |website=space.jpl.nasa.gov|archiveurl= |archivedate=January 1, 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; well above [[low earth orbit]] and well below [[geostationary orbit]], at orbital inclinations of 109.8 and 52.6 degrees.

Measurements are made by transmitting pulsed laser beams from Earth [[ground station]]s to the satellites. The laser beams then return to Earth after hitting the reflecting surfaces; the travel times are precisely measured, permitting ground stations in different parts of the Earth to measure their separations to better than one inch in thousands of miles.

The LAGEOS satellites make it possible to determine positions of points on the Earth with extremely high [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] due to the stability of their orbits.
The high [[volume-to-area ratio|mass-to-area ratio]] and the precise, stable ([[attitude (geometry)|attitude]]-independent) geometry of the LAGEOS spacecraft, together with their extremely regular orbits, make these satellites the most precise position references available.

== Mission goals ==
[[File:LAGEOS-FILE.jpg|thumb|The LAGEOS plaque, designed by Carl Sagan]]
The LAGEOS mission consists of the following key goals:
* Provide an accurate measurement of the satellite's position with respect to Earth.
* Determine the planet's shape ([[geoid]]).
* Determine [[tectonic plate]] movements associated with [[continental drift]].

Ground tracking stations located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France, Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and Japan) have ranged to the satellites and data from these stations are available worldwide to investigators studying [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] dynamics.

There are two LAGEOS spacecraft, LAGEOS-1 launched in 1976, and LAGEOS-2 launched in 1992. {{As of|2011|05}}, both LAGEOS spacecraft are routinely tracked by the [[ILRS network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/satellite_missions/current_missions/lag1_support.html |title=International Laser Ranging Service |website=Ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time capsule ==
LAGEOS-1 (which is predicted to re-enter the atmosphere in 8.4 million years&lt;ref name="ILRSLageos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/satellite_missions/current_missions/lag1_general.html |title=International Laser Ranging Service |website=Ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also contains a plaque designed by [[Carl Sagan]] to indicate to future humanity when LAGEOS-1 was launched. The plaque includes the numbers 1 to 10 in binary. In the upper right is the earth with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the future. It shows a #1 indicating 1 revolution, equaling 1 year. It then shows 268435456 (in binary; 2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;) years in the past, indicated by a left arrow and the arrangement of the Earth's continents at that time. The present is indicated with a 0 and both forward and backward arrows. Then the estimated arrangement of the continents in 8.4 million years with a right facing arrow and 8388608 in binary (2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;). LAGEOS itself is shown at launch on the 0 year, and falling to the Earth in the 8.4 million year diagram.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historydms.hq.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/DMS/e000045273.pdf NASA Press Kit for Project Lageos] (1976) p14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Newsfront - Message for the future|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DgEAAAAAMBAJ|publisher = [[Bonnier Corporation]]|date = 1976-07-01|language = en|first = Popular Science|last = Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">[[File:Reconstitution de la Dame de Cao (Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac, Paris).jpg|250px|thumb|The Lady of Cao]]

'''The Lady of Cao''' is a name given to a female [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] mummy discovered at the archeological site [[El Brujo]], which is located about 45&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] in the [[La Libertad Region]] of [[Peru]].  

==Discovery==
The Lady of Cao was discovered in 2006 by a team of Peruvian archaeologists led by Regulo Franco Jordan of the ''National Cultural Institute of Peru'' with the financial cooperation of the Augusto N. Wiese Foundation.  The mummy, which was heavily tattooed and wrapped in many layers of cloth, was found with a number of ceremonial items, including weapons and jewelry.  Also found were the remains of a second young woman, possibly a human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.go2peru.com/peru_guide/trujillo/brujo_trujillo.htm|title=El Brujo and the Lady of Cao |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern autopsy indicated that the Lady of Cao was in her mid twenties when she died and may have of died of complications due to pregnancy or childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2011/02/peru-lady-of-cao-mummy-died-during.html|title=The Archaeology News Network |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estimated date of death for the Lady of Cao is about 450 CE.   

==Significance==
The richness of the burial site, as well as the presence of weapons, suggest that the woman might have been a high ranking priestess or even a Moche ruler, possibly governing what is now known as the [[Chicama|Chicama District]] region of northern Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/mummy-peru.html|title=National Geographic News, May 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this discovery, it was believed that only men held high rank in the Moche culture. The discovery of the Lady of Cao burial is compared with that of the [[El Señor de Sipán|Lord of Sipan]] in terms of important archeological discoveries relating to the Moche.

==Reconstruction==
On 3 July 2017, culture officials and archaeologists unveiled a replica of her face. According to Peru's Ministry of Culture, the replica was made using 3D imaging technology and forensics archaeology based on her skull structure and ethnographic research which took 10 months to create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/peru-reveals-face-of-ancient-young-female-ruler-lady-of-cao-20170704-gx4r4c.html|title=Peru reveals face of ancient young female ruler Lady of Cao|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Lavina Fielding Anderson''' (born 13 April 1944 in [[Shelley, Idaho]]) is a [[Latter Day Saint]] scholar, writer, editor, and [[feminism|feminist]]. Anderson holds a Ph.D. in English from the [[University of Washington]]. Her editing credits include ''Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1987) and ''Tending the Garden: Essays on Mormon Literature'' (1996), as well as the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', ''[[Journal of Mormon History]]'', ''Mormon Women's Forum Quarterly,'' and ''Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance.'' In 2001, Anderson published a critical edition of [[Lucy Mack Smith]]'s [[History of Joseph Smith by His Mother|memoir]]: ''Lucy's Book: A Critical Edition of Lucy Mack Smith's family memoir'' (Salt Lake City: [[Signature Books]], 2001).

Anderson is one of the original trustees of the [[Mormon Alliance]], founded in 1992 to document allegations of spiritual and ecclesiastical abuse in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). In 1993, Anderson published a chronology documenting cases of what she regarded as spiritual abuse by LDS Church leaders during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. This article became grounds&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/092-65-79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for her excommunication on charges of apostasy in September 1993, as one of the [[September Six]]. Anderson remains as active in the LDS Church as her excommunicant status allows; in 1996, she was described by [[Levi S. Peterson]] as exemplary of an emerging "church in exile" composed of faithful excommunicants.

She is married to the late [[Paul L. Anderson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">{{For|the general meaning|Legal process}}

The '''legal process school''' (sometimes "legal process theory") was a movement within American law that attempted to chart a third way between [[legal formalism]] and [[legal realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Dripps, ''Justice Harlan on Criminal Procedure: Two Cheers for the Legal Process School'', [http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/osjcl/Articles/Volume3_1/Symposium/Dripps_3-1.pdf 3 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 125], 126 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing its name from Hart &amp; Sacks' textbook ''[[The Legal Process (book)|The Legal Process]]'' (along with Hart &amp; Wechsler's textbook ''[[The Federal Courts and the Federal System]]'' considered a primary canonical text of the school), it is associated with scholars such as [[Herbert Wechsler]], [[Henry Hart (lawyer)|Henry Hart]], [[Albert Sacks]] and [[Lon Fuller]], and their students such as [[John Hart Ely]] and [[Alexander Bickel]]. The school grew in the 1950s and 1960s. To this day, the school's influence remains broad.

==Basic precepts==
*'''"Institutional Settlement."''' As the name suggests, the legal process school was deeply interested in the processes by which law is made, and particularly in a federal system, how authority to answer various questions is distributed vertically (as between state and federal governments) and horizontally (as between branches of government) and how this impacts on the legitimacy of decisions. The principle of institutional settlement looks at how society decided: "that law should allocate decisionmaking to the institutions best suited to decide particular questions, and that the decisions arrived at by those institutions must then be respected by other actors in the system, even if those actors would have reached a different conclusion"&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Ernest Young, ''Institutional Settlement in a Globalizing Judicial System'', 54 Duke L. J. 1143, 1150 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Rule of Law.''' Although courts should be aware and respectful of this institutional settlement, courts have an important role to play, and the rule of law "requires the availability of judicial remedies sufficient to vindicate fundamental legal principles."&lt;ref name="fallon"&gt;Richard H. Fallon, Jr., ''Reflections on the Hart and Wechsler Paradigm'', 47 Vand. L. Rev. 953, 964-6 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; "The role of courts in the Legal Process tradition is often similar to that of a point guard on a basketball team: the court takes provisional responsibility for a dispute, but may well decide to pass it off to other actors in the system
*'''"Reasoned Elaboration."''' The legal process school recognized the claims of legal realists that judges do, in fact, make law, and that adjudication is not merely the mechanical deduction from precedent and statutory texts claimed by formalists. Unlike the realists, however, legal process claims that, as Fallon puts it, "while the judicial role is irreducibly creative in some respects, it is limited to the reasoned elaboration of principles and policies that are ultimately traceable to more democratically legitimate decisionmakers." Judges should reason from the totality of the legal materials at issue to reach their conclusions, and while "raw judicial will" sometimes happens, as a matter of observable reality, it is deprecated.&lt;ref name="fallon" /&gt;
*'''"What ''are'' legal materials? The 'anti-positivist' principle."''' Legal process generally, but Hart &amp; Sacks particularly, suggest that the legal materials from which the aforementioned reasoned elaboration must take place are not limited to precedent and statutory text. Rather, as Wells puts it, legal process "permit[s]," and may even "require" that legal materials include "general ethical principles and widely shared social goals ... [because] 'the law rests upon a body of hard-won and deeply-embedded principles and policies.'"&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;Michael Wells, ''Behind the Parity Debate: the Decline of the Legal Process Tradition in the Law of Federal Courts'', 71 B.U.L. Rev. 609 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Hart &amp; Sacks stressed that this did not mean that judges were authorized to impute their own preferences into law, but rather, that there are broad legal authorities embedded in and assumed by narrower texts. This leads legal process to look at purpose and structure as well as text (for example, "federalism," "separation of powers" nor "judicial review" are not explicitly stated in the Constitution, but are eminently clear from the general structure of government delineated therein). "Any particular legal directive must be seen and interpreted in light of the whole body of law."&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;
*'''Neutral principles.''' Courts must reason from legal materials using principles that "in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved."&lt;ref name="wechsler"&gt;Herbert Wechsler, ''Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law'', 73 Harv. L Rev. 1 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must decide a case on reasoning "that he would be willing to follow in other situations to which it applies," which is to say that a principled decision must announce that the case being decided is "an instance of a more inclusive class of cases" and is being "treated in a certain manner because it is held to be proper to treat cases of its type in a certain manner."&lt;ref name="greenawalt"&gt;Kent Greenawalt, ''The Enduring Significance of Neutral Principles'', 78 Colum. L. Rev. 982 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  When a case or class of cases present questions that cannot be adjudicated through application of neutral principles, courts should refuse to decide such questions: "[t]hey should decline to impose substantive judicial judgments on disputes not capable of resolution through the application of neutral principles to sharply defined sets of facts."&lt;ref name="fallon" /&gt;  In the legal process concept, "the integrity of the judicial process may be compromised if ... [cases are decided on] arguments that extend no further than the case at hand. ... Only by insisting on a level of generality, some distance between the reasons and the facts of the case at hand, can one be certain that judges are actually reasoning from legal materials rather than indulging their own preferences."&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; When a judge "adopt[s] a general rule, and say[s], 'This is the basis of our decision,' [they] not only constrain lower courts, [they] constrain [themselves] as well. If the next case should have such different facts that [their] political or policy preferences regarding the outcome are quite the opposite, [they] will be unable to indulge those preferences ... hav[ing] committed [themselves] to the governing principle."&lt;ref name="scalia"&gt;[[Antonin Scalia]], ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules'', 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Traditional dispute resolution.''' Similar to the directive that courts should not hear disputes that cannot be resolved through neutral principles (i.e. [[political questions]]) is the notion that courts in the American system of government are institutionally limited to resolving the kinds of disputes courts traditionally resolved: "'bipolar' disputes in which each of two contending parties introduces arguments making a claim of right or an accusation of guilt, and in which the judge's task is to choose between them on a reasoned basis."&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;

Although legal process is no longer popular by name, particularly in the academy, it can be seen as harmonizing with both major modern schools of judicial thought, [[textualism]] and [[purposivism]], depending on which of the foregoing assumptions are emphasized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26444">[[File:Peggy Guido.jpg|thumb|Guido, leading archaeologist and prehistorian of the 20th century]]

'''Cecily Margaret Guido''' ([[née]] '''Preston'''; 5 August 1912 – 8 September 1994), known as '''Peggy Piggott''' during her first marriage, was an English [[archaeologist]], prehistorian, and finds specialist. Her career in British archaeology spanned sixty years. She is recognised for her field methods; her field-leading research into prehistoric settlement (hillforts and roundhouses), burial traditions, and artefact studies (particularly Iron Age to Anglo-Saxon glass beads); as well as her high-quality and rapid publication, contributing more than 50 articles and books to her field between the 1930s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Guido was born Cecily Margaret Preston on 5 August 1912 in Beckenham, Kent. Peggy was the eldest of two children to Elsie Marie Fidgeon – whose father was of independent means – and Arthur Gurney Preston, a Cambridge-educated engineer and wealthy ironmaster, who is also recorded as of independent means at the time of her birth.&lt;ref name="Stuart Piggott - obit British Academy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Piggott ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mercer|first1=Roger J.|title=Piggott, Stuart Ernest (1910–1996)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63311|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 September 2015|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy's family home was a twenty-room mansion, Wood Lodge in West Wickham. During her childhood, her mother remarried, and during the summer of her eighth birthday her father drowned in Cornwall, after which she was brought up by her aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
As a child, Peggy had an interest in Roman coins.&lt;ref name="Stuart Piggott - obit British Academy" /&gt; As a young woman she met and began excavating with [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa Verney Wheeler]], spending her 21st birthday digging the Roman town of [[Verulamium]] (in 1933).&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy was particularly fond of Tessa, and spoke of her with great affection, dedicating her glass beads monograph to her memory.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Jenny Price pers. comm (Department of Archaeology, University of Durham)"&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy gained her first degree (then a diploma for women) from the University of Cambridge in 1934. From 1935 to 1936, she studied archaeology at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] in London, where she was awarded a postgraduate diploma in Western European Prehistory.&lt;ref name="Stuart Piggott - obit British Academy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercer|first1=Roger|title=Stuart Piggott 1910–1996|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|date=1998|volume=97|pages=413–442|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/97p413.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2015|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that she met first husband, [[Stuart Piggott]], whom she married on 12 November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Roger (1998). "Stuart Piggott 1910–1996" (pdf). Proceedings of the British Academy. 97: 413–442. Retrieved 1 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early Iron Age===
Piggott began her archaeological career by working on the Early [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]]. She began by writing up the rescue excavation of an Early Iron Age site at [[Southcote, Berkshire|Southcote]] (Berkshire), which appeared in the ''[[Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society]]'' in 1937; and publishing the pottery from Iron Age [[Theale]] the following year. In 1938–39, she worked on ''[[The Prehistoric Society]]'''s first research excavation at the Early Iron Age type-site of [[Little Woodbury]] (Wiltshire). She worked here with [[Gerhard Bersu]], who ultimately seems to have been as great an influence on Peggy as the Wheelers.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2008. ''History of the Prehistoric Society 1908–2008''. http://www.prehistoricsociety.org/about/history_of_the_prehistoric_society/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, she published a further Early Iron Age site at [[Langton Matravers]] (Dorset), greatly enhancing knowledge of a period that by then had only just begun to be elucidated.

===Sutton Hoo===
Peggy was a skilled excavator at a time when British archaeology was establishing itself as a modern discipline; she was involved in the high-profile excavation of the Anglo-Saxon boat burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (in 1939), along with [[Charles Phillips (archaeologist)|Charles Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mercer|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Marciniak|editor1-first=Arkadiusz|editor2-last=Coles|editor2-first=John|title=Grahame Clark and His Legacy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle-upon-Tyne|isbn=978-1443822220|pages=47–67|chapter=Stuart Piggott, Christopher Hawkes and Archaeological Narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary accounts suggest that it was Peggy who first struck gold; her involvement in the television programme helping with public communication of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy takes a prominent role in a novel on the subject, ''The Dig'', written by her nephew, John Preston.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, J. 2008. ''The Dig''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peggy's own excavations mostly focused on the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]. The first excavation she directed (in 1937), at the age of 25, was of the Middle Bronze Age barrow and urnfield cemetery at Latch Farm (Hampshire); its publication the following year also added significantly to the gazetteer of cremation urns known for the period.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott,  Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912–1994). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military/Bronze Age===
During World War II, whilst still in her 20s, she directed numerous rescue excavations for the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works, on sites commandeered for defence purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newforestheritage.org/image/762/&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, Peggy was at the height of her productivity, producing an average of two publications each year – often for the national journal ''Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society'', as well as for notable regional societies. At this time, she published on several important Bronze Age monument types including Bronze Age enclosures (Wiltshire) and the well-known hilltop enclosure site of Ram's Hill (Berkshire); on [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles]] (Dorset); and on the excavation of eighteen barrows (Hampshire and Wiltshire), as well as others on Crichel and Launceston Downs (Dorset).&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott,  Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912–1994). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finds specialism===
On the strength of her contribution to British prehistory, Piggott became an elected Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1944, at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the war period, Peggy turned her attention to understanding prehistoric linear earthwork sites (Hampshire) as well as producing a detailed study of the [[Grim's Ditch|Grim's Ditch earthwork complex]] (Wiltshire). In the later 1940s, Piggott began to focus on the Late Bronze Age period and also started producing specialist artefact reports, in particular on Late Bronze Age metalwork, notably: a comprehensive study of British razors; another on a Late Bronze Age metalwork hoard from Blackrock (Sussex); and individual artefact studies too; as well as a report on a Late Bronze Age burial at Orrock (Fife). It is at this point too, that she began to develop her specialist interest in glass beads.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott,  Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912–1994). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh===
Whilst her husband was serving abroad during World War II, Peggy developed a friendship with [[Austin Lane Poole]] who allowed her husband to study for a degree at the University of Oxford on his return from war.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Roger (1998). "Stuart Piggott 1910–1996" (pdf). Proceedings of the British Academy. 97: 413–442. Retrieved 1 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was vital to her husband's future career and meant he satisfied requirements for the Abercromby Chair in Archaeology at Edinburgh University. He took up the Chair in 1947. As a woman of independent means, Peggy was able to support her husband financially in his part-time post, whilst continuing her own research. Having taken a flat in Gloucester Place, Edinburgh and with each keen to focus their efforts on the prehistory of Scotland, the Office of Works subsequently invited the Piggotts to begin excavating archaeological sites, and the two agreed to split prehistory between them: she focusing on the later period.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mercer, ‘Stuart Piggott 1910–1996’ Proceedings of the British Academy 97 (1998), 413–442&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hillforts===
Peggy was soon awarded funding by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] to test the model of Iron Age settlement development in southern Scotland, in response to a [[Council for British Archaeology]] policy statement regarding the misleading nature of settlement classification from surface remains; an early attempt to move [[settlement archaeology]] beyond typological study.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2011. Processual archaeology and gender politics: the loss of innocence. ''Archaeological Dialogues'' 18(1), 59–86.&lt;/ref&gt; In her upland excavations of Hownam Rings (in 1948), Hayhope Knowe (in 1949), and Bonchester Hill (in 1950) – each site published in the same year it was excavated – she tested and refined the CBA model, providing a relative chronological framework for later prehistoric settlement in southern Scotland.&lt;ref name="ScARF 2.3"&gt;{{cite web|title=2.3 Synthesis and survey in the mid-20th century|url=http://www.scottishheritagehub.com/content/23-synthesis-and-survey-mid-20th-century|website=Scottish Archaeological Research Framework|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days before the application of radiocarbon dating to archaeological material, this was a huge leap forward for prehistoric studies.

===Importance===
It is this period of Peggy's career, between the late 1940s and early 1950s, that marks her out as one of the most important British prehistorians. In this period, she excavated no less than six [[Hillfort|hillforts]]; and it is her work in the field of hillfort studies which is considered some of her most influential. Hownam Rings (1948), in particular, became the type-site for hillfort development, known as the Hownam Paradigm, remaining valid to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, I.B.M. 2003. Scottish Roundhouses: The Early Chapters. ''Scottish Archaeological Journal'' 25(1), 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; At Hownam, she discussed archaeological survival, recognising for the first time the problems of erosion on slopes and the vestigial nature of timber features.

===Field methods===
Peggy's excavation method was tactical and efficient, digging a site per year, with strategy chosen for site objectives. Her most influential site in this respect was that of Hayhope Knowe (1949), where she opened 520 sq. m in targeted open-area trenches, to investigate three houses and the enclosure sequence. Following the pioneering excavations of Thomas Wake and Kilbridge-Jones in late 1930s Northumberland, and of Bersu in the 1940s (Isle of Man and Scotarvit Covert), this was one of the first times such an approach had been used for the northern Iron Age. Peggy's method had taken the best of both the Wheeler and Bersu schools of excavation, scaled down for rapid assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2003. Prehistoric Dwelling: Circular Structures in north and central Britain. PhD thesis, University of Durham.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roundhouses===
Beyond elucidating relative settlement chronologies, Peggy's reconstruction drawing of the Hayhope roundhouse was to become the modern standard. Although Little Woodbury had been successful in exposing an Early Iron Age roundhouse, the report had been remarkably inconclusive with respect to its reconstruction: Peggy simplified this, in line with the earlier Northumbrian work of Wake and Kilbride-Jones, which went on to influence Brewster at Staple Howe. The Hayhope-Hownam excavations also suggested the potential for a typology of prehistoric houses – as later undertaken by Richard Feachem and George Jobey – both greatly influenced by Peggy's work.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2003. Prehistoric Dwelling: Circular Structures in north and central Britain (2500 BC-AD 500). PhD thesis, University of Durham.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bersu===
Parallels between Peggy's work and that of [[Gerhard Bersu]] suggest that the two developed some form of intellectual exchange, following her involvement at [[Little Woodbury]] in the late 1930s. Peggy's Milton Loch excavations seem a response to Bersu's work on the Isle of Man – his interpretation of these sites remaining problematic; and it was instead Peggy who established the similarities and differences between dryland and wetland architectures. It was Peggy too who successfully elucidated the reconstruction of the prehistoric roundhouse (compare for example Green Craig and Hayhope). Between Peggy and Bersu, it was Peggy's interpretative skills that definitely had the edge.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2003. ''Prehistoric Dwelling: Circular Structures in north and central Britain (2500 BC-AD 500)''. PhD thesis, University of Durham.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===
By 1948, Peggy began to integrate her work with popular theory, considering archaeological change as 'fashion', or via the migration of elites – a clear development of [[Christopher Hawkes]]’ historical migrations or [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s diffusionism, and a bridge between these and Frank Hodson, who rejected invasionism in 1964. By the early 1950s Peggy was already working towards what we now consider an understanding of everyday life in prehistory: locating the position of finds on plans, and considering ritual deposits. It is in the work of Piggott that we really see the advent of modern settlement studies – through her excavation strategy, and her work on hillforts and roundhouses.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R.E. 2003. Prehistoric Dwelling: Circular Structures in north and central Britain (2500 BC-AD 500). PhD thesis, University of Durham.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 1950s===
In the early 1950s, having already excavated five hillfort sites, Peggy worked with her husband on her sixth: the site of Braidwood Fort (1951–55). Peggy and Stuart's long-term intellectual exchange, and their partnership in excavation, had certainly been of benefit to Stuart. In the introduction to his ''Neolithic Cultures'' (1954), he thanks her both for her penetrating critique, and for her line drawings. Between 1951 and 1953, alongside her Scottish fieldwork, she had also published on a series of English sites including the hilltop site of [[Carl Wark]] (near Sheffield); excavations at Dorchester (Dorset) with R.J.C. Atkinson; and her wartime excavation of an Iron Age barrow burial (Hampshire). It was at this point that she turned her attention to wetland archaeology, and arguably her most technically skilled excavation: the [[crannog]] site of Milton Loch (Dumfries and Galloway), with its well-preserved timber roundhouse (published in 1953).

===Italy===
Piggott produced one of her final field reports for British prehistory in 1954 – a note on ceramics from a dun (on Tiree) – in the year that her relationship with Stuart ended. She worked with him on the site of Braidwood Fort until their twenty-year marriage was annulled, in 1956, on grounds of non-consummation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hawkes archive (Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt; These events took their toll on her British career. Moving to Sicily, Peggy briefly reverted to her maiden name of Preston, using it in the translation that she and her second husband Luigi Guido made of Bernabo Brea's ''Sicily before the Greeks'' (1957). In the 1960s and early 1970s, she produced four guidebooks on Italian archaeology: on Sardinia (1963), Syracuse (1965), Sicily (1967), and on southern Italy as a whole (1972);&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reviews of notable Italian archaeological works in the pages of the British journal ''Antiquity''.

===Glass beads===
In the 1970s, Peggy settled down to researching glass beads, and travelled around Britain to see excavated examples and those in museums. In 1978, she published her first volume on ancient British glass beads, an accomplished work covering both prehistoric and Roman periods (dedicated to [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa Verney Wheeler]]); after which she began her Anglo-Saxon volume. She co-founded the Bead Study Trust (in 1981), and the Peggy Guido Fund for research on beads.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott,  Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912–1994). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s onwards she produced dozens of specialist reports on beads (for sites including Lankhills Winchester, Colchester, Wilsford, Cadbury Congresbury, Conderton Camp, Castle Copse – with many more not yet in print); her bead research saw her driving a camper-van across Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Jenny Price pers. comm (Department of Archaeology, University of Durham)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Her volume on Anglo-Saxon beads was published posthumously (by Martin Welch) in 1999. Both volumes remain the primary reference works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wiltshire===
In c. 1977, she moved from Brock Street, Bath to Long Street in Devizes, and became involved with Devizes Museum, now the [[Wiltshire Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Jenny Price pers. comm (Department of Archaeology, University of Durham)"&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 70, she turned her attention again to prehistoric field archaeology, publishing a reconsideration of the Inner Enclosure at [[Figsbury Ring|Figsbury Rings]] (Wiltshire) with Isobel Smith (in 1982), and conducting a fieldwalking survey of Longbridge Deverill Cow Down with Eve Machin (in 1982–83), to assess plough damage. In 1984, Peggy was elected to the position of Vice President of the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Roger (1998). "Stuart Piggott 1910–1996" (pdf). Proceedings of the British Academy. 97: 413–442. Retrieved 1 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
Guido was a highly skilled excavator and a prolific researcher. Her archaeological career spanned sixty years and was defined by high field standards, and rapid, high-quality publication. Described as having "inexhaustible powers of leadership and enthusiasm", she had been undeterred by the demands of rescue excavation for the military.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; She produced as many as fifty works for British prehistory, in particular advancing the fields of Bronze Age burial traditions, Late Bronze Age artefact studies, Later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement studies (especially roundhouse architecture and hillfort chronologies), and of course Prehistoric, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon glass beads.

==Personal life==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A.W. Lawrence and Peggy Guido.jpeg|thumb|right|A. W. Lawrence and Peggy Guido, Devizes, 1 February 1991]] --&gt;
On 12 November 1936, the then Margaret Preston married her first husband, archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]]. They had met while they were both students at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] in London.&lt;ref name="Stuart Piggott - obit British Academy" /&gt; By 1954 their relationship was over and they divorced in 1956.&lt;ref name="Stuart Piggott - obit British Academy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Piggott ODNB" /&gt; In 1957, she married Luigi Guido; they had met while she was undertaking research in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Bagpipes in Babylon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balfour Paul|first1=Glencairn|authorlink1=Glencairn Balfour Paul|title=Bagpipes in Babylon: a lifetime in the Arab world and beyond|date=2006|publisher=Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1845111519|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A heroine of beads"&gt;{{cite web|title=A heroine of beads|url=https://bradfordunconsideredtrifles.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/a-heroine-of-beads/|website=Bradford Unconsidered Trifles|accessdate=1 September 2015|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Luigi had a [[psychotic]] breakdown and spent six months strapped to his bed being cared for by Margaret. At the end of this period, he suddenly decided to leave his wife and moved back to Sicily; Margaret never heard from him again.&lt;ref name="Bagpipes in Babylon" /&gt;

Whilst in her 70s, Peggy cared for Prof. [[A. W. Lawrence]] who was the younger brother of [[T. E. Lawrence]] and a classical scholar,&lt;ref name="Bagpipes in Babylon" /&gt; something that made her very happy. She described him as "an old friend waiting to die" following the death of his wife in November 1986. From then until 1988, A. W. stayed with Peggy in Devizes for a couple of weeks or months at a time. In 1988 he moved from his own house in Langford (Bedfordshire) to Peggy's 16th-century house at 44 Long Street in Devizes, and they lived together until his death on 31 March 1991.&lt;ref name="Lawrence ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=R.

"Stuart Piggott 1910–1996" (pdf). Proceedings of the British Academy. 97: 413–442. Retrieved 1 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peggy Guido died in a hospital in Bath on 8 September 1994, aged 82, three and a half years after Lawrence. She had no children. On September 5, while still at home,  she said during a phone conversation: "[[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] is dying, he has cancer of the lungs. XXX  died recently. Everybody is going [...] I am thinking about death all the time."&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with Dutch journalist and friend Michiel Hegener. He wrote an article about A. W. Lawrence, including his years with Peggy, available in English at http://www.michielhegener.nl/AWL.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Peggy was a sociable person who had wider interests in music, literature and art.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Guido, Obituary, The Times (30 Sept 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Her name lives on in the Margaret Guido Charitable Trust, by [[Coutts|Coutts of the Strand]]; the Trust provides grants to charities and voluntary bodies, largely those to do with the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R and Davies, M. (forthcoming) Piggott,  Cecily Margaret [Peggy Guido] (1912–1994). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt; A bequest to the National Trust helped them to acquire the meadow land surrounding the monument of [[Silbury Hill]]: a fitting tribute to the woman who did such an extraordinary amount to advance our understanding of Prehistoric Britain.

The '''Norman Rockwell Museum''' is an [[art museum]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], dedicated to the art of [[Norman Rockwell]]. It is home to the world's largest collection of original Rockwell art.

==History==
The museum was founded in 1969 in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], where Rockwell lived the last 25 years of his life.&lt;ref name=nrmAbout&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrm.org/about/the-museum/ |title=Museum History |website=nrm.org |accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally located on Main Street in a building known as the Old Corner House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19040664/mrs_goulet_director_of_corner_house/ |title=Mrs. Goulet Director of Corner House |newspaper=[[The Berkshire Eagle]] |location=[[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] |page=20 |date=May 1, 1969 |accessdate=April 8, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum moved to its current location 24 years later,&lt;ref name=nrmAbout/&gt; opening to the public on April 3, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19040738/simpler_america_gets_fresh_start/ |title=Simpler America Gets Fresh Start |first=Jeff |last=Donn |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |page=4 |date=April 3, 1993 |accessdate=April 8, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current museum building was designed by [[Robert A. M. Stern]].&lt;ref name=nrmAbout/&gt;


==Collection==
In addition to 574 original works of art by Rockwell, the museum also houses the Norman Rockwell Archives, a collection of over 100,000 various items, which include photographs, fan mail, and various business documents.

The '''Peabody Museum of Natural History''' at [[Yale University]] is among the oldest, largest, and most prolific university [[List of natural history museums|natural history museums]] in the world. It was founded by the [[philanthropist]] [[George Peabody]] in 1866 at the behest of his nephew [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], the early [[paleontologist]]. Most known to the public for its Great Hall of Dinosaurs, which includes a mounted juvenile ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and the {{convert|110|ft|m|sing=on}} long mural, ''[[The Age of Reptiles]]''; it also has permanent exhibits dedicated to [[human]] and [[mammal]] [[evolution]]; [[wildlife]] [[diorama]]s, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s; and the [[bird]]s, [[mineral]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[Connecticut]].

The Peabody Museum is located at 170 Whitney Avenue in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], United States, and is run by almost one hundred staff members. While the original building was demolished in 1917, it moved to its current location in 1925, and has since expanded to occupy the Peabody Museum, the attached Kline Geology Laboratory and the Class of 1954 Environmental Sciences Center, parts of three additional buildings, and a field station at the [[Long Island Sound]]. The museum also owns [[Horse Island, Connecticut|Horse Island]] in the [[Thimble Islands]], which is not opened to the public, but used for experiments. The Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center, completed in 2001 and connected to the museum and the adjacent Kline Geology Laboratory, hosts approximately one-half of the museum's 13 million specimens.

On August 28, 2018, Yale University announced a contribution of $160 million by [[Ed Bass|Edward P. Bass '67]] toward the renovation of the Museum.&lt;ref name=NytRenovationAnnouncment&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale Receives $160 Million Gift for Peabody Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/arts/design/peabody-museum-yale-gift.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YaleNewsRenovationAnnouncment&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward P.

Bass's contribution will help to fund the renewal and expansion of the acclaimed museum.  The full scope and timeline for the renovation are still under development, and fundraising for the project is ongoing.&lt;ref name=EvolvedThePlan&gt;{{cite web|title=Peabody Evolved: The Plan|url=http://peabodyevolved.yale.edu/the-plan|publisher=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EvolvedSupport&gt;{{cite web|title=Peabody Evolved: Support|url=http://peabodyevolved.yale.edu/support|publisher=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peabody has several world-important collections. Perhaps the most notable are the vertebrate paleontology collections, among the largest, most extensive, and most historically important fossil collections in the United States (see [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], [[R.S. Lull]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]], [[John Ostrom]], [[Elisabeth Vrba]], and [[Jacques Gauthier]]), and the [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] Collection of Incan artifacts from [[Machu Picchu]], named for the famous Yale archaeologist who rediscovered this Peruvian ruin. Also notable are the extensive ornithology collection, one of the largest and most taxonomically inclusive in the world, and the associated William Robertson Coe Ornithology Library, one of the best in the United States. The collection of marine invertebrates is additionally extensive, having benefitted from the work of such prolific invertebrate zoologists as [[Addison Emery Verrill]]. Faculty curators for the collections are drawn from Yale's departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Geology and Geophysics, and Anthropology. Because these departments maintain a strong tradition of hiring faculty who will perform collections-based research, especially after the renewed support for organismal biology at Yale under President [[Richard Charles Levin]] and in particular former provost [[Alison Richard]], nearly all of the collections are under active internal use and enjoy continuous and considerable growth. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== ''Torosaurus'' ==

The museum has erected the first full-scale reproduction of a ''[[Torosaurus]]'' on Whitney Avenue next to the entrance. The 3&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, 7&amp;nbsp;m (21&amp;nbsp;ft) long, 3.33 [[metric ton]] (7,350 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) statue was sculpted in clay and cast in bronze, and set on a 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;ft) tall granite base. The reproduction of ''T. latus'' is scientifically faithful of ''T. latus'', and its skin is based on the fossilized skin impressions left by a ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'' (a closely related [[ceratopsid]]).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Torosaurus'' Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:PostcardNewHavenCTPeabodyMuseum1909postmark.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The museum as shown on a postcard mailed in 1909]]
[[Othniel Charles Marsh]] was an undergraduate and later the Professor of Paleontology at Yale University. His education was paid for by his wealthy uncle [[George Peabody]], who began to donate much of his accumulated wealth to various educational institutions at the end of his life. Marsh and his teams discovered dozens of new genera of dinosaurs, including triceratops, stegosaurus and apatosaurus.  At the request of Marsh, and to house some of his discoveries, Peabody founded Yale's Museum of Natural History in 1866 with a gift of $150,000.

Yale's collection at the time was mostly minerals, collected by the [[geologist]] and [[mineralogist]] [[Benjamin Silliman]]. Marsh was one of the museum's first three curators, and when Peabody died in 1869 he used his inheritance to fund expeditions which greatly increased the museum's collections. His primary interest was [[dinosaur]]s, and during the infamous period in paleontological history known as the [[Bone Wars]], he discovered  56 new species of dinosaur and shipped literally tons of fossils back from the [[American Southwest]]. His finds also included fossils of vertebrates and invertebrates, [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s of prehistoric animals, and archaeological and [[ethnology|ethnological]] artifacts.

The museum officially opened to the public in 1876. In 1917, it was demolished and replaced by the [[Harkness Memorial Quadrangle]] dormitory. Due to [[World War I]], most of the collections were put in storage until December 1925, when the current building was dedicated. The new building had a great, 2-story hall designed specifically to hold Marsh's dinosaurs.

Some other significant events include:

* In 1930, donation of the [[Harry Payne Bingham]] Oceanographic Collection, including the work of artist [[Wilfrid Swancourt Bronson]].&lt;ref name=PeabodyYale&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Payne Bingham|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/archives/biography/harry-payne-bingham|website=peabody.yale.edu|publisher=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YalePeabodyBronson&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilfrid Swancourt Bronson Archives|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/ypm.ypmar.000051|publisher=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slack|first1=Nancy G.|title=G. Evelyn Hutchinson and the Invention of Modern Ecology|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300161387|page=125 of 457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1931, the mounting of Marsh's ''Brontosaurus'' was finished, after 6 years of work.
* In 1947, [[Rudolph F. Zallinger]] finished painting dinosaurs in their natural habitats in his {{convert|110|ft|m|sing=on}} long mural ''The Age of Reptiles'', after 3-1/2 years of work.
* In 1959, Bingham Laboratory was completed.
* In 1963, Kline Geology Laboratory was completed.
* In 1972, the Birds of Connecticut Hall opened.
* In 2001, the interdisciplinary Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center was constructed on the site of the former Bingham Laboratory. It houses collections space for the museum and laboratory space for several curators.
* In 2005, the Peabody unveiled its 21-foot life-size bronze sculpture of ''Torosaurus''—one of O.C. Marsh's famed dinosaur discoveries.  The 7,350-pound sculpture sits on a 13-foot, 70-ton base of [[Stony Creek (Branford)|Stony Creek]] [[Granite|granite]].
* In 2018, the Peabody announced a $160 million transformative gift toward a redefining renovation that will greatly expand its research capabilities, education and collection centers, and its exhibition galleries.

== Popular culture ==
* The museum was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Burns, Baby Burns]]." In the episode Mr. Burns has a relationship with Lily Bancroft and produce an illegitimate son played by [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. He flashes back to 1939 for his 25th graduation class reunion. They make love in the museum, specifically in an exhibit featuring eskimos and penguins.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Simpsons Archive]][http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F05.html "Burns, Baby Burns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115061945/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F05.html |date=2006-01-15 }} Retrieved July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Pesaro Madonna''''' ({{lang-it|Pala Pesaro}}) (better known as the Madonna di Ca' Pesaro) is a painting by the late Italian Renaissance master [[Titian]], commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in the [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Frari]] Basilica in [[Venice]] for which the work was painted, and where it remains today.  Jacopo was Bishop of [[Paphos]], in [[Cyprus]], and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the [[Borgia]] pope, [[Alexander VI]].&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings ''[[Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter]]'', c. 1510-11&lt;ref name="smart1"&gt;{{cite web | title =Titian's Madonna of the Pesaro Family | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/titian-madonna-of-the-pesaro-family.html | accessdate =March 11, 2013 }}, text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by [[Saint Peter]].  Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo.  The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as ''Madonna della Scala ''(Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/venice-santa-maria-gloriosa-dei-frari Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice], accessed March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory.  An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned [[Turkish people|Turk]] and a [[Moors|Moor]], probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  At the right, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved.  Just behind Saint Francis is [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] - both, like [[Saint Bernardino]], are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.

The members of the donor's family are motionless.  All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space.  Infant angels appear on the cloud above.  One seen in rear view holds the Cross.  The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze.  The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes.  This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky.  The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting.

When Titian painted this [[altarpiece]], he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques.
The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; 

The architectural setting, involving the two large columns (which have been cropped to fit the altarpiece) draw emphasis vertically and to the height of the work; which draws the eye Heavenwards. These columns in the center of the painting are unprecedented in Renaissance painting, and are the subject of some controversy. X-rays reveal that Titian painted several other architectural elements in their place before settling on the columns.  Some critics have even speculated that Titian did not paint the columns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venice.umwblogs.org/exhibit/titians-altarpieces-color-innovation-and-invention/assumption/ Titian: Madonna di Ca’ Pesaro], Venice an online exhibit, the University of Mary Washington. Accessed March 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;  The outdoors setting suggests that the activity is taking place in a portico, in which the grandeur of the columns somehow belittles the human beings which leave the figures and the viewer almost in awe of the greater implied force.

'''Records in Contexts''', or '''RiC''', is a conceptual model and [[ontology]] for the archival description of records, designed by the Expert Group on Archival Description (EGAD) established by the [[International Council on Archives|International Council on Archives (ICA)]]. The EGAD initially began work on the standard between 2012 and 2016, with a conceptual model (RiC-CM) and an ontology (RiC-O) released for comment during 2016.&lt;ref name=RiCICApres2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the standard "Records in Context"|work=P138 Records in Contexts (RiC): a standard for archival description developed by the ICA Experts Group on Archival Description|publisher=International Council on Archives, Paris|date=8 September 2016|author1=Daniel Pitti|author2= Bill Stockting|author3=Florence Clavaud|url=https://www.ica.org/en/presentation-standard-records-context-thursday-8-september-1500|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Conceptual Model aims to bring together the Council's current descriptive standards, namely the [[ISAD(G)|General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G))]], [[ISAAR(CPF)|International Standard Archival Authority Records — Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF))]], International Standard Description of Functions (ISDF), and International Standard Description of Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH).&lt;ref name=RiCv01&gt;{{cite web|title=Records in Contexts: A conceptual model for archival description|url=https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/RiC-CM-0.1.pdf|work=Consultation Draft v0.1|date=September 2016|publisher=Experts Group On Archival Description, International Council on Archives|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; RiC also aims to be better suited to the management of electronic records than previous standards, whilst still supporting traditional analogue materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Carl, ''Researchers, practitioners and their use of the archived web. IIPC Web Archiving Conference 15th June 2017''. (2017) &lt;https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2017/06/20/researcherspractitioners-and-their-use-of-the-archived-web-iipc-web-archiving-conference-15th-june-2017/&gt; [accessed 3 August 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the primary descriptive entities of the model, and how these interrelate within archival description. RiC also aims to modernise the aging current standards, by enabling archival description to better capture the complex relationships records have with each other, and with their creators, holders, and subjects. These groups, individuals, and organisations are referred to as "agents" in RiC. Through these relationships, RiC aims to provide a richer descriptive context than the hierarchical structure of ISAD(G).&lt;ref name=BFPonRiC2016&gt;{{cite web|author=Bogdan Florin Popovici, director Romanian National Archives|title=Records In Contexts; Towards A New Level In Archival Description?|url=http://www.pokarh-mb.si/uploaded/datoteke/Radenci/radenci_2016/013-031_popovici_2016.pdf|date=2016|publisher=Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

The conceptual model was published for comment in 2016. Among the responses, some have shown confusion as to how it should be applied in practice. A consultation meeting of the [[Archives and Records Association]]'s Archives and Technology group expressed uncertainty over how the conceptual model should be interpreted by the profession, and how they would engage with and benefit from it in the future.&lt;ref name=ResultsperJB&gt;{{cite web|author=Jenny Bunn|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/about/community/groups/viewbulletin/59-results-of-the-ara-sat-consultation-on-records-in-contexts.html?groupid=21|title=Results of the ARA SAT consultation on Records in Contexts|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response, the [[Digital_preservation#InterPARES|InterPARES Trust]] state that a more inclusive development process should have been used given the potentially international application of the model, referring especially to the under-representation of Africa and Asia (acknowledged by EGAD in their introduction to the RiC-CM). Their response also questions the integration of the entire suite of current ICA descriptive standards without first gauging the extent to which these are currently implemented globally.

==OWL Ontology==

Although in the future EGAD will develop an OWL ontology called RiC-O to represent RiC-CM, there is already an ontology proposal based on the draft of the conceptual model&lt;ref&gt;Llanes-Padrón, D., Pastor-Sánchez, J.A.

'''''Rory Goes to Holyrood''''' is a 2013 satirical documentary presented by Scottish impressionist and comedian [[Rory Bremner]]. Aired by [[BBC Two Scotland]] on 13 June 2013, the hour-long programme takes a satirical look at [[Scottish politics]] and the [[Scottish independence|independence]] debate, two subjects that had largely seen an absence of humour up to that point. The film sees Bremner visit the [[Scottish Parliament]] and interview politicians and other senior public figures as he gets to grips with the issues of the Scottish political scene. Bremner recorded the programme after moving back to live in Scotland and realising he knew very little about the politics of that country.

==Background==

Details of the programme were announced by the BBC Media Centre in March 2013, with plans for it to be aired later in the year. Bremner had recently returned to live in Scotland after spending much of his life in England, and as part of the press release for the show, he gave some insight into his reasons for recording it. "Coming back to Scotland in the run-up to the Referendum, I realised I knew almost nothing about Scottish Politics. Time I did. And why is there so little political comedy in Scotland outside the Parliament? Time to make sense (and nonsense) of it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/rory-goes-to-holyrood.html |work=BBC Media Centre |title=Rory Bremner puts Scottish politics under satirical spotlight |publisher=BBC |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 also saw Bremner defend fellow comedian [[Susan Calman]], whose attempt to satirise the referendum debate on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The News Quiz]]'' led to her receiving death threats on social media from [[Cybernat|users]] who had been offended by her comments.&lt;ref name=Record-2013-06-10&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=English |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scots-comic-rory-bremner-says-1944212 |title=Scots comic Rory Bremner says most voters don't know who to vote for |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Daily Record |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; Bremner himself spoke of a strong reaction to the announcement of his show, telling ''[[The Scotsman]]'' in June 2013 "I didn't get it to the extent that Susan Calman did, but the strength of feeling surprised me."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudden |first=Liam |url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/tv-radio/rory-bremner-talks-scottish-politics-in-rory-goes-to-holyrood-1-2963333 |title=Rory Bremner talks Scottish politics in Rory Goes To Holyrood |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that from a comedy perspective, there are people who "think [First Minister] Alex Salmond should be off limits, even though Alex Salmond himself has a very good sense of humour and understands that political comedians are part of a healthy democracy."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; ''The Scotsman'' later noted that "many observers have complained of a lack of satire in the mainstream media and lamented the fact even light-hearted attempts to lampoon the Scottish political scene have triggered an explosion of online bile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/tv-radio/scottish-independence-rory-bremner-in-comedy-call-1-3249299 |title=Scottish independence: Rory Bremner in comedy call |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme aired on BBC Two Scotland on 13 June 2013.&lt;ref name=Record-2013-06-10/&gt; Shortly before it was broadcast, Bremner said that recording it had left him undecided on the question of Scottish independence. "On the debate itself, I started the programme with an open mind and, funnily enough, ended it with a perhaps more open mind."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; He subsequently called for there to be more satire in the referendum debate. "There’s great humour to be had. There’s a lot of big, different characters involved and good arguments, and there are plenty of good Scottish comedians who can have plenty of fun with it. It’s far too dangerous to leave it only to the politically minded."

==Synopsis==

The programme follows Bremner{{mdash}}known for his impressions of UK politicians{{mdash}}as he searches for material to put together a show focusing on Scottish politics for the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], the first time he has tackled the subject. Speaking to politicians, journalists and other public figures, he seeks to get to grips with Scotland's political scene, as well as the issues surrounding the independence debate, also assembling a team of his fellow comedians to help. The group, including [[Andy Zaltzman]], Julia Sutherland and Paul Sneddon, discusses potential material with Bremner, and identifies characteristics and topics that could be used in a stand-up routine. Sheldon says that one of the problems with putting together such a show is that many people cannot identify the key figures at Holyrood, something highlighted by Bremner himself during a street survey in which he asks members of the public to name Scotland's politicians.

Undaunted by the lack of public recognition of those he intends to lampoon, Bremner works on his material, listening to recordings of [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] and other politicians as he drives between appointments. He is given a tour of the [[Scottish Parliament Building]] by MSP [[Joan McAlpine]] and watches a session of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. He also travels to Westminster to interview [[Ian Davidson (British politician)|Ian Davidson]], chair of the [[Scottish Affairs Select Committee]]. The documentary ends with Brember presenting a one-off stand-up routine at Edinburgh's [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]].

The '''Royal [[Barbados]] Police Force''' (RBPF), as established under the [[Police Act]], of 1961(a), and the [[Constitution of Barbados]] is a part of the [[Government of Barbados|government]] responsible for local [[Code enforcement|law enforcement]]. Tyrone Griffith is currently [[Commissioner of Police|Commissioner of the Police]]. The RBPF is divided into three [[Police division|territorial divisions]], the Operations Support Division, the Administrative Support Division and the Criminal Investigations Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbadospolice.gov.bb/_sec.cfm?category=Operations Royal Barbados Police Force: Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126081221/http://www.barbadospolice.gov.bb/_sec.cfm?category=Operations |date=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation structure of the RBPF is modelled after [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]].

In recent years, a growing number of Barbadian police officers have been recruited to take up jobs in the [[Bermuda Police Service]].

== History ==
The main Police Force of Barbados was established in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCarrington|Carrington]], p.153&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after its founding the Police Force informally had [[mounted police]]men, however in 1880 an actual mounted division was recognised and known as the Mounted Corps. (later renamed the Mounted Branch in 1933.) In 1882, the Harbour Police Force was unified with the main land division after it had been established separately in 1867. Roughly 100 years later in the 1980s the Harbour Police unit was dissolved entirely.

The prefix "Royal" was added to the title of the Police Force in February 1966 due to a visit by the [[Monarchy of Barbados|Queen]]. Since that time, "Royal" has remained as part of the name and identity of the force.

In 1981, the RBPF became an full member of the [[International Criminal Police Organisation]] (Interpol).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Americas/Barbados Barbados: Royal Barbados Police Force], [[Interpol]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The headquarters for the RBPF is in the former Barclays Bank Complex on Lower Roebuck Street, Bridgetown, Saint Michael.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationnews.com/story/314490532327114.php Police offices moving to Roebuck St.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters houses the Commissioner of Police; the Deputy Commissioner of Police; the offices of all assistant commissioners of police; all staff officers of the above commissioners; the secretary to the Commissioner of Police; the Research and Development Department; the Police Registry; and the Office of Compliance.

The Illyrian '''Tombs of Selca e Poshtme''' ({{sq|Varret e Selcës së Poshtme}}) are located near the town of [[Pogradec]] in [[Albania]] near the village of ''Selcë e Poshtme''. On the right bank of the river Shkumbin at an elevation of 1040&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, lie the remains of the ancient city of [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and the accompanying necropolis. The Roman [[Via Egnatia]] led past it towards [[Thessaloniki]]. Though there are traces of human activity in Neolithic times, the settlement proper dates to the Iron Age (Illyrian proto-urban) through to the Illyrian urban period (5th to 2nd centuries BC),&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its height under settlement by the Illyrian tribe of [[Enchele]] in the later Iron Age and was also occupied in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period as traces of a municipal building show. From the 4th to 1st centuries BC the city was the royal residence of Illyrian kings and therefore, also probably an important political and economic centre.&lt;ref name="Elsie2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA405|date=19 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7380-3|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Albania]] included the Royal tombs of Selca e Poshtme in the [[UNESCO]] World heritage list of proposals.

==The settlement==
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Village.jpg|thumb|250px|Selcë e Poshtme]]
From 1969 to 1972 excavations were conducted by the Albanian archaeologist [[Neritan Ceka]].&lt;ref name="Gloyer2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Gloyer|title=Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCAt8ghUEzAC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-387-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Ceka, the settlement has five phases of occupation. Selcë I to III are divided into: late Neolithic, early [[Bronze Age]] and Late Bronze Age, all represented by different ceramic forms. The settlement was continuously inhabited from the Bronze Age into the Iron Age. During the 6th to 5th centuries BC the settlement developed as a proto-urban center on the road that ran along the river Shkumbin connecting the coast of Albania to Macedonia. From the Iron Age there is a permanent settlement at the site.
Around 570 BC/550 BC we arrive at the phase of Selcë IV, evidenced by traces of burnt dwellings, pottery, including imports from Corinth in the lower horizon, and some Ionian wares. In the upper horizon, local, red-brown painted pottery, wheel made pottery with two handles and Ionic and Attic products were found. The local potters copied Greek models and were also influenced by their style. During the 4th century the acropolis was fortified by an encircling wall of well-cut stone. The city occupied an area of 30,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the 4th and 3rd centuries BC Selca was an important trading centre and was the administrative centre of the Illyrian region of the Dassaretae. Terraces were created in order to develop the settlement across the hilly terrain. In the 3rd century monumental tombs were cut into the rock around the acropolis, some with Ionic columns. One of these tombs was reused at the end of the 2nd century and a wide array of finds were discovered therein, including weapons, bronze vessels, ceramics and gold jewellery. 
The construction of the Via Egnatia, which bypassed the city, led to its decline. During the 4th century AD Selca, as a military and administrative centre, was re-fortified with stone walls bound with mortar. Houses were constructed from reused Roman and Illyrian masonry. On the basis of coin finds two elements phases of construction can be determined. The first from the time of [[Valentinian I]] (364-375), the second from the time of Justinian I (518 - 565) to the years 547/548. The city was of economic and political importance before being conquered by the [[Slavs]] who destroyed the last remains of the Illyrian city.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/909/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tombs==
The royal tombs are located under the Acropolis, carved into the rock, and created during the reign of the Illyrian kings (4th to 3rd centuries BC)

===Tomb I - Rock chamber burial with Ionic order (4th to 3rd centuries BC) ===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb1.jpg|thumb|150px|Tomb I]]
Tomb I consists of a rectangular burial chamber with an antechamber or forecourt. A [[barrel vault]] covers the burial chamber, whose height is 2.10m. Outside the door there is a rain gutter and mortises. The facade of the tomb has a colonnade of Doric pilasters with capitals resembling the [[Ionic order]] decorate the facade on which traces of painting can still be seen, with an entablature above. The doorway is substantial. In the burial chamber, there are two rock-cut couches, one against the side wall and the other against the rear wall. This tomb is oriented towards the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] monumental tomb from the second half of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Outline of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZS4AAAAIAAJ|year=1978|publisher=8 Nentori Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb II - Theatre burial (mid-3rd century BC)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb2.jpg|thumb|Tomb II]]
Tomb II has two elements: below is a rectangular burial chamber with stairs leading down. It would originally have been sealed with stone slabs. Above there is a theatre-like complex with two stepped rows of seats that could have served for any rituals or family visits to do with the deceased.

===Tomb III - Central burial (mid-3rd century BC) ===
This tomb is on two levels. The upper level is a rock cut exedra as an Ionic hemicycle, with eight pilasters whose capitals were made separately flanking the entrance. To the left there is a niche with a relief engraved with a Bucranium and a helmet of the Pergamene type. To the right is a relief of an Illyrian-Macedonian [[shield]]. The floor of the tomb had a mosaic, but nothing of this remains. The door, which would have been sealed, leads to a narrow chamber. Gilkes&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, 2012, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; considers that this chamber may have been abandoned due to the irregularity of the rock, and that the chamber below may have been cut as a result. A fault in the rock, and rough pick marks, are visible. 
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb3_ApparentGrave.jpg|thumb|Tomb III]]
The second chamber has a high barrel vault and contained two beautifully carved sarcophagi in the form of couches. 10 burials were recovered from this chamber, some in the sarcophagi and others in the floor. A second burial period is attested. These date to the last decades of the 3rd century and produced many grave goods, now on display in Tirana. Some scholars believe that this may have been the tomb of a royal family or dynasty. Among the grave goods are golden earrings, necklaces, pins, rings, all of the [[Hellenistic]] type, belt fittings, iron, a silver ornament depicting a battle scene, armour, spear points and 30 ceramic vessels.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eggebrecht: ''Albanien, Schätze aus dem Land der Skipetaren. Ausstellungskatalog'', Mainz 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb IV (second half of the 3rd century BC)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb4_Facade2.jpg|thumb|Part of the facade of Tomb IV]]
Tomb IV has a 5&amp;nbsp;m high facade with two separately carved Ionic columns and the entablature and tympanum of a temple. It is the most monumental of all. The facade is no longer in situ, though some parts can be seen on the ground. There was originally a double leaved stone door. The slots in the threshold are clearly visible. The burial chamber roofed is carved into a barrel vault and was originally covered in painted plaster. The chamber contains a single [[sarcophagus]] of stone slabs, which was robbed in antiquity. The grave dates from the second half of the 3rd century BC. Seven niches are carved into the rock of the long facade, partially covered with inscriptions that could have been made by the builder or the work supervisor, according to archaeologists. They date from the 1st century BC&lt;ref&gt;Neritan Ceka: ''Qyteti ilir; Prane Selces se Poshtme'', Tirana 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Frommer: ''Illyrer'', in: H. Ament (Hrsg.): ''Frühe Völker Europas'', Leipzig-Mannheim 1997, 16 – 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb V (late 3rd century)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb5.jpg|thumb|180px|Tomb V]]
The last tomb has the shape of a Macedonian built tomb and consists of an antechamber and the actual burial chamber, both covered and built in ashlar construction. A stone slab with relief serves as a false door to the grave chamber. In the chamber itself are the remains of three sarcophagi in the form of ''[[klinai]]'', built of upright stone blocks. They were used primarily for body burials. Later, urns and grave goods were laid in the sarcophagus. The tomb was robbed in antiquity.

'''Servantes''' are [[Theatrical property|theatrical properties or "props"]] used by [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]]. Their purpose is to assist the magician to misdirect the audience.  An example of a "prop" is a simple bag or pouch hanging from the magician's belt or a small platform placed out of sight of onlookers (behind a magician's table).  Some magicians keep their props in plain sight; a ring may be used to keep the pouch open.   

Common items stored in the servante are playing cards, cups, or balls. Other magicians keep their servantes concealed to enhance the illusion.

[[File:Shakespeare and His Contemporaries.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|''Shakespeare and His Friends at the Mermaid Tavern'' (1850, oil on canvas) by [[John Faed]]. The painting depicts (from left in back) [[Joshua Sylvester]], [[John Selden]], [[Francis Beaumont]], (seated at table from left) [[William Camden]], [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Donne]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|the Earl of Southampton]], [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], and [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]].]]

'''[[William Shakespeare]]'s style of writing''' was borrowed from the conventions of the day and adapted to his needs.

==Overview==
William Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=150}} The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate [[metaphor]]s and [[conceit]]s, and the language is often [[rhetoric]]al—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. For example, the grand speeches in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, and the verse in ''The'' ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' has been described as stilted.{{sfn|Frye|2005|pp=105, 177}}{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=29}}

Soon, however, William  Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening [[soliloquy]] of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' has its roots in the self-declaration of [[the Vice|Vice]] in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.{{sfn|Brooke|2004|p=69}}{{sfn|Bradbrook|2004|p=195}} No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=63}} By the time of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

Shakespeare's standard poetic form was [[blank verse]], composed in [[iambic pentameter]] with clever use of puns and [[imagery]]. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the [[End-stopping|end of lines]], with the risk of monotony.{{sfn|Frye|2005|p=185}} Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=868}}

{{quote
|character = [[Prince Hamlet]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Hamlet]]''
|source = 5.2.4–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 5.2.4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—
And prais'd be rashness for it—let us know
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well…
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

After ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic [[A. C. Bradley]] described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".{{sfn|Bradley|1991|p=91}} In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included [[enjambment|run-on lines]], irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=42–6}} In ''[[Macbeth]]'', for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another in one of [[Lady Macbeth|Lady Macbeth's]] well-known speeches:

{{quote
|character = [[Lady Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = I.VII.35–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.35–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
{{spaces|24}}Was the hope drunk,
Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely?
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Pity by William Blake 1795.jpg|thumb|''[[Pity (William Blake)|Pity]]'' (1795) by [[William Blake]], is an illustration of two similes in ''Macbeth'': "And Pity, like a naked new-born babe, / Striding the blast, or heaven's Cherubins, hors'd / Upon the sightless couriers of the air,".&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
And in [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth's]] preceding speech:

{{quote
|character = [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = I.VII.21–3.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
And Pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's Cherubins, hors'd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The audience is challenged to complete the sense.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=42–6}} The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=36, 39}}{{sfn|Keast|2004|p=75}}

Shakespeare's poetic genius was allied with a practical sense of the theatre.{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|p=4}} Like all playwrights of the time, Shakespeare dramatised stories from sources such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Holinshed]].{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|pp=1–4}} He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|pp=1–7, 15}} As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In his [[Shakespeare's late romances|late romances]], he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|2004|p=13}}{{sfn|Meagher|2003|p=358}}

==Form==
In some of Shakespeare's early works, punctuation at the end of the lines strengthen the rhythm. He and other dramatists at the time used this form of [[blank verse]] for much of the dialogue between characters to elevate the poetry of drama.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=64–8}} To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming [[couplet]], thus creating suspense.{{sfn|Boulton|2014|pp=78–9}} A typical example occurs in ''[[Macbeth]]'' as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan:

{{quote
|character = [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = II.I.62–4.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' II.I.62–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
[''A bell rings.''
{{spaces|4}}I go, and it is done: the bell invites me.
{{spaces|4}}Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
{{spaces|4}}That summons thee to Heaven, or to Hell.{{spaces|4}}[''Exit.''
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

His plays make effective use of the [[soliloquy]], in which a character makes a solitary speech, giving the audience insight to the character's motivations and inner conflict.{{sfn|Clemen|1987|p=11}} The character either speaks to the audience directly (in the case of choruses, or characters that become epilogues), or more commonly, speaks to himself or herself in the fictional realm.{{sfn|Maurer|2005|p=504}} Shakespeare's writing features extensive wordplay of [[double entendres]] and clever rhetorical flourishes.{{sfn|Mahood|1988|p=9}} Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays. His works have been considered controversial through the centuries for his use of [[Ribaldry|bawdy]] punning,{{sfn|Partridge|1947|p=xi}} to the extent that "virtually every play is shot through with sexual puns."{{sfn|Wells|2004|p=1}} Indeed, in the nineteenth century, popular censored versions of the plays were produced as ''The Family Shakspeare'' {{sic}} by Henrietta Bowdler (writing anonymously) and later by her brother [[Thomas Bowdler]].{{sfn|Wells|2004|pp=19–20}} Comedy is not confined to Shakespeare's comedies, and is a core element of many of the tragedy and history plays. For example, comic scenes dominate over historical material in [[Henry IV, Part 1]].{{sfn|Kastan|2002|p=14}}

==Similarities to contemporaries==
Besides following the popular forms of his day, Shakespeare's general style is comparable to several of his contemporaries.  His works have many similarities to the writing of [[Christopher Marlowe]], and seem to reveal strong influences from the [[Queen's Men]]'s performances, especially in his history plays.  His style is also comparable to [[Francis Beaumont]]'s and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s, other playwrights of the time.{{sfn|Holland|2013}}

Shakespeare often borrowed plots from other plays and stories.  ''[[Hamlet]]'', for example, is comparable to [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985}} ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' is thought to be based on [[Arthur Brooke (poet)|Arthur Brooke]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]''.{{sfn|Roberts|1902}} ''[[King Lear]]'' is based on the story of [[King Leir]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], which was retold in 1587 by [[Raphael Holinshed]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997}} Borrowing plots in this way was not uncommon at the time.  After Shakespeare's death, playwrights quickly began borrowing from his works, a tradition that continues to this day.{{sfn|Holland|2013}}

==Differences from contemporaries==
Shakespeare's works express the complete range of human experience.{{sfn|Reich|Cunningham|Fichner-Rathus|2013|p=354}} His [[characterisation|characters]] were human beings{{sfn|Webster|2012|p=194}} who commanded the sympathy of audiences when many other playwrights' characters were [[Fictional character#Round vs. flat|flat]] or [[archetypes]].{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=503}}{{sfn|Leggatt|1983|p=121}} Macbeth, for example, commits six murders by the end of the fourth act, and is responsible for many deaths offstage, yet still commands an audience's sympathy until the very end{{sfn|Collins|1989|p=91}} because he is seen as a flawed human being, not a monster.{{sfn|McCarthy|1998|pp=234–40}} [[Hamlet]] knows that he must avenge the death of his father, but he is too indecisive, too self-doubting, to carry this out until he has no choice.{{sfn|Berryman|2001|pp=114–16}} His failings cause his downfall, and he exhibits some of the most basic human reactions and emotions. Shakespeare's characters were complex and human in nature. By making the protagonist's [[Characterization#Character development|character development]] central to the plot, Shakespeare changed what could be accomplished with drama.{{sfn|Frye|2005|p=118}}

[[File:Jumprope navy.jpg|thumb|Several simultaneous skippers, jumping a single rope]]

A '''skipping rope''' ([[British English]]) or '''jump rope''' ([[American English]]) is a tool used in the sport of skipping/jump rope where one or more participants jump over a [[rope]] swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of skipping/jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed ([[Double Dutch (jump rope)|double dutch]]), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by sex and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.

==Skipping rope techniques==
There are many techniques which can be used when skipping. These can be used individually, or combined in a series, to create a routine.

=== Solo participants ===
==== Basic jump or easy jump ====
[[File:US Navy 101004-N-6427M-149 Airman David Hall, from Buffalo, N.Y., jumps rope during a training session in the hangar bay aboard the aircraft carrie.jpg|thumb|left|Basic jump technique]]
Jump with both feet slightly apart over the rope. Beginners usually master this technique first before moving onto more advanced techniques.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Alternate foot jump (speed step) ====
[[File:US Navy 101101-N-2821G-032 Rear Adm. Mark D. Guadagnini, commander of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, leads a.jpg|thumb|left|Alternate foot jump technique]]
Use alternate feet to jump off the ground. This technique can be used to effectively double the number of jumps per minute as compared to the above technique. This step can be used for speed events.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Criss-cross ====
[[File:Jumping Rope Criss-cross.jpg|thumb|left|Criss-cross technique]]
Also known as crossover or cross arms. Perform the basic jump whilst crossing arms in front of the body.

==== Side Swing ====
The rope is passed by the side of the participant's body, without jumping it.

==== EB (front-back cross or sailor) ====
Perform the criss-cross whilst crossing one arm behind the back.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Double under ====
A high basic jump, turning the rope twice under the feet. Turning the rope three times is called a '''triple under'''. In competitions, participants may attempt quadruple (quads) and quintuple unders (quins) using the same method.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Toad ====
Perform the criss-cross with one arm crossing under the opposite leg from the inside.

==== Leg over / Crougar ====
[[File:Peter Nestler - Jump-roping around the world.jpg|thumb|left|Leg over technique]]
A basic jump with one arm hooked under the adjacent leg.

==== Awesome Annie ====
Also known as Awesome Anna or swish. Alternates between a leg over and a toad without a jump in between.

==== Inverse toad ====
Perform the toad whilst one arm crosses the adjacent leg from the outside.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Elephant ====
A cross between the inverse toad and the toad, with both arms crossing under one leg.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== Frog or Donkey kick ====
The participant does a [[handstand]], returns to their feet and turns the rope under them. A more advanced version turns the rope during the return to the ground.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==== TJ ====
A triple-under where the first 'jump' is a side swing, middle jump is a toad, and the final jump in an open.

=== Competition techniques ===

In competitions, participants are required to demonstrate competence using specific techniques. The selection required depend on the judging system and country in which the tournament is held.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Health effects==

===Skipping as exercise===
Skipping may be used as a [[cardiovascular]] workout, similar to [[jogging]] or [[cycling|bicycle riding]], and has a high [[Metabolic equivalent|MET]] or [[Exercise intensity#Intensity Levels|intensity level]]. This [[aerobic exercise]] can achieve a "burn rate" of up to 700 to over 1200 [[calorie]]s per hour of vigorous activity, with about 0.1 to nearly 1.1 calories consumed per jump mainly depending upon the speed and intensity of jumps and leg foldings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Ten minutes of skipping is roughly the equivalent of running an eight-minute mile. Skipping for 15–20 minutes is enough to burn off the calories from a candy bar and is equivalent to 45–60 minutes of running depending upon the intensity of jumps and leg swings.
Many professional trainers, fitness experts and professional fighters greatly recommend skipping for burning fat over any other alternative exercises like running and jogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/skip-rope-not-your-workout|title=Jumping rope is cheap, portable, and burns more calories than you might think |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2007-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weighted skipping ropes are available for such athletes to increase the difficulty and effectiveness of such exercise. Individuals or groups can participate in the exercise, and learning proper techniques is relatively simple compared to many other athletic activities. The exercise is also appropriate for a wide range of ages and fitness levels.

==Competition==

===International===
There are two main world organisations: International Rope Skipping Federation (FISAC-IRSF), and the World Jump Rope Federation (WJRF). There have been 11 World Championships (FISAC), with the most recent held in [[Malmö]], Sweden. There have been 7 World Jump Rope Championships (WJRF); the most recent taking place in Orlando, Florida. Other locations of this championship include Washington DC, France, and Portugal.

===World Inter School===
The first [[World Inter School Rope Skipping Organisation|World Inter School Rope Skipping Championship]] was held at Dubai, November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3354027/Chinese-pupil-completes-108-skips-30-seconds-international-contest-Dubai.html | title = Seven skips a SECOND! Astonishing video shows Chinese pupil jumping rope faster than you can count }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second World Inter School Rope Skipping Championship was held at Eger, Hungary.

===United States===
Historically in the [[United States]] there were two competing jump rope organizations: the [[International Rope Skipping Organization]] (IRSO), and the [[World Rope Skipping Federation]] (WRSF). IRSO focused on [[stunt]]-oriented and gymnastic/athletic type moves, while the WRSF appreciated the [[aesthetics]] and form of the exercise. In 1995 these two organizations merged to form the United States Amateur Jump Rope Federation (now, [http://www.usajumprope.org USA Jump Rope]). [http://www.usajumprope.org USA Jump Rope] hosts annual national tournaments, as well as camps, workshops, and clinics on instruction. Jump rope is also part of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] and participates in their annual [[AAU Junior Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=Jumphighersite&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumphighersite.org |url=http://jumphighersite.org/the-benefits-of-jump-rope/ |accessdate=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAUJumpRope&gt;{{cite web |title=AAU Jump Rope Home |url=http://www.aaujumprope.org/ |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SleepersOfMars.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;Cover art by [[Chris Foss]]]]

'''''Sleepers of Mars''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-17326-2}}) is a collection of early short stories by [[John Wyndham]], published after his death, in 1973 by [[Coronet Books]].

The collection includes:

*"Sleepers of Mars" (1939), a sequel to the novel ''[[Stowaway to Mars]]'', in which a Russian expedition finds the remains of Martian civilisation.
*"Worlds to Barter" (1931), telling of the descendants of the human race travelling back in time to take over the current Earth.
*"Invisible Monster" (1933), featuring an invisible alien on the loose after the return of a space expedition. 
*"The Man from Earth" (1934), in which a human sent on a mission to Venus wakes up in the far future as the last human alive.
*"The Third Vibrator" (1933), a cautionary tale in which the inventor of a super-weapon has a vision of how it previously destroyed [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].

==Summary==
At the end of the previous novel ''[[Stowaway to Mars]]'' the British [[spaceship]], the ''Gloria Mundi'' departed [[Mars]], expecting the [[USSR]] ship to leave at the same time.  It did not.  In the Stowaway to Mars it is mentioned that while the British reached Earth safely, it was now several years later, and still there had been no sign of the Soviet vessel.  This story tells their fate.

While on the planet in the previous story, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and British crews had explored part of Mars around their landing sites, discovering [[Life on Mars|vegetation plant life]], in the form of scrubby bushes growing along the banks of [[Martian canal|ancient canal works]], with sluggish water still in them.  The planet also hosted [[AI]] [[robot]]s, hostile to the visitors from [[Earth]].  They seemed almost wild, feral machines living without control of organic life.  Due to fatal encounters with these robots, and ill planned gunfight with the British crew, the Soviets now number four crewmen.   Preparing to depart for Earth they discuss the fate of their mission - originally a race between the nations of Earth to be the first to reach Mars.  The British and the ''Gloria Mundi'' had won the race, reach Mars before the Soviets and United States (whose rocket had crashed with no survivors upon reaching Mars).   The Russians speculate what would be the global reaction if the ''Gloria Mundi'' reaches Earth, and then the Soviets return, and claim that they were the first to land on Mars, not the British.  They conclude that they would not be believed.  However, they reason that if they succeed in racing the British home, then they can claim that the USSR was the first to conquer the Red Planet, and the British will be disbelieved.

Both spaceships prepare to take off, with the Russians planning to boost their engines to achieve greater velocity than the smaller British craft.  Upon take off, however, the Soviet ship suffers a malfunction, crash-landing back upon Mars.  Although the ship is relatively undamaged and the four crew survive the impact, the ship has landed on its side and they lack the means to right it for take off.  Even worse, they have no more fuel for a second attempt.

Stranded on Mars, their wrecked ship surrounded by the hostile [[robot]]s, the Russians are saved by the arrival of more advanced and powerful robots, commanded by a [[Martian]].  [[Humanoid]] in appearance, he is one of the same Martians encountered by the British party (but not by the Soviets) in the previous story.  His machines drive off the feral AIs, and allows the Russians to leave their ship.   Using advanced technology, the Martian is able to modify the mind of one of their crew so that they can communicate.

The Martian offers to provide the Soviet crew safety in one of their [[domed city|enclosed cities]] while they decide what to do with them.  Faced with few options the Russians agree.  They are taken by the advanced robots to a nearby Martian city.  They find it to be in good working order, fully automated, with dwellings suitable for their needs.  There are no people living there however.  Given an apartment within the city the Martian communicates with them via video screen from another settlement.  Talking via the crew member they modified, the Martian explains to the Soviets how the Martians are a dying race, as is their world.  Once fertile and full of life, Mars long ago ran short of water.  As its rivers dried up, so its life died with it.  There was even an attempt to melt the [[Martian polar ice caps|icecaps]] in an attempt to provide more water.  While this worked for a time, eventually even this water was used up, only holding off the inevitable for a few generations and the planet continued to decline.  The Martian tells that his people are now few in number, and expect that they will eventually become [[extinct]].  Asked to explain the robots, the Soviets are told how the Martians experimented with forms of artificial intelligence, and consider the robots to be their successors and evolutionary children.  The rogue AIs encountered earlier in the novel were early attempts, and they now live beyond control of the Martians.  The more advanced robots obey their commands, and perform such tasks as are required in the city.

The Martian is eager for the earthmen to leave his world, and expresses a willingness to aid them.  He tells the Russians that they can remain as guests in the city while he will instruct the robots to repair their ship and refuel it for the voyage back to Earth.  Due to their earlier encounter with the British, the Martian is confident that the city can produce both atmosphere and food suitable for the humans.  While they wait for the repairs to be completed, the Soviets explore the abandoned city.  They discover several interesting machines and devices, and their engineer believes that he can take several examples of advanced technology back to Earth that will give their country an advantage over the capitalist nations in the [[Cold War]].  The chance to learn of the Martian [[civilisation]] far eclipses losing the race back to Earth (the ''Gloria Mundi'' will by now have had such a head-start that catching them up will be impossible).

After several days of exploring, two of the crew discover a huge vault deep beneath the city.  Inside are countless fluid-filled capsules containing apparently dead Martians.  Opening one, they are shocked to discover that the occupant is alive, but the Martian female dies swiftly upon the opening of the container, likely due to trauma caused by incorrect revival.  Realising that all the capsules contain living Martians in some form of [[suspended animation]], the ship's doctor attempts to revive a second one.  This time the Russians take the precaution of bringing the capsule to their quarters and preparing medical equipment before they try to awaken the second Martian.

Their efforts are successful, and the sleeper awakes, surviving the process.  Once recovered he is able to talk with the modified Russian, and discuss his past.  It seems that he was once part of a larger Martian population living many hundreds of years ago, at the time when the world was drying up.  At the time the best hope for their civilisation was seen as the Project to Melt the Ice Caps.  This great work would take many years to achieve, and with the aid of the robot workforce, only need a few Martians to supervise the project.  To conserve water and resources, the vast majority of the population agreed to go into suspended animation for the decades it would take.  They would be woken years later by the descendants of those who remained to direct the project, once the world was fertile once more.  He is shocked to see the world at it is now - far worse and more barren than in his day.  It appears that he and the other sleepers have been left to hibernate for far longer than originally envisaged.

The Soviet crew discuss the implications of this, speculating what happened.  They conclude that while the early generations of Martians entered into the plan with good intentions, the later generations who had melted the poles, reneged on their ancestors' agreement.  They had seen no reason to awaken these sleeping people, when they had done all the work, and could keep all the benefits for themselves.  Now the world had dried up once more, and the sleepers would be left forever in the silent cities.  The Russians are worried by this revelation, and also by the reaction of the Martian they woke.  Angry at the betrayal of him, his wife and all his people he blames the current rulers of Mars.  He claims that he can also order the robots, and will have revenge upon those who kept him dormant for so long.

The Earthmen argue about what course of action they should take. They debate warning the current Martians, given that their return to Earth depends on their goodwill, compared to the injustice suffered by the sleepers.  Also if it will do any good at all, and if it is not best to pretend nothing happened.  Eventually they prevail upon the modified crewman to use the video link to contact the main Martian settlement and warn them.  He does so, causing their host to become displeased.  The Russian assures his fellows that the ruling Martian was not too concerned, and that the robots have since been modified and that the sleepers can be stopped.  Also their ship is now ready for launch, and they can depart the planet.

As they prepare to leave the city, the doctor confronts the modified crewman, revealing that he knows that he lied to them, and did not actually warn the ruling Martians.  As they argue they spot more Martian sleepers now awake in the city, some armed, using machines to awaken others.  It appears that their Martian friend has awoken other sleepers and is preparing to attack the ruling Martians.  Before the four men can react, the sleeper they woke bursts into their quarters, and in an angry rage uses a [[raygun]] to kill the doctor.  He is shot dead by the remaining Russians. They conclude that he had gone into hibernation beside his wife, and that she must have been the first sleeper they tried to awake and inadvertently killed.  While arguing what to do, the Soviets notice from the window that sleepers are attempting to board their spaceship, now fuelled and ready for launch.

As two of the remaining crew race to the landing site to try and stop them, the last Soviet remains behind in the city.  He watches as his comrades are unable to prevent several of the sleepers entering their ship and sealing the hatch.  They are still on the boarding ladder when the ignition sequence is triggered and the ship blasts off, killing two Russians.   The last Russian considers his options, locates the Martian's ray-gun and uses it to kill himself.

The ultimate fate of the Martian civilisation is unknown, nor the final landing site of the Russian ship, which could have carried a crew of Martians to a remote corner of Earth.

In Aronoff &amp; Oehrle (eds.) Language Sound Structure: Studies in Phonology. Cambridge: MIT Press. 107-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clements1990"&gt;Clements, G. N. (1990).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 283-333.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[phonotactic]] principle that aims to outline the structure of a [[syllable]] in terms of [[sonority hierarchy|sonority]].

The SSP states that the [[syllable nucleus]] (syllable center), often a [[vowel]], constitutes a sonority peak that is preceded and/or followed by a sequence of segments – [[consonants]] – with progressively decreasing sonority values (i.e., the sonority has to fall toward both edges of the syllable). The sonority values of segments are determined by a [[sonority hierarchy]].

A good example for the SSP in [[English language|English]] is the one-syllable word ''"trust"'': The first consonant in the [[syllable onset]] is ''t'', which is a [[stop consonant|stop]], the lowest on the sonority scale; next is ''r'', a [[liquid consonant|liquid]] which is more sonorous, then we have the vowel ''u'' {{IPAc-en|ʌ}} – the sonority peak; next, in the [[syllable coda]], is ''s'', a [[fricative]], and last is another stop, ''t''. The SSP explains why, for example, "trend" is a valid English word but *"rtedn" (flipping the order of consonants) is not.

Some languages possess syllables that violate the SSP ([[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Arabic]], for example) while other languages strictly adhere to it, even requiring larger intervals on the sonority scale: In [[Italian language|Italian]] for example, a syllable-initial stop must be followed by either a liquid, a [[semivowel|glide]] or a vowel, but not by a fricative (except: [ps] borrowed words like: pseudonimo, psicologia). Some languages allow a sonority "plateau"; that is, two adjacent [[tautosyllabic]] consonants with the same sonority level. [[Modern Hebrew]] is an example of such language.

A number of unrelated languages {{Specify|reason=Both examples are Indo-European}} that typically follow the SSP will violate it with /s/ + stop [[consonant cluster|clusters]]. For example, in the English word "string" or Italian "spago" the more sonorous /s/ comes before a less sonorous sound in the onset. In native English words, no phoneme other than /s/ ever violates the SSP. Latin also was able to violate the principle in this way -- however the Vulgar Latin dialects that evolved into the [[Western Romance languages]] lost this ability, causing the process of ''I-[[prosthesis (linguistics)|prosthesis]]'' to occur, whereby an /i/ was inserted at the beginning of such a word, to make the /s/ instead a coda consonant rather than an onset consonant. As a result, a Western Romance language like Spanish will have "espada" where a non-Western Romance language like Italian has something akin to "spada".

The '''Stele of Aristion''' dates from around 510 BCE. It was created by sculptor [[Aristocles (sculptors)|Aristokles]] out of [[pentelic marble]] and shows traces of [[polychrome]].

==Description==
The Stele of Aristion or the Marathon Stele is a funerary stele in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] (NAMA, inventory number 29) which dates from around 510 B.C. The work is among the best sculptures from late Archaic Greece. It is made of [[Pentelic marble]] and measures 2.02 m high. The stele was found with its base, which is 0.24 m high. The uppermost portion of the head and helmet is missing. At the top of the base is an [[inscription]], giving the name of the deceased in the [[genitive]]:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' (IG) I³ [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=1425&amp;bookid=4&amp;region=1&amp;subregion=71 1256]; [http://www.davidgill.co.uk/attica/nm29_base.htm Image of the inscription].&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|grc|Ἀριστίονος}} "Aristion's". Aristion is depicted as a bearded [[hoplite]] soldier in profile, facing right.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museum.classics.cam.ac.uk/collections/casts/grave-stele-aristion|title=Grave Stele of Aristion {{!}} Museum of Classical Archaeology Databases|website=museum.classics.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wears a short, thin [[chiton]] under a [[corselet]]. This was originally decorated with painted designs: [[Meander (art)|meanders]], zig-zags, and a star on his shoulder. The rest of the statue was also extensively decorated with paint - traces of red, yellow, and blue paint still survive. Aristion also wears an [[Attic helmet]] and [[greave]]s. His right arm hangs at his side, his left hand holds a spear. Some details are especially well-worked, like the wavy beard, the hair, and the musculature of the arms, legs and chest. In the empty space under his feet there is a horizontal inscribed band, which names the sculptor of the stele: {{lang|grc|ἔργον Ἀριστοκλέος}} "Work of Aristokles".[[File:Rekonstruction Aristion warrior by Aristokles - Bunte Götter in Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Coloured reconstruction in the [[Gods in Color]] exhibition, [[Pergamonmuseum]] 2010]]

==Creation==
Sculptor [[Aristocles (sculptors)|Aristokles]] was known to have his signature on several bases, but his only famous work is [[Stele]] of Aristion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc32396/m1/1/med_res/|title=Digital Library|website=Digital Library|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commemorative funerary stele dates from the last quarter of the century, Aristokles adds his signature on each of his sculptures. His name then appears on an Attica inscription found at Hieraka, [https://itouchmap.com/?c=gr&amp;UF=-818078&amp;UN=-1200452&amp;DG=CAPE] Cape, Greece.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScssAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Sculptor+Aristokles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OltSe66jfd&amp;sig=OP49dmzrGfGTXuYD8-ASN8wUrFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-k92cw4vYAhVO82MKHYjNBcwQ6AEIUDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Sculptor%20Aristokles&amp;f=false|title=A History of Greek Sculpture: From the earliest times down to the age of Pheidias|last=Murray|first=Alexander Stuart|date=1880|publisher=J. Murray|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristokles subject is craved in low relief in profile. This 6th century Greek sculptor is very mysterious due to the lack of information about him.

==Polychrome==
Although the Stele is currently white, this would not have been the case of the [[Classical antiquity|Archaic period]] of [[Attica]]. It was not an uncommon practice to add [[polychrome]] as a decorative element of marble stele. The Stele of Aristion was originally decorated with painted designs: [[Meander (art)|meanders]], zig-zags, along with a star on his shoulder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are also remnants of red pigment located on the ground of the relief, on the end of the shoulder strap, and on the drapery. The amour of the soldier would have been a blue tint, and the hair would be that of a dark color.

==Purpose of funerary stelae==
Funerary [[Stele|stelae]] were placed on slabs of stone that would be used as boundary markers by the ancient governments of Greek and Rome.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-30|title=Stele|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stele&amp;oldid=807927142|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to mark where the property lines existed. The surface of the stele is mostly decorated with a text, ornamentation, or sometimes both.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The text written on the stele would be that of the name of the deceased along with the signature of the artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The main purpose of funerary stelae was to commemorate loved ones. During this time the Greek society made it important to show their family with respect and love by commissioning a grand funerary stele in their honor. People that were fortunate enough to afford funerary stelae were that of the elite society. This was another way to display one's wealth through funerary stelae and other funerary monuments. In  480-430 B.C., legal restrictions we placed on flamboyant displays.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The deceased depicted on the funerary stele of Aristion is depicted as a [[hoplite]] soldier in profile. Men were usually depicted according to their roles in society. Many of these roles shown through funerary stelae would usually be young, athletic, heroic, or bearded with a staff. It is a common theme for the deceased to be represented in a familiar surrounding, as a way to preserve the memory of the deceased. The way people are portrayed on funerary stelae is very much in an idealized way.  The importance of respecting and honoring the dead is a clear aspect in Greek life. Funerary stelae are similar to and influenced by the style from [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptians.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This connection between Egyptian culture and Greek culture is that they both value the importance of honoring a deceased loved one’s life. The similarities of the Egyptian style can be seen in the Stele of Aristion, shown by the low relief and the figure of the man in profile. Although, there are some similarities between these two ancient societies, they do not influence each other.  In Ancient Egypt the funerary stele was only that of pharaohs and officials of the pharaoh.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the Greeks put an importance on idealizing well-to-do citizens and people of authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5998">The '''Stokes interview''' is a secondary interview conducted on a couple who are trying to obtain an [[permanent residence (United States)|immigration green card]] in the United States on the basis of their marriage. It occurs when the immigration officer conducting the [[adjustment of status]] interview suspects that a couple's marital status is [[marriage fraud|fraudulent]]. The Stokes interview is offered as a second chance for the couple to prove their marriage's legitimacy. What separates the Stokes interview from the initial adjustment of status interview, which is usually the only interview necessary in the process, is that during the Stokes interview couples are interviewed separately instead of together. The two interviews are recorded and compared for discrepancies. Applicants have a right to have an attorney present throughout both separate interviews. The Stokes interview is also sometimes known as a marriage fraud interview.&lt;ref name="Stat im"&gt;{{cite web|title=What to expect at the Stokes Interview|url=http://www.statusimmigration.com/StokesInterview.html|website=www.Statusimigration.com|publisher=www.Statusimigration.com|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aspan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apsan|first1=Moses|title=THE MARRIAGE FRAUD INVESTIGATION  "The Stokes Interview"|url=http://www.apsanlaw.com/law-268.What-you-should-know-about-a-Marriage-Fraud-Interview-in-Immigration-Cases.html|website=Aspan Law Office|publisher=Moses Aspan|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Stokes interview originated from the Federal District court case of ''Stokes vs. the INS'' in 1975. Two U.S. citizens, Charles Cook and Bernard Stokes, who married citizens of Guyana filed a suit challenging the INS procedure for determining whether to grant preferential status on the ground that the two non-citizens were "immediate relative" of U.S. citizens. The couples had been married in civil ceremonies, each man filed a [[Form I-130]] petition for their wives listing them as "immediate relative". The result of this case was that when an immigration officer questions the legitimacy of a couple's marital status they may conduct a secondary interview for investigation. The applicant must be provided a written notice describing the rights of the parties involved. A second attachment of the rights must be provided with the appointment letter, as well as a list of the documents required to be submitted at the time of the interview.&lt;ref name="Findlaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=What to Expect at a Stokes Interview|url=http://immigration.findlaw.com/visas/what-to-expect-at-a-stokes-interview.html|website=Find Law|publisher=Find Law|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UM case"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stokes v. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service|url=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10164|website=www.clearinghouse.net|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stokes vs INS Memorandum|url=http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0026-0001.pdf|website=UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stokes interviews were originally conducted by the [[Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service]] (INS) until it was disbanded in 2003. Its responsibilities were assumed by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), responsibilities including, Permanent Residence or green cards, the processing of Form I-130s, Adjustment of status and Stokes interviews as well as many others.&lt;ref name="Our hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/our-history|website=USCIS|publisher=USCIS|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required documents==
The documents an applicant must provide at a Stokes interview are as follows:

* Photo identification of the citizen spouse
* Proof of the petitioner's citizenship
* Immigrant spouse's passport
* Marriage certificate
* Employment letters and the last two pay stubs
* Bank account information
* Rent receipts
* Tax returns
* Insurance policies
* Utility bills
* Photo albums
Many other documents may be requested by the immigration officer depending on the particular circumstances of the case.&lt;ref name="Findlaw" /&gt;

==Process==
During a Stokes interview a couple will be interviewed both together and separately.The process often takes several hours to complete. Each member of the couple will be asked many personal and intrusive questions about themselves and their spouse. The spouse will be asked the same questions separately. The two interviews will be recorded and compared for discrepancies. The couple may be allowed a chance to explain discrepancies should they occur. It is recommended that applicants answer the questions as honestly and truthfully as possible. If an applicant does not know the answer to a question or has forgotten, it is recommended that they say "I don't know" or "I don't remember" rather than attempting to make something up.&lt;ref name="Leg Ser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Immigration Marriage Interview What To Expect During Your Immigration Marriage Interview|url=http://legalservicesincorporated.com/the-immigration-marriage-interview-what-to-expect-during-your-immigration-marriage-interview/|website=Scott Legal|publisher=legal services incorporated|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that very few couples seeking the citizenship or status adjustment of a partner undergo the Stokes interview. Most couples applying for citizenship will only undergo the [[Adjustment of Status]] interview after filing their form [[Form I-130]] petition.&lt;ref name="Aspan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I-130"&gt;{{cite web|title=I-130, Petition for Alien Relative|url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-130|website=UCIS|publisher=USCIS|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ubbi dubbi''' is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] spoken with the [[English language]], and is a close relative of the language game '''Obbish'''.{{cn|date=November 2013}} It was popularized by the 1970s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television show ''[[Zoom (1972 TV series)|Zoom]]''.{{ref|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|section=Magazine|page=16|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-24|&lt;!--section=Part II--&gt;|quote=|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/05/01/mouthing_off/}} Variations to Ubbi Dubbi include Ob, Ib, Arpy Darpy, and  [[wiktionary:-izzle|Iz]].

==Rules==
Ubbi dubbi works by adding ''-ub-'' {{IPAc-en|ʌ|b}} before each vowel sound in a syllable.&lt;ref name=rogers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Stephen D.|title=A dictionary of made-up languages|date=2011|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, Mass.|isbn=1440530408|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fA5NhKLOxdYC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=ubbi+dubbi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2pJ_zmPHJAhWE7SYKHap1CcgQ6AEIOTAF|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A linguist would say "Insert [ˈʌb] after each syllable onset".)&lt;ref name=byrd&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrd|first1=Dani|last2=Mintz|first2=Toben H.|title=Discovering Speech, Words, and Mind|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=9781405157988|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHoY3t6AsywC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=ubbi+dubbi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2pJ_zmPHJAhWE7SYKHap1CcgQ6AEIMjAE|accessdate=23 December 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stress falls on the "ub" of the syllable that is stressed in the original word. So in "hello", which is stressed on the "he-" syllable, the stress falls on the "hub" in "hubellubo".

==Examples==
* Speak → ''spubeak'' &amp;nbsp;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|ʌ|b|iː|k}}
* Hello → ''hubellubo'' &amp;nbsp;{{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ʌ|b|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|b|oʊ}}
* Extra → ''ubextruba'' &amp;nbsp;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|b|ɛ|k|s|ˌ|t|r|ʌ|b|ə}}
* Hubba Bubba bubblegum → "Hububbuba Bububbuba bububblubegubum"
* Mississippi → ''Mubissubissubippubi''
* Ubbi Dubbi → ''Ububbubi Dububbubi''
* Zoom → "Zuboom"
* Subaru → "Subububarubu"
* "Hi, how are you?" → "Hubi, hubow ubare yubou?"
* "We need to get to Plantation Road on time." → "Wube nubeed tuboo gubet tuboo Plubantubashubon Ruboad ubon tubime."
* "[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.]]" → "Uball hubumuban bubeings ubare buborn frubee uband ubequubal ubin dubignubituby uband rubights. Thubey ubare ubendubowed wubith rubeasubon uband cubonscubience uband shubould ubact tubowubards ubone ubanubothuber ubin uba spubirubit ubof brubothuberhubood."

==Uses==
Ubbi Dubbi has also been popularized as the signature speech pattern of the cartoon character Mushmouth from the animated series ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', voiced by [[Bill Cosby]].

It was used in the episode "Mentalo Case" from the TV series ''[[The King Of Queens]]'', between character Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and a salesman at a toy convention.

It was also used between Penny and Amy Farrah Fowler in  season 10 episode 7 of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' as a means of having a secret conversation, to counter Sheldon and Leonard's [[Klingon language|Klingon]].

In the video game ''[[Rayman Origins]]'', the Bubble Dreamer speaks Ubbi Dubbi.
