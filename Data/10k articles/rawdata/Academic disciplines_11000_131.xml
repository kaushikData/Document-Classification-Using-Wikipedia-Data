This is a catalogue of [[astronomical object]]s that were visible in the [[X-ray]] spectrum from the [[ROSAT]] satellite, in the field of [[X-ray astronomy]].

Examinations of 1RXS has shown that many sources can be identified, such as old [[neutron star]]s, while other entries are "intriguing", according to one researcher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWJCADXaes8C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=1rxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e9AZT46XDJKbtweQwtmkCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1rxs&amp;f=false David L.

      <comment>/* ASM method */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">The '''algorithmic state machine (ASM)''' method is a method for designing finite [[state machine]]s. It is used to represent diagrams of digital [[integrated circuit]]s. The ASM diagram is like a [[state diagram]] but less formal and thus easier to understand.  An ASM chart is a method of describing the sequential operations of a digital system.

== ASM method ==
The ASM method is composed of the following steps:

:'''''1'''''. Create an algorithm, using ''[pseudocode]]'', to describe the desired operation of the device.
:'''''2'''''. Convert the [[pseudocode]] into an ''ASM chart''.
:'''''3'''''. Design the ''datapath'' based on the ASM chart.
:'''''4'''''. Create a ''detailed ASM chart'' based on the datapath.
:'''''5'''''. Design the ''control logic'' based on the detailed ASM chart.

== ASM chart ==
An ASM chart consists of an interconnection of four types of basic elements: state names, states, condition checks and conditional outputs.  An ASM state, represented as a rectangle, corresponds to one state of a regular state diagram or finite state machine. The [[Moore machine|Moore]] type outputs are listed inside the box.
[[File : ASM State Name.jpg|frame|right| State Name]]
State name: The name of the state is indicated inside the circle and the circle is placed in the top left corner or the name is placed without the circle.
[[File:ASM Chart State Box.png|frame|left|State box]]
State box : The output of the state is indicated inside the rectangle box

[[File:ASM Chart Decision Box.png|frame|left|Decision box]]
Decision box: A diamond indicates that the stated condition expression is to be tested and the exit path is to be chosen accordingly.  The condition expression contains one or more inputs to the FSM (Finite State Machine).  An ASM condition check, indicated by a diamond with one input and two outputs (for true and false), is used to conditionally transfer between two states or between a state and a conditional output.  The decision box contains the stated condition expression to be tested, the expression contains one or more inputs of the FSM.

[[File:ASM Chart Conditional Output Box.png|frame|right|Conditional output box]]
Conditional output box: An oval denotes the output signals that are of [[Mealy machine|Mealy]] type.  These outputs depend not only on the state but also the inputs to the FSM.

== Datapath ==
Once the desired operation of a circuit has been described using [[Register transfer level|RTL]] operations, the datapath components may be derived.  Every unique variable that is assigned a value in the RTL program can be implemented as a register.  Depending on the functional operation performed when assigning a value to a variable, the register for that variable may be implemented as a straightforward register, a shift register, a counter, or a register preceded by a combinational logic block.  The combinational logic block associated with a register may implement an adder, subtracter, multiplexer, or some other type of combinational logic function.

== Detailed ASM chart ==
Once the datapath is designed, the ASM chart is converted to a detailed ASM chart.  The [[Register transfer level|RTL]] notation is replaced by signals defined in the datapath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">The '''American Musicological Society''' is a membership-based [[musicology|musicological]] organization founded in 1934 to advance scholarly research in the various fields of music as a branch of learning and scholarship. It grew out of a small contingent of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] and, more directly, the New York Musicological Society (1930–1934). Its founders were George S. Dickinson, [[Carl Engel]], [[Gustave Reese]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], [[Joseph Schillinger]], [[Charles Seeger]], [[Harold Spivacke]], [[Oliver Strunk]], and [[Joseph Yasser]]. Its first president was [[Otto Kinkeldey]], the first American to receive an appointment as professor of musicology ([[Cornell University]], 1930).

== Overview ==
The society consists of individual members divided among fifteen regional chapters across the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, as well as subscribing institutions. It was admitted to the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] in 1951, and participates in the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]] and the [[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale]].

The society's annual meetings consist of presentations, [[symposium|symposia]], and concerts, as well as more-or-less informal meetings of numerous related musical societies. Many of the society's awards, prizes and fellowships are announced at these meetings.

== Publications ==
Most of the society's resources are dedicated to musicological publications: the triannual ''[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]]'' (1948-present) published by the [[University of California Press]]. The journal was preceded by the annual ''Bulletin'' (1936–1947) and the annual ''Papers'' (1936–1941). Online versions of these publications are available at [[JSTOR]] and the University of California Press.

Other studies and documents published by the society include the complete works of [[William Billings]], edited by [[Karl Kroeger]] et al. (4 vols, 1977–1990), the series ''Music of the United States of America'' (1993–present),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/%7Emusausa/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Ockeghem]]'s collected works edited by [[Dragan Plamenac]] and Richard Wexler (3 vols., 1966, 1992), [[John Dunstaple]]'s complete works edited by [[Manfred Bukofzer]], published jointly with [[Musica Britannica]] (1970), [[Joseph Kerman]]'s ''The Elizabethan Madrigal'' (1962),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Kerman.php&lt;/ref&gt; E. R. Reilly's ''Quantz and his Versuch'' (1971), E. H. Sparks's ''The Music of Noel Bauldeweyn'' (1972), ''Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to [[Alvin H. Johnson]]'' edited by [[Lewis Lockwood]] and Edward Roesner (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Johnson.php |title=Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to Alvin H. Johnson |website=American Musicological Society |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in conjunction with the [[International Musicological Society]], ''Doctoral Dissertations in Musicology'' edited by C. D. Adkins and A. Dickinson in succession to [[Helen Hewitt]] (1952, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1977, 1984 [first cumulative edition], 1990, 1996 [second series, second cumulative edition]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/ddm/&lt;/ref&gt;(Brunswick, 2011)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">An '''arc fault''' is a high power discharge of electricity between two or more conductors.  This discharge translates into heat, which can break down the wire's insulation and possibly trigger an electrical fire. These arc faults can range in power from a few amps up to thousands of amps high and are highly variable in terms of strength and duration. Common causes of arc faults include faulty connections due to corrosion and faulty initial installation.

== Location and detection ==
Two types of wiring protection are standard thermal breakers and [[ Arc-fault circuit interrupter|arc fault circuit breakers]]. Thermal breakers require an overload condition long enough that a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs in a very small area. A problem with arc fault circuit breaker is they are more likely to produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, James, Ph.D. "[http://livewiretest.com/eliminating-false-positives-in-the-detection-and-location-of-sub-3ms-faults-on-acdc-lines/ Eliminating False Positives in the Detection and Location of sub 3ms Faults on AC/DC Lines]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" presented at the 2011 Aircraft Airworthiness &amp; Sustainment Conference on April 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple wiring systems visual inspection can lead to finding the fault location, but in complex wiring systems, for instance aircraft wiring, devices such as a [[time-domain reflectometer]] are helpful, even on live wires.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia and Gunther, Jacob. "[http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ Analysis of Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry for Wire Fault Location] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQrUbdfD?url=http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ |date=2011-02-12 }}" in IEEE Sensors Journal (Dec 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualitative differences between how a child processes its waking experience and how an adult processes his/her waking experience are acknowledged. Cognitive development is defined in adult terms as the emergence of ability to consciously cognize and consciously understand and articulate their understanding.

A large portion of research has gone into understanding how a child perceives its world. [[Jean Piaget]] was a major force establishing this field, forming his "[[theory of cognitive development]]". Piaget proposed four stages of cognitive development: the ''sensorimotor'', ''preoperational'', ''concrete operational'' and ''formal operational'' period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L|title=PSYCHOLOGY|year=2009|publisher=Catherine Woods|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Piaget's theoretical claims have since fallen out of favor. Still, his description of the most prominent changes in cognition with age, is generally still accepted today (e.g., how early perception moves from being dependent on concrete, external actions.  Later,  abstract understanding of observable aspects of reality can be captured; leading to, discovery of underlying abstract rules and principles, usually starting in adolescence)

Perhaps equally importantly, Piaget identified and described many cognitive changes that must be explained, such as [[object permanence]] in infancy and the understanding of logical relations and cause-effect reasoning in school age children. The many phenomena he described still attract the interest of many current researchers.

In recent years, however, alternative models have been advanced, including [[information-processing theory]], [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], which aim to integrate Piaget's ideas with more recent models and concepts in developmental and cognitive science, theoretical cognitive neuroscience, and social-constructivist approaches.

A major controversy in cognitive development has been "[[nature versus nurture]]", that is, the question if cognitive development is mainly determined by an individual's innate qualities ("nature"), or by their personal experiences ("nurture"). However, it is now recognized by most experts that this is a [[false dichotomy]]: there is overwhelming evidence from biological and behavioral sciences that from the earliest points in development, gene activity interacts with events and experiences in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N.R. ''et al.''. (2005) Psychology: the science of behaviour (3rd Canadian ed) Pearson Ed. {{ISBN|0-205-45769-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive development and motor development may also be closely interrelated. When a person experiences a neurodevelopmental disorder and their cognitive development is disturbed, we often see adverse effects in motor development as well. Cerebellum, which is the part of brain that is most responsible for motor skills, has been shown to have significant importance in cognitive functions in the same way that prefrontal cortex has important duties in not only cognitive abilities but also development of motor skills. To support this, there is evidence of close co-activation of neocerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in functional neuroimaging as well as abnormalities seen in both cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the same developmental disorder. In this way, we see close interrelation of motor development and cognitive development and they cannot operate in their full capacity when either of them are impaired or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Close Interrelation of Motor Development and Cognitive Development and of the Cerebellum and Prefrontal Cortex|first=Adele|last=Diamond|date=26 December 2017|publisher=|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=1|pages=44–56|jstor = 1132216|pmid = 10836557|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00117}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Historical origins: The history and theory of cognitive development. ==
 Jean Piaget is inexorably linked to cognitive development. It is clear that in Piaget's writings that there are influences from many historical predecessors. A few that are worth mentioning are included in the following Historical Origins chart. It is intended to be a more inclusive list of researchers who have studied the processes of acquiring more complex ways of thinking as people grow and develop:

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) believed that people move through stages of development that allow them to think in new, more complex ways.

==== Sensorimotor stage ====
The first stage in Piaget's stages of cognitive development is the sensorimotor stage. This stage lasts from birth to two years old. During this stage, behaviors lack a sense of thought and logic. Behaviors gradually move from acting upon inherited reflexes to interacting with the environment with a goal in mind and being able to represent the external world at the end.

The sensorimotor stage has been broken down into six sub stages that explain the gradual development of infants from birth to age 2. Once the child gains the ability to mentally represent reality, the child begins the transition to the preoperational stage of development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;McShane, John. "Cognitive Development: an information processing approach". 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Birth to one month ====
Each child is born with inherited reflexes that they use to gain knowledge and understanding about their environment. ''Examples of these reflexes include grasping and sucking.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org"&gt;Freyder, C., &amp; Jackson, M. (2008). Sensorimotor Period. Retrieved November 20, 2012, from {{cite web |url=http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106002021/http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage1.htm |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1–4 months ====
Children repeat behaviors that happen unexpectedly because of their reflexes. ''For example, a child's finger comes in contact with the mouth and the child starts sucking on it. If the sensation is pleasurable to the child, then the child will attempt to recreate the behavior.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; Infants use their initial reflexes (grasping and sucking) to explore their environment and create schemes. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemes]] are groups of similar actions or thoughts that are used repeatedly in response to the environment.&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012"&gt;Ormrod, J.E. (2012). Essentials of Educational Psychology: Big Ideas to Guide Effective Teaching. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a child begins to create schemes they use accommodation and assimilation to become progressively adapted to the world.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2010). Sensorimotor Stage&amp;nbsp;— Object Permanence. Retrieved from http://www.simplypsychology.org/sensorimotor.html&lt;/ref&gt; '''Assimilation''' is when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing schema. ''For example, an infant may assimilate a new teddy bear into their putting things in their mouth scheme and use their reflexes to make the teddy bear go into their mouth.''&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt; '''Accommodation''' is when a child either modifies an existing scheme or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event. ''For example, an infant may have to open his or her mouth wider than usual to accommodate the teddy bear's paw.''&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt;

==== 5–8 months ====
Child has an experience with an external stimulus that they find pleasurable, so they try to recreate that experience. ''For example, a child accidentally hits the mobile above the crib and likes to watch it spin. When it stops the child begins to grab at the object to make it spin again.'' In this stage, habits are formed from general schemes that the infant has created but there is not yet, from the child's point of view, any differentiation between means and ends.&lt;ref name="Piaget, J. 1972"&gt;Piaget, J., &amp; Inhelder, B. (1972). The Psychology of the Child (Vol. 5001). Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Children cannot also focus on multiple tasks at once, and only focus on the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt; The child may create a habit of spinning the mobile in its crib, but they are still trying to find out methods to reach the mobile in order to get it to spin in the way that they find pleasurable. Once there is another distraction (say the parent walks in the room) the baby will no longer focus on the mobile. Toys should be given to infants that respond to a child's actions to help foster their investigative instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Buckleitner, W. (2008). So Young, and So Gadgeted. Retrieved November 20, 2012, from https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''For example, a toy plays a song when you push one button, and then a picture pops up if you push another button.''

==== 8–12 months ====
Behaviors will be displayed for a reason rather than by chance. They begin to understand that one action can cause a reaction.&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; They also begin to understand '''object permanence''', which is the realization that objects continue to exist when removed form view. ''For example: The baby wants a rattle but the blanket is in the way. The baby moves the blanket to get the rattle. '' Now that the infant can understand that the object still exists, they can differentiate between the object, and the experience of the object. According to psychologist David Elkind, "An internal representation of the absent object is the earliest manifestation of the symbolic function which develops gradually during the second year of life whose activities dominate the next stage of mental growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elkind | first1 = D | year = 1967 | title = Egocentrism in Adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1025–1034 | doi=10.2307/1127100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 12–18 months ====
Actions occur deliberately with some variation. ''For example a baby drums on a pot with a wooden spoon, then drums on the floor, then on the table.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt;

==== 18–24 months ====
Children begin to build mental symbols and start to participate in pretend play. ''For example, a child is mixing ingredients together but doesn't have a spoon so they pretend to use one or use another object the replace the spoon''.&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; '''Symbolic thought''' is a representation of objects and events as mental entities or symbols which helps foster cognitive development and the formation of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod, J.E. (2012). ''Essentials of Educational Psychology: Big Ideas to Guide Effective Teaching''. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piaget, the infant begins to act upon intelligence rather than habit at this point. The end product is established after the infant has pursued for the appropriate means. The means are formed from the schemes that are known by the child.&lt;ref name="Piaget, J. 1972" /&gt; The child is starting to learn how to use what it has learned in the first two years to develop and further explore their environment.

==== Preoperational stage ====
Lasts from 2 years of age until 6 or 7. It can be characterized in two somewhat different ways. In his early work, before he had developed his structuralist theory of cognition, Piaget described the child's thought during this period as being governed by principles such as '''egocentrism''', animism and other similar constructs. Egocentrism is when a child can only see a certain situation his or her own way. One can not comprehend that other people have other views and perceptions of scenarios. Animism is when an individual gives a lifeless object human-like qualities. An individual usually believes that this object has human emotions, thoughts and intentions. Once he had proposed his structuralist theory, Piaget characterized the preoperational child as lacking the cognitive structures possessed by the concrete operational child. The absence of these structures explains, in part, the behaviors Piaget had previously described as egocentric and animistic, for example, an inability to comprehend that another individual may have different emotional responses to similar experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name = Hurley&gt;Ann Hurley."Cognitive Development: Overview." pp. 2 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych406-5.3.pdf] Retrieved May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage children also become increasingly adept at using symbols as evidenced by the increase in playing and pretending.

==== Concrete operational stage ====
Lasts from 6 or 7 years until about 12 or 13. During this stage, the child's cognitive structures can be characterized by reality. Piaget argues that the same general principles can be discerned in a wide range of behaviors. One of the best-known achievements of this stage is that of '''conservation'''. In a typical conservation experiment a child is asked to judge whether or not two quantities are the same&amp;nbsp;– such as two equal quantities of liquid in a short and tall glass. A preoperational child will typically judge the taller, thinner glass to contain more, while a concrete operational child will judge the amounts still to be the same. The ability to reason in this way reflects the development of a principle of conservation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== Formal operational stage ====
Lasts from 12 or 13 until adulthood and are advancing from logical reasoning with concrete examples to '''abstract examples'''. The need for concrete examples is no longer necessary because abstract thinking can be used instead. In this stage adolescents are also able to view themselves in the future and can picture the ideal life they would like to pursue. Some theorists believe the formal operational stage can be divided into two sub-categories: early formal operational and late formal operation thought. Early formal operational thoughts may be just fantasies, but as adolescents advance to late formal operational thought the life experiences they have encountered changes those fantasy thoughts to realistic thoughts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Many of his claims have fallen out of favor. For example, he claimed that young children cannot [[Conservation (psychology)|conserve]] numbers. However, further experiments showed that children did not really understand what was being asked of them. When the experiment is done with candies, and the children are asked which set they ''want'' rather than having to tell an adult which is more, they show no confusion about which group has more items.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Piaget's theory of cognitive development ends at the Formal Operational stage that is usually  developed in early adulthood. It does not take into account later stages of adult cognitive development as described by for example Harvard University professor [[Robert Kegan]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kegan|first1=Robert|title=The Evolving Self|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other theoretical perspectives on cognitive development ==

=== Speculated core systems of cognition ===
Empiricists study how these skills may be learned in such a short time. The debate is over whether these systems are learned by general-purpose learning devices, or domain-specific cognition. Moreover, many modern cognitive developmental psychologists, recognizing that the term "innate" does not square with modern knowledge about epigenesis, neurobiological development, or learning, favor a non-nativist framework. Researchers who discuss "core systems" often speculate about differences in thinking and learning between proposed domains.
Researchers who posit a set of so-called "core domains" suggest that children have an innate sensitivity to specific kinds of patterns of information. Those commonly cited include:

==== Number ====
Infants appear to have two systems for dealing with numbers. One deals with small numbers, often called [[subitizing and counting|subitizing]]. Another deals with larger numbers in an approximate fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Feigenson, L., Dehaene, S., Spelke, E. (2004). Core Systems of Number. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8. 307-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Space ====
Very young children appear to have some skill in navigation. This basic ability to infer the direction and distance of unseen locations develops in ways that are not entirely clear. However, there is some evidence that it involves the development of complex language skills between 3 and 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Daniel and Stephen J. Farenga. (2007). Knowledge under Construction: The Importance of Play in Developing Children's Spatial and Geometric Thinking. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is evidence that this skill depends importantly on visual experience, because congenitally blind individuals have been found to have impaired abilities to infer new paths between familiar locations.

==== Visual perception ====
One of the original nativist versus empiricist debates was over [[depth perception]]. There is some evidence that children less than 72 hours old can perceive such complex things as [[biological motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simion | first1 = F. | last2 = Regolin | first2 = L. | last3 = Bulf | first3 = H. | year = 2008 | title = A predisposition for biological motion in the newborn baby | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 809–813 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0707021105| pmc = 2206618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear how visual experience in the first few days contributes to this perception. There are far more elaborate aspects of visual perception that develop during infancy and beyond.

==== Essentialism ====
Young children seem to be predisposed to think of biological entities (e.g., animals and plants) in an [[essentialism|essentialistic]] way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelman|first=S|title=The Essential Child: Origins of Essentialism in Everyday Thought|year=2003|isbn=0-19-518198-0|authorlink=Susan Gelman|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they expect such entities (as opposed to, e.g., artifacts) to have many traits such as internal properties that are caused by some "essence" (such as, in our modern Western conceptual framework, the genome).

==== Language acquisition ====
A major, well-studied process and consequence of cognitive development is [[language acquisition]]. The traditional view was that this is the result of deterministic, human-specific genetic structures and processes. Other traditions, however, have emphasized the role of social experience in language learning. However, the relation of gene activity, experience, and language development is now recognized as incredibly complex and difficult to specify. Language development is sometimes separated into learning of phonology (systematic organization of sounds), morphology (structure of linguistic units—root words, affixes, parts of speech, intonation, etc.), syntax (rules of grammar within sentence structure), semantics (study of meaning), and discourse or pragmatics (relation between sentences). However, all of these aspects of language knowledge—which were originally posited by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] to be autonomous or separate—are now recognized to interact in complex ways.

==== Bilingualism ====
It wasn’t until recently that bilingualism had really been accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development. Ellen Bialystok was, and is, a big game changer in this field. Bialystok has done years of research on the effects bilingualism has on cognitive development. There have been a number of studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain, which is the main center at which cognitive development happens. According to Bialystok in “Bilingualism and the Development of Executive Function: The Role of Attention”, children who are bilingual, have to actively filter through the two different languages to select the one they need to use, which in turn makes the development stronger in that center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bialystok | first1 = Ellen | year = 2015 | title = Bilingualism And The Development Of Executive Function: The Role Of Attention | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 117–121 | doi=10.1111/cdep.12116| pmc = 4442091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whorf's hypothesis ===
{{Main|Linguistic relativity}}
[[Benjamin Whorf]] (1897–1941), while working as a student of [[Edward Sapir]], posited that a person's thinking depends on the structure and content of their social group's language. In other words, it is the belief that language determines our thoughts and perceptions. For example, it used to be thought that the Greeks, who wrote left to right, thought differently than Egyptians since the Egyptians wrote right to left. Whorf's theory was so strict that he believed if a word is absent in a language, then the individual is unaware of the object's existence.&lt;ref name="Hunt, E. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = E. | last2 = Agnoli | first2 = F. | year = 1991 | title = The Whorfian hypothesis: A cognitive psychology perspective | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 98 | issue = 3| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.98.3.377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was played out in George Orwell's book, Animal Farm; the pig leaders slowly eliminated words from the citizen's vocabulary so that they were incapable of realizing what they were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosenthal | first1 = P | year = 1975 | title = Language and thought | url = | journal = Theory Into Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 306–311 | doi = 10.1080/00405847509542592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whorfian hypothesis failed to recognize that people can still be aware of the concept or item, even though they lack efficient coding to quickly identify the target information.&lt;ref name="Hunt, E. 1991" /&gt;

=== Quine's bootstrapping hypothesis ===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1908–2000) argued that there are [[Bootstrapping (linguistics)#Acquiring nouns|innate conceptual biases]] that enable the acquisition of language, concepts, and beliefs. Quine's theory follows nativist philosophical traditions, such as the European rationalist philosophers, for example [[Immanuel Kant]].

=== Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development ===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}} Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development emphasized the role of information processing mechanisms in cognitive development, such as attention control and working memory. They suggested that progression along Piagetian stages or other levels of cognitive development is a function of strengthening of control mechanisms and enhancement of working memory storage capacity.

== Neuroscience ==
During development, especially the first few years of life, children show interesting patterns of [[neural development]] and a high degree of [[neuroplasticity]]. Neuroplasticity, as explained by The World Health Organization, can be summed in three points. 1.) Any adaptive mechanism used by the nervous system to repair itself after injury. 2.) Any means by which the nervous system can repair individually damaged central circuits. 3.) Any means by which the capacity of the central nervous system can adapt to new physiological conditions and environment. The relation of brain development and cognitive development is extremely complex and, since the 1990s, has been a growing area of research.

=== Cultural influences ===
From cultural psychologists' view, minds and culture shape each other. In other words, culture can influence brain structures which then influence our interpretation of the culture.
These examples reveal cultural variations in neural responses:

==== Figure-line task (Hedden et al., 2008) ====
Behavioral research has shown that one's strength in independent or interdependent tasks differ based on their cultural context. In general, East Asian cultures are more interdependent whereas Western cultures are more independent.{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- What are independent and interdependent cognitive tasks??--&gt; Hedden et al. assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses of East Asians and Americans while they performed independent (absolute) or interdependent (relative) tasks. The study showed that participants used regions of the brain associated with attentional control when they had to perform culturally incongruent tasks. In other words, neural paths used for the same task were different for Americans and East Asians (Hedden et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedden | first1 = T. | last2 = Ketay | first2 = S. | last3 = Aron | first3 = A. | last4 = Markus | first4 = H.

==== Kobayashi et al., 2007 ====
Kobayashi et al. compared American-English monolingual and Japanese-English bilingual children's brain responses in understanding others' intentions through [[false-belief]] story and cartoon tasks. They found universal activation of the region bilateral [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] in [[theory of mind]] tasks. However, American children showed greater activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus during the tasks whereas Japanese children had greater activity in right inferior frontal gyrus during the Japanese Theory of Mind tasks. In conclusion, these examples suggest that the brain's neural activities are not universal but are culture dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = C. | last2 = Glover | first2 = G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10319">In [[computer science]], the '''complexity function''' of a string, a finite or infinite sequence of letters from some alphabet, is the function that counts the number of distinct factors (substrings of consecutive symbols) from that string.  More generally, the complexity function of a language, a set of finite words over an alphabet, counts the number of distinct words of given length.

==Complexity function of a word==
Let ''u'' be a (possibly infinite) sequence of symbols from an alphabet.  Define the function
''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different factors (consecutive substrings) of length ''n'' from the string&amp;nbsp;''u''.&lt;ref name=L7&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L46/&gt;&lt;ref name=PF3&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS82&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS298&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.298&lt;/ref&gt;

For a string ''u'' of length at least ''n'' over an alphabet of size ''k'' we clearly have 
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \le p_u(n) \le k^n \ , &lt;/math&gt;
the bounds being achieved by the constant word and a [[disjunctive word]],&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[Champernowne word]] respectively.&lt;ref name=CN165&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.165&lt;/ref&gt;  For infinite words ''u'', we have ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') bounded if ''u'' is ultimately periodic (a finite, possibly empty, sequence followed by a finite cycle).  Conversely, if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''u'' is ultimately periodic.&lt;ref name=PF3/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS302&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aperiodic sequence''' is one which is not ultimately periodic.  An aperiodic sequence has strictly increasing complexity function (this is the '''Morse–Hedlund theorem'''),&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN166&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt; so ''p''(''n'') is at least ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L22&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A set ''S'' of finite binary words is ''balanced'' if for each ''n'' the subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of words of length ''n'' has the property that the [[Hamming weight]] of the words in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; takes at most two distinct values.  A '''balanced sequence''' is one for which the set of factors is balanced.&lt;ref name=AS313&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.313&lt;/ref&gt;  A balanced sequence has complexity function at most ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L48&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sturmian word]] over a binary alphabet is one with complexity function ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=PF6&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  A sequence is Sturmian if and only if it is balanced and aperiodic.&lt;ref name=L46&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS318&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the [[Fibonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt;&lt;ref name=deluca1995&gt;{{cite journal |  journal=Information Processing Letters | year=1995 | pages=307–312 | doi=10.1016/0020-0190(95)00067-M | title=A division property of the Fibonacci word | first=Aldo | last=de Luca |  volume=54 |  issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, a Sturmian word over an alphabet of size ''k'' is one with complexity ''n''+''k''−1.  An Arnoux-Rauzy word over a ternary alphabet has complexity 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1:&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt; an example is the [[Tribonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF368&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[recurrent word]]s, those in which each factor appears infinitely often, the complexity function almost characterises the set of factors: if ''s'' is a recurrent word with the same complexity function as ''t'' are then ''s'' has the same set of factors as ''t'' or δ''t'' where δ denotes the letter doubling morphism ''a'' → ''aa''.&lt;ref name=BLRS84&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complexity function of a language==
Let ''L'' be a language over an alphabet and define the function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different words of length ''n'' in ''L''&lt;ref name=BR166&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity function of a word is thus the complexity function of the language consisting of the factors of that word.

The complexity function of a language is less constrained than that of a word.  For example, it may be bounded but not eventually constant: the complexity function of the [[regular language]] &lt;math&gt;a(bb)^*a&lt;/math&gt; takes values 3 and 4 on odd and even ''n''≥2 respectively.  There is an analogue of the Morse–Hedlund theorem: if the complexity of ''L'' satisfies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded and there is a finite language ''F'' such that&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L \subseteq \{ x y^k z : x,y,z \in F,\ k \in \mathbb{N} \} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A '''polynomial''' or '''[[sparse language]]''' is one for which the complexity function ''p''(''n'') is bounded by a fixed power of ''n''.  A [[regular language]] which is not polynomial is ''exponential'': there are infinitely many ''n'' for which ''p''(''n'') is greater than ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some fixed ''k'' &gt; 1.&lt;ref name=BR136&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
The ''[[topological entropy]]'' of an infinite sequence ''u'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{top}}(u) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log p_u(n)}{n \log k} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The limit exists as the logarithm of the complexity function is [[Subadditivity|subadditive]].&lt;ref name=PF4&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS303&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.303&lt;/ref&gt;  Every real number between 0 and 1 occurs as the topological entropy of some sequence is applicable,&lt;ref name=CN169&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt; which may be taken to be [[Uniformly recurrent word|uniformly recurrent]]&lt;ref name=BR391&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.391&lt;/ref&gt; or even uniquely ergodic.&lt;ref name=BR169&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''x'' a real number and ''b'' an integer ≥ 2 then the complexity function of ''x'' in base ''b'' is the complexity function ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') of the sequence of digits of ''x'' written in base ''b''.
If ''x'' is an [[irrational number]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≥ ''n''+1; if ''x'' is [[rational number|rational]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≤ ''C'' for some constant ''C'' depending on ''x'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that for algebraic irrational ''x'' the complexity is ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (which would follow if all such numbers were [[Normal number|normal]]) but all that is known in this case is that ''p'' grows faster than any linear function of ''n''.&lt;ref name=BR414&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.414&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''abelian complexity function''' ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') similarly counts the number of occurrences of distinct factors of given length ''n'', where now we identify factors that differ only by a permutation of the positions.  Clearly ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''p''(''n'').  The abelian complexity of a Sturmian sequence satisfies ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=On the Asymptotic Abelian Complexity of Morphic Words | title=Developments in Language Theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11055">A '''conserved name''' or '''''nomen conservandum''''' (plural '''''nomina conservanda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. cons.''''') is a scientific name that has specific nomenclatural protection. ''Nomen conservandum'' is a [[Latin]] term, meaning "a name to be conserved". The terms are often used interchangeably, such as by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|''International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants'']] (ICN),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants |edition=Melbourne Code |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' favours the term "''conserved name''".

The process for conserving botanical names is different from that for zoological names. Under the botanical code, names may also be "suppressed", '''''nomen rejiciendum''''' (plural '''''nomina rejicienda''''' or '''''nomina utique rejicienda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. rej.'''''), or rejected in favour of a particular conserved name, and combinations based on a suppressed name are also listed as “''nom. rej.''”.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Botany ==
===Conservation===
In botanical nomenclature, '''conservation''' is a nomenclatural procedure governed by Article&amp;nbsp;14 of the ICN.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Its purpose is 
:"to avoid disadvantageous nomenclatural changes entailed by the strict application of the rules, and especially of the principle of priority [...]" (Art.&amp;nbsp;14.1).
Conservation is possible only for names at the rank of [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] or [[species]].

It may effect a change in original spelling, [[Type (biology)|type]], or (most commonly) priority.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* Conserved spelling ('''''orthographia conservanda''''', '''''orth. cons.''''') allows spelling usage to be preserved even if the name was published with another spelling: ''[[Euonymus]]'' (not ''Evonymus''), ''[[Guaiacum]]'' (not ''Guajacum''),  etc. (see [[orthographical variant]]). 
* Conserved types ('''''typus conservandus''''', '''''typ. cons.''''') are often made when it is found that a type in fact belongs to a different taxon from the description, when a name has subsequently been generally misapplied to a different taxon, or when the type belongs to a small group separate from the monophyletic bulk of a taxon.
* Conservation of a name against an earlier taxonomic (heterotypic) synonym (which is termed a '''rejected name''', '''''nomen rejiciendum''''', '''''nom. rej.''''') is relevant only if a particular taxonomist includes both types in the same taxon.

===Rejection===
Besides conservation of names of certain ranks (Art.&amp;nbsp;14), the ICN also offers the option of outright rejection of a name ('''''nomen utique rejiciendum''''') also called '''suppressed name''' under Article&amp;nbsp;56, another way of creating a ''nomen rejiciendum''  that cannot be used anymore. Outright rejection is possible for a name at any rank.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Rejection (suppression) of individual names is distinct from suppression of works ('''''opera utique oppressa''''') under Article&amp;nbsp;34, which allows for listing certain taxonomic ranks in certain publications which are considered not to include any validly published names.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Effects ===
Conflicting conserved names are treated according to the normal rules of priority. Separate proposals (informally referred to as "superconservation" proposals) may be made to protect a conserved name that would be overtaken by another. However, conservation has different consequences depending on the type of name that is conserved:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*A conserved family name is protected against all other family names based on genera that are considered by the taxonomist to be part of the same family.
*A conserved genus or species name is conserved against any [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]s, [[homotypic synonym]]s, and those ''specific'' heterotypic synonyms that are simultaneously declared nomina rejicienda (as well as their own homotypic synonyms).{{clarify|date=September 2013}} As taxonomic changes are made, other names may require new proposals for conservation and/or rejection.

===Documentation===
Conserved and rejected names (and suppressed names) are listed in the appendices to the ICN. As of the 2012 (Melbourne) edition, a separate volume holds the bulk of the appendices (except appendix I, on names of hybrids).&lt;ref name=appendices&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.H.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Barrie, F.R.; Buck, W.R.; Demoulin, V.; Greuter, W.; Hawksworth, D.L.; Herendeen, P.S.; Knapp, S.; Marhold, K.; Prado, J.; Prud'homme van Reine, W.F.; Smith, G.F. |year=2015 |volume=157 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 Appendices II - VIII |publisher=Koeltz Botanical Books |isbn=978-3-87429-480-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance of the second volume is generated from a database which also holds a history of published proposals and their outcomes, the binding decisions on whether a name is validly published (article 38.4) and on whether it is a homonym (article 53.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Orli, S.S.; Wagner, W.L. |year=2015 |title=The foundation of the Melbourne Code Appendices: Announcing a new paradigm for tracking nomenclatural decisions |journal=Taxon |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=1021–1027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appendices/&gt; The database can be queried online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://botany.si.edu/references/codes/props/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants: Appendices II-VIII (with an accounting of proposals to conserve and reject names, to suppress works, and requests for binding decisions) |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedure ===
# The procedure starts by submitting a proposal to the journal ''Taxon'' (published by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy|IAPT]]). This proposal should present the case both for and against conservation of a name. Publication notifies anybody concerned that the matter is being considered and makes it possible for those interested to write in. Publication is the start of the formal procedure: it counts as referring the matter "to the appropriate Committee for study" and Rec&amp;nbsp;14A.1 comes into effect. The name in question is (somewhat) protected by this Recommendation ("... authors should follow existing usage as far as possible ...").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
# After reviewing the matter, judging the merits of the case, "the appropriate Committee" makes a decision either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). Then the matter is passed to the General Committee.
# After reviewing the matter, mostly from a procedural angle, the General Committee makes a decision, either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). At this point Article&amp;nbsp;14.16 comes into effect. Art 14.16 authorizes all users to indeed use that name.
# The General Committee reports to the Nomenclature Section of the [[International Botanical Congress]], stating which names (including types and spellings) it recommends for conservation. Then, by Div.III.1, the Nomenclature Section makes a decision on which names (including types, spellings) are accepted into the ''Code''. At this stage the ''de facto'' decision is made to modify the ''Code''.
# The Plenary Session of that same International Botanical Congress receives the "resolution moved by the Nomenclature Section of that Congress" and makes a ''de jure'' decision to modify the ''Code''. By long tradition this step is ceremonial in nature only.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the course of time there have been different standards for the majority required for a decision. However, for decades the Nomenclature Section has required a 60% majority for an inclusion in the ''Code'', and the Committees have followed this example, in 1996 adopting a 60% majority for a decision.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Zoology ==
For zoology, the term "conserved name", rather than ''nomen conservandum'', is used in the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature'',&lt;ref name=ICZN/&gt; although informally both terms are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the glossary of the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature''&lt;ref name=ICZN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the code for names of animals, one of several [[nomenclature codes]]), this definition is given:
;'''conserved name'''
:A name otherwise unavailable or invalid that the Commission, by the use of its plenary power, has enabled to be used as a [[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] by removal of the known obstacles to such use.

This is a more generalized definition than the one for ''[[nomen protectum]]'', which is specifically a conserved name that is either a junior [[synonym (zoology)|synonym]] or [[homonym (zoology)|homonym]] that is in use because the senior synonym or homonym has been made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'' ("forgotten name").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An example of a conserved name is the [[dinosaur]] genus name ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', which was formally described in 1943. Later, ''Tylosteus'' (which was formally described in 1872) was found to be the same genus as ''Pachycephalosaurus'' (a synonym). By the usual rules, the genus ''Tylosteus'' has precedence and would normally be the correct name. But the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) ruled that the name ''Pachycephalosaurus'' was to be given precedence and treated as the valid name, because it was in more common use and better known to scientists.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The ICZN's procedural details are different from those in botany, but the basic operating principle is the same, with petitions submitted to the commission for review.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Directed panspermia''' is the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space to be used as [[introduced species]] on lifeless but [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.

Historically, Shklovskii and Sagan (1966) and Crick and Orgel (1973) hypothesized that [[life]] on the Earth may have been seeded deliberately by other civilizations. Conversely, Mautner and Matloff (1979) and Mautner (1995, 1997) proposed that humanity should seed other planetary systems, [[protoplanetary disc]]s or star-forming clouds with [[microorganism]]s, to secure and expand our organic gene/protein lifeform. To avoid interference with local life, the targets may be young planetary systems where local life is unlikely. Directed panspermia can be motivated by [[biotic ethics]] that value the basic patterns of organic gene/protein life with its unique complexity and unity, and its drive for self-propagation.

Directed panspermia is becoming possible due to developments in [[solar sails]], precise [[astrometry]], the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]], [[extremophiles]] and microbial [[genetic engineering]]. [[Cosmological]] projections suggest that life in space can then have a  future.&lt;ref name = "CosmologicalFuture" &gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf |bibcode = 2005JBIS...58..167M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook"&gt;{{Cite book | last =  Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future | year = 2000 | location = Washington D.

== History and motivation ==
An early example of the idea of directed panspermia dates to the early [[science fiction]] work ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]], first published in 1930. It details the manner in which the last humans, upon discovering that the [[Solar System]] will soon be destroyed, send microscopic "seeds of a new humanity" towards potentially [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] areas of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stapledon| first=Olaf| title=Last and first men|year=2008|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486466828| pages=238|edition=Unabridged republ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 [[Iosif Shklovsky|Shklovskii]] and [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] speculated that life on Earth may have been seeded through directed panspermia by other civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last  = Shklovskii | first  = I. S. | last2 = Sagan | first2 = C. | title = Intelligent life in the universe | year = 1966 | location = New York | publisher = Dell | isbn = 978-1892803023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 Crick and Orgel also discussed the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last  = Crick | first  = F. H. | last2 = Orgel | first2 = L.

A possible objection is potential interference with local life at the targets, but targeting young planetary systems where local life, especially advanced life, could not have started yet, avoids this problem.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3 " /&gt;
 
Directed panspermia may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]] that value the common gene/protein patterns of self propagation,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Life-centered ethics and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

== Strategies and targets ==
Directed panspermia may be aimed at nearby young planetary systems such as Alpha PsA (25 ly ([[light-year]]s) away) and [[Beta Pictoris]] (63.4 ly), both of which show [[accretion disc]]s and signs of comets and planets. More suitable targets may be identified by space telescopes such as the [[Kepler mission]] that will identify nearby star systems with habitable [[astronomical object]]s. Alternatively, directed panspermia may aim at star-forming interstellar clouds such as [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]] (427 ly), that contains clusters of new stars too young to originate local life (425 infrared-emitting young stars aged 100,000 to a million years). Such clouds contain zones with various densities (diffuse cloud &lt; dark fragment &lt; dense core &lt; protostellar condensation &lt; accretion disc)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mezger  | first = P. G. | title = The search for protostars using millimetre/submillimeter dust emission as a tracer | journal = Planetary Systems: Formation, Evolution and Detection | editors=B. F. Burke, J. H. Rahe and E. E. Roettger | pages = 208–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could selectively capture panspermia capsules of various sizes.

Habitable astronomical objects or habitable zones about nearby stars may be targeted by large (10&amp;nbsp;kg)  missions where microbial capsules are bundled and shielded. Upon arrival, microbial capsules in the payload may be dispersed in orbit for capture by planets. Alternatively, small microbial capsules may be sent in large swarms to habitable planets, [[protoplanetary discs]], or zones of various density in interstellar clouds. The microbial swarm provides minimal shielding but does not require high precision targeting, especially when aiming at large interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;

== Propulsion and launch ==
Panspermia missions should deliver microorganisms that can grow in the new habitats. They may be sent in 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg, 60 μm diameter capsules that allow intact atmospheric entry at the target planets, each containing 100,000 diverse microorganisms suited to various environments. Both for bundled large mass missions and microbial capsule swarms, [[solar sails]] may provide the most simple propulsion for interstellar transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Vulpetti | first1 = G. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = L. | last3 = Matloff | first3 = G. L. | title = Solar Sails : A Novel Approach to Interplanetary Flight | location = New York | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-34404-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Spherical sails will avoid orientation control both at launch and at deceleration at the targets.  

For bundled shielded missions to nearby star systems, [[solar sail]]s with thicknesses of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and areal densities of 0.0001&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seem feasible, and sail/payload mass ratios of 10:1 will allow exit velocities near the maximum possible for such sails. Sails with about 540&amp;nbsp;m radius and area of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can impart 10&amp;nbsp;kg payloads with interstellar cruise velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c''  (1.5x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) when launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au (astronomical unit). At this speed, voyage to the Alpha PsA star will last 50,000&amp;nbsp;y, and to the Rho Opiuchus cloud, 824,000&amp;nbsp;years.

At the targets, the microbial payload would decompose into 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) 30&amp;nbsp;µm capsules to increase the probability of capture. In the swarm strategy to protoplanetary discs and interstellar clouds, 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius, 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg microbial capsules are launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au using sails of 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg with radius of 0.37&amp;nbsp;m and area of 0.42&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to achieve cruising speeds of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''[[Speed of light|c]]''. At the target, each capsule decomposes into 4,000 delivery microcapsules of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg and of 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius that allow intact entry to planetary atmospheres.&lt;ref name = "Anders"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anders | first = E. | title =  Prebiotic organic matter from comets and asteroids | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | pages =  255–257 | year = 1989 |bibcode = 1989Natur.342..255A |doi = 10.1038/342255a0 | issue=6247}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For missions that do not encounter dense gas zones, such as interstellar transit to mature planets or to habitable zones about stars, the microcapsules can be launched directly from 1 au using 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg sails of 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm radius to achieve velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' to be decelerated by [[radiation pressure]] for capture at the targets. 
The 1&amp;nbsp;mm and 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius vehicles and payloads are needed in large numbers for both the bundled and swarm missions. These capsules and the miniature sails for swarm missions can be mass manufactured readily.

==Astrometry and targeting==
The panspermia vehicles would be aimed at moving targets whose locations at the time of arrival must be predicted. This can be calculated using their measured proper motions, their distances, and the cruising speeds of the vehicles. The positional uncertainty and size of the target object then allow estimating the probability that the panspermia vehicles will arrive at their targets.
The positional uncertainty δy (m) of the target at arrival time is given by equation (1), where α&lt;sub&gt;(p)&lt;/sub&gt; is the resolution of proper motion of the target object (arcsec/year), d is the distance from the Earth(m) and v is the velocity of the vehicle (m/s)&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Michael N. Directed Panspermia. 3. Strategies and Motivations for Seeding Star-Forming Clouds. J. British Interplanetary
Soc. 1997, 50, 93-102&lt;/ref&gt;
:δy = 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/v)
Given the positional uncertainty, the vehicles may be launched with a scatter in a circle about the predicted position of the target. The probability P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; for a capsule to hit the target area with radius r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; (m) is the given by the ratio of the targeting scatter and the target area.  
:P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;/π(δy)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.4×10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)        							
To apply these equations, the precision of astrometry of star proper motion of 0.00001 arcsec/year, and the solar sail vehicle velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) may be expected within a few decades. For a chosen planetary system, the area A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; may be the width of the [[habitable zone]], while for interstellar clouds, it may be the sizes of the various density zones of the cloud.

==Deceleration and capture==
Solar sail missions to Sun-like stars can decelerate by [[radiation pressure]] in reverse dynamics of the launch. The sails must be properly oriented at arrival, but orientation control may be avoided using spherical sails. The vehicles must approach the target Sun-like stars at radial distances similar to the launch, about 1 au. After the vehicles are captured in orbit, the microbial capsules may be dispersed in a ring orbiting the star, some within the gravitational capture zone of planets.
Missions to accretion discs of planets and to star-forming clouds will decelerate by viscous drag at the rate dv/dt as determined by equation (3), where v is the velocity, rc the radius of the spherical capsule, ρc is density of the capsule and ρm is the density of the medium.        
: dv/dt =  -(3v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2ρ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) ρ&lt;sub&gt; m&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 
A vehicle entering the cloud with a velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) will be captured when decelerated to 2,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, the typical speed of grains in the cloud. 
The size of the capsules can be designed to stop at zones with various densities in the interstellar cloud. Simulations show that a 35 micron radius capsule will be captured in a dense core, and a 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius capsule in a protostellar condensation in the cloud. As for approach to accretion discs about stars, a millimetre size capsule entering the 1000&amp;nbsp;km thick disc face at 0.0005 ''c'' will be captured at 100&amp;nbsp;km into the disc. Therefore, 1&amp;nbsp;mm sized objects may be the best for seeding [[protoplanetary discs]] about new stars and protostellar condensations in interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

The captured panspermia capsules will mix with dust. A fraction of the dust and a proportional fraction of the captured capsules will be delivered to astronomical objects. Dispersing the payload into delivery microcapsules will increase the chance that some will be delivered to habitable objects. Particles of 0.6 - 60 micron radius can remain cold enough to preserve organic matter during atmospheric entry to planets or moons.&lt;ref name = "Anders " /&gt; Accordingly, each 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 4.2 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; kg capsule captured in the viscous medium can be dispersed into 42,000 delivery microcapsules of 30 micron radius, each weighing 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg and containing 100,000 microbes. These objects will not be ejected from the dust cloud by radiation pressure from the star, and will remain mixed with the dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |   last = Morrison | first = D. | title = Sizes and albedos of the larger asteroids | journal = Comets, Asteroids and Meteorites: Interrelations, Evolution and Origins, A.

H. Delsemme, ed., U. of Toledo Press | pages = 159–169 | year = 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
A fraction of the dust, containing the captured microbial capsules, will be captured by planets or moons, or captured in comets and delivered by them later to planets. The probability of capture, P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;, can be estimated from similar processes, such as the capture of interplanetary dust particles by planets and moons in our Solar System, where 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the Zodiacal cloud maintained by comet ablation, and also a similar fraction of asteroid fragments, is collected by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weatherill | first = G.

The probability of capture of an initially launched capsule by a planet (or astronomical object) P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the equation below, where P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that the capsule reaches the target accretion disc or cloud zone, and P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability of capture from this zone by a planet. 
: P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; × P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;
The probability P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the mixing ratio of the capsules with the dust and on the fraction of the dust delivered to planets. These variables can be estimated for capture in planetary accretion discs or in various zones in the interstellar cloud.

==Biomass requirements==
After determining the composition of chosen [[meteorite]]s, [[Astroecology|astroecologists]] performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain most of their chemical nutrients from [[asteroid]] and [[comet]]ary materials.&lt;ref name=bioresources&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1. Planetary microcosm bioessays of Martian and meteorite materials: soluble electrolytes, nutrients, and algal and plant responses|journal = Icarus |volume = 158 | pages = 72–86 |  year = 2002 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6841 | bibcode=2002Icar..158...72M | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt; For successful missions, enough [[biomass]] must be launched and captured for a reasonable chance to initiate life at the target astronomical object. An optimistic requirement is the capture by the planet of 100 capsules with 100,000 microorganisms each, for a total of 10 million organisms with a total biomass of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

The required biomass to launch for a successful mission is given by following equation. 
m&lt;sub&gt;biomass&lt;/sub&gt; (kg) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; / P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt;     
Using the above equations for P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; with transit velocities of 0.0005 c, the known distances to the targets, and the masses of the dust in the target regions then allows calculating the biomass that needs to be launched for probable success. With these parameters, as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram of biomass (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; microorganisms) could seed Alpha PsA and 4.5&amp;nbsp;gram could seed Beta Pictoris. More biomass needs to be launched to the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]], mainly because its larger distance. A biomass on the order of 300 tons would need to be launched to seed a protostellar condensation or an accretion disc, but two hundred kilograms would be sufficient to seed a young stellar object in the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]].

Consequently, as long as the required [[Life#Range of tolerance|physical range of tolerance]] are met (e.g.: growth temperature, cosmic radiation shielding, atmosphere and gravity), lifeforms viable on Earth may be chemically nourished by watery asteroid and planetary materials in this and other planetary systems.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt;

==Biological payload==
The seeding organisms need to survive and multiply in the target environments and establish a viable [[biosphere]]. Some of the new branches of life may develop intelligent beings who will further expand life in the galaxy.
The messenger microorganisms may find diverse environments, requiring [[extremophile]] microorganisms with a range of tolerances, including thermophile (high temperature), psychrophile (low temperature), acidophile (high acidity), halophile (high salinity), oligotroph (low nutrient concentration), xerophile (dry environments) and radioresistant (high radiation tolerance) microorganisms. [[Genetic engineering]] may produce polyextremophile microorganisms with several tolerances.    
The target atmospheres will probably lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include [[anaerobic microorganisms]]. Colonizing anaerobic [[cyanobacteria]] may later establish atmospheric oxygen that is needed for higher [[evolution]], as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the astronomical objects later when the conditions are right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.

The development of [[eukaryote]] microorganisms was a major bottleneck to higher evolution on Earth. Including eukaryote microorganisms in the payload can bypass this barrier. Multicellular organisms are even more desirable, but being much heavier than bacteria, fewer can be sent. Hardy [[tardigrades]] (water-bears) may be suitable but they are similar to [[arthropods]] and would lead to insects. The body-plan of [[rotifers]] could lead to higher animals, if the rotifers can be hardened to survive interstellar transit.

Microorganisms or capsules captured in the accretion disc can be captured along with the dust into asteroids. During aqueous alteration the asteroids contain water, inorganic salts and organics, and [[astroecology]] experiments with meteorites showed that algae, bacteria, fungi and plant cultures can grow in the asteroids in these media.&lt;ref name = "Bioresources2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary resources and astroecology.

Microorganisms can then spread in the accreting solar nebula, and will be delivered to planets in comets and in asteroids. The microorganisms can grow on nutrients in the carrier comets and asteroids in the aqueous planetary environments, until they adapt to the local environments and nutrients on the planets.&lt;ref name = bioresources/&gt;&lt;ref name = " Bioresources2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olsson-Francis | first = Karen | last2 = Cockell | first2 = Charles S. | title = Use of cyanobacteria for in-situ resource use in space applications | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 58 | issue = 10 | pages = 1279–1285 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2010.05.005 | bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58.1279O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal in the genome===
A number of publications since 1979 have proposed the idea that directed panspermia could be demonstrated to be the origin of all life on Earth if a distinctive 'signature' message were found, deliberately implanted into either the [[genome]] or the [[genetic code]] of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Message through time | author = G.

One outspoken critic is biologist [[PZ Myers]] who said, writing in [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]: {{Quote|text=Unfortunately, what they’ve so honestly described is good old honest garbage ... Their methods failed to recognize a well-known functional association in the genetic code; they did not rule out the operation of natural law before rushing to falsely infer design ...

==Concept missions==
Significantly, panspermia missions can be launched by present or near-future technologies. However, more advanced technologies may be also used when these become available.   
The biological aspects of directed panspermia may be improved by [[genetic engineering]] to produce hardy polyextremophile microorganisms and multicellular organisms, suitable to diverse astronomical objects environments. Hardy polyextremophile anaerobic multicellular eukaryots with high radiation resistance, that can form a self-sustaining ecosystem with [[cyanobacteria]], would combine ideally the features needed for survival and higher evolution.

For advanced missions, [[ion thrusters]] or solar sails using [[beam-powered propulsion]] accelerated by Earth-based lasers can achieve speeds up to 0.01 ''c'' (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s). [[Robots]] may provide in-course navigation, may control the reviving of the frozen microbes periodically during transit to [[DNA repair|repair radiation damage]], and may also choose suitable targets. These propulsion methods and robotics are under development.

Microbial payloads may be also planted on hyperbolic [[comets]] bound for interstellar space. This strategy follows the mechanisms of natural panspermia by comets, as suggested by Hoyle and Wikramasinghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hoyle | first1 = F. | last2 = Wickramasinghe | first2 = C. | title = Lifecloud: The Origin of Life in the Universe | location = London | publisher = J. M. Dent and Sons | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The microorganisms would be frozen in the comets at interstellar temperatures of a few [[kelvin]]s and protected from radiation for eons. It is unlikely that an ejected comet will be captured in another planetary system, but the probability can be increased by allowing the microbes to multiply during warm [[perihelion]] approach to the Sun, then fragmenting the comet.  A 1&amp;nbsp;km radius comet would yield 4.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; one-kg seeded fragments, and rotating the comet would eject these shielded icy objects in random directions into the galaxy. This increases a trillion-fold the probability of capture in another planetary system, compared with transport by a single comet.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;  Such manipulation of comets is a speculative long-term prospect.

The German physicist [[Claudius Gros]] has proposed that the technology developed by the [[Breakthrough Starshot]] initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a [[biosphere]] of [[unicellular organism|unicellular microbes]] on otherwise only transiently [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Gros]]: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0 ''Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project''], Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 361, pp 1-14 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the [[precambrian]] period on Earth. Gros argues that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/author/jessica-boddy ''Jessica Boddy'']: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/qa-should-we-seed-life-alien-worlds ''Q&amp;A: Should we seed life on alien worlds?''], [[Science (journal)|Science]], 9. September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the ''in situ'' [[artificial cell|cell synthesis]] of the microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen Callaway: [http://www.nature.com/news/minimal-cell-raises-stakes-in-race-to-harness-synthetic-life-1.19633 ''Minimal cell raises stakes in race to harness synthetic life'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Genesis project extends directed panspermia to [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] life, arguing that it is more likely that complex life is rare, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/complex-life-elsewhere-in-the-universe/ ''Complex Life Elsewhere in the Universe?'']&lt;/ref&gt; and not bacterial life.

==Motivation and ethics==
Directed panspermia aims to secure and expand our family of organic gene/protein life. It may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]], that value the common gene/protein patterns of  organic life,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Mautner3" /&gt;

[[Molecular biology]] shows complex patterns common to all cellular life, a common [[genetic code]] and a common mechanism to [[Translation (biology)|translate]] it into [[protein]]s, which in turn help to reproduce the DNA code. Also, shared are the basic mechanisms of energy use and material transport. These self-propagating patterns and processes are the core of organic gene/protein life.   
Life is unique because of this complexity, and because of the exact coincidence of the laws of physics that allow life to exist.  Also unique to life is the pursuit of self-propagation, which implies a human purpose to secure and expand life. These objectives are best secured in space, suggesting a panbiotic ethics aimed to secure this future.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt;

==Objections and counterarguments==
The main objection to directed panspermia is that it may interfere with local life at the targets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The colonizing microorganisms may out-compete local life for resources, or infect and harm local organisms.  However, this probability can be minimized by targeting newly forming planetary systems, accretion discs and star-forming clouds, where local life, and especially advanced life, could not have emerged yet. If there is local life that is fundamentally different, the colonizing  microorganisms may not harm it. If there is local organic gene/protein life, it may exchange genes with the colonizing microorganisms, increasing galactic [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
 
Another objection is that space should be left pristine for scientific studies, a reason for planetary quarantine. However, directed panspermia may reach only a few, at most a few hundred new stars, still leaving a hundred billion pristine for local life and for research.     
A technical objection is the uncertain survival of the messenger organisms during long interstellar transit. Research by simulations, and the development on hardy colonizers is needed to address this questions.

A third argument against engaging in directed panspermia derives from the view that wild animals do not —on the average— have lives worth living, and thus spreading life would be morally wrong. Ng supports this view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Y. |date=1995 |title=Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering |url=http://stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=255–285 |doi=10.1007/bf00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing mainly on the fact that almost all animal species have many more offspring than are needed to replace them. The large number of offspring implies that most of them will die before reaching reproductive age, providing only a short window of life before an often unpleasant death. Tomasik agrees,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Tomasik|first= Brian |date= 2015|title=The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering.  |url=http://www.ledonline.it/index.php/Relations/article/view/880/717 |journal=Relations Beyond Anthropocentrism |volume=3 |issue=3  |doi= 10.7358/rela-2015-002-toma }}&lt;/ref&gt; but places significant weight on the extreme suffering many animals experience, especially at death. Plant responds in detail to Tomasik,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/the-unproven-and-unprovable-case-for-wild-animal-suffering/ |title=The Unproven (And Unprovable) Case For Wild Animal Suffering |last=Plant |first= Michael}}  &lt;/ref&gt; arguing that because of the vast number of diverse species and the difficulty of rating animal pain and pleasure, we cannot determine if animals have lives worth living. If wild animal lives are overall negative in quality (with more suffering than pleasure), then spreading life through panspermia would be spreading needless pain. From this perspective, directed panspermia is to be strictly avoided, unless and until we can determine that the lives of the animals generated by it would average positive.

==In popular culture==

The discovery of an ancient directed panspermia effort is the central theme of "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]," an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In the story, [[Captain Picard]] must work to complete the penultimate research of his late archaeology professor's career. That professor, Galen, had discovered that [[DNA]] fragments seeded into the primordial genetic material of 19 worlds could be rearranged to assemble a [[computer algorithm]]. Amid competition (and, later, with begrudging cooperation) from [[Cardassian]], [[Klingon]] and [[Romulan]] expeditions also exploring Galen's research clues, the ''[[U.S.S. Enterprise-D|Enterprise]]'' crew discovers that an alien progenitor race had indeed, [[Abiogenesis|4 billion years]] prior, seeded genetic material across many star systems, thus directing the evolution of many humanoid species.

[[File:Geoffroea_decorticans0.jpg|thumb|''[[Geoffroea decorticans]]'' is both cold and drought deciduous: it loses its leaves in winter as well as during particularly dry summers]]
'''Drought deciduous''' plants are those that [[Abscission|drop their leaves]] during the [[dry season]] or periods of [[drought]].  Examples include plants of the California [[coastal sage scrub]] community, and the leeward Hawaiian dry forest tree, the [[wiliwili]] (''Erythrina sandwicensis'').  This may be contrasted to [[deciduous]] plants that drop their leaves during cold periods, or [[evergreen]] plants that have green leaves year-round.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament''''' is a Biblical commentary and translation by English theologian [[John Wesley]]. First published in 1755 the work went through five editions in Wesley's lifetime.&lt;ref name=ScroggsFront&gt;Scroggs p.415&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 1753 Wesley became gravely ill, leaving him temporarily unable to travel and preach. As a result of this he set to work on a Biblical commentary and translation. He began writing on 4 January 1754 and continued without preaching until March, by which point he had produced a rough draft of the translation. Wesley's pace was slowed by other activities, and he completed the commentary on 23 September 1755, publishing the same year. Further updates were made in 1759 and 1787. In 1790 the translation was published without an accompanying commentary.&lt;ref name=ScroggsFront/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grider p.66&lt;/ref&gt; He was aided in his work by his brother [[Charles Wesley]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Translation===
Wesley worked from [[Greek New Testament|Greek manuscripts of the New Testament]], particularly those of [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], keeping his translation closely in line with the [[King James Version]] (KJV). He made around 12,000 minor alterations to the KJV, many of which have been incorporated into modern translations such as the [[Revised Version]]. Wesley attempted to modernise the dated language of the KJV. He also changed many occurrences of the word "shall" to "will", thereby downplaying an emphasis on [[predestination]] within the text and bringing it more in line with [[Methodist]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.415–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In his preface, Wesley claimed that his notes were aimed at the "unlearned reader," and were meant to be anti-sectarian in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.110&lt;/ref&gt; He based his work on four earlier commentaries: ''[[Gnomon Novi Testamenti]]'' by Bengel, ''The Family Expositor'' by [[Philip Doddridge]], ''The Practical Expositor'' by [[John Guyse]] and ''Theological Lectures'' by [[John Heylyn]]. Many parts of the commentary were merely transcriptions or translations of these texts. All four authors were doctrinally [[Calvinist]], while Wesley was [[Arminian]] in his theology. As such Wesley refrained from using these texts when issues of [[predestination]] and [[free will]] were raised.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.417–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley focused on providing historical context in his commentary, giving explanations of the Jewish court system and the positions of groups such as the [[Sadducees]] and the [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.419&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley's doctrine of [[Christian perfection]] that features heavily in his other writings is notably absent in his notes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explosion-proof enclosures''' are solid cabinets that contain different electrical components like switches, plugs, sockets, transformers, controls, and knobs to keep the surroundings safe from electrical hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfliq.net/electrical-materials-products/explosion-proof-enclosures/|title=Explosion Proof Electrical Enclosures - D &amp; F Liquidators Inc|website=dfliq.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated with sound technology, these boxes are resistant to spark and shock and have a high tolerance to extreme temperatures. An ideal solution for hazardous locations; these explosion-proof enclosures keep any interior explosion from spreading to the external environment and damaging life and property.

==Types of explosion-proof enclosures==
Explosion-proof enclosures are classified into different types depending on the location and the level of protection they offer&lt;ref&gt;[https://iscsales.com/hazardous-location-enclosures-the-definitive-guide-for-2018/ ''Hazardous Location Enclosures: The Definitive Guide for 2018''], by ISC Sales&lt;/ref&gt;. These codes are based on [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) standards which indicate the level of protection against electrical hazards like fire and explosion. Below is a list of location-specific enclosures and their applications:

==Non-hazardous locations==

===Type 1===
Designed for indoor use, type 1 enclosures offer protection against hazardous parts and protect the electronic equipment from dirt, dust, and debris.

===Type 2===
These enclosures are constructed for indoor applications and provide protection to the employees from electric hazards. It keeps the electrical equipment protected from the harmful effects of foreign objects.

===Type 3===
Designed for both indoor and outdoor use, type 3 enclosures keep the personnel protected from hazardous parts and the equipment safe from foreign objects and ingress of sleet, snow, dust, dirt, and rain.

===Type 3R===
In addition to the features and benefits that accompany Type 1 and Type 2, this make offers a much higher resistance to rain, sleet, snow, dust, and extreme weather conditions.

===Type 3S===
Offers protection against hazardous parts and guards the equipment from getting damaged by solid foreign objects. Type 3S enclosures can be used both indoors and outdoors to keep electrical equipment from deteriorating due to the ingress of rain, snow and sleet and functional flaws even when it is fully covered with ice.

===Type 3X===
Over and above the protection offered by Type 3R, these enclosures offer a much higher degree of protection against the external environment. The designation X stands for resistance to corrosion.

===Type 3RX===
Constructed for both indoor and outdoor use, this specific type offers additional protection against snow, sleet and extreme weather conditions apart from being corrosion resistant.

===Type 3SX===
It has all the features and benefits that accompany Type 3S. Designed for rugged use, this make features an efficient external mechanism that is corrosion resistant and facilitates operation even when the unit is covered with snow.

===Types 4, 4X===
These enclosures are ideal for both indoor and outdoor use and designed for protection against hazardous parts. These units keep the inside equipment guarded against harsh environmental conditions and ingress of external factors like rain, snow, dirt, dust and sleet. The designation X signifies resistance to corrosion which implies that the enclosure remains undamaged even with the formation of ice.

===Type 5===
Type 5 enclosures feature a mechanism that is similar to type 2. It comes with an additional gasket that keeps the enclosure guarded against fibers, lint, dust, dirt, and flyings. It is ideal for indoor use.

===Types 6, 6P===
Over and above the safety offered by type 4 units, these have a much higher resistance to water even when there are chances of temporary immersion. It prevents the entry of water and keeps hazardous consequences at bay in case of prolonged immersion.

===Types 12, 12K===
Designed specifically for indoor use, these enclosures provide a very high level of protection against dust, dirt, debris, lint, drips, water splashes, fibers, and flyings. Type 12 units are not resistant to rusting and corrosion but 12k units are. 12k enclosures are available in multiple variants including heavy-duty, wall mount, floor mount, modular, consoles, pushbutton and more.

===Type 13===
These all-purpose units are specifically constructed for indoor use and provide complete protection against ingress of circulating dust, blowing dirt, debris, lint, fibers, and flyings. It keeps the equipment protected against seepage of non-corrosive coolants, splashing, oil, and dripping.

==Explosion-proof enclosures rated for hazardous locations==
===Type 7 Enclosures===
Type 7 enclosures are designed for indoor use in Division 1, Class 1, and Groups A, B, C, and D as defined by the National Fire Protection Association.

===Type 8 Enclosures===
Type 8 enclosures are designed to meet the needs of indoor as well as outdoor applications in hazardous locations. These units are compatible for use in Division 1, Class 1 and Groups A, B, C, and D.

===Type 9 Enclosures===
Compatible with indoor and outdoor installations in hazardous locations, these units are an ideal solution for Division 1, Class 1, and Groups E, F and G.

===Type 10 Enclosures===
Type 10 enclosures are designed to meet the safety specifications of Mines and Health Administration as stated under part 18 of CFR 30.
Environments that contain combustible substances need multi-rated explosion-proof enclosures. Certain environments may also need high pressurizing and purging, provided there is a dependable system that complies with the safety requirements of [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA).

==Applications of explosion-proof enclosures==
Explosion-proof enclosures are available in different shapes, sizes, and specifications for different applications. These spark resistant units house electrical equipment and ensure complete safety of surroundings. Typical applications include:
* Petroleum refineries
* Industries using flammable liquids for operations
* Petrochemical industries
* Dry cleaning plants
* Fuel servicing areas
* Gas plants
* Feed mills
* Plants running metallurgical processes
* Chemical plants
* Producers of plastics and fireworks
* Producers of medicines, sugar plants, and candies
* Carbon-handling units
* Textile mills
* Flax processing plants

==Choosing enclosures for industrial applications==
With more and more companies going green, electronic products are now being designed for use in turbines, solar power systems and alternative energy systems that run with the aid of power and employ smart grids. Faulty installations can lead to fatal injuries and accidents. With the increasing need for electronics in every industry, it is important to consider these five points when selecting enclosures for specific applications:
* Location
Where the product will be installed determines the level of protection needed. Wind turbines are installed outdoors due to which they need to meet NEMA specifications for which 4X enclosures need to be installed. It is important to determine which enclosure has the required strength and durability to protect the equipment from dripping water, powerful sprays, dirt, dust, snow, sleet and debris depending on the location of installation.
* Capabilities
The capacity of your chosen enclosure plays a vital role in maintaining safety and speeding installation. The availability of brackets and attachments can be a huge help. It is important to have a mounting panel when installing a variety of electric components. Standard enclosures are readily available and cost much less as compared to customized units.
* NEMA/RFI Ratings
Applications that involve monitoring and consolidation of excess power from different sources require added protection. A die-cast enclosure made from aluminum with a double layering of gaskets and an outer gasket for sealing the moisture makes an ideal solution for such applications.
* Dimensions
Apart from environmental safety, you should also consider the future needs of your industry. The scope and extent of expansion play a decisive role in determining the dimensions of the enclosure. A small enclosure may prove to be an excellent space saver but can invite significant expenses in the long run. Enclosure modifications for cable access also need to be taken into consideration in enclosure selection.
* Design
The appearance of the enclosure becomes particularly important when it is being installed in a home or an office. The material of the enclosure also needs to be selected depending on the end-use. Installing an industrial unit for controlling a domestic solar system is not a sound choice. A plastic unit with a sleek design makes a perfect solution for residential installations.

The '''external iliac veins''' are large [[vein]]s that connect the [[femoral vein]]s to the [[common iliac vein]]s.  Their origin is at the inferior margin of the [[inguinal ligament]]s and they terminate when they join the [[internal iliac vein]]s (to form the [[common iliac vein]]s).

Both external iliac veins are accompanied along their course by [[external iliac artery|external iliac arteries]].

==Structure==
A continuation of the [[femoral vein]],&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ihGmxzamekC|title=Last's Anatomy: Regional and Applied|author=Sinnatamby|first=Chummy S.|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=0-7020-4839-9|edition=12th|location=|place=Great Britain|pages=309|chapter=5|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the external iliac vein starts at the level of the inguinal ligament.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozes|first1=Geza|last2=Gloviczki|first2=Peter|editor=John J.

The left external iliac vein remains medial to the artery along its whole path. The right external iliac vein is medial to the artery, but as it ascends, it runs posterior to it.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

The external iliac vein is crossed by the [[ureter]] and internal iliac artery which both extend towards the middle. In males it is crossed by the [[vas deferens]] and in females the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]] and [[ovarian vessels]] cross it. [[Psoas major]] lies to its side, except where the artery intervenes.&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7FVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1228|title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice|last=Delancey|first=John O.L.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=978-0-7020-6851-5|editor=Standring|editor-first=Susan|edition=41st|location=|pages=1221–1236|chapter=73, True pelvis, pelvic floor and perineum|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external iliac vein may have one valve, but often has no valves.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

In addition to pubic veins, the main tributaries of the external iliac veins are the [[inferior epigastric veins]] and the [[deep circumflex iliac vein]].&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

==Clinical significance and history==
In 1967, Cockett noted anatomical variations which predisposed to compression of the external iliac vein, amongst other veins. Although less common than [[May-Thurner syndrome]], it is being progressively documented due to modern imaging methods. Compression of the left external iliac vein by the right common iliac artery or left hypogastric artery can occur as it crosses over the vein into the pelvis. The right external iliac vein can similarly be compressed. Such compressions may contribute to [[deep vein thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="Chaar2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeRubertis|first1=Brian|last2=Patel|first2=Rhasheet|editor=Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar|title=Current Management of Venous Diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2dCDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-65226-9|pages=464–465|chapter=35, May-Thurner Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to develop or [[agenesis]] of the external iliac vein has been described in association with [[Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome]] &lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70403">A correlation between '''fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation''' has been suggested by research. [[Ray Blanchard]] identified the association and referred to it as the '''fraternal birth order effect'''.  In several studies, the observation is that the more older [[brother]]s a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] [[sexual orientation|orientation]].&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in homosexual versus heterosexual males and females |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27–67 |year=1997 |pmid=10051890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has sometimes been called the ''older brother effect''. It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valenzuela C | year = 2009 | title = Sexual Orientation, Handedness, Sex Ratio, and Fetomaternal Tolerance-Rejection | url = | journal = Biological Research | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 347–356 | doi=10.4067/s0716-97602010000300012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The fraternal birth order effect has been described by one of its proponents as "the most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in men".&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogaert AF |title=Biological versus nonbiological older brothers and men's sexual orientation |journal=Proc.

Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|title=Fraternal Birth Order, Family Size, and Male Homosexuality: Meta-Analysis of Studies Spanning 25 Years.|journal=Arch.

Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation.&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006/&gt;
Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with [[handedness]],&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt; as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males.&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1=R |last2=Lippa |first2=RA |title=Birth order, sibling sex ratio, handedness, and sexual orientation of male and female participants in a BBC internet research project |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=163–76 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17345165|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Cantor JM, Bogaert AF, Breedlove SM, Ellis L |title=Interaction of fraternal birth order and handedness in the development of male homosexuality |journal=Horm Behav |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=405–14 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16246335 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018-506X(05)00213-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Sex ratio of older siblings in heterosexual and homosexual, right-handed and non-right-handed men |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume= 37|issue= 6|pages= 977–81|year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9119-2 |pmid=17186124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=Ray |title=Review and theory of handedness, birth order, and homosexuality in men |journal=Laterality |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=51–70 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18050001 |doi=10.1080/13576500701710432 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13576500701710432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since handedness develops prenatally,&lt;ref name=Hepperetal1991&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hepper PG|author2=Shahidullah S|author3=White R|title=Handedness in the human fetus|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1991|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1107–11|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90080-R|pmid=1775228}}&lt;/ref&gt; this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Ellis L|title=Birth weight, sexual orientation and the sex of preceding siblings|journal=J.

==Empirical findings==
===Biodemographics===
The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways:&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize/&gt; Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Quantitative and theoretical analyses of the relation between older brothers and homosexuality in men |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=230 |issue=2 |pages=173–87 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15302549 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.04.021 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519304001924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt; It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., {{sfrac|Older Brothers|All Siblings}}) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., {{sfrac|Older Brothers|Other Siblings}}) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;

After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers.&lt;ref name=Baileyetal2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters).&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt; They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt; Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;

In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt; These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt; When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt; Various studies and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality:&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;

* A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers.&lt;ref name="JonesBlanchard1998Meta"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones MB|author2=Blanchard R|title=Birth order and male homosexuality: extension of Slater's index|journal=Hum. Biol.|date=Aug 1998|volume=70|issue=4|pages=775–87|pmid=9686486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;
* A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;
* A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies.&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanderlaan DP|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Zucker KJ|author4=Massuda R|author5=Fontanari AMV|author6=Borba AO|author7=Costa AB|author8=Schneider MA|author9=Mueller A|author10=Soll BMB|author11=Schwarz K|author12=Da Silva DC|author13=Lobato MIR|title=Birth order and androphilic male-to-female transsexualism in Brazil|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jul 2017|volume=49|issue=4|pages=527–535|doi=10.1017/S0021932016000584|pmid=27817755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential [[Confounding factor|confounds]] such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition).&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=XuZheng2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Xu Y|author2=Zheng Y|title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in relation to sexual orientation in China|journal=Soc Behav Pers.|date=Jul 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=995–1002|doi=10.2224/sbp.2014.42.6.995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XuZheng2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Xu Y|author2=Zheng Y|title=Fraternal Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in a Chinese Population|journal=J.

The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;

The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical.&lt;ref name="BlanchardBogaert1997c"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Bogaert AF|title=The relation of closed birth intervals to the sex of the preceding child and the sexual orientation of the succeeding child|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jan 1997|volume=29|issue=1|pages=111–8|pmid=9881124|doi=10.1017/s0021932097001119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;

===Quantitative findings===
Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=curr/&gt; The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%.&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=curr/&gt;{{refn|name=closeestimate|group=note|This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%.&lt;ref name=Blanchardowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;}} Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively.&lt;ref name=Baileyetal2016/&gt;

Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1%&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; to 28.6%.&lt;ref name=Blanchardowe/&gt; The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1  in 7  gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers.&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|polymorphic]] genes (colloquially called [[Xq28|"gay genes"]]) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janninietal2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jannini EA|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Camperio-Ciani A|author4=Bancroft J|title=Male homosexuality: nature or culture?|journal=J.

===Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism===
Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;

====Birth weight====
[[File:Baby weight Necker 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the [[body weight]] of a baby at [[childbirth|birth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402214755/http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html |date=April 2, 2012 }} from Georgia Department of Public Health. Date: 12/04/2008. Original citation: "Birthweight: Infant's weight recorded at the time of birth"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt; The study yielded three main observations:
# The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;
# The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and: 
# The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.
Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardetal2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Côté K|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Lalumière ML|title=The influence of birth order on birth weight: does the sex of preceding siblings matter?|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jul 2003|volume=35|issue=3|pages=455–62|pmid=12887223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBW/&gt; (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Magnus P|author2=Berg K|author3=Bjerkedal T|title=The association of parity and birth weight: testing the sensitization hypothesis|journal=Early Hum Dev.|date=Oct 1985|volume=12|issue=1|pages=49–54|doi=10.1016/0378-3782(85)90136-7|pmid=4064997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Trotnow S|author2=Bregulla K|author3=Flügel K|title=Studies on the birth-weight and the size of the new-born child with reference to the parity of the mother (author's transl)|journal=Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd.|date=Sep 1976|volume=36|issue=9|pages=744–50|pmid=976720|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., [[in utero]]).&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt;

====Handedness====
[[File:Coast watch (1979) (20659957125).jpg|thumb|253px|Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.]]
Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men.&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=Bogaertetal2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research.&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; As handedness is developed during prenatal life,&lt;ref name=Hepperetal1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;

===Mechanism===
In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think [[Neuroligin 4 Y-linked]] protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F. |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Gabrie |first4=José |last5=MacNeil |first5=Adam J. |last6=Hoffarth |first6=Mark R. |last7=VanderLaan |first7=Doug P. |last8=Zucker |first8=Kenneth J. |last9=Blanchard |first9=Ray |title=Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=9 January 2018 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=302–306 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1705895114 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biological vs. non-biological older brothers====
Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt;

If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt; and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male [[gestation]]s (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus).&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt; So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.

===Ubiquity===
The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types.&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt; The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers.&lt;ref name=Zuckeretal2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="XuZheng2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races,&lt;ref name=Bogaert98/&gt; including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt; The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras,&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogaertetal2007/&gt; ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;

The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bailey JM|author2=Zucker KJ|title=Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: A conceptual analysis and quantitative review|journal=Dev.

This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;

Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are [[cisgender]] and attracted to adult men).&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt; Two [[XY sex-determination system|chromosomally male]] groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., [[transgender]] chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males).&lt;ref name=Blanchoff1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Bogaert AF|authorlink1=Ray Blanchard|title=Birth order in homosexual versus heterosexual sex offenders against children, pubescents, and adults|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=1998|volume=27|issue=6|pages=595–603|pmid=9883307|doi=10.1023/A:1018773117741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals").

Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000 /&gt; One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bogaert Anthony F. | year = 1997 | title = Pedophilia, sexual orientation, and birth order | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/106/2/331/ | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 331–335 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.106.2.331|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls.&lt;ref name=Blanchoff1998/&gt; The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by [[selection bias]]. The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Barbaree HE|author3=Bogaert AF|author4=Dickey R|author5=Klassen P|author6=Kuban ME|author7=Zucker KJ|authorlink1=Ray Blanchard|title=Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation in pedophiles|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=2000|volume=29|issue=5|pages=463–78|pmid=10983250|doi=10.1023/A:1001943719964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults).&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt; The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="FreundBlan87"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund K|author2=Blanchard R|title=Feminine gender identity and physical aggressiveness in heterosexual and homosexual pedophiles|journal=J Sex Marital Ther.|date=1987|volume=13|issue=1|pages=25–34|doi=10.1080/00926238708403876|pmid=3573049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freundetal1982"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund K|author2=Scher H|author3=Chan S|author4=Ben-Aron M|title=Experimental analysis of pedophilia|journal=Behav Res Ther|date=1982|volume=20|issue=2|pages=105–12|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(82)90110-3|pmid=7073641}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

===Other findings===
[[Peter Bearman|Bearman]] and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation.  Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters".&lt;ref name="Bearman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bearman|first=Peter|author2=Brückner, Hannah|year=2002|title=Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=5|url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/205a/ecp/bearman_bruckner_ajs.pdf|format=PDF|pages=1179–1205|doi=10.1086/341906}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters).&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew M.|year=2008|title=Family and sexual orientation: the family-demographic correlates of homosexuality in men and women|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~afranc5/Family%20and%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616234247/http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~afranc5/Family%20and%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-06-16|format=PDF|pages=371–377|doi=10.1080/00224490802398357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)."&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize /&gt; Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize /&gt;}} Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and  prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS /&gt; Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize /&gt; Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="BogaertNOBSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardowe&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Bogaert AF|title=Proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to fraternal birth order: An estimate based on two national probability samples.|journal=Am.

Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7-point [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.

To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" ''Sexual partner'' was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group.&lt;ref name=curr&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multidimensional Assessment of Sexual Orientation and the Fraternal Birth Order Effect|doi=10.1037/sgd0000103|year=2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=113–122|author=Joseph M. Currin et al.|journal=Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups.&lt;ref name=curr/&gt; A 2017 [[meta-analysis]] analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;

However, in a large study not included in the above-mentioned meta-analysis, Frisch et al. (2006) also failed to notice a correlation between older brothers and same-sex unions between men in a sample of over 2 million Danes. Instead, researchers found a correlation between such unions and having an excess of older ''sisters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Childhood family correlates of heterosexual and homosexual marriages: a national cohort study of two million Danes|year=2006|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=35|issue=5|pages=533–47|author1=Frisch M|author2=Hviid A|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9062-2|pmid=17039403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism==
Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when [[gestation|gestating]] a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers.  An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanBog96 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchard97&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P |title=H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men |journal=J.

McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he
investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=McConaghy06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McConaghy N, Hadzi-Pavlovic D, Stevens C, Manicavasagar V, Buhrich N, Vollmer-Conna U |title=Fraternal birth order and ratio of heterosexual/homosexual feelings in women and men |journal=J Homosex |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=161–74 |year=2006 |pmid=17135133 |doi=10.1300/J082v51n04_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally.&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogaertantbem03&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bogaert AF|title=Interaction of older brothers and sex-typing in the prediction of sexual orientation in men|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=April 2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=129–34|doi=10.1023/A:1022827524721|pmid=12710827|issn=1573-2800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonRahman/&gt; It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning.&lt;ref name=WilsonRahman&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rahman Q|author2=Wilson G|authorlink2=Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|title=Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation|date=2005|publisher=Peter Owen Publishers|location=London|isbn=0720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Furuta pendulum''', or rotational inverted pendulum, consists of a driven arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a [[pendulum]] attached to that arm which is free to rotate in the vertical plane.  It was invented in 1992 at [http://www.titech.ac.jp/ Tokyo Institute of Technology] by Katsuhisa Furuta&lt;ref&gt;Furuta, K., Yamakita, M. and Kobayashi, S. (1992) “Swing-up control of inverted pendulum using pseudo-state feedback”, Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 206(6), 263-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuetal2001"&gt;Xu, Y., Iwase, M. and Furuta, K.

It is an example of a complex nonlinear oscillator of interest in [[Control Systems Engineering|control system theory]].  The pendulum is [[Underactuation|underactuated]] and extremely [[Nonlinear|non-linear]] due to the gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] forces.  Since then, dozens, possibly hundreds of papers and theses have used the system to demonstrate linear and non-linear control laws.&lt;ref&gt;J.Á.

==Equations of motion==
Despite the great deal of attention the system has received, very few publications successfully derive (or use) the full dynamics.  Many authors&lt;ref name="Furutaetal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fantoni"/&gt; have only considered the rotational inertia of the pendulum for a single principal axis (or neglected it altogether&lt;ref name="Egeland"/&gt;).  In other words, the inertia tensor only has a single non-zero element (or none), and the remaining two diagonal terms are zero. It is possible to find a pendulum system where the moment of inertia in one of the three principal axes is approximately zero, but not two.

A few authors&lt;ref name="Xuetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwaseetal2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akessonetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirata, H., Haga, K., Anabuki, M., Ouchi, S. and Ratiroch-Anant, P.  (2006) “Self-Tuning Control for Rotation Type Inverted Pendulum Using Two Kinds of Adaptive Controllers”, Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 1-6. http://lab8.ec.u-tokai.ac.jp/RAM062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ratiroch-Anant, P., Anabuki, M. and Hirata, H. (2004) “Self-tuning control for rotational inverted pendulum by eigenvalue approach”, Proceedings of TENCON 2004, IEEE Region 10 Conference, Volume D, 542-545. http://lab8.ec.u-tokai.ac.jp/TENCON2004_D-542.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Y., Izutsu, M., Pan, Y. And Furuta, K. (2006) “Design of control method to rotate pendulum”, Proceedings of SICE-ICASE International Joint Conference, Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; have considered slender symmetric pendulums where the moments of inertia for two of the principal axes are equal and the remaining moment of inertia is zero.  Of the dozens of publications surveyed for this wiki only a single conference paper&lt;ref&gt;Craig, K. and Awtar, S. (2005) “Inverted pendulum systems: rotary and arm-driven a mechatronic system design case study”, Proceedings of the 7th Mechatronics Forum International Conference, Atlanta. http://www-personal.umich.edu/~awtar/craig_awtar_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and journal paper&lt;ref&gt;Awtar, S., King, N., Allen, T., Bang, I., Hagan, M., Skidmore, D. and Craig, K. (2002) “Inverted pendulum systems: Rotary and arm-driven – A mechatronic system design case study”, Mechatronics, 12, 357-370. http://www-personal.umich.edu/~awtar/invertedpendulum_mechatronics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were found to include all three principal inertial terms of the pendulum.  Both papers used a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian formulation]] but each contained minor errors (presumably typographical).

The equations of motion presented here are an extract from a [http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jcse/2011/528341.pdf paper]&lt;ref name="Cazzolatoetal2011"&gt;Cazzolato, B.S and Prime, Z (2011) "On the Dynamics of the Furuta Pendulum", Journal of Control Science and Engineering,
Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 528341, 8 pages. http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jcse/2011/528341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on the Furuta pendulum dynamics derived at the [[University of Adelaide]].

===Definitions===

[[Image:Furuta pendulum.jpg|thumb|450px| Fig. 1: Schematic of the single rotary inverted pendulum system.]]

Consider the rotational inverted pendulum mounted to a DC motor as shown in Fig. 1.  The DC motor is used to apply a torque &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; to Arm 1.  The link between Arm 1 and Arm 2 is not actuated but free to rotate.  The two arms have lengths  &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The arms have masses  &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; which are located at &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;  respectively, which are the lengths from the point of rotation of the arm to its center of mass.  The arms have inertia tensors  &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2&lt;/math&gt; (about the centre of mass of the arm).  Each rotational joint is viscously damped with damping coefficients  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; is the damping provided by the motor bearings and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is the damping arising from the pin coupling between Arm 1 and Arm 2.

A right hand coordinate system has been used to define the inputs, states and the Cartesian coordinate systems 1 and 2.  The coordinate axes of Arm 1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.

The angular rotation of Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the horizontal plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above) is positive.  The angular rotation of Arm 2, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the vertical plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.  When the Arm is hanging down in the stable equilibrium position &lt;math&gt;\theta_2=0&lt;/math&gt; .

The torque the servo-motor applies to Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt;, is positive in a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above).  A disturbance torque,  &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, is experienced by Arm 2, where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.

===Assumptions===
Before deriving the dynamics of the system a number of assumptions must be made.  These are:
*The motor shaft and Arm 1 are assumed to be rigidly coupled and infinitely stiff.
*Arm 2 is assumed to be infinitely stiff.
*The coordinate axes of Arm1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.
*The motor rotor inertia is assumed to be negligible.  However, this term may be easily added to the moment of inertia of Arm 1.
*Only viscous damping is considered.  All other forms of damping (such as Coulomb) have been neglected, however it is a simple exercise to add this to the final governing DE.

===Non-linear Equations of Motion===
The non-linear equations of motion are given by&lt;ref name="Cazzolatoetal2011"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 \left(J_{1zz} + m_1 l_1^2 + m_2 L_1^2 + (J_{2yy} + m_2 l_2^2)\sin^2(\theta_2) +
J_{2xx}\cos^2(\theta_2) \right) 
+ \ddot{\theta}_2 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2) 
- m_2 L_1 l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \dot{\theta}_2^2 
+\dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \sin(2 \theta_2) (m_2 l_2^2 + J_{2yy} - J_{2xx}) 
+b_1 \dot{\theta}_1
= \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
+\ddot{\theta}_2 (m_2 l_2^2 + J_{2zz})
+ 1/2 \dot{\theta}_1^2 \sin(2 \theta_2) ( -m_2 l_2^2 - J_{2yy} + J_{2xx} )
+b_2 \dot{\theta}_2
+g m_2 l_2 \sin(\theta_2)
= \tau_2&lt;/math&gt;

===Simplifications===
Most Furuta pendulums tend to have long slender arms, such that the moment of
inertia along the axis of the arms is negligible. In addition, most arms have
rotational symmetry such that the moments of inertia in two of the principal axes
are equal. Thus, the inertia tensors may be approximated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1 = diag[J_{1xx},J_{1yy},J_{1zz}] = diag[0,J_{1},J_{1}]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2 = diag[J_{2xx},J_{2yy},J_{2zz}] = diag[0,J_{2},J_{2}]&lt;/math&gt;

Further simplifications are obtained by making the following substitutions. The
total moment of inertia of Arm 1 about the pivot point (using the parallel axis
theorem) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_1} = J_1 +m_1l_1^2&lt;/math&gt;. The total moment of inertia of Arm 2 about its pivot
point is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_2} = J_2 +m_2l_2^2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, define the total moment of inertia the motor
rotor experiences when the pendulum (Arm 2) is in its equilibrium position
(hanging vertically down), &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_0} = \hat{J}_1 +m_2L_1^2 =  J_1 +m_1l_1^2 + m_2L_1^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the previous definitions into the governing DEs gives the more
compact form

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 \left(\hat{J_0} + \hat{J_2}\sin^2(\theta_2) \right) 
+ \ddot{\theta}_2 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2) 
- m_2 L_1 l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \dot{\theta}_2^2 
+\dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \sin(2 \theta_2)\hat{J_2} 
+b_1 \dot{\theta}_1
= \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
+\ddot{\theta}_2 \hat{J_2}
- 1/2 \dot{\theta}_1^2 \sin(2 \theta_2) \hat{J_2} 
+b_2 \dot{\theta}_2
+g m_2 l_2 \sin(\theta_2)
= \tau_2&lt;/math&gt;

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

=== Illustrator ===
[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

[[File:Partial-depth-removal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bridge after hydrodemolition to expose first layer of [[rebar]].]]
'''Hydrodemolition''' (also known as hydro demolition, hydroblasting, hydro blasting, hydromilling, waterblasting, and waterjetting) is a [[concrete]] removal technique which utilizes high-pressure water to remove deteriorated and sound concrete as well as [[asphalt]] and [[grout]]. This process provides an excellent bonding surface for repair material and new coating applications. First developed in Europe in the 1970s, this technology has become widely accepted for concrete removal and surface preparation throughout Europe and North America.

Hydrodemolition is not used as much for [[demolition]] as it is for surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the reinforcing steel has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound concrete and [[rebar|reinforcing bar]]s (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive [[cathodic protection]] system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike [[jackhammer]]s, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.

==Applications==
[[File:hydro column detail.jpg|thumb|right|Hydrodemolition around column]]
{{Quote|“Hydrodemolition can be used for horizontal, vertical, and overhead concrete removal and surface preparation on reinforced and non-reinforced structures. It is effective in removing concrete from around embedded metal elements such as reinforcing steel, expansion joints, anchorages, conduits, shear connectors, and shear studs. Hydrodemolition can be used for localized removals where deterioration is confined to small areas and for large area removals in preparation for a bonded overlay. This technology can also be used to remove existing coatings from concrete.”|International Concrete Repair Technical Guidelines No. 03737}}

===Hydro scarification===
[[File:Scarification 2 Portland.JPG|thumb|right|Exposed clean [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] left by scarification]]

The process of hydro scarification (a.k.a. hydroscarification or scarification) uses ultra high pressure water to remove the top surface of a concrete bridge or road surface. Usually the removal is within 1/4" to 3/4" at the most, but can be of any depth above the top layer of [[rebar]]. Removal of this type is done in order to provide a good microfracture-free surface for bonding with new, sound concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lundy|first1=J.R.|last2=Sujjavanich|first2=S|year=1997|url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP_RES/docs/Reports/LatexandMicrosilica.pdf|title=Latex &amp; Microcosmic Concrete Bridge Deck Overlays in Oregon (Final Report)|location=[[Corvallis, Oregon]]|publisher=Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering [[Oregon State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like applying oil and chips to an asphalt road, this helps extend the useful life of the bridge decking and road surface by delaying the need for complete replacement.

Another application for hydro scarification is for decontamination, as for example is planned to be used in the [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement]] for the concrete of Unit 4 of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].

===Partial depth removal===
Partial depth removal involves the selective removal of deteriorated concrete to a certain depth or of a concrete overlay to a depth exceeding 3/4". It is usually done in the case of concrete restoration projects where embedded objects such as rebar are substantial and need to be preserved.

===Full depth removal===
Complete removal of a concrete deck is done when it is too deteriorated to keep, but the structural concrete is adequate or can be easily repaired after the hydrodemolition has taken place. It can also be a preferred alternative where a bridge deck has been compromised during initial construction but not yet open to traffic. It allows the preservation of the reinforcement while the deck concrete can be fully replaced to meet the design intent and avoid the need for potential future repairs under traffic. Precast concrete beams are often used in structures such as bridges and parking garages. Hydrodemolition has been used successfully to remove concrete over these beams, where alternate methods such as jackhammers might have caused fracture of the beams. 

==Structures==
This technology has been used on the following types of structures: bridge decks and substructures, [[parking structures]], [[dams]] and [[spillways]], [[water treatment]] facilities, [[tunnels]] and [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]], [[nuclear power plant]]s, piers and docks, [[stadiums]], warehouses, transfer stations, and [[retaining wall]]s.

==Safety==
Any process that is powerful enough to cut concrete can cut skin and bone. Operators of hydrodemolition equipment are required to wear protective equipment. For robotic hydrodemolition equipment, the operator wears steel-toed boots, eye protection, earmuffs and [[hard hat]]. Hand lance operators wear steel-toed boots, metatarsals, shin guards and sometimes [[Bulletproof vest|body armor]].

==Environmental benefits==
Hydrodemolition offers a number of environmental benefits. Hydrodemolition creates no dust pollution, reduces noise pollution, and the water used during the process can be collected after use to minimise any risk of contamination. Recently an innovative technology is available, which allows to clean and reuse the process-water after hydrodemolition.

==Related processes==

===[[Hydrocleaning]]===
all types of surfaces can get dirty from excessive use and abuse, water and air pollution and general exposure to the elements. These surfaces can be cleaned using high pressure water or high pressure water mixed with an abrasive.

===Coating and sealant surface preparation===
The use of high pressure and ultra high pressure water has been used to clean various coatings on concrete surfaces for the purpose of repair and reapplication. Coatings are used to protect concrete from the elements, rain, salt, and to create a friendlier surface for human use. Concrete can also be covered with carpet or tiles using a heavy duty glue or mastic. High pressure water can be used to clean these materials off when new carpet or tiles are desired.

===[[Airfield rubber removal]]===
Commercial and military airfields are required to maintain certain levels of friction on runways to prevent planes from skidding. Runway design, weather and amount of rubber remaining from tire wear all play a role in the level of friction of a landing strip.  If too much rubber is present, the friction of the [[Runway|landing strip]] will be less, requiring more distance for landings, especially in wet weather. High pressure water can be used to remove rubber and restore required friction.

===Cold cutting===
Cold cutting can be used to cut steel, concrete and other materials with the addition of an abrasive feed at the nozzle. Cold cutting is especially useful for cutting of pipes, vessels and tanks in areas where there is a requirement for no sparks or heat generated, such as chemical plants, oil rigs, or even residential neighborhoods, due to the lack of explosive force usually required to break concrete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">In the [[law of the European Union]], '''indicative limit values''', more exactly '''indicative occupational exposure limit values''' (IOELVs), are [[human]] [[Acute exposure|exposure]] limits to [[hazard]]ous [[Chemical substance|substances]] specified by the [[Council of the European Union]] based on expert [[research]] and advice.

They are not binding on [[European Union member state|member states]] but must be taken into consideration in setting national [[occupational exposure limit]]s. Some member states have pre-existing national limits lower than the IOELV and are not required to revise these upwards. In practice, most member states adopt the IOELV but there are some variances upwards and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters &amp; Grodzki (2006) ''pp''53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
A system of IOELVs was first introduced in 1980 by [[directive 80/1107/EEC]] but the first list of 27 substances was not  created until '''directive 91/322/EC''' in 1991. Member states had until 31 December 1993 to implement national limits. This first list was amended by directive 2006/15/EC in 2006 which transferred 10 of the 27 to a different regulatory regime. A second list was defined in directive 96/94/EEC but this was [[repeal]]ed by directive 2000/39/EC.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, directive 80/1107/EEC was repealed and replaced by a new regime under the chemical agents directive ([[directive 98/24/EC]]). The directive defines '''occupational exposure limit value''' as "the limit of the time-[[weighted average]] of the [[concentration]] of a chemical agent in the [[air]] within the [[breathing zone]] of a worker over a specified reference period."&lt;ref&gt;Art.2(d)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the directive led to the creation of the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] to advise the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Union]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995D0320:EN:HTML L 188, 9.8.1995, p.14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; There have subsequently been two directives establishing further lists of IOELVs: 2000/39/EC and 2006/15/EC. {{As of|2008}}, the IOELVs under '''directive 91/322/EC''' remain in force but under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=European Commission | work=Health and Safety at Work | publisher=Employment and Social Affairs | accessdate=2008-04-24 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | title=Occupational Exposure Limits and Biological Limit Values | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416032949/http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | archivedate=2008-04-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third list of IOELVs, now under directive 98/24/EC, is expected in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/europe/euronews/dossiers/ioelv3.htm | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | title=Third list of indicative occupational exposure limit values (IOELVs) (98/24/EC) | work=On the Horizon | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Institute for Biodiversity and Environmental Research''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''IBER'''; {{lang-ms|Institut Penyelidikan Biodiversiti dan Alam Sekitar}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: اينستيتوت ڤڽليديقن بيوديۏرسيتي دان عالم سکيتر) in [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] ([[Borneo]]/[[Southeast Asia]]) is a research institute of [[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]] (UBD) dedicated to [[biodiversity]]  and [[environmental science]]s research and education. IBER’s location within the northwest Borneo hotspot offers unique opportunities for long-term studies in both terrestrial and marine tropical ecosystems.

== History ==

Biodiversity and environment have  been the university's research strengths since its founding in 1985.&lt;ref name=iber&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Biodiversity and Environmental Research|url=http://www.ubd.edu.bn/faculties-and-institutes/iber|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further developed  through the Brunei Rainforest Project, a collaborative project between UBD and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) in the establishment of a permanent field research facility in the [[Ulu Temburong National Park]] - the Kuala Belalong Field Studies Centre (KBFSC)  where a 14-month scientific expedition was carried out in 1991-1992.&lt;ref name=rgs&gt;{{cite web|title=Brunei Rainforest project 1991-1992|url=http://www.rgs.org/OurWork/Fieldwork+and+Expeditions/Resources/Past+Field+Programmes/Brunei/Brunei+Rainforest+Project+1991-1992.htm|publisher=Royal Geographical Society|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, KBFSC has gained local and international recognition as a centre for tropical rainforest research and education in Borneo&lt;ref name=lifecanopy&gt;{{cite book|title=Life Underneath the canopy|year=2011|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalam|isbn=99917-1-242-9|pages=82|editor=Hjh Anis F.D. |editor2=Tennakoon, K. |editor3=Malai Alya S.M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UBD has participated in and led several expeditions to forest areas within the [[Heart of Borneo]] (HoB) boundary&lt;ref name=hobforestry&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of Borneo|url=http://www.forestry.gov.bn/heart.htm|publisher=Forestry Department, Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=19 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731125730/http://www.forestry.gov.bn/heart.htm|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Sarawak]] Forestry Department expeditions to [[Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary|Lanjak Entimau]] and Paya Maga, the UBD-led biodiversity surveys to Sungai Ingei&lt;ref name=Ingeiwwf&gt;{{cite web|title=Sungai Ingei Biodiversity Survey|url=https://wwf.panda.org/?209726/Sungei-Ingei-Faunal-Biodiversity-Survey wwf.panda.org|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of Borneo Seminar: Sungai Ingei Biodiversity Survey|url=http://www.bruneimipr.gov.bn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=569%3Aheart-of-borneo-seminar--sungai-ingei-faunal-biodiversity-survey&amp;catid=96%3Aarchieve&amp;Itemid=48|publisher=Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources, Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation Forest and the iCUBE Scientific Expedition to Bukit Pagon, Brunei Darussalam.&lt;ref name=iber /&gt;&lt;ref name=pagonicube&gt;{{cite web|title=iCUBE Expedition to Bukit Pagon, Brunei|url=http://www.icubeconsortium.org/index.php/programmes/expedition|publisher=iCUBE Consortium|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following these significant milestones achieved in the biodiversity and environment research frontier, IBER was established in 2013 to further develop and expand prospects and international collaborations in biodiversity explorations within Brunei Darussalam.&lt;ref name=discubd&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Official Establishment of IBER, FIT and CARe|journal=Discover UBD|date=July–September 2013|issue=11|pages=5|url=http://www.ubd.edu.bn/Resources/docs/ubdMagazine/discover%20ubd%20issue%2011.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2013|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute’s establishment was officially announced by [[Hassanal Bolkiah|His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam]], Chancellor of Universiti Brunei Darussalam, at UBD’s 25th Convocation Ceremony on 12 September 2013.&lt;ref name=iberbrudirect&gt;{{cite web|title=IBER: A centre of excellence for ecosystem studies|url=http://www.brudirect.com/national/national/national-local/8527-iber-a-centre-of-excellence-for-ecosystem-studies www.brudirect.com|publisher=brudirect.com|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

IBER was set up as a focal agency within UBD that functions to coordinate, facilitate, support and execute research, education and outreach activities or programmes within the biodiversity and environmental scope (both terrestrial and marine).&lt;ref name=researchhighlight&gt;{{cite web|title=Research at the Institute for Biodiversity and Environmental Research|url=http://www.ubd.edu.bn/Resources/docs/IBER/Research%20highlights.pdf|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; KBFSC, previously an independent research centre of UBD, is now managed as the premier international research and educational facility for IBER and remains as a core research focus of UBD.&lt;ref name=discubd /&gt;

== Research ==

Brunei Darussalam is one of the top ten forested nations in the world,&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1757e/i1757e.pdf|publisher=fao.org|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is situated in the hyperdiverse northwest Borneo tropical forests and the edge of the [[Coral Triangle]]. Recognising Brunei's strengths and prominence in biodiversity, the university has biodiversity and environmental studies as one of its five key research areas.

Biodiversity and environmental research at the institute is conducted through university- and government-funded research projects, as well as international.&lt;ref name=iberbrudirect /&gt; A major initiative of the institute is the establishment of the [[International Consortium of Universities for the study of Biodiversity and the Environment]] ([[iCUBE]]).&lt;ref name=icubeestablishmt&gt;{{cite web|title=International Consortium of Universities for the study of Biodiversity and the Environment (iCUBE)|url=http://www.icubeconsortium.org/|publisher=iCUBE Consortium|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This group brings together a core group of research universities ([[King's College London]], [[Korea University]], [[Monash University]], [[National University of Singapore]],  [[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]], [[University of Auckland]],  [[University of Bonn]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]) united in a shared goal of research and education on biodiversity and the environment.

'''Interruption science''' is the [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] scientific study concerned with how interruptions affect human performance, and the development interventions to ameliorate the disruption caused by interruptions. Interruption science is branch of [[human factors and ergonomics|human factors psychology]] and emerged from [[human–computer interaction]] and [[cognitive psychology]].

Being ubiquitous in life and an intuitive concept, there are few formal definitions of interruption. A commonly agreed upon definition proposed by Boehm-Davis and Remington specifies an interruption is "the suspension of one stream of work prior to completion, with the intent of returning to and completing the original stream of work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boehm-Davis|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Remington|first2=Roger|title=Reducing the disruptive effects of interruption: A cognitive framework for analysing the costs and benefits of intervention strategies|journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention|date=September 2009|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1124–1129|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2009.06.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interruptions are considered to be on the spectrum of [[human multitasking|multitasking]] and in this context referred to as '''sequential multitasking'''.&lt;ref name="The multitasking mind"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taatgen|first1=Dario D. Salvucci, Niels A.|title=The multitasking mind|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0199733562}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing feature of an interruption (see [[Task switching (psychology)]], concurrent multitasking) is the presence of primary task which must be returned to upon completing a secondary interrupting task.&lt;ref name="The multitasking mind"/&gt; For instance, talking on the phone while driving is generally considered an instance of concurrent multitasking; stopping a data entry task to check emails is generally considered an instance of an interruption.

Interruptions, in almost all instances, are disruptive to performance and induce errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trafton|first1=Gregory J.|last2=Monk|first2=Christopher A.|title=Task Interruptions|journal=Reviews of Human Factors and Ergonomics|date=1 March 2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=111–126|doi=10.1518/155723408X299852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, interruption science typically examines the effects of interruptions in high-risk workplace environments such as [[aviation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latorella|first1=K.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}
The first formal investigation into interruptions was conducted by [[Bluma Zeigarnik|Zeigarnik]] and [[Maria Ovsiankina|Ovsiankina]] as part of the [[Vygotsky Circle]] in the 1920s. Their seminary research demonstrated the [[Zeigarnik effect]]: people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. In the 1940s, Fitts and Jones reported that interruptions were a cause of pilot errors and flying accidents, and made recommendations on reducing these disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillie|first1=Tony|last2=Broadbent|first2=Donald|title=What makes interruptions disruptive? A study of length, similarity, and complexity|journal=Psychological Research|date=April 1989|volume=50|issue=4|pages=243–250|doi=10.1007/BF00309260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge workers==
Office workers face a number of interruptions due to information technologies such as [[e-mail]], [[text message]]s, and phone calls. One line of research in interruption science examines the disruptive effects of these technologies and how to improve the [[usability|usability and design]] of such devices. According to Gloria Mark, "the average [[knowledge worker]] switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker can take nearly a half-hour to resume the original task".&lt;ref name=marci&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alboher|first1=Marci|title=Fighting a War Against Distraction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/jobs/22shifting.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark conducted a study on office workers, which revealed that "each employee spent only 11 minutes on any given project before being interrupted".&lt;ref name="NYT6"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson|first1=Clive|authorlink1=Clive Thompson (journalist)|title=Meet the Life Hackers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/magazine/16guru.html?pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelemen et al. showed that a team of programmers is interrupted through a technical Skype support chat up to 150 times a day and how these interrupts can be reduced by introducing a dispatcher role and a knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelemen|first=Zádor Dániel|last2=Tódor|first2=Balázs|last3=Hodosi|first3=Sándor|last4=Somfai|first4=Ákos|date=2016-11-01|title=Refactoring technical support to reduce interrupts of developers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.1822/abstract|journal=Journal of Software: Evolution and Process|language=en|volume=28|issue=11|pages=960–968|doi=10.1002/smr.1822|issn=2047-7481|arxiv=1510.04929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notifications===
One of the major challenges associated with increased reliance on information technologies is they will send users notifications, without considering current task demands. Answering notifications impedes task performance and the ability to resume to the original task at hand.&lt;ref name=ACM&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iqbal|first=Shamsi T.|author2=Horvitz|title=Notifications and Awareness: A Field Study of Alert Usage and Preferences|journal=Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|year=2010|pages=27–30|doi=10.1145/1718918.1718926|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1718926|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, even just knowing that one has received a notification can negatively impact sustained attention.&lt;ref name=stothartetal2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stothart|first1=C|last2=Mitchum|first2=A|last3=Yehnert|first3=C|title=The Attentional Cost of Receiving a Cell Phone Notification.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=29 June 2015|doi=10.1037/xhp0000100|pmid=26121498|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2015-28923-001/|volume=41|pages=893–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several solutions have been proposed to this problem. One study suggested entirely disable email notifications. The down side was it may induce a pressure to constant need to check their email accounts.&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt;{{rp|27}} In fact, entirely removing notifications may lead people to spend more time checking their email.&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt;{{rp|29}} The absence of e-mail notifications is often seen as counterproductive because of the required "catch-up" time periods after a long time between email checking.&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt;{{rp|30}} Alternatively, there are several attempts to design software applications that deliver notifications when there is an identified break from work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutrell|first=Edward|title=Notification, Disruption, and Memory: Effects of Messaging Interruptions on Memory and Performance|url=http://interruptions.net/literature/Cutrell-Interact01-Messaging.pdf|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or categorize notifications based on their relative importance (e.g. Oasis).

Research has also investigated the effects of relevant interruptions, and found notifications relevant to the current task are less disruptive than if it were unrelated.&lt;ref name="Notification Manage"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iqbal|first=Shamsi T|author2=Bailey|title=Effects of Intelligent Notification Management on Users and Their Tasks|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Annual SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI'08|year=2008|pages=93–102|url=http://interruptions.net/literature.htm|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Overall task performance is most impacted when an instant message is received during fast and stimulus-driven tasks such as typing, pressing buttons, or examining search results.&lt;ref name=Cutrell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutrell|first=Edward|author2=Czerwinski, Horvitz|title=Notification, Disruption, and Memory: Effects of Messaging Interruptions on Memory and Performance|journal=INTERACT 2001 Conference Proceedings|year=2001|pages=263–269|url=http://interruptions.net/literature/Cutrell-Interact01-Messaging.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|263,265,268}}

Bounded deferral is a restricted notification method that entails users waiting a prescribed amount of time before they access a [[notification system|notification]] to reduce the amount of interruption and decline in productivity. This technique was used in the aim to provide calmer and less disruptive work spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horvitz|first=Eric|title=Balancing Awareness and Interruption: Investigation of Notification Deferral Policies|url=http://interruptions.net/literature/Horvitz-UM05b.pdf|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} If users are busy, alerts and notifications are put aside and delivered only when users are in a position to receive notifications without harming their work. The bounded deferral method has proven to be useful and has the potential to become even more effective on a wider scale, as it has showed how an effective notification system can operate.

[[File:Doctor Miguel Angel Carbajo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|For a surgeon, interruption during an operation could have serious consequences. Yet in some cases, a surgeon may need to be interrupted to make him or her aware of new issues arising with the patient.]]

In nursing, a study has been conducted of the impact of interruptions on [[nurse]]s in a [[trauma center]].&lt;ref&gt;Brixey J. J., Robinson D. J., Tang Z., Johnson T. R., Zhang J. &amp; Turley J. P. (2005) "Interruptions in Workflow for RNs in a Level-One Trauma Center", in: ''AMIA 2005 Annual Symposium Proceedings'', Bethesda, MD: [[American Medical Informatics Association]], 86-90&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has been done on the interruption rates of nurses and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Paxton |first1= F. |last2= Heaney |first2= D.

Interruption caused by smartphone use in health-care settings can be deadly. Hence, it may be worthwhile for health care organizations to craft effective cellphone usage policies to maximize technological benefits and minimize unnecessary distraction associated with smart phone use.&lt;ref name="RMHP_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P.S. |last1=Gill |first2=A. |last2=Kamath |first3=T.S. |last3=Gill|title=Distraction: an assessment of smartphone usage in health care work settings |journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy |volume=5 |year=2012 |pages=105–114|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=13797 |doi=10.2147/RMHP.S34813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''littoral zone''' is the part of a sea, lake or river that is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the [[high water mark]], which is rarely inundated, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this [[intertidal zone]] and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of "littoral zone" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.

There is no single definition. What is regarded as the full extent of the littoral zone, and the way the littoral zone is divided into subregions, varies in different contexts (lakes and rivers have their own definitions). The use of the term also varies from one part of the world to another, and between different disciplines. For example, military commanders speak of the littoral in ways that are quite different from marine biologists.

The adjacency of water gives a number of distinctive characteristics to littoral regions. The [[erosion|erosive]] power of water results in particular types of [[landform]]s, such as [[sand dune]]s, and [[estuary|estuaries]]. The natural movement of the littoral along the coast is called the [[littoral drift]]. Biologically, the ready availability of water enables a greater variety of plant and animal life, and particularly the formation of extensive [[wetlands]]. In addition, the additional local [[humidity]] due to evaporation usually creates a [[microclimate]] supporting unique types of organisms.

The word "littoral" is used both as a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. It derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] noun ''litus, litoris'', meaning "shore". (The doubled 't' is a late medieval innovation and the word is sometimes seen in the more classical-looking spelling 'litoral'.)

In [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]], the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Starting from the shoreline, the littoral zone begins at the spray region just above the high tide mark. From here, it moves to the intertidal region between the high and low water marks, and then out as far as the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. These three subregions are called, in order, the [[Littoral zone#Supralittoral zone|supralittoral zone]], the [[Littoral zone#Eublittoral zone|eulittoral zone]] and the [[Littoral zone#Sublittoral zone|sublittoral zone]].

===Supralittoral zone===
{{main|Supralittoral zone}}

The ''supralittoral zone'' (also called the ''splash'', ''spray'' or ''supratidal zone'') is the area above the spring high tide line that is regularly splashed, but not submerged by ocean water. Seawater penetrates these elevated areas only during storms with high tides. Organisms here must cope also with exposure to fresh water from rain, cold, heat and [[predation]] by land animals and seabirds. At the top of this area, patches of dark [[lichen]]s can appear as crusts on rocks. Some types of [[Common periwinkle|periwinkles]], [[Neritidae]] and detritus feeding [[Isopod]]a commonly inhabit the lower supralittoral.&lt;ref name="Yip and Madl"&gt;Yip and Madl&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eulittoral zone===
{{see also|Intertidal zone}}

The ''eulittoral zone'' (also called the ''midlittoral'' or ''mediolittoral zone'') is the ''intertidal zone'' also known as the ''foreshore''. It extends from the spring high tide line, which is rarely inundated, to the spring low tide line, which is rarely not inundated. The wave action and turbulence of recurring tides shapes and reforms cliffs, gaps, and caves, offering a huge range of habitats for sedentary organisms. Protected rocky shorelines usually show a narrow almost homogenous eulittoral strip, often marked by the presence of [[barnacle]]s. Exposed sites show a wider extension and are often divided into further zones. For more on this, see [[intertidal ecology]].

===Sublittoral zone===
{{see also|Neritic zone}}

The ''sublittoral zone'' starts immediately below the eulittoral zone. This zone is permanently covered with seawater and is approximately equivalent to the [[neritic zone]].

In [[physical oceanography]], the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, [[internal wave]]s, river outflows and oceanic fronts. In practice, this typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]], with depths around 200 meters.

In marine biology, the sublittoral refers to the areas where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the [[photic zone]]. This results in high [[primary production]] and makes the sublittoral zone the location of the majority of sea life. As in physical oceanography, this zone typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. The benthic zone in the sublittoral is much more stable than in the intertidal zone; temperature, water pressure, and the amount of sunlight remain fairly constant. Sublittoral corals do not have to deal with as much change as intertidal corals. [[Coral|Corals]] can live in both zones, but they are more common in the sublittoral zone.

Within the sublittoral, marine biologists also identify the following:
*The '''infralittoral zone''' is the algal dominated zone to maybe five metres below the low water mark.
*The '''circalittoral zone''' is the region beyond the infralittoral, that is, below the algal zone and dominated by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals such as [[oyster]]s.

Shallower regions of the sublittoral zone, extending not far from the shore, are sometimes referred to as the '''subtidal zone'''.

==In freshwater ecosystems==
[[File:Moon Lake shoreline - Riding Mountain National Park.JPG|thumb|right|Shoreline of a lake with nearly unvegetated littoral zone]]

In freshwater situations, littoral zones occur on the edge of large lakes and rivers, often with extensive areas of [[wetland]]. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as fringing wetlands. Here, the effects of tides are minimal, so other definitions of "littoral" are used. For example, the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] defines littoral as that portion of the lake that is less than 15&amp;nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]] in depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/surveys.html#littoral|title=Fisheries lake surveys| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The littoral zone may form a narrow or broad fringing wetland, with extensive areas of aquatic plants sorted by their tolerance to different water depths.  Typically, four zones are recognized, from higher to lower on the shore: wooded wetland, [[wet meadow]], [[marsh]] and [[aquatic vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative areas of these four types depends not only on the profile of the shoreline, but upon past water levels.  The area of wet meadow is particularly dependent upon past water levels;&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in general, the area of wet meadows along lakes and rivers increases with natural water level fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, D.A, Thompson, T.A., Booth, R.K. and Nicholas, J.R. 2007. Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes. USGS Circular 1311. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests. FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the animals in lakes and rivers are dependent upon the wetlands of littoral zones, since the rooted plants provide habitat and food. Hence, a large and productive littoral zone is considered an important characteristic of a healthy lake or river.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;

Littoral zones are at particular risk for two reasons.  First, human settlement is often attracted to shorelines, and settlement often disrupts breeding habitats for littoral zone species.  For example, many turtles are killed on roads when they leave the water to lay their eggs in upland sites.  Fish can be negatively affected by docks and retaining walls which remove breeding habitat in shallow water.  Some shoreline communities even deliberately try to remove wetlands since they may interfere with activities like swimming. Overall, the presence of human settlement has a demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houlahan|first1=J. E.|last2=Keddy|first2=P. A.|last3=Makkay|first3=K.|last4=Findlay|first4=C. S.|title=The effects of adjacent land use on wetland species richness and community composition|journal=Wetlands|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=79–96|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[79:TEOALU]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally serious problem is the tendency to stabilize lake or river levels with dams.  Dams removed the spring flood which carries nutrients into littoral zones, and reduces the natural fluctuation of water levels upon which many wetland plants and animals depend.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, B. A. (ed.) 2002. Flood Pulsing in Wetlands: Restoring the Natural Hydrological Balance. John Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, over time, dams can reduce the area of wetland from a broad littoral zone to a narrow band of vegetation.  Marshes and wet meadows are at particular risk.

For the purposes of naval operations, the [[United States Navy]] divides the littoral zone in the ways shown on the diagram at the top of this article. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have their own definitions, and these have legal implications.

The '''Macondo Writers Workshop''' is an association of socially-engaged master's level writers working to advance creativity, foster generosity, and serve community. Founded in 1995 by writer [[Sandra Cisneros]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandracisneros.com/|title=Sandra Cisneros Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and named after the town in [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabriel García]] Marquez's ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', the workshop gathers writers from all genres who work on geographic, cultural, economic, gender, and spiritual borders. An essential aspect of the Macondo Workshop is a global sense of community; participants recognize their place as writers in our society and the world.

==History==
Macondo began over twenty years ago when author Sandra Cisneros gathered a group of writers, artists, scholars and activists around her dining table in her King William home to meet informally for rigorous writing workshops. Under the direction of Cisneros, and during its brief time at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, membership grew significantly. As such, Macondo has very established traditions and expectations that include a rigorous application process aimed at professional writers of all genres, and the "Compassionate Code of Conduct," a document drafted by a group of past Macondistas outlining the principles and ethics that govern our organization. Macondo has over two hundred lifetime members, many of whom have been with the association from the beginning and who continue to receive support from the Macondo community. Macondo has grown and solidified itself as a space of intense artistic and cultural creativity where writers, artists, thinkers, scholars, and critics can come together and inspire and challenge one another in order to incite change in our respective communities.

==Mission==
Cisneros has described Macondo's mission as supporting and uniting writers "who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community-building and non-violent social change."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.texasobserver.org/sandra-cisneros-macando-workshop-goes-binational/&lt;/ref&gt;  The anthropologist and writer [[Ruth Behar]] has described participants as "Americans of the other America, moving between cultures, languages, classes, homelands, translating our experience for ourselves and others."&lt;ref&gt;''Border Crossings and Beyond: The Life and Works of Sandra Cisneros'' by Carmen Haydée Rivera, Macmillan, 2009, page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing faculty==
Noted past faculty members have included [[Ai (poet)|Ai Ogawa]], [[Dorothy Allison]], [[Julia Alvarez]], [[Andrei Codrescu]], [[Joy Harjo]], [[Tim Z. Hernandez]], [[Manuel Muñoz (writer)|Manuel Muñoz]], [[Elena Poniatowska]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/mondo-nuevo-mundo/Content?oid=2288642&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luis J. Rodriguez]] and [[Helena María Viramontes]].

==Macondistas==
The term '''"Macondistas"''' refers to authors and members of the writing community who are alumni of the Macondo Writers' Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/MacondoWriters/&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers and poets who have attended include: [[Pat Alderete]], [[Francisco Aragon]], [[Richard Blanco]],&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.mysanantonio.com/latinlife/2015/07/inaugural-poet-blanco-will-help-celebrate-macondo-workshops-20th/&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah A.

'''Management of dyslexia''' depends on a multiple of variables; there is no one specific strategy or set of strategies which will work for all who have dyslexia. 

Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

Several [[special education]] approaches have been developed for students with dyslexia. [[Adaptive technology]], such as specialized computer software, has resulted in recent innovations helpful to many people with dyslexia.

One factor that characterises the field of dyslexia remediation is the stream of [[alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities]]. These controversial treatments include nutritional supplements, special diets, [[homeopathy]], and [[osteopathy]]/[[chiropractic]] manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Lang Commun Disord |year=2008 |title= Survey of complementary and alternative therapies used by children with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia) |volume= 44 |author= Bull L |doi=10.1080/13682820802015643 |issue= 2 |pmid=18608596 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems and orthography==
[[File:Visual-dyslexia.jpg|thumb|290px|Corrective glasses are used to cure visual dyslexia]]
{{details|topic=Orthography|Orthographies and dyslexia}}
A [[writing system]] is a type of [[symbolic system]] used to represent elements or statements expressible in [[language]].
The [[orthography]] of a [[language]] specifies the correct way of using a specific [[writing system]] to write the language. Where more than one writing system is used for a language, for example for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], there can be more than one orthography.

===Alphabetic orthography===
Most teaching is geared to remediating specific areas of weakness, such as addressing difficulties with phonetic decoding by providing phonics-based tutoring.  Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torgesen (2004) emphasized the importance of explicit instruction for remediation as well as the need for intensity that is completely different from regular classroom instruction.  To make gains in reading, students need highly structured, sequential interactive activities and close monitoring, directly connecting the known with the new, with sufficient time for practice of new skills to build automaticity and fluency. The size of the instructional group is also important, ideally between 1:1 and 1:3.&lt;ref&gt;Birsh, Judith R. (2005).  Research and reading disability. In Judith R. Birsh (Ed), "Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills" (pp. 16-17). Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. Baltimore, Maryland. {{ISBN|978-1-55766-676-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions in a Latin alphabet writing system==

There is little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular program for reading instruction when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007/&gt;

In 2007 the researchers Joseph Torgesen and Richard Wagner have shown that, when teaching children with reading disabilities, programs including systematic and explicit instruction in phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence are far more successful than programs that do not.

==Academic remediations==
With appropriate instruction, dyslexics can become skilled readers. Appropriate remedial instruction includes using:

* Direct, explicit and comprehensive instruction in the structure of language
* A systematic sequence for teaching individual skills
* Structured information from the simple to the complex
* Simultaneous multisensory approaches, including combinations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities
* Interaction between student and teacher during instruction of new skills
* Reinforcement throughout the day of newly learned skills
* Integrated spelling and handwriting instruction sequence with reading instruction, so that they are mutually reinforcing
* Extended practice for each skill until the student overlearns the skill (see [[Overlearning]] and [[Automaticity]])
* Ongoing review of previously learned skills
* Careful pacing to avoid information overload
* Intensive instruction until reading, spelling and writing skills are at grade level.
* Repeated reading to help develop fluency and reading rate&lt;ref name="uhry"&gt;Uhry, Joanna Kellogg and Diana Brewster Clark (2004). Dyslexia: theory and practice of instruction. Pro-ed publishers. pp. 88-89. {{ISBN|1-4164-0115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paired reading to help develop fluency and enhance comprehension.

==Classroom accommodations==
Although there are no treatments or quick cures for dyslexia there are many techniques that can be used to assist dyslexic students in the classroom while reading skills are being remediated. These include such things as:
* Oral testing
* Untimed tests
* Audiobooks
* Eliminate or reduce spelling tests
* Minimizing the need to read out loud &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Gavin. Dyslexia 2nd edition. New York: Continuum International.(2007).Pages 41-95&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allow students to record the Teacher explaining homework (for example on a Dictaphone) to ensure an accurate account of the homework is made.
* Accept dictated homework
* Reduce homework load
* Grade on content, not spelling nor handwriting
* Reduce copying tasks
* Avoid or reduce essay tests
* Providing teacher handouts to supplement the notes taken
* Using materials that are not visually overcrowded
* To increase motivation, giving assignments in areas in which the student has a strong interest, for example, sports stories, biographies of inventors or rock musicians, or fiction about teenage issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allkindsofminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use an appropriate layout, including a larger font size, larger line spacing (1.5) and a clear font - sans-serif fonts are usually recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html Dyslexia Style guide from the British Dyslexia Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224433/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some dyslexic people are sensitive to the colour of the paper and may find off-white, pale green or pale purple paper can make reading easier. 
* Using appropriate font type and size.  It is suggested{{by whom|date=July 2011}} that [[Sassoon (typeface)|Sassoon]] and [[Comic Sans]] may be the easiest to read; [[Times New Roman]] may be one of the most difficult to read. The font should not be too small. There are several fonts and typefaces designed for dyslexia including ''Gill Dyslexic'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ Gill Dyslexic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924215435/http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Read Regular'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readregular.com/english/regular.html Read Regular] typeface&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexia Readable]],  ''Sylexiad'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html Sylexiad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709074857/http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html |date=2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDyslexic]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendyslexic.org/ OpenDyslexic]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cadman'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://pjmiller.deviantart.com/art/Cadman-732272890 Cadman] &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dyslexie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664561/dyslexie-a-typeface-designed-to-help-dyslexics-read Dyslexie] font&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin writing system only). However, although dyslexics may prefer some of these special fonts, there is no evidence that any of the fonts nominally designed for dyslexics helps them read more easily or better,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s-e-o.org/which-font-is-best-for-dyslexic-users-the-science-reviewed/|title=Which Font is Best For Dyslexic Users?

==Recent developments==
[[Accessible publishing]] works to make reading easier for all who struggle with the standard one-size-fits-all method of book publishing. Accessible publishing works with publishers and  [[Print on Demand]] technology which allows the reader to choose how the books will be published. Available format variations include choosing the font size (from 11 point font  through to 28 point font), whether the font is bold, italic or regular, and choosing the amount of line spacing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Format/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a variety of special fonts being developed for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ | work=The New York Times | title=Making Reading Easier | first=Dwight | last=Garner | date=2008-05-20 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some individuals with dyslexia report improved ease of reading with different fonts, these reports are anecdotal; there is little empirical evidence to support the use of "dyslexia fonts". 
Accessible publishers, such as ReadHowYouWant, also work to make books available in [[Braille]], [[e-books]], [[audiobook]]s and [[DAISY]].

New formats such as streamline text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx What is streamline text?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233331/http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that help dyslexic people to track (move from one line to the next) more fluently. These work by adding 'sign-posts' into the text to show where to go next.

Teachers are also using audiobooks as a way of teaching textbooks in an engaging way to those with dyslexia. In the UK, one of the biggest charities is [[Listening Books]], which offers members a streaming service over the internet. An Australian company, ReadHowYouWant is working to make all published books available in [[audiobook]] form.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the nonprofit [[Learning Ally]] offers the world's largest library of human-narrated audio textbooks, and a second organization,  [[Bookshare]], offers a wide selection of synthetic-read audiobooks. These audiobooks work well for individuals who have word reading accuracy and fluency difficulties (i.e. dyslexics).

Individuals with dyslexia require more practice to master skills in their areas of deficit. In the circumstances where typically developing children need 30 to 60 hours training, the number of hours that has resulted in optimistic conclusions concerning the remediation of dyslexia is between 80 and 100 hours, or less if the intervention is started sufficiently early. Only approximately 20% of adults with early reading difficulties have acquired fluent reading skills in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Lyytinen&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lyytinen, Heikki, Erskine, Jane, Aro, Mikko, Richardson, Ulla | contribution = Reading and reading disorders | editor-last = Hoff | editor-first = Erika | title = Blackwell Handbook of Language Development | pages = 454–474 | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4051-3253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fmri|Functional MRI]] ([[fMRI]]) studies have shown neurological changes in dyslexic children and adults who have used phonological interventions, with improved performance on tests of phonemic awareness and text decoding.&lt;ref name=ClinicalTrial&gt;{{cite journal | title=Neural Changes following Remediation in Adult Developmental Dyslexia (Clinical Study) | journal=Neuron | date=2004-10-28 | first1=Guinevere | last1=Eden |first2=Karen M. |last2=Jones |first3=Katherine |last3=Cappell |first4=Lynn |last4=Gareau |first5=Frank B. |last5=Wood |first6=Thomas A. |last6=Zeffiro |first7=Nicole A.E. |last7=Dietz |first8=John A. |last8=Agnew |first9=D.

[[fMRI]] studies have also shown changes in the brain and spelling improvement of dyslexic children taught [[spelling]] phonetically in an [[orthography|orthographic]] manner.&lt;ref name=Dahms2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahms, Joel. | year = 2006| title = Spelling Out Dyslexia | journal = Northwest Science &amp; Technology |url = https://depts.washington.edu/nwst/issues/index.php?issueID=fall_2006&amp;storyID=800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study has shown that the usage of an FM system drives neural plasticity in children with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hornickel J, Zecker S, Bradlow A, Kraus N |title=Assistive listening devices drive neuroplasticity in children with dyslexia|journal=[PNAS] |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1206628109|pmc=3478599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FM system is a personal assistive listening device, consisting of a wireless microphone worn by the teacher, and a wireless receiver similar to a Bluetooth receiver worn on the ears by the pupil. Measurements of the brain’s response to speech sounds showed that the children who wore the device for one year responded more consistently to the very soft and rapidly changing elements of sounds that help distinguish one consonant from another (cat, bat, pat etc.). That improved stability was linked with reading improvement based on standardized measures of readability – which, as a long-term benefit, points to brain plasticity.

==National statutory provision and support structures==
{{details|topic=National statutory provision and support structures|:Category:Dyslexia support by country}}
Each country has adopted and developed a [[writing system]] of choice.
Each country has their own Statutes relating to the [[:Category:Education by country|provision of Education]], and special educational needs. The statutory provision framework of support in each country is usually complemented by many independent and voluntary support agencies providing more specialised information and support.

The '''mummies of Venzone''' are a number of mummies found in [[Venzone]], Italy, in the 1600s. They were mummified by natural processes, and, while such mummies exist elsewhere, the cause of the Venzone mummies' preservation in particular still remains a mystery.

In 1906, ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' translated portions of an article by F. Savorgnan de Brazza, which first appeared in the French publication ''Cosmos''. His article had described the history and characteristic of these naturally-preserved bodies. The forms and features of their appearance, he describes, were entirely recognizable. The first discovered corpse had weighed a total of only 33 pounds, with the remainder of them weighing somewhere between 22 and 44 pounds.

In his own time, Mr. de Brazzo referred to the existence of a number of hypotheses regarding the cause of mummification. The most reasonable, he believed, was to attribute it to a species of fungus, ''[[Hypha|Hypha tombicina]]'', whose spores were known to be prevalent in both the tombs and their wooden coffins. Even so, the theory still remained only a reasonable speculation.

When de Brazza’s article and this subsequent translation were published, there were clearly doubts that remained, with the process unable to actually be replicated, as well as the “conditions that assure its [the fungus’] life and reproduction”  still remaining unknown. Another precarious position, as ''the Literary Digest'' observes, was in knowing that the mummies would likely never increase in number. The practice of burying dead in churches was later banned, thereby preventing much further observation of the natural process.&lt;ref name="unz"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Fungus That Makes Mummies|journal=The Literary Digest|date=Dec 29, 1906|pages=976|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1906dec29-00976a02|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

At the time of de Brazza’s writing, the number of [[Mummy|mummies]] in Venzone was numbered at 42.&lt;ref name="unz" /&gt; Following an [[1976 Friuli earthquake|earthquake in the area in 1976]], the number has since been reduced to only 15.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aufderheide|first=Arthur C.|title=The Scientific Study of Mummies|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their declining number, understandably, has made it rather difficult to study precisely what the conditions behind their mummification had truly been. As [[University of Minnesota]] professor Arthur C. Aufderheide recounts, while the community of Venzone may be “incredibly hospitable,” those with jurisdiction over the bodies have often refused even Aufderheide himself to collect samples for analysis.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide" /&gt; In turn, this means that only already-collected cultures can generally be used today in analyzing what conditions might have caused mummification.

While a number of novel theories have been offered as to the cause of their preservation, there is still no conclusive opinion. De Brazza was content with attributing it to the presence of a fungus called ''Hypha tombicina'', denying that [[limestone]] – an entirely possible cause of the mummies’ characteristics - was ever present in the tombs.&lt;ref name="unz" /&gt;  On the contrary, Aufderheide asserts that the mummies were indeed originally present in a tomb that contained a native limestone floor. Such a setting, he affirms, would have been entirely suitable for bringing about the very conditions that are still seen these mummies today. Curiously, Aufderheide’s own recent studies have also failed to detect the presence of anything like ''Hypha'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aufderheide|first=Arthur C.|title=The Scientific Study of Mummies|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although discovered in 1908, its scientific importance came into light in the late 1960s when it attracted scientists by the recurrent red colouration it caused by forming massive blooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryther|first1=John H.|title=Occurrence of red water off Peru|journal=Nature|year=1967|volume=214|issue=5095|pages=1318–1319|doi=10.1038/2141318a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cause red tides in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=William S.|last2=Fylling|first2=Dennis M.

Unlike typical protozoans, ''M. rubra'' can make its own nutrition by [[photosynthesis]]. The unusual [[autotrophic]] property was discovered in 2006 when genetic sequencing revealed that the photosynthesising organelles, [[plastids]], were derived from the principal food of the ciliate, the photosynthetic algae called [[cryptomonads]] (or cryptophytes).&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Matthew D.|last2=Tengs|first2=Torstein|last3=Oldach|first3=David|last4=Stoecker|first4=Diane K.|title=Sequestration, performance, and functional control of cryptophyte plastids in the ciliate ''Myrionecta rubra ''(Ciliophora)|journal=Journal of Phycology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1235–1246|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, thus, both autotrophic and [[heterotrophic]].

== Description ==

''M. rubra'' is a free-living marine ciliate. It is reddish in colour and form dark-red mass during blooming. Its body is almost spherical, looking like a miniature [[sunflower]] with its radiating hair-like [[Undulipodium|cilia]] on its body surface. It measures up to 100 μm in length and 75 μm in width. The body is superficially divided into two lobes due to formation of a constriction at the centre. The constriction gives rise to a larger anterior lobe and a smaller posterior lobe. The cilia arise from the constriction. Using the cilia it can jump about 10-20 times its body length in one movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=F. J. R.|last2=Blackbourn|first2=D. J.|last3=Blackbourn|first3=Janice|title=The red-water ciliate'' Mesodinium rubrum'' and its 'incomplete symbionts': A review including new ultrastructural observations|journal=Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|year=1971|volume=28|issue=3|pages=391–407|doi=10.1139/f71-052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its nucleus is prominently situated at the centre, and is surrounded by organelles mostly derived from algae. For example, its cytoplasm contains numerous plastids, [[mitochondria]] and other [[Cell nuclei|nuclei]]. These organelles are properly separated such that the mitochondria are fully enclosed in a [[endosome|vacuole membrane]] and two [[endoplasmic reticulum]] membranes of the ciliate.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2009"/&gt; This indicates that the ciliate is primarily an heterotroph, but after acquiring algal plastid, it transforms into an autotroph.

=== The endosymbiont ===

Genetic analysis showed that in the American coastal areas, the primary food of ''M. rubra'' is the algae most closely related to the free-living ''[[Geminigera cryophila]]''.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; But in Japanese coasts, the major algal species is ''[[Teleaulax amphioxeia]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When these plastid-containing algae are ingested by the ciliate, they are not digested. The plastids remain functional and provide nutrition to the ciliate by photosynthesis. In order for the plastids to be normally active, they still require enzymes, which are synthesised by the sequestered algal nuclei. The single nucleus can survive and remain genetically active up to 30 days in the cytoplasm of the ciliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Matthew D.|last2=Oldach|first2=David|last3=Delwiche|first3=Charles F.|last4=Stoecker|first4=Diane K.|title=Retention of transcriptionally active cryptophyte nuclei by the ciliate ''Myrionecta rubra''|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=445|issue=7126|pages=426–428|doi=10.1038/nature05496|pmid=17251979}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the retention time of the prey nuclei is short, an average ''M. rubra'' cell may contain eight algal plastids per single prey nucleus and the nuclei need to be replaced by continuous feeding on fresh algae. Thus, the algal organelles are not permanently integrated.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

'''NetCorps''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Cyberjeunes'') was a volunteer-organizing coalition consisting of nine Canadian [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and managed by the NetCorps coordination unit.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/faq.php?tpl=orange "NetCorps Frequently asked questions"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the program, the organizations created international [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) internships in developing countries around the world. Interns typically participated in six-month programs, leaving between August and November for host organizations in the placement countries. Positions were limited to 19–30-year-old Canadian citizens or landed immigrants who had "appropriate information and communication technologies skills".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; Typical duties included creating webpages, developing databases, computer networking, setting up hardware, preparing manuals and other documentation, and general-to-advanced computer instruction.

==Program ==

===Objectives===

* To strengthen the ICT capacity of civil society and public-sector organizations to contribute to development goals in governance, education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability
* Increase the professional skills and capacities of young Canadians aged 19 to 30 to contribute positively to Canadian international development efforts and secure meaningful employment
* To increase the awareness and promote greater engagement of young Canadians with respect to international development issues&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

===Budget===
During the 2007-2008 season, the program placed 240 interns and was funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and Human Resources and [[Social Development Canada]] (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a completion bonus.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

==History==

===NetCorps creation===

NetCorps Canada International was conceived in 1996 by Dr. David Johnston (Governor General of Canada as of 2011 and former President of the [[University of Waterloo]]), a prominent lawyer and adviser to the federal government on information-highway issues.

===Phase I===

In 1997 [[Industry Canada]], in partnership with the Special Initiatives Division of Canada's [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), funded a NetCorps-style test project that sent two residents of Cape Breton to Angola for Internet and [[Geographic Information System]]s projects. This NetCorps conceptualization and placement was done through the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) and Dr.[[Michael Gurstein]], Director of the Centre and (at the time) Chair in the Management of Technology Change at the [[University College of Cape Breton]]. An initial NetCorps training program and manual were produced as a result of this program. Notably, the two placements in Angola were of previously unemployed young adults from Cape Breton; they were provided with training in [[Linux]] through C/CEN as part of a demonstration program in the economic benefits that could be achieved through local investment in Information and Communications Technologies in economically marginal regions.

===Phase II===

In 1998 the efforts of Industry Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a consortium of Canada’s largest international development volunteer-sending agencies secured 14 internships in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

===Phase III===

Further collaboration with Industry Canada and the consortium of international development agencies in 1998 saw the Canadian International Development Agency offer 30 internships in the Americas. This phase was announced by the Prime Minister at the [[2nd Summit of the Americas]] in Santiago, Chile in April 1998.

===Phase IV - NetCorps Canada International===

From 1999 to 2006, the NetCorps consortium sent more than 1700 NetCorps volunteers overseas, due to the collaboration of Industry Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy financed by [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC).

===2006–2007 – Transition Year===

In 2006–2007, the consortium successfully organized the placement of 236 volunteers in collaboration with Industry Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 2006-2007 was the last year that Industry Canada would be involved in the NetCorps program.

===Phase VI – 2007–2008===

For 2007–2008, (CIDA) replaced Industry Canada as funders of the NetCorps program. The 240 placements offered that year were once again part of the Government of Canada’s youth-employment strategy.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/history.php?tpl=red "A history of NetCorps Canada International"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was discontinued indefinitely as of the 2008–2009 season.&lt;ref name="mainpage"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/home.php? "NetCorps News"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Nightcart.gif|thumb|right|18th-century London nightman's calling card]]

'''Night soil''' is a historically used [[euphemism]] for [[Human waste|human excreta]] collected from [[cesspit|cesspools]], privies, [[pail closet]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, [[privy midden]]s, [[septic tank]]s, etc. This material was removed from the immediate area, usually at night, by workers employed in this trade. Sometimes it could be transported out of towns and sold on as a [[fertilizer]]. 

Another definition is "untreated excreta transported without water (e.g. via containers or buckets)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanitation safety planning: manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta.|author = Jackson, D| author2=Winkler, M| author3=Stenström, TA|publisher = World Health Organization|date=2015|isbn = 978 92 4 154924 0|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssp-manual/en/|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "night soil" is largely an [[Archaism|archaic word]], used in historical contexts. The modern term is "fecal sludge"; [[fecal sludge management]] is an ongoing challenge, particularly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/TILLEY%20et%20al%202014%20Compendium%20of%20Sanitation%20Systems%20and%20Technologies%20-%202nd%20Revised%20Edition.pdf|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|edition = 2nd Revised|author = Tilley, E.|author2 = Ulrich, L.|author3 = Lüthi, C.|author4 = Reymond, Ph.|author5 = Zurbrügg, C.|date=2014|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night soil was produced as a result of a [[sanitation]] system in areas without [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] or [[septic tank]]s. In this system of waste management, the human feces are collected without dilution with water.

==Collection and disposal==
{{Main|Fecal sludge management}}
Feces were excreted into a container such as a [[chamber pot]], and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence [[slopping out]]). The excrement in the pail was often covered with earth (soil), which may have contributed to the term "night soil." Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a [[shophouse]]. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Disposal has varied through time. In urban areas, a night soil collector arrived regularly, at varying time periods depending on the supply and demand for night soil collection. Usually this occurred during the night, giving the night soil its name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In isolated rural areas such as in [[farm]]s, the [[household]] usually disposed of the night soil themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Uses in agriculture==
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Human excreta may be attractive as [[fertilizer]] because of the high demand for fertilizer and the relative availability of the material to create night soil. In areas where native soil is of poor quality, the local population may weigh the risk of using night soil.

The use of unprocessed human feces as fertilizer is a risky practice as it may contain [[Faecal-oral route|disease-causing pathogens]]. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common [[parasitic worm]] infections, such as [[ascariasis]], in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted from one infected person to another person ([[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] of disease).

These risks are reduced by proper [[fecal sludge management]], e.g. via [[compost]]ing. The safe reduction of [[human excreta]] into compost is possible. Some municipalities create [[compost]] from the [[sewage sludge]], but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claims have been made that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of [[heavy metals]].

==History==

===Ancient Attica===
The use of sewage as fertilizer was common in ancient Attica. The sewage system of ancient Athens collected the sewage of the city in a large reservoir and then channelled it to the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus river]] valley for use as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Life of Greece'', PP. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===China, Hong Kong, and Singapore===
[[File:China; a woman carrying buckets of night-soil. Wellcome L0056427.jpg|thumb|A woman carrying buckets of night-soil, photographed in 1871.]]
The term is known, or even infamous, among the generations that were born in parts of China or [[Chinatowns]] (depending on the development of the infrastructure) before 1960. Post-[[World War II]] [[Chinatown, Singapore]], before the [[history of Singapore|independence of Singapore]], utilized night-soil collection as a primary means of waste disposal, especially as much of the infrastructure was damaged and took a long time to rebuild following the [[Battle of Singapore]] and subsequent [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Following the development of the economy and the [[standard of living]] after independence, the night soil system in Singapore is now merely a curious anecdote from the time of colonial rule when new systems developed.

The collection method is generally very manual and heavily relies on close human contact with the waste. During the Nationalist era when the [[Kuomintang]] ruled [[mainland China]], as well as Chinatown in Singapore, the night soil collector usually arrived with spare and relatively empty [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s to exchange for the full honey buckets. The method of transporting the honey buckets from individual households to collection centers was very similar to delivering [[water supply|water supplies]] by an unskilled laborer, with the exception that the item being transported was not at all [[drinking water|potable]]  and it was being delivered ''from'' the household, rather than ''to'' the household. The collector would hang full honey buckets onto each end of a pole he carried on his shoulder and then proceeded to carry it through the streets until he reached the collection point.

Hong Kong has a similar euphemism for night soil collection, {{lang|zh|倒夜香}} ''dàoyèxiāng'', which literally means "emptying nocturnal fragrance".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Japan ===
{{see also|Toilets in Japan}}
The reuse of [[Human feces|feces]] as fertilizer was common in Japan. In [[Edo]] city, compost merchants gathered feces to sell for farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. [[Human waste|Human excreta]] of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, P., Walthall. A., &amp; Palias, J. (2006). Modern east asia: A cultural, social, &amp; political history. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston &amp; New York. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after [[World War II]], both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is used for night soil fertilization{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. The presence of the [[Occupation of Japan|United States occupying force]], by whom the use of human waste as fertilizer was seen as unhygienic and suspect, was also a contributing factor: "the Occupationaires condemned the practice, and tried to prevent their compatriots from eating vegetables and fruit from the local markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|title=Pictures|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=4 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615140135/http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|archivedate=15 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico and Central America===
Various [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations used human feces to fertilize their crops. The Aztecs, in particular, are well known for their famous [[chinampa]]s, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] in the year 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico." Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; They were constructed by first fencing an area between 30 m x 2.5 m and 91 m x 9 m, using wattle.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, P. (1976). Mysteries of the Mexican pyramids. Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited: Toronto. pp. 299 {{ISBN|0-06-014324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge, M et al. (2011). Mathematical accuracy of Aztec land surveys assessed from records in the Codex Vergara. PNAS: University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Then filled in with mud, sediment, feces and decaying vegetation. To stabilize the chinampas, trees were often planted on the corners, primarily ''āhuexōtl'' (''[[Salix bonplandiana]]'') or ''āhuēhuētl'' (''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Taxodium mucronatum". The Gymnosperm Database. Retrieved 2009-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinampas were very common before Spanish conquest and are still found in Mexico today.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Gladstone sanitary ware night soil containers 3928.JPG|thumb|Industrially produced "sanitary ware", now in the [[Gladstone Pottery Museum]]]]
A [[gong farmer]] was the term used in Tudor England for a person employed to remove human excrement from privies and cesspits.  Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries.

The rapid industrialisation of England during the nineteenth century led to mass urbanisation, over-crowding, and epidemics. One response was the development of the "Rochdale system", in which the town council arranged for the collection of the night soil from the outhouse attached to each dwelling or group of dwellings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calow|first1=Dennis|title=Home Sweet Home: A century of Leicester housing 1814-1914|date=2007|publisher=Univ of Leicester|url=http://cdm15407.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15407coll5/id/1181|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[pail closet]]). A later response was the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]], which led to the creation of [[Byelaw terraced house|byelaws regarding housing]], mandating one outhouse per house. These were still "earth closets" (not water closets i.e. WCs) and so still depended on the "night soil men" or "nightmen".

== Current examples ==

===India===
People responsible for the disposal of night soil are considered [[Dalit|untouchables]] in India. The practice of untouchability was banned by law when India gained independence, but the tradition widely persists as the law is difficult to enforce.  This "[[manual scavenging]]" is now illegal in all Indian states.

The Indian government's Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment stated in 2003 that 676,000 people were employed in the manual collection of human waste in India. Social organizations have estimated that up to 1.3 million Indians collect such waste. Further, workers in the collection of human waste were confined to marriage amongst themselves, thereby leading to a waste-collecting caste, which passes its profession on from generation to generation.

Employment of Manual Scavengers and Creation of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 has made manual scavenging illegal.

=== Japan ===
Modern Japan still has areas with ongoing night soil collection and disposal. The Japanese name for the "outhouse within the house" style toilet, where night soil is collected for disposal, is ''kumitori benjo'' (汲み取り便所). The proper disposal or [[recycling]] of sewage remains an important research area that is highly political.

=== Biophysics is ===
* An [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* A scientific field (a branch of [[science]]) &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.

'''Philosophy for Children''', sometimes abbreviated to '''P4C''', is a movement that aims to teach [[reasoning]] and argumentative skills to [[children]]. There are also related methods sometimes called "''Philosophy for Young People''" or "''Philosophy for Kids''". Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Splitter and Ann M. Sharp, Teaching for Better Thinking, ACER: Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a long tradition within [[higher education]] of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges (see ''"[[philosophy education]]"'').&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Philosophy 4 Skool, by Michael Brett, http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/philinschool.htm accessed July 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the noted [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] was of the impression that children were not capable of [[critical thinking]] until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is [[empirical evidence]] that teaching children [[reasoning]] skills early in life greatly improves other [[cognitive]] and [[academic]] skills and greatly assists learning in general.&lt;ref&gt;k.J. Topping and S. Trickey (2007) "Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry for School Children", British Journal of Educational Psychology, Dec 77(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "inquiry" is preferred to "lesson" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.

==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==

One of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called "the most influential figure" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt; at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue. Lipman's ideas about learning, pedagogy and curriculum are heavily influenced by the educational and philosophical ideas of the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Bleazby, Jennifer (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools. Routledge: New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the materials used by the IAPC are philosophical children's novels that were published by Lipman, including ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'', which he published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/children/#2&lt;/ref&gt; Others have built on Lipman's ideas and developed further teaching resources and learning activities that compliment his original Philosophy for Children novels and pedagogical approach, such as Phil Cam's popular teaching resources &lt;ref&gt;Cam, Phil (2012) Teaching Ethics in Schools. ACER: Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cam, Phil (1993-97) Thinking Stories, Hale and Iremonger.&lt;/ref&gt; Lipman wrote the world's first systematic pre-college philosophy curriculum and created both masters and doctoral programs in the field of Philosophy for Children. He also founded ''Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/thinking-journal/ Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gareth Matthews]] worked with a variety of students, but primarily with students in late primary school (5th grade and thereabouts). Matthews' method was to get the students to actively create philosophical settings, to “make the philosophical problem their own”. One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book ''Dialogues With Children''.

Karin Murris of Witwatersrand University, South Africa and Joanna Haynes of Plymouth University, England, have popularised the use of children's picture books as an alternative to purpose-written materials. Tom Wartenberg of Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts has also written a large number of discussion plans for philosophising with picture books.

Jana Mohr Lone has written about children's philosophical thinking and the benefits of encouraging children to engage in philosophical inquiry.

Ellen Duthie, together with her team based in Spain, researches and develops the possibilities of [http://www.wonderponderonline.com Visual Philosophy for Children] (and adults), exploring different ways of engaging and stimulating philosophical dialogue through visuals in her Wonder Ponder series of books.    

There is particular diversity in the UK, owing to the large number of competing and collaborating freelance trainers each emphasising different strands of the pedagogy. Roger Sutcliffe's practice includes the use of news stories; Steve Williams has emphasised the importance of dialogues that model argument as well as raising philosophical issues; [[Will ord|Will Ord]] emphasises the use of striking photos, often containing contrasts that suggest opposing concepts.;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkingeducation.co.uk/p4c.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Buckley advocates a more physical, game-based approach and "Philosophy in Role", in which children philosophise within a story as characters confronted with a variety of problems.

[http://www.sapere.org.uk/ SAPERE] is the UK's leading provider of P4C training.  Registered in 1994, the charity has trained over 27,000 teachers and other individuals in the use of P4C.  SAPERE's mission is to advance the educational, personal and social development of young people, especially those facing disadvantage, through the promotion of P4C.  The organisation's work gained national prominence in 2015 when Durham University School of Education published results of a randomised control trial of P4C with over 3,000 primary school students.  The study was sponsored by the [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/ Education Endowment Foundation]. The [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evaluation/projects/philosophy-for-children/ study] found that P4C advanced attainment for all students and had a particularly strong impact on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Co-founded by [[Peter Worley]] and Emma Worley, The [http://www.philosophy-foundation.org/ Philosophy Foundation]'s specialist philosophy teachers (all philosophy graduates) specifically use philosophical material, including thought-experiments and stories or activities that lead to questions from the philosophical canon. They make use of carefully structured questioning strategies and also the introduction of thinking skills in order to develop good thinking habits from a young age. The questioning strategies are used to introduce dialectic along Platonic lines and in order to maintain philosophical focus. Uniquely they have a methodology that introduces writing and meta-analysis with older primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;For more on The [[Philosophy Foundation]]'s methodology see 'The If Machine: Philosophical Enquiry in the Classroom' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120504005234/http://www.philosophy-foundation.org/shop/overview] by Peter Worley.&lt;/ref&gt;

UK based Thinking Space is Grace Robinson, a philosopher and a network of associated philosophers and educators whose work is characterised by playful and experimental collaborations. This work with a range of practitioners, among them artists, scientists, and academics, aims to bring philosophical issues alive for children and young people. Thinking Space's most notable collaboration is with The University of Leeds on 'Leeds Philosophy Exchange'; an accredited undergraduate course in which philosophy students facilitate philosophical enquiry in local primary schools, alongside teachers trained by Thinking Space in P4C.

A particular way of doing philosophy with children is illustrated by the work of [[Christopher R. Phillips|Chris Phillips]] with the Philosophers Club at Cesar Chavez Elementary School in the [[Mission District, San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Socrates' Children: A volunteer teaches kids philosophy -- and how to listen to one another |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/01/22/MN18636.DTL |date=1999-01-22 |last=Moore |first=Teresa |publisher=SFGate |access-date=2006-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112205525/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1999%2F01%2F22%2FMN18636.DTL |archive-date=2007-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor William Barry]] of [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] is pioneering a new approach to p4c called Philosophy for Children and Community (P4c²) in the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area. His contribution to evolving the idea of p4c involves young people becoming novice critical theory action researchers and meaningful members of communities of inquiry focused on human flourishing for every person. Another key component of Barry's P4c² is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory. The Institute of P4c² has recently been developed by Living Leadership Today, LLC Founder Maria Rachelle in Silicon Valley California and resulted in the creation of the online international scholarly journal, the ''International Journal of Transformative Research [http://IJTR.net].

==Programs, competitions, and publications==
There are a number of college-level academic philosophy programs in the United States that do outreach to public schools, most notably at the [http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/ University of Washington], University of Massachusetts - Boston, [[University of Chicago]],  [[California State University Long Beach]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Montclair State University]], [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Hawai`i at Manoa]], [[Notre Dame de Namur University]], [[Creighton University]], and [[Plattsburgh State University Of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plattsburgh.edu/academics/philosophy/faculty/dixon.php Plattsburgh State University Of New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Washington, the Center for Philosophy for Children educates University of Washington graduate and undergraduate students about how to facilitate philosophy sessions, and then sends them into Seattle classrooms with supervision and mentoring from experienced instructors. This program has introduced philosophy to thousands of public school students, and runs many year-long weekly philosophy sessions in Seattle public school classrooms. The Center has four graduate fellowships in pre-college philosophy and also runs regular workshops and programs for teachers, parents and other adults about how to introduce philosophy to young people.

At the University of Chicago, students in the college teach in schools on Chicago South Side through the University's [[Civic Knowledge Project]]. The class, known as [[Winning Words]], is an after school program that works with elementary, middle and high school students in Chicago. The program aims to engage and inspire local youth through an education in philosophy, reasoning and the verbal arts of dialogue and rhetoric; building self-confidence and exposing its students to a wide range of philosophical material. Recognized by the [[American Philosophical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100324132609/http://plato-apa.org/organizations/centers-institutes/ American Philosophical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; the program provides an introduction to philosophy and Socratic dialogue and includes writing, public speaking, debate, drama, poetry and art. The material uses the Socratic method to engage students and to encourage the use of critical thinking, reasoning and expression. Such modes of thought and communication foster the sense of wonder that is at the root of serious introspection, intellectual growth, and ethical reflection. February 2012, the American Philosophical Association's Committee on Pre-Collegiate Philosophy featured Winning Words and the Civic Knowledge Project in its Central Division meeting.

Before the Department of Education cut funding for such programs in the early 1990s, there were over 5,000 programs in K-12 schools nationwide which engaged young people in philosophical reflection or critical thinking, more generally. This number has dropped substantially.

The [[Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]] (IAPC), which has been recognized by the APA for excellence and innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115150957/http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/index.shtml |archivedate=2011-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes [[Lipman]]'s method, exposing children to philosophically stimulating narrative to encourage them to create and ask their own philosophical questions, actively in the [[K-12]] classroom through a longstanding partnership with the [[Montclair public school system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montclair.k12.nj.us/WebPage.aspx?Id=1 Montclair public school system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209050236/http://www.montclair.k12.nj.us/WebPage.aspx?Id=1 |date=2011-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students are encouraged to ask their questions and the philosophical facilitator (a member of the IAPC) helps the children to develop philosophical skills and dispositions of critical, caring, and creative thinking in order to get the young students to come to reasonable judgment about what is "best to do or believe," in response to the initial question. IAPC has a large teacher preparation component and provides teacher manuals that include discussion plans specifically designed to assist in the facilitation of philosophical discussions that are general enough to answer most student questions. In addition to working directly with schoolchildren, members of the IAPC work with several constituencies, including professional and pre-professional educators, educational administrators and policy-makers, and faculty and students of education, philosophy and related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/about.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116102600/http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/about.shtml |archivedate=2011-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IAPC has trained educators worldwide to successfully implement their curriculum in their home states and countries.
Philosophy and Children organization offers introductory [[workshop]]s and Certificate courses in schools and graduate teachers in [[Australia]].

The [[Philosophy Learning and Teaching Organization]] (PLATO) is a national organization in the USA that provides support and resources for bringing philosophy into pre-college classrooms.

There is an annual ''[[Philosophy Slam]]'' competition for kids in grades K-12. Younger children are encouraged to submit artwork which illustrates their philosophical reflections while older children submit increasingly sophisticated written work.

In the UK the University of Leeds now offers a students into schools programme called Leeds Philosophy Exchange, led by Grace Robinson. The University of Bristol is now working on Bristol Philosophy Exchange applying a similar model in which philosophy students and primary school teachers exchange skills and knowledge in weekly philosophical enquiry with children.

Educational charity The Philosophy Foundation (formerly The Philosophy Shop) trains philosophy graduates to do philosophy with primary and secondary school children, and places them in schools nationwide. They also train teachers in the transferable skills of philosophy (questioning, thinking skills and discourse skills), and are encouraging an enquiry based approach to education at all levels, including tertiary.

[[SAPERE]] is a UK charity that trains teachers in P4C nationwide.

[[Thinking Space]] works with schools to devise creative philosophy projects that combine the expertise of philosophers and teachers.

The growth of a community between European philosophy with children ([[PWC]]) practitioners culminated in the establishment of  “Stichting [[SOPHIA (European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children)|SOPHIA]] —The European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children” in 1993, with Eulalia Bosch (Catalonia) as its President, and Karel van der Leeuw (the Netherlands) Secretary.  Following the motto of the European Community (now the [[European Union|EU]]) – ‘ unity through diversity’, [[SOPHIA (European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children)|SOPHIA]] supported the development of doing philosophy with children within all the different European cultures and languages, and nurtured the community among practitioners as the foundation for collaborative work and mutual development. Many groundbreaking and innovative projects have resulted from SOPHIA members working together, often funded by the EU. For example, pwc projects working with [[art]], [[citizenship]], [[excluded]] children, [[architecture]], [[anti-racism]], [[music]], [[community development]] and more.

In Australasia an extensive P4C network has developed since the 1980s.  Associations have been established in each Australian state and also the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA) has been instrumental in promoting P4C throughout Australasia. FAPSA is a professional non-profit organization promoting philosophy in schools and representing the interests of its affiliated associations across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The Federation’s primary purpose is to facilitate the educational aims and objectives of its affiliated associations. FAPSA has an official journal called the ''[[Journal for Philosophy in Schools]]''

In 2007 a competition was created in Perth Western Australia called a [[Philosothon]]. This competition promotes P4C and has been phenomenally successful over its short history. Each Australian state now holds an annual Philosothon and FAPSA hosts the Australasian Philosothon in different states each year. There are over 400 schools involved in Philosothons in Australasia, Europe and the UK.

===Journals===
There have been several academic [[Academic journal|journal]]s devoted to publishing work regarding philosophy for/with children.
* ''[[Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children]]'' contains some work by young philosophers but consists primarily of work by adults about their work doing philosophy for children including lesson plans, [[developmental psychology]], and work from the emerging field called "[[Hermeneutics of childhood]]" which is a [[multi-disciplinary]] approach to considering the [[intellectual]] and [[emotional]] life of children.
* "Critical and Creative Thinking: The Australasian Journal of Philosophy in Education"
* "[http://journal.viterbo.edu/index.php/atpp Analytic Teaching and Philosophical Praxis]"
* "Childhood and Philosophy"
* ''[[Questions: Philosophy for Young People]]'' has as its mission the publication of work that features the philosophical reflections of children, themselves. Thus, it contains essays authored by children, transcripts of classroom dialogues with some commentary by moderators, artwork by children, and so forth. It also publishes the winners of the [[Philosophy Slam competition]].
* ''[[Journal for Philosophy in Schools]]'' (JPS) is the official journal of The Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA). The focus of the journal is research into philosophy with school-aged children.

===Books===
A number of books have been published on philosophy for children other than those mentioned above by Matthews and Lipman. Some are intended to be read by children, others by children with their parents, and still others by philosophers, educators, and policy-makers considering the merits of K-12 philosophy programs. A partial (by no means exhaustive or representative) list includes the books:

'''Problem analysis''' or the '''problem frames approach''' is an approach to software [[requirements analysis]]. It was developed by British software consultant [[Michael A. Jackson]] in the 1990s.

== History ==
The problem frames approach was first sketched by Jackson in his book ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'' (1995) and in a number of articles in various journals devoted to software engineering.  It has received its fullest description in his ''Problem Frames: Analysing and Structuring Software Development Problems'' (2001).

A session on problem frames was part of the 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050126191532/http://www.sse.uni-essen.de/refsq/downloads/summary-refsq03.pdf 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~karlc/ProblemFramesWorkshop.htm First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE’04 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.  One outcome of that workshop was a 2005 special issue on problem frames in the ''International Journal of Information and Software Technology''.

The Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819174609/http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, China. The Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames (IWAAPF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://icse08.upb.de/program/workshops.html Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2008 in Leipzig, Germany.  In 2010, the IWAAPF workshops were replaced by the International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation (IWAAPO).  IWAAPO broadens the focus of the workshops to include alternative and complementary approaches to software development that share an emphasis on problem analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaapo.org/ International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111084248/http://www.iwaapo.org/ |date=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IWAAPO-2010 was held as part of ICSE 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.co.za/ICSE2010/3-EVENTS/WORKSHOPS/W23.html IWAAPO-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today research on the problem frames approach is being conducted at a number of universities, most notably at the [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom  as part of its ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme&lt;ref&gt;[http://computing-research.open.ac.uk/read/index.php?page=topic&amp;group=RPSS&amp;theme=READ ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: "Relating software requirements and architectures using problem frames" by Hall, J.G.; Jackson, M.; Laney, R.C.; Nuseibeh, B.; Rapanotti, L., in ''Proceedings of the IEEE Joint International Conference on Requirements Engineering'' (2002), pp. 137–144&lt;/ref&gt; Interesting work is being done by Professors Lavazza and del Bianco on using problem frames with UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaria.org/conferences2007/filesICSEA07/UMLreqs.pdf |title=Using problem frames with UML |author1=Lavazza, Luigi |author2=Del Bianco, Vieri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas in the problem frames approach have been generalized into the concepts of [[problem-oriented development]] (POD) and problem-oriented engineering (POE), of which [[problem-oriented software engineering]] (POSE) is a particular sub-category.  The first [http://poc-workshop.eu International Workshop on Problem-Oriented Development] was held in June 2009.

== Overview ==

=== Fundamental philosophy ===
''Problem analysis'' or the ''problem frames approach'' is an approach — a set of concepts — to be used when gathering requirements and creating specifications for computer software. Its basic philosophy is strikingly different from other software requirements methods in insisting that:

* The best way to approach requirements analysis is through a process of parallel — not hierarchical — decomposition of user requirements.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
  |last=Jackson 
  |first=Michael   
  |title=Problem Decomposition for Reuse
  |year=1995  
  |pages=1, 2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* User requirements are about relationships in the real world—the ''application domain'' – not about the software system or even the interface with the software system.

{{quote|
It is more helpful ... to recognize that the solution is located in the computer and
its software, and the problem is in the world outside.
... The computers can provide solutions to these problems because they
are connected to the world outside.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

{{quote|
The moral is clear:
to study and analyse a problem you must focus on studying and analysing the problem world
in some depth,
and in your investigations you must be willing to
travel some distance away from the computer. ... ''[In a call forwarding problem...]'' You need to describe what's there – people and offices and holidays
and moving office and delegating responsibility – and what effects ''[in the problem world]''
you would like the system to achieve – 
calls to A's number must reach A, and 
''[when B is on vacation, and C is temporarily working at D's desk]'' 
calls to B's or C's number must reach C.

None of these appear in the interface with the computer.... They are
all deeper into the world than that.

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The approach uses three sets of conceptual tools.

=== Tools for describing specific problems ===

Concepts used for describing specific problems include: 
''phenomena'' (of various kinds, including ''events''), 
''problem context'', 
''problem domain'',
''solution domain'' (aka the ''machine''), 
''shared phenomena'' (which exist in ''domain interfaces''), 
''domain requirements'' (which exist in the problem domains) and 
''specifications'' (which exist at the problem domain:machine interface).

The graphical tools for describing problems are the ''context diagram'' and the 
''problem diagram''.

=== Tools for describing classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The Problem Frames Approach includes concepts for describing classes of problems.  A recognized class of problems is called a ''problem frame'' (roughly analogous to a '''design pattern''').

In a problem frame, domains are given general names and described in terms of their important characteristics. A domain, for example, may be classified as ''causal'' (reacts in a deterministic, predictable way to events) or ''biddable'' (can be bid, or asked, to respond to events, but cannot be expected always to react to events in any predictable, deterministic way).  (A biddable domain usually consists of people.)

The graphical tool for representing a problem frame is a ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks generally like a problem diagram except for a few minor differences—domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== A list of recognized classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The first group of problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

== Describing problems ==

=== The problem context ===
Problem analysis considers a software application to be a kind of software ''machine''. A software development project aims to change the problem context by creating a software machine and adding it to the problem context, where it will bring about certain desired effects.

The particular portion of the problem context that is of interest in connection with a particular problem — the particular portion of the problem context that forms the context of the problem — is called the ''application domain''.

After the software development project has been finished, and the software machine has been inserted into the problem context, the problem context will contain both the application domain and the machine. At that point, the situation will look like this:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext1.svg|220px|center]]

The problem context contains the machine and the application domain. The ''machine interface'' is where the Machine and the application domain meet and interact.

The same situation can be shown in a different kind of diagram, a ''context diagram'', this way:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext2.png|center|]]

=== The context diagram ===
The problem analyst's first task is to truly understand the problem.  That means understanding the context in which the problem is set.  And that means drawing a ''context diagram.''

Here is Jackson's description of examining the problem context, in this case the context for a bridge to be built:

: You're an engineer planning to build a bridge across a river. So you visit the site. Standing on one bank of the river, you look at the surrounding land, and at the river traffic. You feel how exposed the place is, and how hard the wind is blowing and how fast the river is running. You look at the bank and wonder what faults a geological survey will show up in the rocky terrain. You picture to yourself the bridge that you are going to build. (''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'': "The Problem Context")

An analyst trying to understand a software development problem must go through the same process as the bridge engineer. He starts by examining the various problem domains in the application domain. These domains form the context into which the planned Machine must fit. Then he imagines how the Machine will fit into this context. And then he constructs a context diagram showing his vision of the problem context with the Machine installed in it.

The context diagram shows the various ''problem domains'' in the application domain, their connections, and the Machine and its connections to (some of) the problem domains. Here is what a context diagram looks like.

[[Image:ProblemFramesContextDiagram1.svg|center|]]

This diagram shows:

* the ''machine'' to be built. The dark border helps to identify the box that represents the Machine.
* the ''problem domains'' that are relevant to the problem.
* the solid lines represent ''domain interfaces'' — areas where domains overlap and share phenomena in common.

A domain is simply a part of the world that we are interested in.  It consists of ''phenomena'' — individuals, events, states of affairs, relationships, and behaviors.

A domain interface is an area where domains connect and communicate.  Domain interfaces are not data flows or messages.  An interface is a place where domains partially overlap, so that the phenomena in the interface are ''shared phenomena'' — they exist in both of the overlapping domains.

You can imagine domains as being like primitive one-celled organisms (like amoebas).  They are able to extend parts of themselves into pseudopods. Imagine that two such organisms extend pseudopods toward each other in a sort of handshake, and that the cellular material in the area where they are shaking hands is mixing, so that it belongs to both of them.  That's an interface.

In the following diagram, X is the interface between domains A and B.  Individuals that exist or events that occur in X, exist or occur in both A and B.  
 
[[Image:ProblemFramesInterfaces.svg|center|]]

Shared individuals, states and events may look differently to the domains that share them.  Consider for example an interface between a computer and a keyboard. When the keyboard domain sees an event ''Keyboard operator presses the spacebar'' the computer will see the same event as ''Byte hex("20") appears in the input buffer.''

=== Problem diagrams ===
The problem analyst's basic tool for describing a problem is a ''problem diagram''. Here is a generic problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram1.svg|center|]]

In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows:

* a dotted oval representing the ''requirement'' to bring about certain effects in the problem domains.
* dotted lines representing ''requirement references'' — references in the requirement to phenomena in the problem domains.

An interface that connects a problem domain to the machine is called a ''specification interface'' and the phenomena in the specification interface are called ''specification phenomena''. The  goal of the requirements analyst is to develop a specification for the behavior that the Machine must exhibit at the Machine interface in order to satisfy the requirement.

Here is an example of a real, if simple, problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram2.png|center|]]

This problem might be part of a computer system in a hospital. In the hospital, patients are connected to sensors that can detect and measure their temperature and blood pressure. The requirement is to construct a Machine that can display information about patient conditions on a panel in the nurses station.

The name of the requirement is "Display ~ Patient Condition".  The tilde (~) indicates that the requirement is about a relationship or correspondence between the panel display and patient conditions. The arrowhead indicates that the requirement reference connected to the Panel Display domain is also a requirement constraint. That means that the requirement contains some kind of stipulation that the Panel display must meet. In short, the requirement is that ''The panel display must display information that matches and accurately reports the condition of the patients.''

== Describing classes of problems ==

=== Problem frames ===
A ''problem frame'' is a description of a recognizable class of problems, where the class of problems has a known solution.  In a sense, problem frames are problem patterns.

Each problem frame has its own ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks essentially like a problem diagram, but instead of showing specific domains and requirements, it shows types of domains and types of requirements; domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== Variant frames ===
In ''Problem Frames'' Jackson discussed variants of the five basic problem
frames that he had identified.  A variant typically adds a domain to the problem context.

* a ''description variant'' introduces a description lexical domain 
* an ''operator variant'' introduces an operator
* a ''connection variant'' introduces a connection domain between the machine and the central domain with which it interfaces
* a ''control variant'' introduces no new domain; it changes the control characteristics of interface phenomena

=== Problem concerns ===
Jackson also discusses certain kinds of concerns that arise when working with problem frames.

Particular concerns 
* overrun
* initialization
* reliability
* identities
* completeness

Composition concerns 
* commensurable descriptions  
* consistency  
* precedence  
* interference  
* synchronization

== Recognized problem frames ==

The first problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

=== Required-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled so that it satisfies certain conditions.  The problem is to build a machine that will impose that control.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesRequiredBehaviorFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Commanded-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled in accordance with commands issued by an operator.  The problem is to build a machine that will accept the operator's commands and impose the control accordingly.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesCommandedBehaviorFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Information display problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world about whose states and behavior certain information is continually needed.  The problem is to build a machine that will obtain this information from the world and present it at the required place in the required form.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesInformationDisplayFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Simple workpieces problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''A tool is needed to allow a user to create and edit a certain class of computer-processible text or graphic objects, or similar structures, so that they can be subsequently copied, printed, analyzed or used in other ways.  The problem is to build a machine that can act as this tool.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesSimpleWorkpiecesFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Transformation problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There are some given computer-readable input files whose data must be transformed to give certain required output files.  The output data must be in a particular format, and it must be derived from the input data according to certain rules.  The problem is to build a machine that will produce the required outputs from the inputs.''

== Problem analysis and the software development process ==
When problem analysis is incorporated into the [[software development process]], the software development lifecycle starts with the problem analyst, who studies the situation and:
* creates a context diagram
* gathers a list of requirements and adds a requirements oval to the context diagram, creating a grand "all-in-one" problem diagram.  (However, in many cases actually creating an all-in-one problem diagram may be impractical or unhelpful: there will be too many requirements references criss-crossing the diagram to make it very useful.)
* decomposes the all-in-one problem and problem diagram into simpler problems and simpler problem diagrams.  These problems are ''projections'', not subsets, of the all-in-one diagram.
* continues to decompose problems until each problem is simple enough that it can be seen to be an instance of a recognized problem frame.  Each subproblem description includes a description of the specification interfaces for the machine to be built.

At this point, problem analysis — ''problem decomposition'' — is complete.  The next step is to reverse the process and to build the desired software system though a process of ''solution composition''.

The solution composition process is not yet well understood, and is still very much a research topic. Extrapolating from hints in ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'', we can guess that the software development process would continue with the developers, who would:

* compose the multiple subproblem machine specifications into the specification for a single all-in-one machine: a specification for a software machine that satisfies all of the customer's requirements.  This is a non-trivial activity — the composition process may very well raise ''composition problems'' that need to be solved.
* implement the all-in-one machine by going through the traditional code/test/deploy process.

== Similar approaches ==
There are a few other software development ideas that are similar in some ways to problem analysis.

* The notion of a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] is similar to Jackson's notion of a problem frame.  It differs in that a design pattern is used for recognizing and handling design issues (often design issues in specific object-oriented programming languages such as C++ or Java) rather than for recognizing and handling requirements issues. Furthermore, one difference is that design patterns cover ''solutions'' while in problem frames ''problems'' are represented. However, the design patterns also tend to account for semantic outcomes that are not native to the programming language they are to be implemented in.  So, another difference is that problem frames is a native meta-notation for the domain of problems, whereas design patterns are a catalogue of technical debt left behind by the language implementers.
* ''Aspect-oriented programming'', AOP (also known as [[aspect-oriented software development]], AOSD) is similarly interested in parallel decomposition, which addresses what AOP proponents call ''cross-cutting concerns'' or ''aspects''. AOP addresses concerns that are much closer to the design and code-generation phase than to the requirements analysis phase. 
* AOP has moved into requirement engineering notations such as ITU-T Z.151 User Requirements Notation (URN).  In URN the AOP is over the all the intentional elements. AOP can also be applied over requirement modelling that uses problem frames as a heuristic.  URN models driven with problem frame thinking, and interleaved with aspects, allows for inclusion of architectural tactics into the requirement model.
* Martin Fowler's book '''Analysis Patterns''' is very similar to problem analysis in its search for patterns.  It doesn't really present a new requirements analysis method, however.  And the notion of parallel decomposition — which is so important for problem analysis — is not a part of Fowler's analysis patterns.
* Jon G. Hall, Lucia Rapanotti, together with Jackson, have developed the Problem Oriented Software Engineering (POSE) framework&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Hall, L. Rapanotti, and M. Jackson. Problem-oriented software engineering: solving the package router control problem. IEEE Trans. Software Eng., 2008. {{doi|10.1109/TSE.2007.70769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which shares the problem frames foundations. Since, 2005, Hall and Rapanotti have extended POSE to Problem Oriented Engineering (POE), which provides a framework for engineering design, including a development process model and assurance-driven design,&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Hall and L. Rapanotti. Assurance-driven design. In Proceedings of the third International Conference on Software Engineering Advances. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be scalable to projects that include many stake-holders and that combine diverse engineering disciplines such as software and education provision.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rapanotti and J. G. Hall. Designing an online part-time master of philosophy. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services. IEEE Press, May 24–28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27261">The '''psychology of music preference''' refers as the [[psychology|psychological factors]] behind peoples' different music preferences. Music is heard by people daily in many parts of the world, and affects people in various ways from emotion regulation to cognitive development, along with providing a means for self-expression. Music training has been shown to help improve intellectual development and ability, though no connection has been found as to how it affects emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=Glen E.|author2=Mankarious, Monika |title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood|journal=Emotion|date=October 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous studies have been conducted to show that individual personality can have an effect on music preference, mostly using personality, though a recent meta-analysis has shown that personality in itself explains little variance in music preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schäfer|first=Thomas|last2=Mehlhorn|first2=Claudia|title=Can personality traits predict musical style preferences?

== Personality and music preference ==

===Personality===
Various questionnaires have been created to both measure the big five personality traits and musical preferences. The majority of studies attempting to find the correlation between personality and musical preferences administered questionnaires to measure both traits.&lt;ref name="Zwiegenhaft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zweigenhaft|first=Richard L.|title=A Do Re Mi Encore|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=45–55|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.29.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Fagan, Patrick |author3=Furnham, Adrian |title=Personality and uses of music as predictors of preferences for music consensually classified as happy, sad, complex, and social.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1037/a0019210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Swami, Viren|author3=Furnham, Adrian|author4=Maakip, Ismail|date=1 January 2009|title=The Big Five Personality Traits and Uses of Music|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=30|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.30.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopacz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopacz|first=Malgorzata|title=Personality and music preferences: The influence of personality traits on preferences regarding musical elements|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=216–239|doi=10.1093/jmt/42.3.216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmeyer|first=Alexandra|author2=Guglhör-Rudan, Angelika |author3=Tarnai, Christian |title=What Do Music Preferences Reveal About Personality?|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rentfrow|first=Peter J.|author2=Gosling, Samuel D. |title=The do re mi's of everyday life: The structure and personality correlates of music preferences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2003|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1236–1256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.6.1236|pmid=12793587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used questionnaires to determine personality traits, and then asked participants to rate musical excerpts on scales such as liking, perceived complexity, emotions felt, and more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonneville-Roussy|first=Arielle|last2=Rentfrow|first2=Peter J.|last3=Xu|first3=Man K.|last4=Potter|first4=Jeff|title=Music through the ages: Trends in musical engagement and preferences from adolescence through middle adulthood.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033770|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=105|issue=4|pages=703–717|doi=10.1037/a0033770}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E.

In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Dave |author2=Morizot, Julien |author3=Gaudreau, Patrick|title=Personality Metatraits and Music Preferences in Adolescence: A Pilot Study|journal=International Journal of Adolescence and Youth|date=27 March 2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=289–301|doi=10.1080/02673843.2010.9748036}}&lt;/ref&gt; but each trait is still worth discussing. The personality traits have also been shown to correlate significantly with the emotional effect music has on people. Individual personality differences can help predict the emotional intensity and valence derived from music.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Openness to experience ====

Of all the traits, openness to experience has been shown to have the greatest effect upon genre preference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zwiegenhaft /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=E. C.|author2=Silvia, P. J. |title=Shivers and Timbres: Personality and the Experience of Chills From Music|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=7 October 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1177/1948550610386810|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Shivers_2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, those rated high in openness to experience prefer more music categorized as complex and novel like classical, jazz, and eclecticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Peter G. |author2=de Ruyter, Boris |author3=Bouwhuis, Don G. |title=Toward a better understanding of the relation between music preference, listening behavior, and personality|journal=Psychology of Music|date=16 March 2011|volume=40|issue=4|pages=411–428|doi=10.1177/0305735610388897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and intense and rebellious music.&lt;ref name="rentfrow goldberg levitin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rentfrow|first=Peter J.|author2=Goldberg, Lewis R. |author3=Levitin, Daniel J. |title=The structure of musical preferences: A five-factor model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1139–1157|doi=10.1037/a0022406|pmc=3138530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zwiegenhaft /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 18"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=R. A.|title=Music preferences and personality among Japanese university students|journal=International Journal of Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=47|issue=4|pages=259–268|doi=10.1080/00207594.2011.631544|pmid=22248342}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, reflective and complex genres included classical, blues, jazz, and folk music, while intense and rebellious genres included rock, alternative, and heavy metal music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt; One of the facets of openness to experience is aesthetic appreciation, which is why researchers generally explain the high positive correlation between openness and liking complex music.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas |author2=Fagan, Patrick |author3=Furnham, Adrian|title=Personality and uses of music as predictors of preferences for music consensually classified as happy, sad, complex, and social|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=November 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1037/a0019210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looking at how personality traits affect music-induced emotion found that of all the traits, openness to experience was the best predictor of higher emotionally intense reactions to sad and slow music.  The most common feelings described from sad music were nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder, and openness to experience correlated positively with all these feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Thompson, William F. |author3=McIlwain, Doris |author4=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Who enjoys listening to sad music and why?|journal=Music Perception|date=February 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=311–317|doi=10.1525/mp.2012.29.3.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sad music has also been theorized to allow for greater experience of aesthetic experiences and beauty.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski thompson" /&gt;  Furthermore, open individuals show a preference for diverse musical styles, but do not prefer popular forms of contemporary music, indicating that there are limits to this openness.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli" /&gt; However, this is only true up to a certain point, as another study looked at music's ability to produce "chills" in the listeners.  Although this study found that openness was the best predictor of genre preference, there is no way to use openness to experience to predict who gets chills from music.  Instead, the only measure for that was frequency of listening to music and the self-rated value of the importance of music in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=Emily C.|author2=Silvia, Paul J. |title=Shivers and Timbres: Personality and the Experience of Chills From Music|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=7 October 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1177/1948550610386810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study examined how openness to experience and frequency of listening are related and how they affect music preference.  While listening to classical music excerpts, those rated high in openness tended to decrease in liking music faster during repeated listenings, as opposed to those scoring low in openness, who tended to like music more with repeated plays.  This suggests novelty in music is an important quality for people high in openness to experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Patrick G|author2=Schellenberg, Glen E. |title=Interactive effects of personality and frequency of exposure on liking for music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=20 October 2010|volume=50|pages=175–179|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.021|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study had people take a personality test before and after listening to classical music with and without written lyrics in front of them.  Both the music with and without lyrics showed some effect at actually changing people's self-rated personality traits, most significantly in terms of openness to experience, which showed some significant increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djikic|first=Maja|title=The effect of music and lyrics on personality|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=August 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1037/a0022313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of personality affecting music preference, here classical music altered the assessment of their own personalities and make people assess themselves as more open.

Openness to experience is also positively correlated with intellectual or cognitive use of music, which means that this individual enjoys analyzing complex musical compositions.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Furthermore, individuals more open prefer a greater number of melodic themes in a work of music.&lt;ref name="Steele young"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of myers-briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55|pmid=21866713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;

==== Conscientiousness ====
Conscientiousness is negatively correlated with intense and rebellious music, such as rock and heavy metal music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt; While previous studies have found a relationship between conscientiousness and emotional regulation, these results do not apply cross culturally—specifically, researchers did not find this relationship in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==== Extraversion ====

Extraversion is another good predictor of music genre preference and music use.  Energetic extroverts have been linked to preferences in happy, upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, extroverts tend to listen to music more and have background music present in their lives more often.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic2010" /&gt; One study compared introverts and extroverts to see who would be more easily distracted by background music with and without lyrics.  It was assumed that since extroverts listen to background music more they would be able to tune it out better, but that was proved untrue.  No matter how much music people listen to they are still equally affected and distracted by music with lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=Christina |author2=Furnham, Adrian |author3=McClelland, Alastair|title=The influence of distracting familiar vocal music on cognitive performance of introverts and extraverts|journal=Psychology of Music|date=9 November 2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=84–93|doi=10.1177/0305735611422672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheerful music with fast tempos, many melodic themes, and vocals are also preferred by extroverts.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 18" /&gt; They are more likely than others to listen to music in the background while doing other activities, such as running, being with friends, or studying.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt; This group also tends to use music to counter the monotony of everyday tasks, such as ironing.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;  In a Turkish study, researchers found that extroverts preferred rock, pop, and rap because these genres facilitated dance and movement.

Another study examined music teachers and music therapists, assuming that people who like and study music would be more extroverted.  The results showed that music teachers were definitely higher in extraversion than the general public.  Music therapists were also higher on extraversion than introversion, though they scored significantly lower than the teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita Louise|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of Myers-Briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|date=Spring 2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|pmid=21866713|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differences can probably be attributed to teaching being a profession more dependent on extraversion.

==== Agreeableness ====

Agreeable individuals preferred upbeat and conventional music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, listeners with high agreeableness displayed an intense emotional response to music which they had never before listened to.&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg" /&gt; Agreeableness is also a good predictor of the emotional intensity experienced from all types of music, both positive and negative.  Those scoring high in agreeableness tend to have more intense emotional reactions to all types of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, Glenn E. |title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neuroticism ====

The more neurotic a person is, the less likely they are to listen to intense and rebellious music (such as alternative, rock and heavy metal); they will likely prefer upbeat and conventional music, such as country, sound tracks, and pop music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, neuroticism is positively correlated with emotional use of music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Those who scored high in neuroticism were more likely to report use of music for emotional regulation and experience higher intensity of emotional affect, especially negative emotion.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==Individual and situational influences on musical preferences==
Situations have been shown to influence individual’s preferences for certain types of music. Participants in a study from 1996 provided information about what music they would prefer to listen to in given situations, and indicated that the situation greatly determined their musical preferences. For example, melancholic situations called for sad and moody music, while an arousal situation would call for loud, strong rhythm, invigorating music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Situational influences on reported musical preference|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1996|volume=15|pages=30–45|doi=10.1037/h0094081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===

Women are more likely than men to respond to music in a more emotional way.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|authorlink=Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females prefer popular music more than males.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlings|first=D.|author2=Ciancarelli, V. |title=Music Preference and the Five-Factor Model of the NEO Personality Inventory|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 October 1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–132|doi=10.1177/0305735697252003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music, researchers found that males demonstrated more of a preference for bass music than females. This preference for bass music is also correlated with [[Anti-social behavior|antisocial]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] personalities.&lt;ref name="McCown Keiser Mulhearn Williamson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCown|first=William|author2=Keiser, Ross |author3=Mulhearn, Shea |author4= Williamson, David |title=The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=1997|volume=23|issue=4|pages=543–547 |doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===

Age is a strong factor in determining music preference. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barret|first=Frederick S.|author2=Grimm, Kevin J. |author3=Robins, Richard W. |author4=Wildschut, Tim |author5=Constantine, Sedikides |author6=Janata, Petr |title=Music-evoked nostalgia: Affect, memory, and personality|journal=Emotion|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=3|pages=390–403|doi=10.1037/a0019006|pmid=20515227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of adolescent preferences of music in England, researchers found that girls regarded music as a worthwhile activity more than boys, but both boys and girls agreed that it does not need to be taught in schools. There is also evidence that preferences and opinions toward music can change with age.&lt;ref name="crowther"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowther|first=R|author2=Durkin, K |title=Sex- and age-related differences in the musical behavior, interests and attitudes towards music of 232 secondary school students|journal=Educational Studies|year=1982|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/0305569820080206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Canadian study concerning how adolescent music preferences relate to personality, researchers found that adolescents who preferred heavy music demonstrated low self-esteem, higher levels of discomfort within the family, and tended to feel rejected by others.  Adolescents who preferred light music were preoccupied with doing the proper thing, and had difficulty balancing independence with dependence. Adolescents who had eclectic music preferences had less difficulty negotiating adolescence, and were flexible using music according to mood and particular needs at the time.&lt;ref name="schwartz fouts g"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Kelly|author2=Fouts, Gregory |title=Music preferences, personality style, and developmental issues of adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=2003|volume=32|issue=3|pages=205–213|doi=10.1023/a:1022547520656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season of the year===

Season of the year can also affect preferences.  After reflecting upon fall or winter seasons, participants preferred reflective and complex music, whereas after reflecting upon summer or spring, participants preferred energetic and rhythmic music. However, "pop" music seems to have a universal appeal, despite the season.&lt;ref name=Pettijohn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettijohn|first=Terry F.|author2=Williams, Greg M. |author3=Carter, Tiffany C. |title=Music for the Seasons: Seasonal Music Preferences in College Students|journal=Current Psychology|date=26 November 2010|volume=29|issue=4|pages=328–345|doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity===

Familiarity and complexity both have interesting effects on musical preferences.  As seen in other types of artistic media, an inverted U relationship is apparent       when relating subjective complexity on liking music excerpts. Individuals like complexity to a certain degree, then begin to dislike the music when complexity gets too high. Furthermore, there is a clear positive monotonic relationship between familiarity and liking of music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Subjective complexity, familiarity, and liking for popular music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self views===

Music preferences can also be influenced by how the individual wants to be perceived, especially in males.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;  Music preferences could be used to make self-directed identity claims.  Individuals might select styles of music that reinforce their self-views. For examples, individuals with a conservative self-view preferred conventional styles of music, while individuals with an athletic self view preferred vigorous music.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;

===Mood===

Active mood is another factor that affects music preference.  Generally whether people are in a good or bad mood when they hear music affects how they feel about the type of music and also their emotional response.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski" /&gt; On that line of thinking, aggression has been shown to improve creativity and emotional intensity derived from music.  People with aggressive disorders find music to be a powerful emotional outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pool|first=Jonathan|author2=Odell-Miller, Helen |title=Aggression in music therapy and its role in creativity with reference to personality disorder|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|year=2011|volume=38|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.003|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the value people put on music and frequency of listening affects their reactions to it.  If people listen to a certain type of music and add emotional experience to songs or a genre in general, this increases the likelihood of enjoying the music and being emotionally affected by it.&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"/&gt;  This helps explain why many people might have strong reactions to music their parents listened to frequently when they were children.

'''Repatriation''' is the return of art or [[cultural heritage]], usually referring to ancient or [[looted art]], to their country of origin or former owners (or their heirs). The disputed cultural property items are physical artifacts of a group or society that were taken from another group usually in an act of looting, whether in the context of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]] or war. The contested objects range widely from [[sculpture]]s and paintings to monuments and human remains.

== Background ==

===War and looting===

==== Ancient world====
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9066.jpg|thumb|Victory Stele of Naram Sin, Akkadian Dynasty, reign of Naram-Sin (2254-2218 BC). Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]
War and the subsequent looting of defeated peoples has been common practice since ancient times. The stele of King [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]], which is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, is one of the earliest works of art known to have been looted in war. The stele commemorating Naram-Sin's victory in a battle against the [[Lullubi]] people in 2250 BCE was taken as war plunder about a thousand years later by the [[Elamites]] who relocated it to their capital in [[Susa]], Iran. There, it was uncovered in 1898 by French archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Sumerian poem titled ''[[Curse of Akkad]]'', Naram-Sin was responsible for the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] as he looted and destroyed the [[Temple of Enlil]] and incited the wrath of the gods as a result, see Miles, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palladion]] was the earliest and perhaps the most important stolen statue in western literature.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miles, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The small carved wooden statue of an armed [[Athena]] served as Troy's protective [[talisman]], which is said to have been stolen by two Greeks who secretly smuggled the statue out of the [[Temple of Athena]]. It was widely believed in antiquity that the conquest of Troy was only possible because the city had lost its protective talisman. This myth illustrates the sacramental significance of statuary in Ancient Greece as divine manifestations of the gods that symbolized power and were often believed to possess supernatural abilities. The sacred nature of the statues is further illustrated in the supposed suffering of the victorious Greeks afterward, including [[Odysseus]], who was the mastermind behind the robbery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by [[Romulus]], the first victor to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius]]. In Rome's many subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Miles, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned, Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; However, the triumphal procession of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Emperor Augustus]] was sufficiently embarrassed by the history of Roman plunder of Greek art to return some pieces to their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;Isager, Jacob, ''Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art'', p. 173, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-135-08580-3}}, 978-1-135-08580-3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIwWTaEXQM0C&amp;pg=PA173 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
One of the most infamous cases of esurient art plundering in wartime was the [[Nazi]] appropriation of art from both public and private holdings throughout Europe and Russia. The looting began before [[World War II]] with illegal seizures as part of a systematic persecution of Jews, which was included as a part of Nazi crimes during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;See film, ''Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War'' by L.H. Nicholas, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Germany plundered 427 museums in the [[Soviet Union]] and ravaged or destroyed 1,670 [[Russian Orthodox]] churches, 237 [[Catholic]] churches and 532 synagogues.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unplundering Art|newspaper=Economist|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known recent case of wartime looting was the plundering of ancient artifacts from the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war in 2003. Although this was not a case in which the victors plundered art from their defeated enemy, it was result of the unstable and chaotic conditions of war that allowed looting to happen and which some would argue was the fault of the invading US forces.

Archaeologists and scholars criticized the US military for not taking the measures to secure the museum, a repository for a myriad of valuable ancient artifacts from the ancient [[Mesopotamian]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry Meier and James Glanz|title=Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/africa/26iht-treasure.2300298.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the several months leading up to the war, scholars, art directors, and collector met with [[the Pentagon]] to ensure that the US government would protect Iraq's important archaeological heritage, with the National Museum in Baghdad being at the top of the list of concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Greenfield, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Between April 8, when the museum was vacated and April 12, when some of the staff returned, an estimated 15,000 items and an additional 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen.&lt;ref name="poole1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poole|first=Robert M.|title=Looting Iraq|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|archivedate=3 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the National Library was plundered of thousands of [[cuneiform]] tablets and the building was set on fire with half a million books inside; fortunately, many of the manuscripts and books were preserved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; A US task force was able to retrieve about half of the stolen artifacts by organizing and dispatching an inventory of missing objects and by declaring that there would be no punishment for anyone returning an item.&lt;ref name="poole1"/&gt; In addition to the vulnerability of art and historical institutions during the Iraq war, Iraq's rich archaeological sites and areas of excavated land (Iraq is presumed to possess vast undiscovered treasures) have fallen victim to widespread looting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Greenfield, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Hordes of looters disinterred enormous craters around Iraq's archaeological sites, sometimes using bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 archaeological sites in Iraq have been despoiled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Modern imperialism and looting ===
[[File:Paris Louvre c1845.jpg|thumb|Paris Louvre ca. 1845]]
The scale of plundering that took place under [[Napoleon]]'s French Empire was unprecedented in modern history with the only comparable looting expeditions taking place in ancient Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Well known examples include [[Lucius Mummius]]' sack of Corinth or [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]' plunder of Syracuse, See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported their actions with the opinion that their sophisticated artistic taste would allow them to appreciate the plundered art.&lt;ref&gt;See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's soldiers crudely dismantled the art by tearing paintings out of their frames hung in churches and sometimes causing damage during the shipping process.  Napoleon's soldiers appropriated private collections and even the papal collection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Of the most famous artworks plundered included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|Bronze Horses of Saint Mark]] in Venice and the [[Laocoön and His Sons]] in Rome (both since returned), with the later being considered the most impressive sculpture from antiquity at the time.

[[File:Gruppo del laocoonte, 04.JPG|thumb|left|Laocoön group, ca. 40-20 BCE. Museo Pio Clementino, Vatican]]
The Laocoön had a particular meaning for the French because it was associated with a myth in connection to the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The Laocoön was the fabled Trojan priest who warned the Trojans not to accept the Wooden Horse that the Greeks offered to Athena. A god hostile to Troy sent sea serpents to kill him and his sons, which led to the fall of Troy and heralded the eventual founding of Rome, see Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; When the art was brought into Paris, the pieces arrived in the fashion of a triumphal procession modeled after the common practice of ancient Romans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

Napoleon's extensive plunder of Italy was criticized by such French artists as [[Antoine-Chrysostôme Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849), who circulated a petition that gathered the signatures of fifty other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically one of the names included [[Vivant Denon]], the future Director of the [[Louvre]] and future facilitator of Napoleon's despoliation of artifacts from Egypt (see Miles, p. 326)&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding of the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris in 1793, Napoleon's aim was to establish an encyclopedic exhibition of art history, which later both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] would attempt to emulate in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|L'Expédition d'Égypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte by Leon Cogniet, ca. 1835. Musée du Louvre, Paris. Depicts Napoleon and his savants studying Egypt.]]
Napoleon continued his art conquests in 1798 when he invaded Egypt in an attempt to safeguard French trade interests and to undermine Britain's access to India via Egypt. His expedition in Egypt is noted for the 167 "savants" he took with him including scientists and other specialists equipped with tools for recording, surveying and documenting ancient and modern Egypt and its natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the expedition discoveries included the [[Rosetta Stone]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]] near Thebes. The French military campaign was short-lived and unsuccessful and the majority of the collected artifacts (including the Rosetta Stone) were seized by British troops, ending up in the [[British Museum]]. Nonetheless, the information gathered by the French expedition was soon after published in the several volumes of ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', which included 837 copperplate engravings and over 3,000 drawings. In contrast to the disapproving public reaction to the looting of Italian works of art, the appropriation of Egyptian art saw widespread interest and fascination throughout Europe, inciting a phenomenon which came to be called "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Miles, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demands for restitution ===
A precedent for art repatriation was set in Roman antiquity when [[Cicero]] prosecuted [[Verres]], a senate member and illegal appropriator of art. Cicero's speech influenced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] European thought and had an indirect impact on the modern debate about art repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's argument uses military episodes of plunder as "case law" and expresses certain standards when it comes to appropriating cultural property of another people.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero makes a distinction between public and private uses of art and what is appropriate for each and he also asserts that the primary purpose of art is religious expression and veneration. He also sets standards for the responsibilities of imperial administration abroad to the code of ethics surrounding the collection of art from defeated Greece and Rome in wartime. Later, both Napoleon and Lord Elgin would be likened to Verres in condemnations of their plundering of art.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the Napoleonic Era.]]Art was repatriated for the first time in modern history when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] overturned art plundered by Napoleon to Italy after he and Marshal Bluchers armies defeated the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This decision contrasted sharply to a long-held tradition to the effect that "[[Spoils system|to the victors go the spoils]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This is remarkable considering that in the battle of Waterloo alone, the financial and human costs were colossal; the decision to not only refrain from plundering France but to repatriate France's prior seizures from the Netherlands, Italy, Prussia, and Spain, was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the British paid for the restitution of the papal collection to Rome because the Pope could not finance the shipping himself.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops began packing up looted art from the Louvre, there was a public outcry in France. Crowds reportedly tried to prevent the taking of the [[Horses of Saint Mark]] and there were throngs of weeping ladies outside the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Miles, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unprecedented nature of this repatriation effort, there are recent estimations that only about 55 percent of what was taken was actually repatriated: the Louvre Director at the time, [[Vivant Denon]], had sent out many important works to other parts of France before the British could take them.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Wellington viewed himself as representing all of Europe's nations and he believed that the moral decision would be to restore the art in its apparently proper context.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Lord Castlereagh]] he wrote:

{{cquote|The Allies then, having the contents of the museum justly in their power, could not do otherwise than restore them to the countries form which, contrary to the practice of civilized warfare, they had been torn during the disastrous period of the French revolution and the tyranny of Bonaparte. ... Not only, then, would it, in my opinion, be unjust in the Sovereigns to gratify the people of France on this subject, at the expense of their own people, but the sacrifice they would make would be impolitic, as it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the people of France a great moral lesson. |||Excerpt from letter of Wellington to Viscount Castlereagh, K.G., Paris| September 23, 1815&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;}}

Wellington also forbade pilfering among his troops as he believed that it led to the lack of discipline and distraction from military duty. He also held the view that winning support from local inhabitants was an important break from Napoleon's practices.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The great public interest in art repatriation helped fuel the expansion of public museums in Europe and launched museum-funded archaeological explorations. The concept of art and cultural repatriation gained momentum through the latter decades of the twentieth century and began to show fruition by the end of the century when key works were ceded back to claimants.

== Legal issues ==

=== National government laws ===
In 1863 US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] summoned [[Francis Lieber]], a German-American jurist and political philosopher, to write a legal code to regulate Union soldiers' behavior toward Confederation prisoners, noncombatants, spies and property.  The resulting ''General Orders No.100'' or the [[Lieber Code]], legally recognized cultural property as a protected category in war.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lieber Code had far-reaching results as it became the basis for the Hague Convention of 1907 and 1954 and has led to Standing Rules of Engagement (ROE) for US troops today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Miles, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the ROE clauses instruct US troops not to attack "schools, museums, national monuments, and any other historical or cultural sites unless they are being used for a military purpose and pose a threat".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

In 2004 the US passed the Bill HR1047 for the Emergency Protection for Iraq Cultural Antiquities Act, which allows the President authority to impose emergency import restrictions by Section 204 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCIPA).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Britain and Switzerland put into effect statutory prohibitions against illegally exported Iraqi artifacts.  In the UK, the Dealing in Cultural Objects Bill was established in 2003 that prohibited the handling of illegal cultural objects.

=== International conventions ===
The Hague Convention of 1907 aimed to forbid pillaging and sought to make wartime plunder the subject of legal proceedings, although in practice the defeated countries did not gain any leverage in their demands for repatriation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;  The Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict took place in the wake of widespread destruction of cultural heritage in [[World War II]] is the first international treaty of a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict.

The [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) Convention on Stolen or Illicitly Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 called for the return of illegally exported cultural objects &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326162020/http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
The 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) allowed for stolen objects to be seized if there were documentation of it in a museum or institution of a state party and the following agreement in 1972 promoted world cultural and natural heritage&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 UNESCO Convention strengthened existing provisions; the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation was established.  It consists of 22 members elected by the General Conference of UNESCO to facilitate bilateral negotiations for the restitution of "any cultural property which has a fundamental significance from the point of view of the spiritual values and cultural heritage of the people of a Member State or Associate Member of UNESCO and which has been lost as a result of colonial or foreign occupation or as a result of illicit appropriation".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riviere|first=Francoise|title=Editorial|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also created to "encourage the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"/&gt;

In response to the Iraqi National Museum looting, UNESCO Director-General, [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] convened a meeting in Paris on April 17, 2003 in order to assess the situation and coordinate international networks in order to recover the cultural heritage of Iraq.  On July 8, 2003, [[Interpol]] and UNESCO signed an amendment to their 1999 Cooperation Agreement in the effort to recover looted Iraqi artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouchenaki|first=Mounir|title=Return and restitution of cultural property in the wake of the 1970 Convention|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political issues ==

=== Colonialism and identity ===
From early on, the field of archaeology was deeply involved in political endeavors and in the construction of national identities. This early relationship can be seen during the [[Renaissance]] and the proto-Italian reactions against the [[High Gothic]] movement, but the relationship became stronger during 19th century Europe when archaeology became institutionalized as a field of study furnished by artifacts acquired during the rise of European colonialism led by the British and French.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, pp. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonialism and the field of archaeology mutually supported one another as the need to acquire knowledge of ancient artifacts justified further colonial dominance.

As further justification for colonial rule, the archaeological discoveries also shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them.  In the case of Egypt, colonial Europe's mission to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history, or better yet, European history placed ancient Egypt in a new spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Said 86&lt;/ref&gt;  With the archaeological discoveries, ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Colla 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization;&lt;ref&gt;Miles 320&lt;/ref&gt; by the same token, the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt.  But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West, modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Museums furnished by colonial looting have largely shaped the way a nation imagines its dominion, the nature of the human beings under its power, the geography of the land, and the legitimacy of its ancestors, working to suggest a process of political inheriting.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 164&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to understand the paradoxical way in which the objects on display at museums are tangible reminders of the power held by those who gaze at them.&lt;ref&gt;Colla 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot Colla describes the structure of the Egyptian sculpture room in the British Museum as an assemblage that "form[s] an abstract image of the globe with London at the center".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Colla 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]], as Colla describes, presents a lesson of human development and progress:  "the forward march of human civilization from its classical origins in Greece and Rome, through Renaissance Italy, to modern-day London".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The restoration of monuments was often made in colonial states to make natives feel as if in their current state, they were no longer capable of greatness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Anderson 181&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sometimes colonial rulers argued that the ancestors of the colonized people did not make the artifacts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Some scholars also argue that European colonialists used monumental archaeology and tourism to appear as the guardian of the colonized, reinforcing unconscious and undetectable ownership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Colonial rulers used peoples, religions, languages, artifacts, and monuments as source for reinforcing European nationalism, which was adopted and easily inherited from the colonial states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

=== Nationalism and identity ===
As a direct reaction and resistance to colonial oppression, archaeology was also used for the purpose of legitimating the existence of an independent nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Andreu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Egyptian Nationalists utilized its ancient history to invent the political and expressive culture of "[[Pharaonism]]" as a response to Europe’s "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Colla 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Masada02 ST 04.jpg|thumb|Masada fortress, Israel]]  Some argue that in colonized states, nationalist archaeology was used to resist colonialism and racism under the guise of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, pp. 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is true that both colonialist and nationalist discourse use the artifact to form mechanisms to sustain their contending political agendas, there is a danger in viewing them interchangeably since the latter was a reaction and form of resistance to the former.  On the other hand, it is important to realize that in the process of emulating the mechanisms of colonial discourse, the nationalist discourse produced new forms of power.  In the case of the Egyptian nationalist movement, the new form of power and meaning that surrounded the artifact furthered the Egyptian independence cause but continued to oppress the rural Egyptian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2015}} argue that archaeology can be a positive source of pride in cultural traditions, but can also be abused to justify cultural or racial superiority as the Nazis argued that Germanic people of Northern Europe was a distinct race and cradle of Western civilization that was superior to Jewish race.{{citation needed|reason=We need a source that substantiates the relationship between archaeology and the Nazi concept of Germanic racial superiority.|date=June 2015}} In some conflicts that involve land ownership, archaeology is used to encourage confrontation by means of constructing of national myth as seen with the ancient fortress of [[Masada]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Paul|title=Masada legend galvanizes Israel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7830416.stm|accessdate=6 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, archaeology allows rulers to justify the domination of neighboring peoples as [[Saddam Hussein]] used [[Mesopotamia]]'s magnificent past to justify his [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars employ the idea that identity is fluid and constructed, especially national identity of modern nation-states, to argue that the post-colonial countries have no real claims to the artifacts plundered from their borders since their cultural connections to the artifacts are indirect and equivocal.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xx-xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; This argument asserts that artifacts should be viewed as universal cultural property and should not be divided among artificially created [[nation-states]]. Moreover, that encyclopedic museums are a testament to diversity, tolerance and the appreciation of many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars would argue that this reasoning is a continuation of colonialist discourse attempting to appropriate the ancient art of colonized states and incorporate it into the narrative of Western history.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

}}
The debate surrounding art repatriation differs case by case due to the specific nature of legal and historical issues surrounding each case, but below are listed general arguments commonly used:

=== Arguments against repatriation ===
* Artifacts are a part of a universal human history and encyclopedic museums like the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] cultivate the dissemination of knowledge, tolerance, and broad cultural understanding.
* Artifacts were frequently excavated or uncovered by looters, who brought to light a piece of artwork that would otherwise never have been seen; foreign-led excavation teams have uncovered items that contribute to cultural knowledge and understanding.
* Nationalist retentionist cultural property laws claiming ownership are founded on constructed boundaries of modern nations with weak connections to the culture, spirit, and race to the ancient peoples who produced those antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuno|first=James|title=Who Owns Antiquity? The Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural identities are dynamic, inter-related and overlapping so no modern nation-state can claim cultural property as their own or else they are promoting a sectarian view of culture.
* Having artwork disseminated around the world encourages international scholarly and professional exchange.
* Encyclopedic museums are located in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Paris and New York, and if the artworks were to be moved, they would be seen by far fewer people. If the [[Rosetta Stone]] were to be moved from The British Museum to The [[Cairo Museum]], the number of people who view it would drop from about 5.5 million visitors to 2.5 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone] The Telegraph. By Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner, 20 Jul 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for repatriation ===
* Encyclopedic museums such as the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] were established as repositories for looted art during imperial and colonial rule, and thus are located in metropolitan cities out of view and reach of the cultures from which they were appropriated.
* Precedence of repatriated art has already been set in many cases but the artworks that museums currently refuse to repatriate are the most valuable and famous artworks.
* Foreign-led excavations have justified colonial rule; in the pursuit of obtaining knowledge about the artifacts, there was a need to establish control over the artifacts and the countries where they were located.
* The argument that art is a part of a universal human history is a derivative of colonial discourse that appropriated ancient art of other cultures into the Western historical narrative.
* The encyclopedic museums that house much of the world's artworks and artifacts are located in Western cities and privilege European scholars, professionals and people.
* The argument that artwork will not be protected outside of the Western world is hypocritical as much of the artwork transported out of colonized countries was crudely removed and damaged and sometimes lost in transportation. The [[Elgin marbles]] for example, were also damaged during the cleaning and "preservation" process.
* Art is best appreciated and understood in its  original historical and cultural context. Moreover the ''Napried'', one of the ships commissioned by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola|di Cesnola]] to transport approximately 35,000 pieces of antiquities that he had collected from [[Cyprus]], was lost at sea carrying about 5,000 pieces in its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://napried.com/|title=Napried Exploration|website=napried.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art taken out of the country as a spoil of war, looting, imperialism, and colonialism is unethical, even if it isn't reflected in legislation.  The possession of artwork taken under these conditions is a form of continued colonialism.
* The lack of existing legal recourse for claiming the return of illicitly appropriated cultural property is a result of colonization.
* Cultural property is a symbol of cultural heritage and identity and the appropriation of historical artworks is an affront to a nation's pride.

== International examples ==
[[File:Nofretete Neues Museum.jpg|thumb|The iconic bust of Nefertiti]]

=== Egypt ===
Egypt is seeking the repatriation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] from the [[British Museum]] and the [[Nefertiti bust]] from the [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin.

=== Greece ===
Greece is seeking repatriation of the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[British Museum]], taken from the [[Parthenon]] by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Since 1816, the [[British Museum]] has held the Parthenon Marbles ("In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting", text from the Marbles article), and, despite the tortuous and ill explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display the marbles.
[[File:Euphronios krater side A MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|Euphronios Krater]]

=== Italy ===
In February 2006, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] negotiated the repatriation of the [[Euphronios krater]] to [[Italy]], from where it was thought to have been looted in the early 1970s.

=== Canada ===
The [[Haisla people|Haisla]] [[totem Pole]] of [[Kitimat, British Columbia]] was originally prepared for chief G'psgoalux in 1872.  This aboriginal artifact was donated to a Swedish museum in 1929. According to the donor, he had purchased the pole from the [[Haisla people]] while he lived on the Canadian west coast and served as Swedish consul. After being approached by the Haisla people, the Swedish government decided in 1994 to return the pole, as the exact circumstances around the acquisition were unclear. The pole was returned to Kitimat in 2006 after a building had been constructed in order to preserve the pole.

=== India ===
The U.K. has rejected India's fresh demand to return its priceless artifacts like "[[Koh-i-Noor|Kohinoor Diamond]]" and "[[Sultanganj Buddha]]" that were stolen/looted/smuggled during British colonial rule citing a law (The British Museum Act, 1963) that prevents it from giving back the items. ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) is planning to join a campaign with the support of UNESCO and other countries to regain the artifacts.

=== South Korea ===
In November 2010, Japan agreed to return some 1,000 cultural objects to South Korea that were plundered during its colonial occupation from 1910-45. The collection includes a collection of royal books called [[Uigwe]] from the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tong|first=Xiong|title=S Korea to retrieve stolen cultural property from Japan: media|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-11/08/c_13596596.htm|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=Xinhua News Agency|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea [[Donald Gregg]] received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely. Former Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as "extensive and shocking." The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.

'''Si6''' is the [[codename]] of the ''Laboratorio de Investigación y Desarrollo en Seguridad Informática'' (Information Security Research and Development Laboratory) of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[CITEFA]] (''Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de las Fuerzas Armadas'', [[Military of Argentina|Armed Forces]] Scientific and Technical Research Institute).

SI6 belongs to the Information Security Division of CITEFA's Information Technology Department.

==History==
The Si6 was created on January 2004 to analyze and provide the [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Argentine Ministry of Defense]] with scientific and technical assistance on subjects related to [[computer security]].
Si6 creation was somehow hard to accomplish, mainly because it's very difficult to admit new workers into Argentina's Government. Finally it was possible thanks to the support and effort a lot people made.

==Goal==
Its mission is to create and direct [[information security]] R&amp;D activities for both general purpose and national defense areas.

==Philosophy==
Si6 believes that the sum of community efforts through applied research of innovative technologies is one of the most efficient ways to achieve technology knowledge. At the same time, Si6 think that improved education, specially on those areas, is a basic pillar of the society welfare. 

All Si6 public projects are published under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license. As part of this common knowledge exchange policy, CITEFA makes different agreements with public and private institutions in order to establish a national research and development network.

==Work==
SI6 is currently working on [[intruder detection]], [[intruder classification]], [[intruder identification]], [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]s, [[pattern analysis]], [[biometric authentication]], [[virtual private networks]], [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[digital signature]], [[penetration test]]s, etc.

==Location==
Si6 is located at CITEFA headquarters, [[Buenos Aires]].

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been implemented as "foreground selection" tool in the [[GIMP]] (since version 2.3.3), as part of the tracer tool in [[Inkscape]] (since 0.44pre3), and as function in [[ImageJ]] and [[FIJI Image processing software|Fiji]] (plug-in). Experimental implementations were also reported for [[Blender (software)|Blender]] and [[Krita]]. Although the algorithm was originally designed for videos, virtually all implementations use SIOX primarily for still image segmentation. In fact, it is often said to be the current [[de facto standard]] for this task in the [[open-source]] world.
 
Initially, a free hand selection tool is used to specify the region of interest. It must contain all foreground objects to extract and as few background as possible. The pixels outside the region of interest form the sure background while the inner region define a superset of the foreground, i.e. the unknown region. A so-called foreground brush is then used to mark representative foreground regions. The algorithm outputs a selection mask. The selection can be refined by either adding further foreground markings or by adding background markings using the background brush.

Technically, the algorithm performs the following steps: 
* Create a set of representative colors for sure foreground and sure background, the so-called color signatures.
* Assign all image points to foreground or background by a weighted nearest neighbor search in the color signatures.
* Apply some standard image processing operations like erode, dilate, and blur to remove artifacts.
* Find the connected foreground components that are either large enough or marked by the user.

For video segmentation the sure background and sure foreground regions are learned from motion statistics. SIOX also features tools that allow sub-pixel accurate refinement of edges and high texture areas, the so-called "detail refinement brushes".

As with all [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] algorithms, there are always pictures where the algorithm does not yield perfect results. The most critical drawback of SIOX is the color dependence. Although many photos are well-separable by color, the algorithm cannot deal with camouflage. If the foreground and background share many identical shades of similar colors, the algorithm might give a result with parts missing or incorrectly classified foreground. SIOX performs about equally well on different benchmarks compared to graph-based segmentation methods, such as [[Grabcut]]. SIOX is, however, more noise robust and can therefore also be used for the segmentation of videos. Graph-based segmentation methods search for a minimum cut and therefore tend to not perform optimally with complex structures.

The algorithm has initially been developed at the department of computer science at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]]. The main developer, [[Gerald Friedland]], is now faculty at the EECS department of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] and also a Principal Data Scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore National Lab]]. He continues to support the development through mentoring, e.g. in the [[Google Summer of Code]].

'''Simplified music notation''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.simplifiedmusicnotation.org/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative form of [[music notation]] designed to make [[sight-reading]] easier. It was proposed by Peter Hayes George (1927-2012).  It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] are incorporated into the shape of the [[note head]]s.  [[Musical note|Note]]s such as double sharps and double flats are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] at which they are actually played, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called "history signs" to show that they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].  The key signature and all other information in the original [[Sheet music|score]] is retained, but the player does not need to remember the [[key signature]] and [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] while playing.

The notation was designed to help players who struggle with sight-reading,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R.‘Songwriting and Composer Magazine’ The Magazine for International Songwriters and Composers’, 1st Quarter 2009, p.8 ‘Simplified Music Notation: ‘A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation’.&lt;/ref&gt; including those who suffer from [[working memory]] impairments, [[dyslexia]] and other [[learning disability|learning difficulties]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen N. Wayne State College, American Music Teacher, June/July 2009, p.78-81 ‘A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation: Elementary Piano Compositions’&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Peter Hayes George (1927-2012) was born in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], the son of a [[diplomat]].  He attended RADA and began his career as an [[actor]] playing roles such as the lead in ‘[[Malachi's Cove (film)|Malachi's Cove]]’ directed by [[Charles Frank]] and the juvenile lead in [[Peter Brook|Peter Brook's]] London West End production ''[[Dark of the Moon (play)|Dark of the Moon]]''.  In the 1960s he gave up acting as shortcomings with his [[working memory]] made it difficult for him to accept major roles with long speeches.

After studying music for teachers at Los Angeles City College in 1962, George took up the piano.  He thought that since musicians can keep the music in front of them while playing, his memory problems would present no difficulty. However, he discovered that [[musician]]s must remember to modulate each musical note according to the [[key signature]], to continue any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] through the [[bar (music)|bar]], and to cancel them at the end of the bar.  He also found difficulty in transposing notes such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]].&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, S. [http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/business/3681103.Scoring_a_winner_in_music_learning/ Scoring a winner in music learning] in ''The Argus, Business Supplement'' 17 September 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

His simplified music notation was designed in response to this.  The original concept was formed in 1977 and the notation was developed over the next 30 years. The first series of music books in his simplified music notation was [[publishing|published]] in September 2008. A second series, "Key Perfect", was published in 2010. Its early-grade piano repertoire pieces were composed and compiled by music teacher and author [[John Kember]] and international pianist and lecturer [[John York]].&lt;ref&gt;York J.'Piano Magazine' , January 2010, p.41 ‘Simplified Music Notation': 'Sight-reading breakthrough'&lt;/ref&gt;  This latest series was designed to show the effectiveness of simplified music notation as a learning tool towards improving students' reading skills in traditional notation.&lt;ref&gt;American Music Teacher, Music Merchandise section. February/March 2009, p.10-12 ‘Simplified Music Notation’&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
The basic concept of George's simplified music notation is that players should be able to play what they see, without having to adapt for key signature or complex accidentals.&lt;ref&gt;George, Peter Hayes ''A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation''. The Creative Arts Research Trust ISMN 797-0-708083-12-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[sharp (music)|sharp]] and [[flat (music)|flat]] symbols in the key signature are replaced by the sharp and flat [[Musical note|note]]heads of simplified music notation: a [[triangle]] for sharps and a [[rhombus]] for flats. The traditional [[oval]] notehead is used when a note is [[natural (music)|natural]].

If there is a [[key change]] in the middle of a piece, the new key signature is shown without naturals to ‘neutralise’ the previous [[key (music)|key]]. The exception to this is where the key changes to [[C major]] or [[A minor]], where ‘neutralising’ naturals are used to make this clear.  Instead of the traditional natural symbol, an oval notehead is used.

Double sharps, and double flats (and optionally B{{music|sharp}} and E{{music|sharp}}, and F{{music|flat}} and C{{music|flat}}) are enharmonically transposed, and preceded by a symbol called a  ''history sign''.  History signs allow anybody studying the music to see how it was originally written and to analyse the [[chord progression|harmonic progression]] of the piece.  However, they can be ignored whilst [[sight-reading]].

{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'''Portability''' in [[High-level programming language|high-level computer programming]] is the usability of the same [[software]] in different environments. The prerequirement for portability is the generalized [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] between the application logic and [[Interface (computer science)|system interfaces]]. When software with the same functionality is produced for several [[computing platform]]s, portability is the key issue for development cost reduction.

== Strategies for portability ==
Software portability may involve:
* Transferring installed program files to another computer of basically the same architecture.
* Reinstalling a program from distribution files on another computer of basically the same architecture.
* [[Compiler|Building]] [[executable]] programs for different platforms from [[source code]]; this is what is usually understood by "[[porting]]".

=== Similar systems ===
When [[operating system]]s of the same family are installed on two computers with [[CPU|processors]] with similar [[instruction set]]s it is often possible to transfer the files implementing program files between them.

In the simplest case the file or files may simply be copied from one machine to the other. However, in many cases, the software is [[Installation (computer programs)|installed]] on a computer in a way which depends upon its detailed hardware, software, and setup, with [[device driver]]s for particular devices, using installed operating system and supporting software components, and using different [[Logical drive|drives]] or [[Directory (file systems)|directories]].

In some cases software, usually described as "[[portable application|portable software]]" is specifically designed to run on different computers with compatible operating systems and processors without any machine-dependent installation; it is sufficient to transfer specified directories and their contents. Software installed on portable [[mass storage]] devices such as [[USB stick]]s can be used on any compatible computer on simply plugging the storage device in, and stores all configuration information on the removable device. Hardware- and software-specific information is often stored in [[configuration file]]s in specified locations (e.g. the [[Windows registry|registry]] on machines running [[Microsoft Windows]]).

Software which is not portable in this sense will have to be transferred with modifications to support the environment on the destination machine.

=== Different processors ===
{{As of|2011}} the majority of desktop and laptop computers used [[microprocessor]]s compatible with the 32- and 64-bit [[x86]] instruction sets. Smaller portable devices use processors with different and incompatible instruction sets, such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]. The difference between larger and smaller devices is such that detailed software operation is different; an application designed to display suitably on a large screen cannot simply be ported to a pocket-sized smartphone with a tiny screen even if the functionality is similar.

[[Web applications]] are required to be processor independent, so portability can be achieved by using web programming techniques, writing in [[JavaScript]]. Such a program can run in a common web browser. Such [[web application]]s must, for security reasons, have limited control over the host computer, especially regarding reading and writing files. Non-web programs, installed upon a computer in the normal manner, can have more control, and yet achieve system portability by linking to portable libraries that provides the same interface on different systems.

== Source code portability ==
Software can be compiled and [[linker (computing)|linked]] from source code for different operating systems and processors if written in a programming language supporting compilation for the platforms. This is usually a task for the program developers; typical users have neither access to the source code nor the required skills.

In [[Open-source software|open-source]] environments such as Linux the source code is available to all. In earlier days source code was often distributed in a standardised format, and could be built into executable code with a standard [[Make (software)|Make tool]] for any particular system by moderately knowledgeable users if no errors occurred during the build. Some [[Linux distribution]]s distribute software to users in source form. In these cases there is usually no need for detailed adaptation of the software for the system; it is distributed in a way which [[Conditional compilation|modifies the compilation process to match the system]].

=== Effort to port source code ===
Even with seemingly portable languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] the effort to port source code can vary considerably. The authors of [[UNIX/32V]] (1979) reported that "[t]he [[Bourne shell|(Bourne) shell]] [...] required by far the largest conversion effort of any supposedly portable program, for the simple reason that it is not portable."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. London and John F. Reiser (1978). [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/32vscan.pdf A Unix operating system for the DEC VAX-11/780 computer]. Bell Labs internal memo 78-1353-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the effort consists of recompiling the source code,  but sometimes it is necessary to rewrite major parts of the software. Many language specifications describe implementation defined behaviour (e.g. right shifting a signed integer in C can do a [[Logical shift|logical]] or an [[Arithmetic shift|arithmetic]] shift). Operating system functions or third party libraries might not be available on the target system. Some functions can be available on a target system, but exhibit slightly different behaviour (E.g.: utime() fails under Windows with EACCES, when it is called for a directory). The program code itself can also contain unportable things, like the paths of include files. Drive letters and the backslash as path delimiter are not accepted on all operating systems. Implementation defined things like [[Endianness|byte order]] and the size of an [[Integer (computer science)|int]] can also raise the porting effort. In practice the claim of languages, like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], to have the WOCA ([[write once, compile anywhere]]) is arguable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5719">In [[geometry]], '''space partitioning''' is the process of dividing a [[space]] (usually a [[Euclidean space]]) into two or more [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[subset]]s  (see also [[partition of a set]]).  In other words, space partitioning divides a space into non-overlapping regions.  Any point in the space can then be identified to lie in exactly one of the regions.

== Overview ==
Space-partitioning systems are often [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], meaning that a space (or a region of space) is divided into several regions, and then the same space-partitioning system is [[recursion|recursively]] applied to each of the regions thus created.  The regions can be organized into a [[Tree data structure|tree]], called a '''space-partitioning tree'''.

Most space-partitioning systems use [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s (or, in higher dimensions, [[hyperplane]]s) to divide space: points on one side of the plane form one region, and points on the other side form another.  Points exactly on the plane are usually arbitrarily assigned to one or the other side.  Recursively partitioning space using planes in this way produces a [[BSP tree]], one of the most common forms of space partitioning.

== Uses ==
=== In computer graphics ===
Space partitioning is particularly important in [[computer graphics]], especially  heavily used in [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], where it is frequently used to organize the objects in a virtual scene. A typical scene may contain millions of polygons. Performing a ray/polygon [[intersection test]] with each would be a very computationally expensive task. 

Storing objects in a space-partitioning [[data structure]] ([[k-d tree|''k''-d tree]] or [[BSP tree]] for example) makes it easy and fast to perform certain kinds of geometry queries—for example in determining whether a ray intersects an object, space partitioning can reduce the number of intersection test to just a few per primary ray, yielding a logarithmic [[time complexity]] with respect to the number of polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://dip.felk.cvut.cz/browse/pdfcache/nikodtom_2010bach.pdf | title = Ray Tracing Algorithm For Interactive Applications | author = Tomas Nikodym | journal = Czech Technical University, FEE | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.8495 | title = State of the Art in Ray Tracing Animated Scenes | author = Ingo Wald, William R. Mark| journal = EUROGRAPHICS | year = 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS4241/Handouts/Lecture14.html Ray Tracing - Auxiliary Data Structures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space partitioning is also often used in scanline algorithms to eliminate the polygons out of the camera's [[viewing frustum]], limiting the number of polygons processed by the pipeline. There is also a usage in [[collision detection]]: determining whether two objects are close to each other can be much faster using space partitioning.

=== In integrated circuit design ===
In [[integrated circuit design]], an important step is [[design rule check]]. This step ensures that the completed design is manufacturable. The check involves rules that specify widths and spacings and other geometry patterns. A modern design can have billions of polygons that represent wires and transistors. Efficient checking relies heavily on geometry query. For example, a rule may specify that any polygon must be at least ''n'' nanometers from any other polygon. This is converted into a geometry query by enlarging a polygon by ''n/2'' at all sides and query to find all intersecting polygons.

=== In probability and statistical learning theory ===
The number of components in a space partition plays a central role in some results in probability theory. See [[Growth function]] for more details.

==Data structures==
Common space-partitioning systems include:
* [[BSP tree]]s;
* [[Quadtree]]s;
* [[Octree]]s;
* [[k-d tree|''k''-d tree]]s;
* [[Bin (computational geometry)|Bins]];
* [[R-tree]]s;
* [[Bounding volume hierarchies]].

==Number of components==
Suppose the n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is partitioned by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; [[hyperplane]]s that are &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional. What is the number of components in the partition? The largest number of components is attained when the hyperplanes are in [[general position]], i.e, no two are parallel and no three have the same intersection. Denote this maximum number of components by &lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the following recurrence relation holds:

::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = Comp(n, r-1) + Comp(n-1,r-1)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(0,r) = 1&lt;/math&gt; - when there are no dimensions, there is a single point.
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; - when there are no hyperplanes, all the space is a single component.
And its solution is:
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = \sum_{k=0}^n {r\choose k}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;r\geq n&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = 2^r&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;r\leq n&lt;/math&gt;
::::(consider e.g. &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular hyperplanes; each additional hyperplane divides each existing component to 2).
which is upper-bounded as:
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) \leq r^n+1&lt;/math&gt;

'''The Architect and his Office''' was a landmark report about the state of the British architectural profession in the early 1960s. It was commissioned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1960 and the report was published in February 1962 with an introduction by [[William Holford, Baron Holford|William Holford]], then President of the Institute. Running to more than 250 pages, the report examined architectural education, fees and salaries, and management and technical competence. It was based on extensive fieldwork including a questionnaire survey and visits to nearly 70 architects' offices of various kinds. Funding of slightly more than £11,000 was provided for the study by the [[Leverhulme Trust]]. 

According to [[Frank Duffy (architect)|Frank Duffy]], in his book ''Architectural Knowledge: the Idea of a Profession'', the study stands as one of the best studies of a profession ever carried out anywhere in the world (page 173). Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179).

'''''The Case for God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It is an answer to the recent claims that God does not exist from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] and focuses on the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] from the paleolithic age to the present day. Also included are [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].

Among the themes of the book are [[apophatic theology]] and intellectualism versus practice. Armstrong claims that the fundamental reality, later called [[God]], [[Brahman]], [[nirvana]] or [[Tao]], transcends human concepts and thoughts, and can only be known through devoted religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong|title=All quiet on the God front|date=4 July 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/07/religion-armstrong-god-case|title=The Case for God: What Religion Means  By Karen Armstrong |last=Byrnes|first=Sholto|date=16 July 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Douthat-t.html|title=Perpetual Revelations|date=1 October 2009|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6619456.ece|title=The Case for God: What Religion Really Means by Karen Armstrong|date=5 July 2009|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/09/10/out-out-damned-atheists.html|title=Out, Out, Damned Atheists: Karen Armstrong weighs in on God.|last=Miller|first=Lisa|date=11 September 2009|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the introduction, Armstrong presents two forms of knowledge, ''[[Logos#Jung.27s analytical psychology|mythos]]'' and ''[[logos]]''.{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xi}} Since the 16th and 17th century, she says ''logos'' governed civilization, resulting in two phenomena: [[fundamentalism]] and [[atheism]].{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xv}} Armstrong says that the [[new atheism|"new" atheists]] have made some valid criticisms of religion, stating "I can sympathize with the irritation of the new atheists". But she maintains that they have focused primarily on fundamentalism. She says they "aren't radical enough" and finds their work "disappointingly shallow".{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvi}} According to Armstrong, "My aim in this book is simply to bring something fresh to the table."{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvii}}

==Reception==
Singer-Songwriter [[Don Moen]] of [[Integrity Music]] is quoted as saying, “The Language of Music takes the mystery out of music theory and explains it in a very clear, practical, straightforward way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donmoen.com/about/|title=About - Don Moen - Praise &amp; Worship Leader|website=donmoen.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musician [[Abraham Laboriel]] states, “…more than just practical music theory, this book is an outpouring of the heart and spirit…”.  Rick Muchow, Music Director of [[Saddleback Church]] says, “…this is a guidebook to modern music theory that every musician needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rickmuchow.com/about/|title=About|website=rickmuchow.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings''''' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257&lt;/ref&gt; is a reconstruction of the chronology of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. The book was originally his doctoral dissertation and is widely regarded as the definitive work on the chronology of [[History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah#Iron_Age_II_.281000.E2.80.93587.C2.A0BCE.29|Hebrew Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiele's chronology is accepted in several recent study Bibles, and is the chronology used for the Hebrew monarchs in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (T. C. Mitchell, "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.)" ''CAH'' 3, Part 1, p. 445). Thiele's chronology with the slight modifications of Leslie McFall, ("A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 [1991], pp. 3-45) is accepted in Jack Finegan's influential ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'', rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998), p. 249. See also, in the notes below, the list of scholars who accept his date for the beginning of the divided kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered the classic and comprehensive work in reckoning the accession of kings, calendars, and co-regencies, based on biblical and extra-biblical sources.

==Biblical chronology ==
The chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah rests primarily on a series of reign lengths and cross references within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] or the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and fitting them into the chronology of other ancient civilizations.

However, some of the biblical cross references did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King [[Asa of Judah]] had a cumulative error of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on. He explained this pattern as a result of two different methods of reckoning regnal years: the ''accession year'' method in one and the ''non-accession year'' method in the other. Under the accession year method, if a king died in the middle of a year, the period to the end of that year would be called the "accession year" of the new king, whose Year 1 would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year. Israel appears to have used the non-accession method, while Judah used the accession method until [[Athaliah]] seized power in Judah, when Israel's non-accession method appears to have been adopted in Judah.

In addition, Thiele also concluded that Israel counted years starting in the spring month of [[Nisan]], while Judah counted years starting in the autumn month of [[Tishri]]. The cumulative impact of differing new years and different methods of calculating reigns explained, to Thiele, most of the apparent inconsistencies in the cross references.

Unknown to Thiele when he first published his findings, these same conclusions that the northern kingdom used non-accession years and a spring New Year while the southern kingdom used accession years and a fall New Year had been discovered by [[Valerius Coucke]] of Belgium some years previously, a fact which Thiele acknowledges in his ''Mysterious Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysterious Numbers'', 3rd ed., p. 59, n. 17, citing V. Coucke, "Chronique biblique," in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Based on his conclusions, Thiele showed that the 14 years between [[Ahab]] and [[Jehu]] were really 12 years. This enabled him to date their reigns precisely, for [[Ahab]] is mentioned in the [[Kurkh Monolith|Kurk Stele]] which records the Assyrian advance into Syria/Israel at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, and Jehu is mentioned on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] paying tribute in 841 BC. As these two events are dated by Assyrian chronology as being 12 years apart, Ahab must have fought the Assyrians in his last year and Jehu paid tribute in his first year.

Thiele was able to reconcile the Biblical chronological data from the books of Kings and Chronicles with the exception of synchronisms between [[Hoshea]] of Israel and [[Hezekiah]] of Judah towards the end of the kingdom of Israel and reluctantly concluded that at that point the ancient authors had made a mistake. Oddly, it is at that precise point that he himself makes a mistake, by failing to realize that Hezekiah had a coregency with his father Ahaz, which explains the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms. This correction has been supplied by subsequent writers who built on Thiele’s work, including Thiele’s colleague [[Siegfried Horn]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah’s Reign," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 2 (1964) pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; TC Mitchell and [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', 1st ed., JD Douglas, editor; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie McFall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | first = Leslie | last = McFall | title = Translation Guide | page = 12 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rKrw27MI?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-19 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's method in arriving at his chronology has been contrasted with the analytical method employed by [[Julius Wellhausen]] and other scholars who follow some form of the [[documentary hypothesis]]. Wellhausen taught that the chronological data of the books of Kings and Chronicles were artificially put together at a date much later than the events they were ostensibly describing and were basically not historical.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen, ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' (New York: Meridian Books, 1957) p. 151, originally published as ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels'' (Berlin: Reimer, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a necessary consequence of his ''a priori'' assumption that the biblical books as we have them today were the work of late-date editors who could not possibly have known the correct history of the times they were writing about. Theodore Robinson summarized this position as follows: "Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. Robinson, ''A History of Israel'' (Oxford, 1932) I, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellhausen's methodology in interpreting the Scriptures and the history of Israel has therefore been classed by RK Harrison as a deductive approach; that is, one that starts with presuppositions and derives a historical reconstruction from those presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Harrison, "The Critical Use of the OT," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' (Jan–Mar 1989) pp. 12–20.&lt;/ref&gt; A necessary consequence of this approach has been that no general agreement has been reached on the chronology of the Hebrew kingdom period as calculated by authors who adopted this method. "The disadvantage of the deductive approach is that nothing is settled for certain; the results obtained are as diverse as the [[presupposition (philosophy)|presupposition]]s of the scholars, since diverse presuppositions produce diverse results."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Rodger C | last = Young | contribution = Inductive and Deductive Methods as Applied to OT Chronology | title = [[The Master's Seminary Journal]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | year = 2007 | page = 102 | format = PDF | contribution-url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj18e.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Thiele's method of determining the chronology of the Hebrew kings was based on induction, that is, making it a matter of first priority to determine the actual methods used by ancient scribes and court recorders in recording the years of kings, as described above. Thiele's inductive method, then, was based on inscriptional evidence from the ancient Near East, and not on the presuppositions followed by liberal scholarship. It is Thiele's method that has produced the determinative studies for the chronology of the kingdom period, not the presupposition-based method, so that even those interpreters who continue in late-date theories for the authorship of Scripture have recognized the credibility of Thiele's scholarship in determining the date for the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, as cited above. The work of Thiele and other textual scholars who have followed an inductive (evidence-based) approach is therefore significant in providing an alternative to the methods of the documentary hypothesis, and the success of that approach has been seen as theologically significant in supporting a high view of the inspiration of Scripture, particularly regarding its integrity in the abundant and complex historical data related to the kingdom period.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the chronological data of the MT [ [[Masoretic text]] ] were not authentic—the actual dates and synchronisms for these various kings—then neither Thiele nor McFall nor anyone else could have constructed a chronology from them that in every case is faithful to the original texts and in every proven instance is consistent with Assyrian and Babylonian chronology. This mathematical demonstration should sit in judgment over the various theories of text formation: If a theory of text formation cannot explain how the chronological data of the MT has produced a chronology that in every respect seems authentic for the four centuries of the monarchic period, then that theory must be rejected as another example of a presupposition-based approach that cannot meet the rational criteria for credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, review of Christine Tetley's ''The Reconstructed Chronology of the Divided Kingdom'' (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2005), in ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45:2 (2007), pp. 282-283 ([http://home.swbell.net/rcyoung8/TetleyReview.rtf Link]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception==

Thiele's chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars,&lt;ref&gt;'Not all scholars are convinced by this solution, and commentators on the prophetic books often accept that dates can only be approximate.', McConville, G (2002). Exploring the Old Testament, Volume 4: The Prophets (viii).  London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Despite that fact of scholarly dedication, neither Thiele’s carefully argued University of Chicago dissertation, nor anyone else’s, has achieved as yet universal acceptance.', Kaiser, WC (1998). A history of Israel: From the bronze age through the Jewish Wars (293). Nashville, TN: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; nor has any other scholar’s work in this field. Yet the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps has achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology, so that Assyriologist [[Donald Wiseman|DJ Wiseman]] wrote “The chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele,”&lt;ref&gt;Donald J Wiseman, ''1 and 2 Kings'' in ''[[Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries]]'' (Leicester: Intervarsity, 1993), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, Leslie McFall: “Thiele’s chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.”&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “The Chronology of Saul and David,” ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 53 (2010) 215, n. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in his chronology,&lt;ref&gt;'but his harmonizing approach has not gone unchallenged, especially because of the many shifts in the basis of reckoning dates that it requires (e.g., Jepsen 1968: 34–35)—shifts which were unlikely in actual practice.', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his final conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;'Driver described Thiele’s system as an “important work, which comes very near to, if it does not actually reach, a final solution of the problem of the dates of the kings of Israel and Judah.”  Even a critic of Thiele’s system who accused him of manipulating variable factors to achieve his goal of fitting the biblical evidence into Near Eastern history and who described his work as “more a study in numerical ingenuity than in scholarly research” had to admit that “Thiele’s assumption is validated by the results achieved: inner consistency and harmony and conformity with the fixed dates of ancient Near Eastern history.”', McFall, Leslie, 'A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles', Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 148. 1991 (589) (4). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, even scholars sharing Thiele's religious convictions have maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.

{{quote |In his desire to resolve the discrepancies between the data in the Book of Kings, Thiele was forced to make improbable suppositions…  There is no basis for Thiele's statement that his conjectures are correct because he succeeded in reconciling most of the data in the Book of Kings, since his assumptions… are derived from the chronological data themselves…"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=QkgEaWG0_j4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+chronology+of+the+kings+of+Israel+and+Judah#v=onepage&amp;q=Temple&amp;f=false | first = Gershon | last = Galil | title = The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah | publisher = Brill | year = 1996 | page = 4| isbn = 9004106111 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The numerous extrabiblical synchronisms he invokes do not always reflect the latest refinements in Assyriological research (cf.

This citation, from a critic of Thiele's system, demonstrates the difference mentioned above between the deductive approach based on presuppositions and an inductive approach based on data, not a priori assumptions. Thiele is criticized here for basing his theories on data or evidence, not on presuppositions.

Despite these criticisms Thiele's methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;'Thiele’s work has become a cornerstone of much recent chronological discussion (cf. De Vries IDB 1: 580–99; IDBSup: 161–66);', Freedman, D. N. (1996).  Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;'Following Thiele’s revolutionary work, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, a consensus has emerged that the kingdom under Solomon divided at his death in 931 BC.

Cross, "An Interpretation of the Nora Stone," ''Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research'' 208 (1972) p. 17, n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and others studying the chronology of the kings of Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of these studies is found in William H. Barnes, ''Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), pp. 29-55, and also in Rodger C. Young, "Three Verifications of Thiele's Date for the Beginning of the Divided Kingdom," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45 (2007), pp. 179-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Thiele's work has found widespread recognition and use across various related scholarly disciplines. His date of 931 BCE, in conjunction with the synchronism between Rehoboam and Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shishak]] in 1 Kings 14:25, is used by Egyptologists to give absolute dates to Egypt’s [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]], and his work has also been used by scholars in other disciplines to establish Assyrian and Babylonian dates.&lt;ref&gt;'In a 1996 article, Kenneth Strand wrote, “What has generally not been given due notice is the effect that Thiele’s clarification of the Hebrew chronology of this period of history has had in furnishing a corrective for various dates in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian history.”28  The purpose of Strand’s article was to show that Thiele’s methodology accomplished more than just producing a coherent chronology from scriptural data. His chronology, once produced, proved useful in settling some troublesome problems in Assyrian and Babylonian history. As Strand pointed out, this outcome was quite the opposite of what some of Thiele’s critics asserted, namely that Thiele merely juggled the scriptural data until he could match generally accepted dates from the surrounding nations.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (112–113). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Thiele's reconstruction led to further research which has refined or even departed from his synthesis. Notable studies of this type include work by Tadmor&lt;ref&gt;'H. Tadmor (EncMiqr 4: 245–310) bases his chronology upon considerations similar to those of Begrich and Thiele, but assumes far fewer systemic fluctuations; items which are inexplicable are regarded as late editorial calculations or errors.', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'While also somewhat conservative in his approach to the figures in MT, Tadmor’s pragmatic reconstruction delves into the process by which the redactor(s) of Kings compiled their chronological framework from heterogeneous materials, sometimes leaving traces in textual inconsistencies (Tadmor EncMiqr 4: 45).', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and McFall.&lt;ref&gt;'It remained then for others to complete the application of principles that Thiele used elsewhere, thereby providing a chronology for the eighth-century kings of Judah that is in complete harmony with the reign lengths and synchronisms given in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly attitudes towards the Biblical record of the Israelite monarchies from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were largely disparaging, treating the records as essentially fictional and dismissing the value of the regnal synchronisms.&lt;ref&gt;'R. Kittel: “Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning.. . .”5 Theodore H. Robinson: “Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given.”6 S. R. and G. R. Driver: “Since, however, it is clear on various grounds that these synchronisms are not original, any attempt to base a chronological scheme on them may be disregarded.”7 Karl Marti: “Almost along the whole line, the discrepancy between synchronisms and years of reign is incurable.”8 TMSJ 18:1 (Spring 2007) p. 102 Cyrus Gordon: “The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors. . . . [T]he editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully.”9', Young, Roger C, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' Volume 48. 2005 (2) (233). Lynchburg, VA: The Evangelical Theological Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, modern scholarly attitudes to the monarchical chronology and synchronisms in 1 and 2 Kings has been far more positive subsequent to the work of Thiele and those who have developed his thesis further,&lt;ref&gt;' The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen. That was the logical outgrowth of Thiele’s work, and it attained a holy grail that had been sought for twenty-two centuries, namely a rational explanation of the chronological data of the Hebrew monarchies that was consistent with the scriptural texts used to construct the chronology, and also consistent with several fixed dates from Assyrian and Babylonian history.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; a change in attitude to which recent archaeology has contributed.&lt;ref&gt;'Grabbe suggests that the names and sequence of kings in Israel and Judah, and their approximate chronological placement, agrees with what can be gleaned from extra-biblical sources. To this extent the biblical framework (meaning primarily 1 and 2 Kings) is reliable: even if we had no external sources we could have reasonable confidence in the biblical sequence of Jeroboam I, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Omri, Ahab, Jehu, etc. in Samaria, and David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat, etc. in Jerusalem, along with their interrelationships. Beyond that it starts to get more and more tricky, with decreasing reliability in the biblical narrative as the detail increases (this is a general statement, and there are sometimes exceptions in specific instances).', Grabbe, L.

'''Visual semiotics''' is a sub-domain of semiotics that analyses the way visual images communicate a message.

Studies of meaning evolve from [[semiotics]], a philosophical approach that seeks to interpret messages in terms of signs and patterns of symbolism. Originating in literary and linguistic contexts, the study of [[semiotics]] (or semiology in [[France]]) has been expanding in a number of directions since the early turn-of-the-century work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the U.S. and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Ferdinand Saussure]] in France.

A sign can be a word, sound, or visual image. Saussure divides a sign into two components: the signifier, which is the sound, image, or word, and the signified, which is the concept or meaning the signifier represents. As Berger points out, the problem of meaning arises from the fact that the relation between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary and conventional. In other words, signs can mean anything we agree that they mean, as well as mean different things to different people. Nonverbal signs can produce many complex symbols and hold multiple meanings.

==Belgian input==
[[Image:Groupe Mu 1991.jpg|thumb|The Mu Group µ in 1991 : J.-M. Klinkenberg, P. Minguet, F. Edeline.]]The Belgian Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of visual semiotics, on a cognitive basis, as well as a [[visual rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Trait of sign visual (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most signs operate on several levels—iconic as well as symbolic and/or indexical. This suggests that visual semiotic analysis may be addressing a hierarchy of meaning in addition to categories and components of meaning. As [[Umberto Eco]] explains, "what is commonly called a 'message' is in fact a ''text'' whose content is a multilevel ''discourse''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Umberto Eco|title=A Theory of Semiotics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BoXO4ItsuaMC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=1979|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20217-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadening concept of text and discourse encourages additional research into how visual communication operates to create meaning. Deely explains that "at the heart of [[semiotics]] is the realization that the whole of human experience, without exception, is an interpretive structure mediated and sustained by signs." [[Semiotics]] now considers a variety of texts, using Eco's terms, to investigate such diverse areas as movies, art, advertisements, and fashion, as well as visuals. In other words, as Berger explains, "the essential breakthrough of semiology is to take linguistics as a model and apply linguistic concepts to other phenomena--texts--and not just to language itself." Anthropologists like [[Grant McCracken]] and marketing experts like [[Sydney Levy]] have even used semiotic interpretations to analyze the rich cultural meanings of products and consumer consumption behaviors as texts.

Visual texts are an important area of analysis for semioticians and particularly for scholars working with visually intensive forms such as advertising and television because images are such a central part of our [[mass communication]] sign system. Linda Scott has deconstructed the images in perfume advertising as well as in Apple's "1984" commercial using close readings of the various messages that can be interpreted from the ads. Shay Sayre has also looked at perfume advertising images and the visual rhetoric in Hungary's first free election television advertisements using [[semiotic analysis]]. Also using [[semiotics]], [[Arthur Asa Berger]] has deconstructed the meaning of the "1984" commercial as well as programs such as Cheers and films such as Murder on the Orient Express.

Systems of meaning, Culler and Berger tells us, are analyzed by looking at cultural and communication products and events as signs and then by analysing the relationship between these signs. The categories of signs and the relationships between them create a system. Barthes, for example, has analyzed the "fashion system," and classified the system of communication through fashion into two categories: image clothing and descriptive clothing. Likewise, an advertisement has its own system of meaning. We expect an appeal to purchase, either directly or implied, to be made and a product to be shown, for example, as part of the advertising system.&lt;ref&gt;Visual Communication Division of AEJMC, Washington, DC, August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book Discourses in Place: Language in the material world, Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon note that visual semiotics has to do with turning “from the spoken, face-to-face discourses to the representations of that interaction order in images and signs” (82). Interaction order involves the various social interactions that takes place in any setting, such as being alone, being with a companion, at a meeting, watching a show etc., and it “is almost always complex,” with various interactions occurring at once (83). When it comes to images, says Scollon and Wong, there are also multiple relationships. These include the relationships between the components of a visual image, the relationships between the producers of the visual image, the relationships between the producers and the components, as well as the relationships between the components of an image and those who are viewing it. That's are the main point.

This interaction order has four main semiotic systems, says Scollon and Wong. These include represented participants, modality, composition and interactive participants. Represented participants are elements of a visual image, and are either narrative (“present unfolding actions and events or… processes of change”) or conceptual (“show abstract, comparative or generalized categories”) (Scollon and Wong 86). Modality is how true to reality a visual image is, and main indicators include color saturation, color differentiation, depth, illumination and brightness, among others. With modality, it is often found “that truth, veracity, or sincerity might be expressed in very different ways from one society to another,” with Western cultures favoring naturalistic representation, or as true to seeing it in person as possible (Scollon and Wong 89-90).

Composition is the way in which represented participants within a visual image are arranged in relation to one another, with the three main systems of compositions being ideal-real(top to bottom), given-new(left to right), and center-margin relationships (Scollon and Wong 92). So for example, when reading a menu at a fast food restaurant, the given information would be something such as “hamburger,” and the new information would be the price, read left to right and recognized in that order. As mentioned above, interactive participants, explain Scollon and Wong, are the various relationships that occur around a visual image, such as those between the producers of the image and the represented participants in that image. In this way, these four components work together to help convey the meaning of signs and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, Ronald, and Suzanne B. K. Wong Scollon. Discourses in Place: Language in the Material World. London: Routledge, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of Visual Semiotics==
The [[International Association of Visual Semiotics]] was formed in 1989. The Association, being of an international nature, recognizes three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. The Association is in French and Spanish:  Association Internationale de Sémiotique Visuelle and El Asociación Internacional de Semiótica Visual, respectively.

Congresses have been held in Blois (France) 1989,  Bilbao (Spain) 1992, Berkeley (California, USA) 1994,  São Paulo (Brazil) 1996, Siena (Italy) 1999, Québec (Canada) 2001, Mexico city 2003, Lyon (France) 2004, Istanbul (Turkey) 2007, Venice (Italy) 2010, and Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AISV Buenos Aires 2012 |url=http://www.aisv2012.org |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous Presidents: [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (2001-2012), Paolo Fabbri (1998-2001), Ana Claudia de Oliveira (1996-1998), [[Jacques Fontanille]] (1994-1996), Fernande Saint-Martin (1990-1994), Michel Costantini (1989-1990).

Visual Semiotics are also associated with that of Film, Fashion and Advertising. it is suggested that the use of semiotics in films are used to connote a specific underlying theme like that of the nuclear bomb in Godzilla.

'''Vivian Morgan Carkeek''' (November 23, 1879 - December 29, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] attorney and businessman from [[Seattle, Washington]].

Born to Morgan and Emily Carkeek,&lt;ref&gt;Dorpat, Paul (August 19, 2005). "Celebrating in Style," Pacific NW Magazine, [http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/celebrating-in-style/ ''Seattle Times''] ("The Carkeeks were English immigrants, and their children, Guendolen and Vivian, kept the family's Anglo-Saxon flame lit. More than a student of the King Arthur legend, the lawyer Vivian Carkeek was a true believer, and for years the national president of the Knights of the Round Table. Guendolen was packed off to England as a teenager to go to school, although she wound up living in Paris and marrying a Russian count. Later, she returned to Seattle to help revive the historical society that her mother founded in 1911.")&lt;/ref&gt; one of the area's early pioneer families for whom [[Carkeek Park]] is named, Carkeek graduated from the [[University of Washington School of Law]]'s inaugural class in 1901 (a classmate of [[Walter B. Beals]] and [[Walter M. French]], who later married Vivian's cousin, Bessie Westlake Carkeek), and was a partner at the firm Carkeek, McDonald, Harris and Coryell.&lt;ref&gt;''American Legal News'' (1915), vol. 26, p. 38 (Washington news: "Announcement has been made of the dissolution of the law firm of Carkeek, McDonald &amp; Kapp, 1207 American Bank Building, Seattle, by the retirement of F.C.

Carkeek, like his mother and [[Guendolen Plestcheeff|sister]], was passionately interested in the history of the Seattle area, and he served briefly as president of the Seattle Historic Society, which his mother had founded in 1911, and was a founding officer of the Associates of Eighty-Nine, which was established in 1919 to perpetuate remembrance of the [[Great Seattle Fire]]. In the early 1930s he financed the acquisition of theater historian J. Willis Sayre's private collection of 12,500 theatrical programs for the [[Seattle Public Library]]. Carkeek also established the "Vivian Carkeek Prize" which is annually awarded "for the best student contribution to the ''Washington Law Review'' on a point of Washington law or any point of peculiar interest to Washington attorneys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors &amp; Awards|url=https://www.law.washington.edu/students/academics/honors.aspx|website=School of Law|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orbis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flom|first1=Eric|title=Silent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786439084|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRUhxhNTZngC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Associates of Eighty-Nine Will Celebrate June 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYpNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=Business Chronicle of the Pacific Northwest|date=May 31, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;
