[[Boron]] can be prepared in several crystalline and [[amorphous]] forms. Well known crystalline forms are α-rhombohedral, β-rhombohedral, and β-tetragonal.  In special circumstances, boron can also be synthesized in the form of its α-tetragonal and γ-orthorhombic allotropes. Two amorphous forms, one a finely divided powder and the other a glassy solid, are also known.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=930}}{{sfn|Housecroft |Sharpe|2008|p=331}} Although at least 14 more allotropes have been reported, these other forms are based on tenuous evidence or have not been experimentally confirmed, or are thought to represent mixed allotropes, or boron frameworks stabilized by impurities.{{sfn|Donohue|1982|p=48}}{{sfn|Housecroft |Sharpe|2008|p=331}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lundström | first = T. | editor1-first = J.

Amorphous powder boron and [[polycrystalline]] rhombohedral β-boron are the most common forms. The latter allotrope is a very hard&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[Vickers hardness]] comparable to that of cubic [[boron nitride]]&lt;/ref&gt; grey material, about ten percent lighter than aluminium and with a melting point (2080&amp;nbsp;°C) several hundred degrees higher than that of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor = Lide, D.

Elemental boron has been found in star dust and meteorites but does not exist in the high oxygen environment of Earth. It is difficult to extract from its compounds. The earliest methods involved reduction of [[boric oxide]] with metals such as [[magnesium]] or [[aluminium]]. However, the product is almost always contaminated with metal [[boride]]s. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1149/1.2428689|title =High-Purity Crystalline Boron|year =1958|first1 = D.

==α-rhombohedral boron==
α-rhombohedral boron has a unit cell of twelve boron atoms. The structure consists of {{chem|B|12}} icosahedra in which each boron atom has five nearest neighbors within the icosahedron. If the bonding were the conventional [[covalent]] type then each boron would have donated five electrons. However, boron has only three valence electrons, and it is thought that the bonding in the {{chem|B|12}} icosahedra is achieved by the so-called 3-center electron-deficient bonds where the electron charge is accumulated at the center of a triangle formed by three adjacent atoms.{{sfn|Nelmes|Loveday|Allan|Besson|1993}}

The isolated {{chem|B|12}} icosahedra are not stable; thus boron is not a molecular solid, but the icosahedra in it are connected by strong covalent bonds.

==α-tetragonal boron==
Pure α-tetragonal can only be synthesized as thin layers deposited on an underlying substrate of isotropic boron carbide (B&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or nitride (B&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=930}} Most examples of α-tetragonal boron&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Structure of Tetragonal Boron| doi =10.1021/ja01550a019|year =1958 |journal =Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume =80|pages =4507|issue = 17| last1 =Hoard| first1 =J.

==β-rhombohedral boron==
β-rhombohedral boron has a unit cell containing 105–108 atoms. Most atoms form B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; discrete icosahedra; a few form partially interpenetrating icosahedra, and there are two deltahedral B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; units, and a single central B atom.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=931}} For a long time, it was unclear whether the α or β phase is most stable at ambient conditions; however, gradually a consensus was reached that the β phase is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope.{{sfn|Oganov|Chen|Ma|Glass|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Unifying Electron-Counting Rule for Macropolyhedral Boranes, Metallaboranes, and Metallocenes|author = Jemmis, E.D. |author2=Balakrishnarajan, M.M. |author3=Pancharatna, P.D.|journal = J.

The γ-phase can be described as a NaCl-type arrangement of two types of clusters, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedra and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pairs.

While this allotrope is occasionally mentioned in the literature,{{sfn|Amberger|1981|pp=21, 27, 74}} no subsequent work appears to have been published either confirming or discrediting its existence. Donohue (1982) commented{{sfn|Donohue|1982|p=80}} that the number of atoms in the unit cell did not appear to be icosahedrally related (the icosahedron being a motif common to boron structures).
 
==High-pressure superconducting phase==
Compressing boron above 160 GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure. Contrary to other phases, which are [[semiconductor]]s, this phase is a [[metal]] and becomes a [[superconductor]] with a critical temperature increasing from 4 K at 160 GPa to 11 K at 250 GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Mikhail Eremets|Eremets, M.

'''Banat Air Flight 166''' was an Antonov [[Antonov An-24]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|YR|AMR}}) chartered on 13 December 1995 from [[Romavia]] by [[Banat Air]].

It was due to fly from [[Verona]], Italy, to [[Timişoara]], Romania, when it crashed shortly after take-off, killing all eight crewmembers and 41 passengers. It later emerged that the aircraft was severely overloaded and its wings were contaminated with ice and snow. The accident was the 116th loss of an Antonov 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19951213-0 ASN Aircraft accident Antonov 24B YR-AMR Verona Airport (VRN)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
Whilst parked in parking spot B6 at Verona-Villafranca Airport, snow fell continuously and the outside temperature was 0&amp;nbsp;°C. After forty-one passengers boarded Flight 166 to Romania, the pilot declined to have the plane [[Deicing|deiced]]. At just past 19:30 local time, the aircraft [[taxiing|taxied]] to the end of [[runway]] 23; however heavy traffic delayed the departure.

When the Banat Air flight was cleared for [[takeoff]], the [[outside temperature]] was below the [[freezing]] point. Shortly after lifting off, the aircraft reached its maximum speed. Banking to the right, the [[airspeed]] dropped dramatically, and so the pilot applied nose down [[Tailplane#Elevator|elevator]], causing the speed to increase again. Continuing their right hand bank, the flight crew again applied nose up elevator. The speed then dropped significantly, and the plane banked at sixty seven degrees. The pilots were unable to regain control of the plane and it struck the ground right-wing first, breaking up and bursting into flames.

==Investigation==
[[File:IncidenteAereoVillafranca2.jpg|thumb|Only the tail of Flight 166 that was left intact in the crash]]
Investigators concluded that there were multiple causes for the accident, including the disruption of airflow over the wings due to ice formation on the wings, due to the plane taking off without being de-iced. They also determined that spatial disorientation and the plane being overloaded by about 2000 kilograms played key parts in the accident.

Ideas in science and technology often arise from studying nature. In the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, [[Galileo Galilei|G. Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler|J. Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|I. Newton]] studied the motion of the sun and the planets and developed the first empirical equation to describe gravity. A few years later, [[Michael Faraday|M. Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell|J. C. Maxwell]] derived the fundamentals of electromagnetism by examining interactions between electrical currents and magnets. The studies of heat transfer and mechanical work lead to the understanding of [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. However, [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] originated from the spectroscopic study of light. Current objects of attention are originated in chemistry but the most abundant of them are found in biology, e.g. the study of [[Genetics|genetics]], characteristics of cells and the development of higher animals and disease.&lt;ref name="George M. Whitesides"/&gt;

===The current field of research===
Bio-inspiration is a solidly established strategy in the field of [[chemistry]], but it is not a mainstream approach. Especially, this research is still developing its scientific and technological systems, on academic and industrial levels. 

This field dates back from the 1980s but in the 2010s, many natural phenomena have not been studied.&lt;ref name="George M. Whitesides"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitesides |first1=G. M. |title=Bioinspiration: something for everyone |journal=Interface Focus |date=15 May 2015 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=20150031–20150031 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krishnan |first1=Rajeshwar |title=Biomimetic or Bioinspired? |url=https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/fal/fal12/fal_win12_p003.pdf |publisher=The Electrochemical Society (ECS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical characteristics of bioinspiration==

===Function===
Bio-inspired research is quite different from chemistry research. This research does not focus on complexity and microscopic things like molecular structure. It is based on observing and understanding the functions from the products of biological evolution.

===A limitless source of ideas===
There are various kinds of organisms and many different strategies that have proved successful in biology at solving some functional problem. Some kinds of high-level bio functions may seem simple, but they are supported by many layers of underlying structures, processes, molecules and their elaborate interaction. There is no chance to run out of phenomena for bio-inspired research.

===Simplicity===
Often, bio-inspired research about something can be much easier than precisely replicating the source of inspiration. For example, researchers do not have to know how a bird flies to make an airplane.

===Trans-cultural field===
Bio-inspiration returns to observation of nature as a source of inspiration for problem-solving and make it part of a grand tradition. The simplicity of many solutions emerge from a bio-inspired strategy, combined with the fact that different geographical and cultural regions have different types of contact with animals, fish, plants, birds and even microorganisms. This means different regions will have intrinsic advantages in areas in which their natural landscape is rich. So bio-inspired research is trans-cultural field.

== Technical applications ==
There are many technical applications available nowadays that are bioinspired. However, this term should not be mixed up with [[biomimicry]]. For example, an airplane in general is bioinspired by birds. The wing tips of an airplane are biomimetic because its original function of minimizing turbulence and therefore needing less energy to fly, is not changed or improved compared to nature's original. Also, Nano 3D printing method is also one of the novel method for bioinspiration. Plants and animals have particular properties which are often related to their composition of nano- and micro surface structures. Many research have already been tried to mimic ''[[Salvinia molesta]]'' leaves for superhydrophobicity, [[gecko]]'s toes which increase the amount of attractive [[Van der Waals force]] that lead to adhesiveness even on slippery surfaces, and [[moth]] antennae which inspire a new approach to detect chemical leaks, drugs and explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anthony |first1=Lowder |title=Nanoscribe’s Nano 3D Printer Used to Study Animal Shapes and Bioinspired Materials - 3D Printing Media Network |url=https://www.3dprintingmedia.network/nanoscribes-nano-3d-printer-used-study-animal-shapes-bioinspired-materials/ |website=3D Printing Media Network |date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Züricher Spielzeugmuseum 1000752.jpg|thumb|A 'Birmingham Dribbler', Stevens's Model Dockyard, England, around 1890]]
'''Birmingham Dribbler''' or '''carpet railway''' describes a type of very early [[model railroad|model railway]]. It is a bit of a misnomer, as the railway featured a model [[live steam]] railway locomotive, but no track – the locomotive was simply run across the floor. In some cases, the front wheels were even made steerable so that they could be run in a circle without track. They first appeared in the 1840s and became very popular [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[model railway]] [[toy]]s.

The [[steam locomotive]]s were very simple, usually made in [[brass]], with a pair of simple [[Oscillating cylinder steam engine|oscillating cylinders]] driving the main wheels. They were basically a [[boiler]] mounted on wheels, although simple decoration (usually bands of lacquer) was sometimes applied.  Track was not used – the boiler was filled with water, the burner lit, and when steam was being produced, the locomotive was placed on the floor and allowed to run until either the water or fuel ran out or the engine crashed into the furniture.  Very quickly, after a number had exploded, simple safety valves were fitted.

They quickly gained the nickname of '''Birmingham Dribblers''' (or sometimes "Piddlers"), as large numbers of them were made in [[Birmingham]], England, and they had the unfortunate habit of leaving a trail of water behind them as they ran across the floor.  Very often this trail would be mixed with the fuel used for the burner, and there were numerous incidents of fires caused by the locomotive crashing into furniture and over-turning so that the burning fuel was spilled over the floor. As time passed, embellishments were added, such as wooden [[buffer beam]]s, [[Buffer (rail transport)|buffers]] and [[steam whistle]]s.

==Recent models==
&lt;!-- Despite the vague information, I think it worth advising people that more modern examples are available. --&gt;
[[File:Rew13d27-814 Hemmens Dribbler.JPG|thumb|A modern (c1978?) reproduction of a "Birmingham Dribbler" steam engine, made by Maxwell Hemmens.]]
Not all Birmingham Dribblers are Victorian antiques. In the late 1970s to 1990s, a brass, self-assembly kit for a Birmingham Dribbler model was manufactured by Maxwell Hemmens Precision Steam Models of Yorkshire, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scratch built and model live steam engines|url=http://www.mikes-steam-engines.co.uk/scratch_built.htm |work=(Photographs of Maxwell Hemmens' made and un-made kits)&lt;!-- includes photos of the boxes! --&gt;|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed models are still available from John Hemmens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steamengines.co.uk/BIRMINGHAM-DRIBBLER.aspx Birmingham Dribblers from John Hemmens]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">[[Image:Bisulfite-S-H-tautomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|A [[ball-and-stick model]] of the most commonly stated structure (the one having ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry) for the bisulfite ion in solution and in the solid state. Note that the hydrogen is bonded to the sulfur atom.]]

'''Bisulfite''' ion ([[IUPAC]]-recommended nomenclature: '''hydrogen sulfite''') is the ion HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  Salts containing the HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion are termed bisulfites also known as sulfite lyes.  For example, [[sodium bisulfite]] is NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Structure==
[[Image:Bisulfite-equilibrium-2D.png|thumb|right|Bisulfite tautomers in equilibrium]]  [[Image:Bisulfite-equilibrium-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Ball-and-stick models of the proposed bisulfite equilibrium. The tautomer on the right has ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.]]

Some evidence may suggest that the proton in bisulfite ion is located on sulfur, giving rise to [[molecular symmetry|''C''&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]].  There is, however, some evidence from [[oxygen-17|&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O]] [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] spectroscopy to suggest that two [[tautomer|tautomeric]] forms of HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; exist in dynamic equilibrium, one which has the proton attached to sulfur (HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and one which is protonated at oxygen (HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; structure is supported by [[X-ray crystallography]] and, in aqueous solution, by [[Raman spectroscopy]] (ν(S–H) = 2500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Reactions==
Bisulfite salts are typically prepared by treatment of alkaline solutions with excess [[sulfur dioxide]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaOH  →  NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[conjugate base]] of [[sulfurous acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Sulfurous acid is not an isolable compound and does not appear to exist in solution either.   An equilibrium that is much more consistent with [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] evidence is given :
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is a weak acidic species with a [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 6.97.  Its conjugate base is the [[sulfite]] ion, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;:
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Bisulfites are reducing agents, as are all sulfites and sulfur dioxide, which contains sulfur in the same oxidation state (+4).

==Medicine==
Bisulfite salts are common additives to the drug [[epinephrine]] in order to prevent its oxidation to [[adrenochrome]] and resulting inactivation.  Bisulfites can sometimes cause an allergic reaction.  This is different from the common [[sulfa drugs]] allergy.  The quantity of bisulfite in medical pain blockers that initiates Type 1 hypersensitivity has been determined by Fraser and Huang.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Blast gates''' are [[gate valve]]s used to focus a [[dust collection system]]'s [[vacuum]] [[pressure]] for maximum dust (or other material) extraction at the desired location. Blast gates are positioned near individual pieces of machinery and operate by being, by default, closed &amp;mdash; blocking air flow. When one blast gate is opened, all available suction is focused at that location, maximizing the amount of material collected.

Note that in larger dust collection system installations with more available power, multiple blast gates may be opened at the same time without detriment to collection abilities at individual locations. In fact, some systems are so powerful that at least one blast gate ''must'' be open at all times, or the system can collapse itself.

The '''Burgas–Alexandroupoli pipeline''' was a proposed [[oil pipeline]] project for transportation of [[Russia]]n and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil from the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Black Sea]] port of [[Burgas]] to the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] port of [[Alexandroupoli]]. It was seen as an alternative route for Russian oil, bypassing the [[Bosporus]] and the [[Dardanelles]].  However, in December 2011 the project was suspended by the Bulgarian government due to environmental and supply concerns.

==History==
The pipeline project was proposed in 1993–1994 by several Russian and Greek companies.&lt;ref name=transneft&gt;{{cite news

In February 1998, a Greek [[consortium]] for pipeline construction named Bapline was established, and in May 1998, a memorandum of creation of the Transbalkan Oil Pipeline Company was signed.&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt; In 2000, a technical specifications and an economic evaluation of the project were prepared by the [[Germany|German]] company ILF.&lt;ref name=transneft/&gt;

A joint protocol for preparing the pipeline's construction was signed by the three countries in January 2005.&lt;ref name=emb&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical features and financing==
The main pipeline with a diameter of {{convert|36|in|mm|-2}} would be {{convert|279|km|mi|0}} long, and it would transport 15-23&amp;nbsp;million tons of oil per year during the first phase, as well as 35&amp;nbsp;million during the second.&lt;ref name=transneft/&gt;  The pipeline would have three oil refilling stations, two of which in Bulgaria (the first one at [[LUKOIL Neftochim Burgas|Neftochim]] close to Burgas) and one at Alexandroupoli. The project included reconstruction of Burgas and Alexandroupolis terminals, including oil tanks with a capacity of 600,000&amp;nbsp;tons in Burgas, and 1,200,000&amp;nbsp;tons in Alexandroupolis.&lt;ref name=bapline/&gt;

The pipeline was expected to cost up to €1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;

==Controversy==
There were several competitive pipeline projects, such as the [[AMBO pipeline]] from Burgas to [[Vlorë]], [[Pan-European Pipeline]] from [[Constanţa]] to [[Trieste]], [[Odessa-Brody pipeline|Odessa-Brody-Plotsk pipeline]], [[Kiykoy-Ibrice pipeline]], and Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline — all aimed to transport oil from the Black Sea bypassing Turkish straits.  The project of the Burgas–Alexandroupoli pipeline was described as one of the shortest pipeline through a plain terrain and therefore to be one of the cheapest and cost effective.&lt;ref name=bapline&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.doingbusiness.ro/energy2007/presentations/getfile.php?filename=AMBO-Christos_Dimas.pdf |title=Burgas–Alexandroupolis Oil Pipeline Project |author=Christos Dimas |location=3rd Emerging Europe Energy Summit |format=PDF |date=2007-11-08 |publisher=Bapline |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305075212/http://www.doingbusiness.ro/energy2007/presentations/getfile.php?filename=AMBO-Christos_Dimas.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The critics of the Burgas–Alexandroupoli pipeline project raised environmental concerns because of oil tankers traffic in the Aegean Sea, which contains numerous submerged rocks and island populations dependent on tourism and fishing.&lt;ref name=bank&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4412">'''Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions''' are the axisymmetric eigenfunctions of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] operator, derived by [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] and P.C. Kendall in 1957&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1956). On force-free magnetic fields. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 42(1), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S., &amp; Kendall, P. C. (1957). On force-free magnetic fields. The Astrophysical Journal, 126, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;, in attempting to solve the force-free magnetic fields. The results were independently derived by both, but were agreed to publish the paper together.

If the force-free magnetic field equation is written as &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{H}=\lambda\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; with the assumption of divergence free field (&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{H}=0&lt;/math&gt;), then the most general solution for axisymmetric case is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\nabla\times(\nabla\times\psi\mathbf{\hat n}) + \nabla\times\psi\mathbf{\hat n} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector and the scalar function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[Helmholtz equation]], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\psi + \lambda^2\psi=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The same equation also appears in fluid dynamics in [[Beltrami flow]]s where, vorticity vector is parallel to the velocity vector, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivation==

Taking curl of the equation &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{H}=\lambda\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; and using this same equation, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{H}) = \lambda^2\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the vector identity &lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{H} \right) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{H}) - \nabla^{2}\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, we can set &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{H}=0&lt;/math&gt; since it is solenoidal, which leads to a vector [[Helmholtz equation]],

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\mathbf{H}+\lambda^2\mathbf{H}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Every solution of above equation is not the solution of original equation, but the converse is true.  If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function which satisfies the equation 
&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\psi + \lambda^2\psi=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the three linearly independent solutions of the vector [[Helmholtz equation]] are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \nabla\psi,\quad \mathbf{T} = \nabla\times\psi\mathbf{\hat n}, \quad \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\nabla\times\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed unit vector. Since &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{S} =\lambda\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, it can be found that &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{T})=\lambda(\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{T})&lt;/math&gt;. But this is same as the original equation, therefore &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the poloidal field and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the toroidal field. Thus, substituting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;, we get the most general solution as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\nabla\times(\nabla\times\psi\mathbf{\hat n}) + \nabla\times\psi\mathbf{\hat n}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Cylindrical polar coordinates==

Taking the unit vector in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}=\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, with a periodicity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction with vanishing boundary conditions at &lt;math&gt;r=a&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is given by&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, D., Turner, L., &amp; Vahala, G. (1978). Three‐dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in cylindrical geometry. The Physics of Fluids, 21(5), 757-764.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Z. (1991). Discrete eigenstates of plasmas described by the Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions. Progress of theoretical physics, 86(1), 45-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = J_m(\mu_jr)e^{im\theta+ikz}, \quad \lambda =\pm(\mu_j^2+k^2)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_m&lt;/math&gt; is the Bessel function, &lt;math&gt;k=\pm 2\pi n/L, \ n = 0,1,2,...&lt;/math&gt;, the integers &lt;math&gt;m =0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the boundary condition &lt;math&gt;a k\mu_j J_m'(\mu_j a)+m \lambda J_m(\mu_j a) =0.&lt;/math&gt; The eigenvalues for &lt;math&gt;m=n=0&lt;/math&gt; has to be dealt separately.
Since here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}=\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, we can think of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction to be toroidal and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; direction to be poloidal, consistent with the convention.

[[File:Biga. Festa do esquecemento. Xinzo de Limia, Ourense, Galicia.jpg|thumb|A chariot drawn by horses]]
[[File:Chariot spread.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Approximate historical map of the spread of the spoke-wheeled chariot, 2000–500 BC]]

A '''chariot''' is a type of [[carriage]] driven by a charioteer, usually using horses{{Efn|Although there were rare exceptions to the use of horses to pull chariots. For instance, the lion-pulled chariot described by Plutarch in his "Life of Antony".}} to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile [[archery]] platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people.

The word "chariot" comes from the [[Latin]] term '''''carrus''''', a loanword from [[Gaulish]]. A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a ''car''. In [[ancient Rome]] and some other [[Ancient history#Europe and Mediterranean|ancient Mediterranean civilizations]], a ''[[Biga (chariot)|biga]]'' required two horses, a ''[[Triga (chariot)|triga]]'' three, and a ''[[quadriga]]'' four.

The chariot was a fast, light, open, two-[[wheel]]ed conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for [[ancient warfare]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for [[travel]], in [[Parade|processions]], for [[game]]s, and in [[Chariot racing|races]].

The critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the [[spoke]]d [[wheel]]. The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC. The use of chariots peaked around 1300&amp;nbsp;BC (see [[Battle of Kadesh]]). Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD, but [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] continued to be popular in [[Constantinople]] until the 6th century.

==Europe==
===Ancient Europe===
====Caucasus region====
Horses were introduced to [[Transcaucasia]] at the time of the [[Kura-Araxes culture]], beginning about 3300 BC. (Archeologists have not found earlier horse bones in the area.) During the Kura-Araxes period, horses seem to become quite widespread, with signs of domestication.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;pg=PA298 ''The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World.''] Princeton University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|1400831105}} p298.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Europe====
The [[domestication of the horse]] was an important step toward civilization. An increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis, that horses were domesticated in the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s ([[Dereivka]] in [[Ukraine]]) approximately 4000-3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Matossian ''Shaping World History'' p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imh.org/legacy-of-the-horse/what-we-theorize-when-and-where-did-domestication-occur/ |title=What We Theorize – When and Where Did Domestication Occur |accessdate=2010-12-12 |work=International Museum of the Horse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217005628/http://imh.org/legacy-of-the-horse/what-we-theorize-when-and-where-did-domestication-occur/ |archivedate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |title=Horsey-aeology, Binary Black Holes, Tracking Red Tides, Fish Re-evolution, Walk Like a Man, Fact or Fiction |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2009/03/07/horsey-aeology-binary-black-holes-tracking-red-tides-fish-re-evolution-walk-like-a-man-fact-or-ficti/|work=Quirks and Quarks Podcast with Bob Macdonald |publisher= [[CBC Radio]] |date=2009-03-07 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the [[wheel]] used in [[transportation]] most likely took place in Mesopotamia or the Eurasian steppes in modern-day Ukraine. Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the mid [[4th millennium BC]] near-simultaneously in the Northern Caucasus ([[Maykop culture]]), and in Central Europe. The earliest vehicles may have been [[Bullock cart|ox carts]].&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;pg=PA461 ''The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World.''] Princeton University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|1400831105}} p416&lt;/ref&gt;

Starokorsunskaya kurgan in the [[Kuban]] region of Russia contains a wagon grave (or [[chariot burial]]) of the [[Maikop Culture]] (which also had horses). The two solid wooden wheels from this kurgan have been dated to the second half of the fourth millennium. Soon thereafter the number of such burials in this Northern Caucasus region multiplied.&lt;ref name="asianreviewofbooks.com"&gt;Christoph Baumer, [http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/pages/?ID=1478 ''The History of Central Asia: The Age of the Steppe Warriors''.] I.B. Tauris, 2012 {{ISBN|1780760604}} p90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;Chris Fowler, Jan Harding, Daniela Hofmann, eds, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=2PAkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 ''The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe.''] OUP Oxford, 2015 {{ISBN|0191666882}} p113&lt;/ref&gt;

As David Anthony writes in his book [[The Horse, the Wheel and Language]], in Eastern Europe, the earliest well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (a wagon with two axles and four wheels) is on the [[Bronocice pot]] (c. 3500 BC). It is a clay pot excavated in a [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnelbeaker]] settlement in [[Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship|Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anthony |first=David A. |title=The horse, the wheel, and language: how Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=2007 |page=67 |isbn=0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest securely dated real wheel-axle combination in Eastern Europe is the [[Ljubljana Marshes Wheel]] (c. 3150 BC).&lt;ref name="Slovenia"&gt;{{cite web |title=World's Oldest Wheel Found in Slovenia |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/background_information/culture/worlds_oldest_wheel_found_in_slovenia/ |date=March 2003 |publisher=Government Communication Office of the Republic of Slovenia |author=Gasser, Aleksander }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
The earliest records of chariots are the arsenal inventories of the palatial centres in [[Mycenaean Greece]], as described in [[Linear B]] tablets from the 15th-14th centuries BC. The tablets distinguish between "assembled" and "dismantled" chariots.

The latter [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the first millennium BC had a (still not very effective) [[cavalry]] arm, and the rocky terrain of the [[Geography of Greece|Greek mainland]] was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in [[epic poetry]]. [[Linear B]] tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Panathenaic Games]] and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in ''[[hippodrome]]s'' and in contests called ''[[agon]]s''. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a ''[[paranymph]]'', or friend of a bridegroom, went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.

[[Herodotus]] (''Histories'', 5. 9) Reports that chariots were widely used in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]]–[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] steppe by the [[Sigynnae]].

[[File:Parade charriots Louvre CA2503.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Procession of chariots on a [[Geometric art|Late Geometric]] [[amphora]] from Athens (ca. 720–700 BC)]]

Greek chariots were made to be drawn by two [[horse]]s attached to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or ''trace'' fastened to the front or ''prow'' of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize [[vase]]s in the [[British Museum]] from the [[Panathenaic Games]] at [[Athens, Greece]], in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.

The body or ''basket'' of the chariot rested directly on the [[axle]] (called ''beam'') connecting the two wheels. There was no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3&amp;nbsp;ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, making it easy to mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.

[[File:Delphi charioteer front DSC06255.JPG|left|thumb|upright=.75|The ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]'' was dedicated to the god [[Apollo]] in 474 BC by the tyrant of [[Gela#Ancient era|Gela]] in commemoration of a [[Pythian games|Pythian racing victory]] at [[Delphi]]]]

The reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through rings attached to the [[horse collar|collar]] bands or yoke, and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense.

The wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron. They had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=J. E.|title=Structures, or Why Things Don't Fall Down|year=1978|publisher=Pelican|location=London|isbn=9780140219616|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other nations of this time had chariots of similar design to the Greeks, the chief differences being the mountings.

According to Greek mythology, the chariot was invented by [[Erichthonius of Athens]] to conceal his feet, which were those of a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/3390.html Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable. Char’iot.] Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Encyclopedia, Dictionary, Thesaurus and hundreds more. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable appearance of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when [[Phaethon|Phaëton]], the son of [[Helios]], in an attempt to drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a ''phaeton'' as one who drives a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Chariot Allegory]]'', depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for chariot, ἅρμα, ''hárma'', is also used nowadays to denote a [[tank]], properly called άρμα μάχης, ''árma mákhēs'', literally a "combat chariot".

====Northern Europe====
[[File:Kiviksgraven slab 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[petroglyph]] in [[the King's Grave|a double burial]], c. 1000 BC (the [[Nordic Bronze Age]])]]

The [[Trundholm sun chariot]] is dated to c. 1400 BC (see [[Nordic Bronze Age]]). The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels, and the Sun itself on two. All wheels have four spokes. The "chariot" comprises the solar disk, the axle, and the wheels, and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger. Nevertheless, the presence of a model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing.

In addition to the Trundholm chariot, there are numerous [[petroglyph]]s from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots. One petroglyph, drawn on a stone slab in a [[the King's Grave|double burial]] from c. 1000 BC, depicts a biga with two four-spoked wheels.

The use of the [[composite bow]] in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe.

====Western Europe and British Isles====
The [[Celts]] were famous for their chariots and modern English words like ''car'', ''carriage'' and ''carry'' are ultimately derived from the native [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic language]] ([[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]]: ''Cerbyd''). The word ''chariot'' itself is derived from the [[French language|Norman French]] ''charriote'' and shares a Celtic root ([[Gaulish]]: ''karros''). Some 20 [[Iron Age|iron-aged]] [[chariot burial]]s have been excavated in Britain, roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC. Virtually all of them were found in [[East Yorkshire]] - the exception was a find in 2001 in [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]], 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Edinburgh]].

The Celtic chariot, which may have been called [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Celtic/karbantos|''karbantos'']] in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] (compare Latin ''carpentum''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Karl|first=Raimund|editor-first=John T|editor-last=Koch|editor-link=John T.

British chariots were open in front. [[Julius Caesar]] provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10657/10657.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook of "De Bello Gallico" and Other Commentaries by Caius Julius Caesar, translated by W. A. MacDevitt (1915).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chariots play an important role in [[Irish mythology]] surrounding the hero [[Cú Chulainn]].

[[File:Boudiccastatue.jpg|thumb|Sculpture by [[Thomas Thornycroft]] of [[Boudica]] and her daughters in her chariot, addressing her troops before the battle]]
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0010.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of chariots and warriors on the [[Vix krater|Vix ''krater'']] (c. 510), a vessel of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] workmanship found in a Gallic burial]]

Chariots could also be used for ceremonial purposes. According to [[Tacitus]] (''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 14.35), [[Boudica]], queen of the [[Iceni]] and a number of other tribes in a formidable uprising against the occupying Roman forces, addressed her troops from a chariot in 61 AD:

: "Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens, ut quamque nationem accesserat, solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur"

: ''Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women.''

The last mention of chariot use in battle seems to be at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], somewhere in modern Scotland, in 84 AD. From [[Tacitus]] (''[[Agricola (Tacitus)|Agricola]]'' 1.35–36) "The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry." The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries: "Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled, and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry."

[[File:Husitsky bojovy vuz replika.jpg|thumb|Modern reconstruction of a [[Hussite]] war wagon]]

Later through the centuries, the chariot, became commonly known as the "[[war wagon]]". The "war wagon" was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields. The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets, supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand-gunners; side walls were use for protection against archers, crossbowmen, the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire.

It was especially useful during the [[Hussite Wars]], ca. 1420, by [[Hussite]] forces rebelling in [[Bohemia]]. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s larger forces of mounted [[knight]]s.

====Etruria====
[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Monteleone Chariot]] at the Met (c. 530 BC)]]
The only intact [[Monteleone chariot|Etruscan chariot]] dates to c. 530 BC and was uncovered as part of a [[chariot burial]] at [[Monteleone di Spoleto]]. Currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eust/hod_03.23.1.htm METmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; it is decorated with bronze plates decorated with detailed low-relief scenes, commonly interpreted as depicting episodes from the life of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 The Golden Chariot of Achilles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221124/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 |date=March 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urartu====
In [[Urartu]] (860–590 BC), the chariot was used by both the nobility and the military. In Erebuni ([[Yerevan]]), King Argishti of Urartu is depicted riding on a chariot which is dragged by two horses. The chariot has two wheels and each wheel has about eight spokes. This type of chariot was used around 800 BC.

====Rome====
[[File:Winner of a Roman chariot race.jpg|thumb|A winner of a Roman [[chariot racing|chariot race]]]]

In the [[Roman Empire]], chariots were not used for warfare, but for [[chariot racing]], especially in [[circus (building)|circuses]], or for triumphal processions, when they could be drawn by as many as ten horses or even by dogs, tigers, or ostriches{{fact|date=June 2018}}. There were four divisions, or ''factiones'', of charioteers, distinguished by the colour of their costumes: the red, blue, green and white teams. The main centre of chariot racing was the [[Circus Maximus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 The Charioteer of Delphi: Circus Maximus.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221124/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 |date=March 16, 2008 }} The Roman Mysteries books by Caroline Lawrence.&lt;/ref&gt; situated in the valley between the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] Hills in Rome. The track could hold 12 chariots, and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the ''spina''. Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], even after the [[Olympic Games]] had been disbanded, until their decline after the [[Nika riots]] in the 6th century. The starting gates were known as the Carceres.

An ancient Roman car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast together with the horses drawing it was called a ''[[Quadriga]]'', from the Latin ''quadriugi'' (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team drawing it, was a ''triga'', from ''triugi'' (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team drawing it, was a ''biga'', from ''biugi''.

==Ancient Near East==
Some scholars argue that the horse chariot was most likely a product of the ancient Near East early in the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Raulwing 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Joost Crouwel writes that "Chariots were not sudden inventions, but developed out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels. This development can best be traced in the Near East, where spoke-wheeled and horse-drawn chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE..." and were illustrated on a Syrian cylinder seal dated to either the 18th or 17th century BC.&lt;ref name=Crouwel&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joost Crouwel|editor1-last=Veldmeijer|editor1-first=Andre J.|editor2-last=Ikram|editor2-first=Salima|title=Chasing Chariots: Proceedings of the First International Chariot Conference (Cairo 2012)|date=2013|publisher=Sidestone Press|isbn=978-9088902093|page=74|chapter=Studying the Six Chariots from the Tomb of Tutankhamun – An Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early wheeled vehicles in the Near East===
[[File:Standard of Ur - War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8&lt;!--low aspect image--&gt;|Relief of early [[war wagon]]s on the [[Standard of Ur]], c. 2500 BC]]

It is widely believed that wheeled transport was invented in [[Mesopotamia]]. Nevertheless, recent archaeological evidence seems to indicate otherwise, pointing to Neolithic Europe.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt;

According to [[Christoph Baumer]], the earliest discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia come from the first half of the third millennium BC – more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region. At the same time, in Mesopotamia, some intriguing early pictograms of a sled that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found. They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel.&lt;ref name="asianreviewofbooks.com"/&gt;

The earliest fully developed spoke-wheeled horse chariots are from the [[chariot burial]]s of the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] (Timber-Grave) sites of the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] [[Proto-Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] culture in modern Russia and [[Kazakhstan]] from around 2000 BC. This culture is at least partially derived from the earlier [[Yamna culture]]. It built heavily fortified settlements, engaged in [[Bronze Age|bronze]] metallurgy on an industrial scale and practiced complex burial rituals reminiscent of [[Hindu]] rituals known from the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the ''[[Avesta]]''.

Over the next few centuries, the [[Andronovo culture]] spread across the steppes from the [[Urals]] to the [[Tien Shan]], likely corresponding to the time of early [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian cultures]].

Chariots figure prominently in Indo-Iranian mythology. Chariots are also an important part of both [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Persian mythology]], with most of the gods in their [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] portrayed as riding them. The [[Sanskrit]] word for a chariot is ''rátha-'' ([[Masculine gender|m.]]), which is cognate with [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''raθa-'' (also m.), and in origin a substantiation of the adjective [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*rot-h₂-ó-}}'' meaning "having wheels", with the characteristic accent shift found in Indo-Iranian substantivisations. This adjective is in turn derived from the collective noun ''{{PIE|*rot-eh₂-}}'' "wheels", continued in Latin ''rota'', which belongs to the noun ''{{PIE|*rót-o-}}'' for "wheel" (from ''{{PIE|*ret-}}'' "to run") that is also found in Germanic, Celtic and Baltic ([[Old High German]] ''rad'' n., [[Old Irish]] ''roth'' m., [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''rãtas'' m.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rix |first1=Helmut |last2=Kümmel |first2=Martin |last3=Zehnder |first3=Thomas |last4=Lipp |first4=Reiner| last5=Schirmer|first5=Brigitte|title=[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]|date=2001 |publisher=Ludwig Reichert |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=3-89500-219-4 |page=507 |edition=2nd |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest depiction of vehicles in the context of warfare is on the [[Standard of Ur]] in southern Mesopotamia, c. 2500 BCE. These are more properly called [[wagons]] or [[carts]] and were double-axled and pulled by oxen or a hybrid of a [[donkey]] and a female [[onager]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Origin of the Indo-Iranians|author= Elena Efimovna Kuzʹmina| page=134|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; named Kunga in the city of [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Nagar]] which was famous for breeding them.&lt;ref name="kunga1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=AaZg0ypYrnQC&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Ebla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East|author= Paolo Matthiae,Nicoló Marchetti| page=436|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrids were used by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite]],&lt;ref name="kunga1" /&gt; [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|early Sumerian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Ur III]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;pg=PA403#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World |author= David W.

The Sumerians had a lighter, two-wheeled type of cart, pulled by four asses, and with solid wheels. The spoked wheel did not appear in Mesopotamia until the mid-2000s BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Alive!

Chariots are frequently mentioned in the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] and the [[Greek Old Testament]], respectively, particularly by the prophets, as instruments of war or as symbols of power or glory. First mentioned in the story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 50:9), "Iron chariots" are mentioned also in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (17:16,18) and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] (1:19,4:3,13) as weapons of the [[Canaan]]ites and [[Israelites]]. [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 13:5 mentions chariots of the [[Philistines]], who are sometimes identified with the [[Sea Peoples]] or [[Mycenaean Greece|early Greeks]].

===Egypt===
{{Main article|Chariotry in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Ramses II at Kadesh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramses II]] fighting from a chariot at the [[Battle of Kadesh]] with two archers, one with the reins tied around the waist to free both hands (relief from [[Abu Simbel]])]]

The chariot and horse were introduced to [[Egypt]] by the [[Hyksos]] invaders in the 16th century BCE and undoubtedly contributed to the military success of the Egyptians. In the remains of [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Assyria]]n art, there are numerous representations of chariots, which display rich ornamentation. The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BCE. As a general rule, the Egyptians used chariots as mobile archery platforms; chariots always had two men, with the driver steering the chariot with his reins while the main archer aimed his bow and arrow at any targets within range. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]. Chariots can be carried by two or more horses.

===Hittites===
[[File:Hittite Chariot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] chariot (drawing of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] relief)]]

The oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the [[Hittite language|Old Hittite]] [[Anitta text]] (18th century BCE), which mentions 40 teams of horses (in the original [[cuneiform]] spelling: 40 ''ṢÍ-IM-TI'' ANŠE.KUR.RA&lt;sup&gt;ḪI.A&lt;/sup&gt;) at the siege of [[Salatiwara]]. Since the text mentions ''teams'' rather than ''chariots'', the existence of chariots in the 18th century BCE is uncertain. The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BCE ([[Hattusili I]]). A Hittite horse-training text is attributed to [[Kikkuli the Mitanni]] (15th century BCE).

The [[Hittites]] were renowned charioteers. They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels, with four spokes rather than eight, and that held three rather than two warriors. It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots. Typically one Hittite warrior steered the chariot while the second man was usually the main archer; the third warrior would either wield a spear or sword when charging at enemies or hold up a large shield to protect himself and the others from enemy arrows. 

Hittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources, specifically metals. As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia, tensions flared among the neighboring [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hurrian]]s, and [[Egyptians]]. Under [[Suppiluliuma I]], the Hittites conquered [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and, eventually, the whole of [[Syria]]. The [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BCE is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving over 5,000 chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Aaron Ralby|title=Atlas of Military History|year=2013|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1|pages=54–55|chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BCE: Clash of Empires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia===
{{Main article|Scythed chariot}}

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] succeeded [[Elam]] in the mid 1st millennium. They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots. They also used [[scythed chariot]]s. [[Cyrus the Younger]] employed these chariots in large numbers at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].

[[File:Oxus chariot model.jpg|thumb|A golden chariot made during [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550–330 BCE).]]
[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]] and the [[Indus River|Indus]] [[satrapy]] supplied cavalry and chariots to [[Xerxes the Great]]'s army. However, by this time, [[cavalry]] was far more effective and agile than the chariot, and the defeat of [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BCE), where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind, marked the end of the era of chariot warfare (barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers, India, China, and the Celtic peoples).

{{Main article|Chariot (China)}}
The earliest archaeological evidence of chariots in China, a chariot burial site discovered in 1933 at Hougang, [[Anyang]] in [[Henan]] province, dates to the rule of King [[Wu Ding]] of the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1200 BCE). [[Oracle bone inscription]]s suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle, but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command-vehicles and in royal hunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Shaughnessy |first= Edward L. |title= Historical Perspectives on The Introduction of The Chariot Into China |journal= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |year= 1988 |pages= 189–237 |doi= 10.2307/2719276 |publisher= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 48, No. 1 |jstor= 2719276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charioteer figure, bronze, Eastern Zhou Dynasty.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|Bronze Chinese charioteer from the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC)]]
During the Shang Dynasty, members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants, including a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses, but four-horse variants are occasionally found in burials.

[[Jacques Gernet]] claims that the [[Zhou dynasty]], which conquered the Shang ca. 1046 BC, made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and "invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast".&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. ''A History of Chinese Civilization'', Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-49781-7}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew consisted of an archer, a driver, and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or [[dagger-axe]]. From the 8th to 5th centuries BCE the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.

Massed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the [[Warring States period|Warring-States Period]] (476–221 BC). The main reasons were increased use of the [[crossbow]], use of long halberds up to 18 feet long and pikes up to 22 feet long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of [[mounted archer]]y from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221-206 BC) and the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 AD), while armored chariots were also used during the Han Dynasty against the [[Xiongnu]] Confederation in the [[Han–Xiongnu War]] (133 BC to 89 AD), specifically at the [[Battle of Mobei]] (119 BC).

Before the Han Dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.&lt;ref&gt;[Mencius · Liang Hui Huang (King the Hui of Liang, Hui is a posthumous name) Volume One] 'The kingslayer of a country of ten thousands chariots, must be the house of thousand chariots. The kingslayer of a country of thousand chariots, must be the house of hundred chariots.' [Zhao Qi's note] Zhao Qi's note: ' Ten thousands chariots, is the son of heaven (King of Zhou).'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Zhan Guo Ce·Zhao Ce] 'Nowadays, Kingdom of Qin is a country of ten thousands chariots, Kingdom of Liang (Kingdom of Wei, 'Da Liang' is the capital of Wei) is also a country of ten thousands chariots.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariots figure prominently in the [[Rigveda]], evidencing their presence in India in the 2nd millennium BCE. Among [[Rigvedic deities]], notably [[Ushas]] (the dawn) rides in a chariot, as well as [[Agni]] in his function as a messenger between gods and men.

There are some depictions of chariots among the [[petroglyphs]] in the sandstone of the [[Vindhya]] range. Two depictions of chariots are found in Morhana Pahar, [[Mirzapur]] district. One depicts a biga and the head of the driver. The second depicts a quadriga, with six-spoked wheels, and a driver standing up in a large chariot box. This chariot is being attacked. One figure, who is armed with a shield and a mace, stands in the chariot's path; another figure, who is armed with bow and arrow, threatens the right flank. It has been suggested (speculated) that the drawings record a story, most probably dating to the early centuries BCE, from some center in the area of the [[Ganges]]–[[Yamuna]] plain into the territory of still Neolithic hunting tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Sparreboom 1985:87&lt;/ref&gt; The very realistic chariots carved into the [[Sanchi]] [[stupa]]s are dated to roughly the 1st century.

The [[scythed chariot]] was invented by the King of [[Magadha]], [[Ajatashatru]] around 475 BCE. He used these chariots against the [[Licchavi (republic)|Licchavis]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} A [[scythe]]d war chariot had a sharp, sickle-shaped blade or blades mounted on each end of the [[axle]]. The blades, used as weapons, extended horizontally for a metre on the sides of the chariot.

There is a chariot displayed at the [[AP State Archaeology Museum]], [[Hyderabad, Telangana]].

==Gauge==
A popular legend that has been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 4&amp;nbsp;ft {{frac|8|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in [[Standard gauge|standard railroad gauge]] to Roman times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62159153 |title=STANDARD RAILWAY GAUGE. |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Queensland |date=5 October 1937 |accessdate=3 June 2011 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it was based on the distance between the ruts of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the [[Roman Empire]].{{Efn|The gaps in the pedestrian crossings in [[Pompeii]] could give credence or otherwise to this statement, but no relevant studies appear to have been made.}}  This is encouraged by the fact that the otherwise peculiar distance is almost exactly 5 Roman feet but there is no evidence to span the millennium and a half between the departure of the Romans from Britain and the adoption of the gauge on the [[Stockton and Darlington]] railroad in 1825.

'''Dynamic voltage scaling''' is a [[power management]] technique in [[computer architecture]], where the voltage used in a component is increased or decreased, depending upon circumstances. Dynamic voltage scaling to increase voltage is known as '''overvolting'''; dynamic voltage scaling to decrease voltage is known as '''undervolting'''. Undervolting is done in order to [[energy conservation|conserve power]], particularly in [[laptop]]s and other mobile devices,&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where energy comes from a battery and thus is limited, or in rare cases, to increase reliability. Overvolting is done in order to increase computer performance.

The term "overvolting" is also used to refer to increasing static operating voltage of [[computer]] components to allow operation at higher speed ([[overclocking]]).

==Background==
[[MOSFET]]-based digital circuits operate using voltages at circuit nodes to represent logical state.  The voltage at these nodes switches between a high voltage and a low voltage during normal operation&amp;mdash;when the inputs to a [[logic gate]] transition, the transistors making up that gate may toggle the gate's output.

At each node in a circuit is a certain amount of [[capacitance]].  Capacitance can be thought of as a measure of how long it takes for a given current to produce a given voltage change. The capacitance arises from various sources, mainly transistors (primarily [[gate capacitance]] and [[diffusion capacitance]]) and wires ([[Coupling (electronics)|coupling capacitance]]).  Toggling a voltage at a circuit node requires charging or discharging the capacitance at that node; since currents are related to voltage, the time it takes depends on the voltage applied.  By applying a higher voltage to the devices in a circuit, the capacitances are charged and discharged more quickly, resulting in faster operation of the circuit and allowing for higher frequency operation.

==Methods==
Many modern components allow voltage regulation to be controlled through software (for example, through the [[BIOS]]).  It is usually possible to control the voltages supplied to the CPU, [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], and [[PCI Express]] (or [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]]) port through a PC's BIOS.

However, some components do not allow software control of supply voltages, and hardware modification is required by overclockers seeking to overvolt the component for extreme overclocks.  [[Video card]]s and [[motherboard]] [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]]s are components which frequently require hardware modifications to change supply voltages.

These modifications are known as "voltage mods" in the overclocking community.

==Undervolting==

Undervolting is reducing the voltage of a component, usually the processor, reducing temperature and cooling requirements, and possibly allowing a fan to be omitted.

=={{anchor|Switching power}}Power==
The ''switching power'' dissipated by a chip using static [[CMOS]] gates is ''C·V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·f'', where C is the [[capacitance]] being switched per clock cycle, V is the supply [[voltage]], and f is the switching frequency,&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Rabaey. Digital Integrated Circuits. Prentice Hall, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; so this part of the power consumption decreases quadratically with voltage.  The formula is not exact however, as many modern chips are not implemented using 100% CMOS, but also use special memory circuits, [[dynamic logic (digital electronics)|dynamic logic]] such as [[domino logic]], etc. Moreover, there is also a static [[leakage (semiconductors)|leakage current]], which has become more and more accentuated as feature sizes have become smaller (below 90 nanometres) and threshold levels lower.

Accordingly, dynamic voltage scaling is widely used as part of strategies to manage switching power consumption in battery powered devices such as cell phones and laptop computers.  Low voltage modes are used in conjunction with lowered clock frequencies to minimize power consumption associated with components such as CPUs and DSPs; only when significant computational power is needed will the voltage and frequency be raised.

Some peripherals also support low voltage operational modes.  For example, low power MMC and SD cards can run at 1.8 V as well as at 3.3 V, and driver stacks may conserve power by switching to the lower voltage after detecting a card which supports it.

When leakage current is a significant factor in terms of power consumption, chips are often designed so that portions of them can be powered completely off.  This is not usually viewed as being dynamic voltage scaling, because it is not transparent to software.  When sections of chips can be turned off, as for example on [[Texas Instruments|TI]] [[OMAP|OMAP3]] processors, drivers and other support software need to support that.

==Program execution speed==
The speed at which a digital circuit can switch states - that is, to go from "low" ([[IC power supply pin|VSS]]) to "high" ([[IC power supply pin|VDD]]) or vice versa - is proportional to the voltage differential in that circuit. Reducing the voltage means that circuits switch slower, reducing the maximum frequency at which that circuit can run. This, in turn, reduces the rate at which program instructions that can be issued,  which may increase run time for program segments which are sufficiently CPU-bound.

This again highlights why dynamic voltage scaling is generally done in conjunction with dynamic frequency scaling, at least for CPUs.  There are complex tradeoffs to consider, which depend on the particular system, the load presented to it, and power management goals.  When quick responses are needed, clocks and voltages might be raised together.  Otherwise, they may both be kept low to maximize battery life.

==Implementations==
The 167-processor [[Asynchronous array of simple processors|AsAP 2]] chip enables individual processors to make extremely fast (on the order of 1-2ns) and locally controlled changes to their own supply voltages. Processors connect their local power grid to either a higher (VddHi) or lower (VddLow) supply voltage, or can be cut off entirely from either grid to dramatically cut leakage power.

Another approach uses per-core on-chip switching regulators for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~meeta/my_papers/hpca08_onchipvrm.pdf "System Level Analysis of Fast, Per-Core DVFS using On-Chip Switching Regulators"].
2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating system API==

Unix system provides a userspace governor, allowing to modify the cpu frequencies (though limited to hardware capabilities).

==System stability==
[[Dynamic frequency scaling]] is another power conservation technique that works on the same principles as dynamic voltage scaling. Both dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic frequency scaling can be used to prevent computer system overheating, which can result in program or operating system [[Crash (computing)|crashes]], and possibly hardware damage. Reducing the voltage supplied to the CPU below the manufacturer's recommended minimum setting can result in system instability.

==Temperature==
The efficiency of some electrical components, such as voltage regulators, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power used may increase with temperature causing [[thermal runaway]]. Increases in voltage or frequency may increase system power demands even faster than the CMOS formula indicates, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article821-page5.html | title = Asus EN9600GT Silent Edition Graphics Card | author = Mike Chin | page = 5 | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPCRNewLevels"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article814-page1.html | title = 80 Plus expands podium for Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold | author = MIke Chin | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caveats==
The primary caveat of overvolting is increased heat: the power dissipated by a circuit increases with the square of the voltage applied, so even small voltage increases significantly affect power.  At higher temperatures, transistor performance is adversely affected, and at some threshold, the performance reduction due to the heat exceeds the potential gains from the higher voltages.  Overheating and damage to circuits can occur very quickly when using high voltages.

There are also longer-term concerns: various adverse device-level effects such as [[hot carrier injection]] and [[electromigration]] occur more rapidly at higher voltages, decreasing the [[MTBF|lifespan]] of overvolted components.

'''Energy in Indonesia''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption, import and export in [[Indonesia]]. In 2009 Indonesia produced oil, [[coal]], [[natural gas]] and [[palm oil]], utilised also as energy raw material in 2010. Renewable energy potential in Indonesia is high: [[Solar energy|solar]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]] and [[geothermal energy]]. [[Tropical rain forests]] and [[peat]] land areas have extensive coal storage. Indonesia is geologically unstable country.
According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Indonesia was the 10th top natural gas producer in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% of world production of which 36 bcm was exported. In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th top coal producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown. The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = International Energy Agency | title = Key World Energy Statistics 2010 | year = 2010 | accessdate = 13 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil – it has 22 billion barrels of conventional oil and gas reserves, of which about 4 billion are recoverable. That's the equivalent of about 10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal and has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential.

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] energy production increased 34% and export 76% from 2004 to 2008 in Indonesia.

== Energy by sources ==

===Fossil Fuel Energy Sources ===

====Coal====
Indonesia is well-supplied with medium and low-quality thermal coal. At current rates of production, Indonesia's coal reserves are expected to last for over 80 years. In 2009 Indonesia was the world's second top coal exporter sending coal to, for example, China, India, Japan and Italy. [[Kalimantan]] (Borneo) and [[South Sumatra]] are the centres of Indonesia’s coal mining. In recent years, production in Indonesia has been rising rapidly, from just over 200 mill tons in 2007 to over 400 mill tons in 2013. Recently (December 2013), the chair of the [http://apbi-icma.org/en Indonesian Coal Mining Association] said the production in 2014 may reach 450 mill tons.&lt;ref&gt;Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/31/coal-miners-boost-production.html Coal minders to boost production'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 31 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian coal industry is rather fragmented. Output is supplied by a few large producers and a large number of small firms. Large firms in the industry include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/08/05/coal-miners-sell-more-first-half-profits-remain-stagnant.html Coal miners sell more in first half, but profits remain stagnant'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bumi Resources|PT Bumi Resources]] (the controlling shareholder of large coal firms PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin Indonesia)
* PT Adaro Energy
* PT Kideco Jaya Agung
* PT Indo Tambangraya Megah 
* [[Berau Coal Energy|PT Berau Coal]]
* PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (state-owned)

Coal production poses risks for [[deforestation in Kalimantan]]. According to one Greenpeace report, a coal plant in Indonesia has decreased the fishing catches and increased the respiratory-related diseases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] Greenpeace 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil====
[[File:Oil Balance Indonesia.svg|thumb|Indonesia used to be a net oil exporter.]]

Oil is a major sector in the Indonesian economy. During the 1980s, Indonesia was a significant oil-exporting country.  Since 2000, domestic consumption has continued to rise while production has been falling, so in recent years Indonesia has begun importing increasing amounts of oil.  Within Indonesia, there are considerable amounts of oil in Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua Province]]. There are said to be around 60 basins across the country, only 22 of which have been explored and exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Randgga D. Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/21/80-percent-oil-and-gas-revenues-pay-subsidies.html 80 percent of oil and gas revenues pay for subsidies'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Main oil fields in Indonesia include the following:

* '''Minas.''' The Minas field, in [[Riau]] in [[Sumatra]], operated by the US-based firm Chevron Pacific Indonesia, is the largest oil block in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;For some details of Chevron's operations in Indonesia, see the Chevron official [http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/indonesiafactsheet.pdf Indonesia Fact Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;  Output from the field is around 20-25% of current annual oil production in Indonesia.
* '''Duri.'''  The Duri field, in Bengkalis Regency in [[Riau]] in [[Sumatra]], is operated by the US-based firm Chevron Pacific Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmal W. Azwar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/27/chevron-kicks-duri-field-expansion-sumatra.html Chevron kicks off Duri field expansion in Sumatra'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rokan.''' The Rokan field, in [[Riau]] in [[Sumatra]], operated by Chevron Pacific Indonesia, is a recently developed large field in the Rokan Hilir Regency.
* '''Cepu.''' The Cepu field, operated by Mobil Cepu Ltd which is a subsidiary of US-based [[Exxon Mobil]], is on the border of Central and East Java near the town of [[Tuban]].  The field was discovered in March 2001 and is estimated to have proven reserves of 600 million barrels of oil and 1.7 trillion cu feet of gas. Development of the field has been subject to on-going discussions between the operators and the Indonesian government.&lt;ref&gt;Alfian, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/05/15/cepu-delay-losses-ri-could-be-150m.html Cepu delay losses to RI could be up to $150 million'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 15 May 2009.

Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/18/production-target-depends-cepu-block0.html Production target "depends on Cepu block"'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gas====
[[File:Gas Balance Indonesia.svg|thumb|Indonesia's gas balance]]

There is growing recognition in Indonesia that the gas sector has considerable development potential.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Azwar, 'Energy: RI to focus on gas potential with new projects this year', ''The Jakarta Post'', 8 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In principle, the Indonesian government is supporting moves to give increasing priority to investment in natural gas.  In practice, private sector investors, especially foreign investors, have been reluctant to invest because many of the problems that are holding back investment in the oil sector also affect investment in gas.  At present (mid 2013), main potential gas fields in Indonesia are believed to include the following:

* '''Mahakam.'''  The Mahakam block in [[East Kalimantan]], under the management of [[Total S.A.|Total E&amp;P Indonesie]] with participation from the Japanese oil and gas firm [[Inpex]], provides around 30% of Indonesia's natural gas output. In mid 2013 the field was reported to be producing around 1.7 bill cu feet of gas per day as well as 67,000 barrels of condensate. At the time discussions were underway about the details of the future management of the block involving a proposal that [[Pertamina]] take over all or part of the management of the block.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Awar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/26/total-keen-develop-mahakam-with-pertamina.html Total 'keen' to develop Mahakam with Pertamina'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2013 it was reported that Total E&amp;P Indonesie had announced that it would stop exploration for new projects at the field.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Swar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/05/total-stop-mahakam-block-development-amid-uncertainty.html Total to 'stop' Mahakam block development amid uncertainty'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 5 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Energy and Resources Minister issued a regulation stipulating that the management of the block would be transferred from Total E&amp;P Indonesie and Inpex, which had managed the field for over 50 years since 1966, to Pertamina.&lt;ref&gt;Salis W. Aprilian, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/22/sharing-risk-mahakam-block.html Sharing risk in the Mahakam Block'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, it was announced that [http://phe.pertamina.com/AboutPHE.aspx Pertamina Hulu Indonesia], a subsidiary of Pertamina, would take over management of the block on 1 January 2018.
* '''Tangguh.'''  The [[Tangguh gas field|Tangguh field]] in [[Bintuni Bay]] in [[West Papua (province)|West Papua Province]] operated by [[BP]] (British Petroleum) is estimated to have proven gas reserves of 4.4 trillion cu feet.  It is hoped that annual output of the field in the near future might reach 7.6 million tons of [[liquefied natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Aswan, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/17/fujian-may-pay-more-tangguh-gas.html Fujian may pay more of Tangguh gas'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 17 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Arun.''' The Arun field in Aceh has been operated by ExxonMobil since the 1970s.  The reserves at the field are now largely depleted so production is now slowly being phased out.  At the peak, the Arun field produced around 3.4 mill cu feet of gas per day (1994) and about 130,000 of condensate per day (1989).  ExxonMobil affiliates also operate the nearby '''South Lhoksukon A and D fields''' as well as the '''North Sumatra offshore gas field'''.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.exxonmobil.co.id/Indonesia-English/PA/about_where_apo.aspx Aceh Production Operations] of ExxonMobil&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2015, ExxonMobil Indonesia sold its assets in Aceh to Pertamina.  The sale included the divestment by ExxonMobil of its assets (100%) in the North Sumatra Offshore block, its interests (100%) in B block, and its stake (30%) in the PT Arun Natural Gas Liquefaction (NGL) plant. Following the completion of the deal, Pertamina will have an 85% stake in the Arun NGL plant.&lt;ref&gt;Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/14/exxonmobil-sells-aceh-assets-pertamina.html ExxonMobil sells Aceh assets to Pertamina'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 14 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''East Natuna.''' The East [[Natuna gas field]] (formerly known as Natuna D-Alpha) in the [[Natuna Islands]] in the South China Sea is believed to be one of the biggest gas reserves in Southeast Asia.  It is estimated to have proven reserves of 46 trillion cu feet (tcf) of gas.  The aim is to begin expanded production in 2020 with production rising to 4,000 mmscf (million standard cu feet) per day sustained for perhaps 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Azwar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/26/consortium-expects-govt-approval-east-natuna.html Consortium expects govt approval on East Natuna'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Banyu Urip.'''  The Banyu Urip field, a major field for Indonesia, is in the Cepu block in [[Bojonegoro Regency]] in East Java. Interests in the block are held by Pertamina (45%) through its subsidiary PT Pertamina EP Cepu and ExxonMobil Cepu Limited (45%) which is a subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation.  ExxonMobil is the operator of the block.&lt;ref&gt;Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/04/14/pertamina-starts-delivery-cepu-oil-cilacap-balongan.html Pertamina starts delivery of Cepu oil to Cilacap, Balongan'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 14 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Masela.''' The Masela field, currently (early 2016) under consideration for development by the Indonesian Government, is situated to the east of [[Timor|Timor Island]], roughly halfway between Timor and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in Australia.  The main investors in the field are currently (early 2016) [[Inpex]] and Shell who hold stakes of 65% and 35% respectively.  The field, if developed, is likely to become the biggest deepwater gas project in Indonesia, involving an estimated investment of between $14–19 billion. Over 10 trillion cubic feet of gas are said to exist in the block.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina and Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/30/another-delay-masela-gas-block-development.html Another delay for the Masela gas block development.]', ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, development of the field is being delayed over uncertainty as to whether the field might be operated through an offshore or onshore processing facility.  In March 2016, after a row between his ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Anton Hermansyah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/02/masela-saga-another-comical-brouhaha.html Masela saga, another comical brouhaha'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 2 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Jokowi]] decreed that the processing facility should be onshore.&lt;ref&gt;Ayomi Amindoni, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/23/masela-saga-ends-jokowi-announces-onshore-scheme.html Masela saga ends as Jokowi announces onshore scheme'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  This change of plans will involve the investors in greatly increased costs and will delay the start of the project. It was proposed that they submit revised Plans of Development (POD) to the Indonesian Government.&lt;ref&gt;Ayomi Amindoni, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/24/inpex-shell-committed-masela-project-skkmigas.html Inpex, Shell committed to Masela: SKKMigas'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 24 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''List of fields.'''  See also [[List of gas fields in Indonesia]].

====Shale====
There is potential for [[tight oil]] and [[shale gas]] in northern Sumatra and eastern Kalimantan.&lt;ref&gt;Data are scarce.  According to a 2014 study which made reference to Indonesia, "Shale gas resources [in Indonesia] might be substantial, but have been subjected to scant independent scrutiny." See Michael M.D Ross, '[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2014/ewp-403.pdf Diversification of Energy Supply: Prospects for Emerging Snergy Sources'], ADB Economics Working Paper Series, No 403, 2014, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; There are estimated to be 46 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 7.9 billion barrels of shale oil which could be recovered with existing technologies.&lt;ref name=EIAJune2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources: An Assessment of 137 Shale Formations in 41 Countries Outside the United States|url=http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/fullreport.pdf|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|accessdate=11 June 2013|format=PDF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pertamina]] has taken the lead in using [[hydraulic fracturing]] to explore for shale gas in northern Sumatra. Chevron Pacific Indonesia and NuEnergy Gas are also pioneers in using fracking in existing oil fields and in new exploration. Environmental concerns and a government-imposed cap on oil prices present barriers to full development of the substantial shale deposits in the country.&lt;ref name=Time62513&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Embraces Shale Fracking — but at What Cost?:  Shale fracking has already caused waves in the U.S. and is poised to similarly shake up Southeast Asia's energy landscape|url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/25/indonesia-embraces-shale-fracking-but-at-what-cost/|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=Time|date=25 June 2013|author=Charlie Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulawesi, Seram, Buru, Irian Jaya in eastern Indonesia have shales that were deposited in marine environments which may be more brittle and thus more suitable for fracking than the source rocks in western Indonesia which have higher clay content.&lt;ref name=EIAJune2013 /&gt;

====Coal Bed Methane====
With 453 trillion cubic feet [[Coal Bed Methane]] (CBM) reserve mainly in [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], Indonesia has potential to redraft its energy charts as United States with its Shale Gas. But with low enthusiastic to develop CBM project, the government only targeted 8.9 million metric standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/04/21/cbm-could-redraft-indonesia-s-energy-charts.html |title=CBM could redraft Indonesia's  energy charts |author=Rohmad Hadiwijoyo |date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy sources  ===
The contribution of renewable sources of energy to [[energy supply]] as a percentage of total [[primary energy]] (potential) supply in 2010 was 34.5%.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2013) ''Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics'', DOI: 10.1787/factbook-2013-en&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable generation sources supplied 5% to 6% of Indonesia's electricity in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2015/06/11/indonesia-sets-19-renewable-energy-target-2019 Indonesia Sets 19% Renewable Energy Target For 2019], Clean Technica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://energypedia.info/wiki/Indonesia_Energy_Situation Indonesia Energy Situation], Energypedia&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia has set a target of 26% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;REN 21 (2013), ''[[Renewables 2013 Global Status Report]]'', p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biomass ====
An estimated 55% of Indonesia's population, i.e. 128 million people primarily rely upon traditional [[biomass]] (mainly wood) for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;REN 21 (2013), ''Renewables Global Status Report'', p.125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reliance on this source of energy has the disadvantage that poor people in rural areas have little alternative but to collect timber from forests, and often cut down trees, to collect wood for cooking.

A pilot project of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) Power Generator with capacity of 1 Megawatt has been inaugurated in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/09/16/056607446/Indonesia-Builds-First-POME-Power-Generator |title=Indonesia Builds First POME Power Generator |author=Ali Hidayat |date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia has many Palm Oil Mills.

====Hydroelectricity====
Indonesia has set a target of 2 GW installed capacity in [[hydroelectricity]], including 0.43 GW micro hydro, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;REN 21 (2013), ''Renewables Global Status Report'', p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geothermal energy====
{{Main|Geothermal power in Indonesia}}

Indonesia uses [[Geothermal power in Indonesia|some geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE2007_Global_Status_Report.pdf Renewables 2007 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529000000/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE2007_Global_Status_Report.pdf |date=29 May 2008 }}, REN21 sihteeristö (Pariisi) ja Worldwatch institute (Washington, DC), 2008, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Renewable Energy Policy Network's ''Renewables 2013 Global Status Report'', Indonesia has the third largest installed generating capacity in the world. With 1.3 GW installed capacity, Indonesia trails only the United States (3.4 GW) and the Philippines (1.9 GW). However it leads Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.9 GW), New Zealand (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.7 GW), and Japan (0.5 GW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.org/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2013/GSR2013_lowres.pdf Renewables 2013 Global Status Report]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current official policy is to encourage the increasing use of geothermal energy for electricity production.  Geothermal sites in Indonesia include the [[Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station]] and the [[Kamojang]] plant, both in [[West Java]].

The development of the sector has been proceeding rather more slowly than hoped.  Expansion appears to be held up by a range of technical, economic, and policy issues which have attracted considerable comment in Indonesia.  However, it has proved difficult to formulate policies to respond to the problems.&lt;ref&gt;Slamet Susanto, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/13/ri-s-geothermal-energy-still-untouched.html RI's geothermal energy still "untouched"'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 June 2013, and '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/13/govt-set-raise-prices-geothermal-power.html Govt set to raise prices of geothermal power'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 June 2013. See also Hanan Nugroho, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/23/geothermal-challenges-keep-development-track.html Geothermal: Challenges to keep the development on track'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind power====
Low wind speeds mean that there is limited scope for large-scale energy generation from wind in Indonesia. Only small (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;kW) and medium (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;kW) generators are feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasan MH, Mahlia TMI, Nur H|date=2012|title=A review on energy scenario and sustainable energy in Indonesia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032111005995|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=16 |issue=4|pages=2316–2328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a very small amount of (off-grid) electricity is generated using [[wind power]].  For example, a small plant was established at Pandanmino, a small village on the south coast of Java in [[Bantul Regency]], Yogyakarta Province, in 2011.  However it was established as experimental [[Power stations|plant]] and it is not clear whether funding for long-term maintenance will be available.&lt;ref&gt;Salmet Susanto, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/05/pandanmino-self-sufficient-electricity-due-wind-power.html Alternative energy: Pandanmino, self-sufficient in electricity due to wind power'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 5 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar power====
The Indonesian solar PV sector is relatively underdeveloped but has significant potential.  However, for a range of reasons, it is unlikely that it will be practical to expand electricity output from solar sources in Indonesia quickly. A range of technical, financial, economic and social constraints are likely to be constraints on the rapid installation of solar power in Indonesia, including in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of issues involved in expanding capacity in the solar electricity sector in developing Asia, see Michael M.D Ross, '[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2014/ewp-403.pdf Diversification of Energy Supply: Prospects for Emerging Energy Sources'],{{dead link|date=August 2018}} ADB Economics Working Paper Series, No 403, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Output from the solar photovoltaic sector is almost exclusively set aside for decentralised rural electrification. In 2011 the sector produced a relatively small amount of electricity—only 22 MWh.&lt;ref&gt;Observ'ER (2012) Worldwide electricity production from renewable energy sources: Stats and figures series: Fourteenth Inventory - Edition 2012
[http://www.energies-renouvelables.org/observ-er/html/inventaire/Eng/preface.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of energy==

=== Transport sector ===
Much energy in Indonesia is used for domestic transportation. The dominance of private vehicles - mostly cars and motorbikes - in Indonesia has led to an enormous demand for fuel. Energy consumption in the transport sector is growing by about 4.5% every year. There is therefore an urgent need for policy reform and infrastructure investment to enhance the energy efficiency of transport, particularly in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leung KH|date=2016|title=Indonesia's Summary Transport Assessment|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/217196/ino-paper-15-2016.pdf|journal=Asian Development Bank|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are large opportunities to reduce both the energy consumption from the transport sector, for example through the adoption of higher energy efficiency standards for private cars/motorbikes and expanding mass transit networks. Many of these measures would be more cost-effective than the current transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colenbrander S, Gouldson A, Sudmant AH, Papargyropoulou E|date=2015|title=The economic case for low-carbon development in rapidly growing developing world cities: A case study of Palembang, Indonesia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151500021X#bib14|journal=Energy Policy|volume=80|pages=24–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also scope to reduce the carbon intensity of transport energy, particularly through replacing diesel with biodiesel or through electrification. Both would require comprehensive supply chain analysis to ensure that the biofuels and power plants are not having wider environmental impacts such as deforestation or air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theicct.org/publications/biofuels-policy-indonesia-overview-and-status-report|title=Biofuels policy in Indonesia: Overview and status report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electricity sector ===
'''Access to electricity'''

Over 50% of households in 2011 had an electricity connection. An estimated 63 million people in 2011 did not have direct access to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;REN 21 (2013), ''[[Renewables Global Status Report]]'', p.123, Table R17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organisations'''

The electricity sector, dominated by the state-owned electricity utility [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]], is another major consumer of primary energy.

==Major energy companies in Indonesia==

A '''fallstreak hole''' (also known as a '''cavum''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''hole punch cloud''', '''punch hole cloud''', '''skypunch''', '''cloud canal''' or '''cloud hole''') is a large gap, usually circular or elliptical, that can appear in [[cirrocumulus]] or [[altocumulus]] [[clouds]]. Such holes are formed when the water temperature in the clouds is below freezing but the water, in a [[Supercooled water|supercooled state]], has not frozen yet due to the lack of [[ice nucleation]]. When [[ice crystals]] do form, a [[domino effect]] is set off due to the [[Bergeron process]], causing the water droplets around the crystals to evaporate: this leaves a large, often circular, hole in the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cloudappreciationsociety.org/74/|title=Cloud Appreciation Society {{!}} Fallstreak Holes (February ’06)|website=www.cloudappreciationsociety.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the introduction of large numbers of tiny ice crystals into the cloud layer sets off this domino effect of fusion which creates the hole. The ice crystals can be formed by passing aircraft, which often have a large reduction in pressure behind the wing- or propeller-tips. This cools the air very quickly, and can produce a ribbon of ice crystals trailing in the aircraft's wake. These ice crystals find themselves surrounded by droplets, and grow quickly by the Bergeron process, causing the droplets to evaporate and creating a hole with brush-like streaks of ice crystals below it. An early satellite documentation of elongated fallstreak holes over the Florida Panhandle that likely were induced by passing aircraft appeared in Corfidi and Brandli (1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corfidi|first=Stephen|author2=Brandli, Hank|title=GOES views aircraft distrails|journal=National Weather Digest|date=May 1986|volume=11|pages=37-39|url=http://nwafiles.nwas.org/digest/papers/1986/Vol11-Issue2-May1986/Pg37-Corfidi.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fallstreak holes are more routinely seen by the higher resolution satellites of today (e.g, see third ilustration accompanying this article).

[[Image:Fillet.JPG|thumb|right|275px|A fillet corner sample. Note the flat "lip".]]
In the [[picture frame|picture framing]] industry, a '''fillet''' (also referred to as a '''slip''') is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between [[mat (picture framing)|matting]], used for decorative purposes. The picture framing term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the [[fillet (mechanics)|engineering term]], which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of "fillets" in picture frames is wholly decorative. 

==Pronunciation==
''Fillet'' can be pronounced in two ways. One way is to pronounce it as if it were "fill-it", as the similar term from mechanical engineering is pronounced. The other is similar to the French-derived  [[fillet (cut)|culinary term]]. Either is acceptable in English, though most frame shops prefer one or the other pronunciation.

==Construction==
Fillets are typically made of soft or hard wood, and feature a flat "lip" which can fit underneath a [[mat (picture framing)|mat]]; the non-lip portion is what is displayed. Except for their shape and size (which is understandably small), fillets are constructed similarly to picture frames, usually from wood or polystyrene. Metal fillets are very rare. Fillets are available in a number of styles and finishes, including [[gold leaf|gold]] and [[silver leaf (art)|silver leaf]] finishes.

==Uses==
The fillet is normally used as decoration in the lining of a [[picture frame]] or underneath a mat inside one; the intent is to help draw the eye inwards to the document being framed. 

However, one can also use inverted fillets as form of picture frame on small, flat objects, as seen below:

[[Image:Filletframe.JPG|thumb|center|275px|An old greeting card, framed with an inverted fillet]]

In this case, the card was glued to the lip of the inverted fillet (which is thus hidden behind the back of the card).

Objects such as this that have been framed using inverted fillets can be backed and then affixed to wire for hanging, displayed on an [[easel]], or used inside of a larger [[picture frame|shadowbox]] display. It is important to note that only very small, extremely flat objects can be framed using only an inverted fillet, as a fillet lacks the depth of a traditional picture frame, and due to its size, weight and construction, could not support a great amount of weight on its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">The '''Forrest H. Dutlinger Natural Area''' is a [[protected area]] in [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Clinton County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States that includes a {{convert|158|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[old-growth forest]] of [[eastern hemlock]], [[American beech]], [[Prunus serotina|black cherry]], [[sugar maple]], and [[northern red oak]]. There are also [[eastern white pine]]s, but a few were selectively logged around 1900.  The largest tree is an eastern hemlock, {{convert|43|in|cm}} [[diameter at breast height]] and {{convert|112|ft|m}} tall.  

The old-growth forest once lay on the boundary of two lumber companies, the Goodyear and Lackawanna, but was apparently spared because of a dispute over a surveying error.

Forrest Dutlinger was a forester for the state of Pennsylvania from 1909 to 1959, beginning his career at a time of massive clear cutting of forests without any reforestation by the timber companies. Major fires were widespread and common due to most machinery being steam driven; the fires used to boil the water would ignite the surrounding area. Dutlinger also watched helplessly as the Asian [[chestnut blight]] killed all the American Chestnut trees in a matter of years. The chestnut was the most common hardwood tree in the forest at the time, and its magnificent lumber and nuts as a food source for wildlife have never been replaced.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''HVDC Visby–Näs''' is a bipolar [[HVDC]] electric power transmission system between [[Visby]] and a [[wind power]] centre near Näs on [[Gotland]], Sweden. The project went into service in 1999. The system operates at 80 kV with a maximum power of 50 megawatts.  This HVDC system allows for voltage regulation in the connected AC systems.

Because obtaining a right-of-way for an overhead line is a lengthy and expensive procedure, the 70 kilometer line is constructed as an underground cable. Since an [[alternating current]] three-phase underground cable would have been more expensive, the HVDC system was selected for this project.

The '''Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX)''', stylized as '''Helically Symmetric eXperiment''', is an experimental [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] confinement device at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], with design principles that are hoped to be incorporated into a [[fusion reactor]]. The HSX is a modular coil [[stellarator]] which is a [[toroid]]-shaped [[pressure vessel]] with external [[electromagnet]]s which generate a [[magnetic field]] for the purpose of containing a plasma.

== Background ==
{{main|stellarator}}
A [[stellarator]] is a [[magnetic confinement fusion]] device which generates all required magnetic fields to confine high temperature plasma by external magnetic coils. In contrast, in [[tokamaks]] and [[reversed field pinch]]es the magnetic field is created by the interaction of external magnets and an [[electrical current]] flowing through the plasma. The lack of this large externally driven plasma currents makes stellarators suitable for steady-state fusion power plant.

However, due to non-[[Axisymmetry|axisymmetric]] nature of the fields, conventional stellarators have a combination of toroidal and helical modulation of the magnetic field lines that leads to high transport of plasma out of the confinement volume at fusion relevant conditions. This large transport in conventional stellarators can limit their performance as a [[fusion reactor]]. 

This problem can be largely reduced by tailoring the magnetic field geometry. The dramatic improvements in computer modeling capability in the last two decades has helped to "optimize" the magnetic geometry to reduce this transport, resulting in a new class of stellarators called "quasi-symmetric stellarators". Computer-modeled odd-looking [[electromagnets]] will directly produce the needed magnetic field configuration. These devices combine the good confinement properties of tokamaks and the steady-state nature of conventional stellarators.  The Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is such a quasi-helically symmetric stellarator ([[Helical symmetry|helical axis of symmetry]]).

==Device==

The magnetic field in HSX is generated by a set of 48 twisted coils arranged in four field periods. HSX typically operates at a magnetic field of 1 Tesla at the center of the plasma column.  A set of auxiliary coils is used to deliberately break the symmetry to mimic conventional stellarator properties for comparison. 

HSX vacuum vessel is made of stainless steel, and is helically shaped to follow the magnetic geometry. 

Plasma formation and heating is achieved using 28&amp;nbsp;GHz, 100&amp;nbsp;kW [[electron cyclotron resonance]] heating (ECRH). A second 100&amp;nbsp;kW [[gyrotron]] has recently been installed on HSX to perform heat pulse modulation studies. 

===Operations===
Plasmas as high as 3 kilo [[electronvolt]]s in temperature and about 8x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;/cc in density are routinely formed for various experiments.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In [[vacuum tube]]s and [[gas-filled tube]]s, a '''hot cathode''' or '''thermionic cathode''' is a [[cathode]] electrode which is heated to make it emit [[electron]]s due to [[thermionic emission]].  This is in contrast to a [[cold cathode]], which does not have a heating element.  The heating element is usually an [[electrical filament]] heated by a separate [[electric current]] passing through it.  Hot cathodes typically achieve much higher power density than cold cathodes, emitting significantly more electrons from the same surface area. [[Cold cathode]]s rely on [[field electron emission]] or [[secondary electron]] emission from positive ion bombardment, and do not require heating.  There are two types of hot cathode.  In a ''directly heated cathode'', the filament is the cathode and emits the electrons.  In an ''indirectly heated cathode'', the filament or ''heater'' heats a separate metal cathode electrode which emits the electrons.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, a wide variety of electronic devices used hot-cathode vacuum tubes. Today, hot cathodes are used as the source of electrons in [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s, and the [[electron gun]]s used in [[cathode ray tube]]s and laboratory equipment such as [[electron microscope]]s.

A [[cathode]] electrode in a vacuum tube or other vacuum system is a metal surface which emits [[electron]]s into the evacuated space of the tube.  Since the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positive [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the metal atoms, they normally stay inside the metal and require energy to leave it.&lt;ref name="Avadhanulu"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cathode is heated to a temperature that causes electrons to be 'boiled off' of its surface into the evacuated space in the tube, a process called ''[[thermionic emission]]''.&lt;ref name="Avadhanulu" /&gt;

There are two types of hot cathodes:&lt;ref name="Avadhanulu" /&gt;
;Directly heated cathode: In this type, the filament itself is the cathode and emits the electrons directly.  Directly heated cathodes were used in the first vacuum tubes.  Today, they are used in [[fluorescent tube]]s and most high-power transmitting vacuum tubes.
;Indirectly heated cathode: In this type, the filament is not the cathode but rather heats a separate cathode consisting of a sheet metal cylinder surrounding the filament, and the cylinder emits electrons.  Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most low power vacuum tubes.  For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube, coated with metal oxides. It is heated by a tungsten filament inside it, and the heat from the filament causes the outside surface of the oxide coating to emit electrons.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt;   The filament of an indirectly heated cathode is usually called the ''heater''.

The main reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament, allowing vacuum tubes to use [[alternating current]] to heat the filament.  In a tube in which the filament itself is the cathode, the alternating [[electric field]] from the filament surface would affect the movement of the electrons and introduce hum into the tube output.  It also allows the filaments in all the tubes in an electronic device to be tied together and supplied from the same current source, even though the cathodes they heat may be at different potentials.

[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|Glow of a directly heated cathode in an Eimac 4-1000A 1 kW power [[tetrode]] tube in a [[radio transmitter]].  Directly heated cathodes operate at higher temperatures and produce a brighter glow.  The cathode is behind the other tube elements and not directly visible. ]]

To improve electron emission, cathodes are usually treated with chemicals, compounds of metals with a low [[work function]].  These form a metal layer on the surface which emits more electrons.  Treated cathodes require less surface area, lower temperatures and less power to supply the same cathode current.  The untreated thoriated tungsten filaments used in early vacuum tubes (called "bright emitters") had to be heated to 2500&amp;nbsp;°F (1400&amp;nbsp;°C), white-hot, to produce sufficient thermionic emission for use, while modern coated cathodes produce far more electrons at a given temperature, so they only have to be heated to 800–1100&amp;nbsp;°F (425–600&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="Avadhanulu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;

==Types==

===Oxide-coated cathodes===
The most common type of indirectly heated cathode is the oxide-coated cathode, in which the nickel cathode surface has a coating of [[alkaline earth metal]] oxide to increase emission.  One of the earliest materials used for this was [[barium oxide]]; it forms a monatomic layer of [[barium]] with an extremely low work function. More modern formulations utilize a mixture of barium oxide, [[strontium oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]. Another standard formulation is barium oxide, calcium oxide, and [[aluminium oxide]] in a 5:3:2 ratio. [[Thorium oxide]] is used as well. Oxide-coated cathodes operate at about 800-1000&amp;nbsp;°C, orange-hot. They are used in most small glass vacuum tubes, but are rarely used in high-power tubes because the coating is degraded by positive ions that bombard the cathode, accelerated by the high voltage on the tube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Documents/M8G%20MA%20Electrodes.htm MA Electrode Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

For manufacturing convenience, the oxide-coated cathodes are usually coated with [[carbonate]]s, which are then converted to oxides by heating. The activation may be achieved by [[microwave heating]], direct electric current heating, or electron bombardment while the tube is on the exhausting machine, until the production of gases ceases. The purity of cathode materials is crucial for tube lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transfixr.com/strafe_tube.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205200639/http://www.transfixr.com/strafe_tube.htm |archivedate=2006-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba content significantly increases on the surface layers of oxide cathodes down to several tens of nanometers in depth, after the cathode activation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Barium oxide reacts with traces of silicon in the underlying metal, forming barium silicate (Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) layer. This layer has high electrical resistance, especially under discontinuous current load, and acts as a resistor in series with the cathode. This is particularly undesirable for tubes used in computer applications, where they can stay without conducting current for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="RCA"&gt;Electron Tube Design, Radio Corporation of America, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium also sublimates from the heated cathode, and deposits on nearby structures. For electron tubes, where the grid is subjected to high temperatures and barium contamination would facilitate electron emission from the grid itself, higher proportion of calcium is added to the coating mix (up to 20% of calcium carbonate).&lt;ref name="RCA"/&gt;

===Boride cathodes===
[[File:LaB6HotCathode.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Lanthanum hexaboride hot cathode]]
[[File:Lab6cathodes.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Lanthanum hexaboride hot cathodes]]
[[Lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cerium hexaboride]] (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are used as the coating of some high-current cathodes. Hexaborides show low work function, around 2.5 [[electronvolt|eV]]. They are also resistant to poisoning. Cerium boride cathodes show lower evaporation rate at 1700 [[Kelvin|K]] than lanthanum boride, but it becomes equal at 1850 K and higher. Cerium boride cathodes have one and a half times the lifetime of lanthanum boride, due to its higher resistance to carbon contamination. Boride cathodes are about ten times as "bright" as the tungsten ones and have 10-15 times longer lifetime. They are used e.g. in [[electron microscope]]s, [[microwave tube]]s, [[electron lithography]], [[electron beam welding]], [[X-Ray tube]]s, and [[free electron laser]]s. However these materials tend to be expensive.

Other hexaborides can be employed as well; examples are [[calcium hexaboride]], [[strontium hexaboride]], [[barium hexaboride]], [[yttrium hexaboride]], [[gadolinium hexaboride]], [[samarium hexaboride]], and [[thorium hexaboride]].

===Thoriated filaments===
A common type of directly heated cathode, used in most high power transmitting tubes, is the [[thoriated tungsten]] filament, discovered in 1914 and made practical by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Turner page 7-37&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of [[thorium]] is added to the tungsten of the filament. The filament is heated white-hot, at about 2400&amp;nbsp;°C, and thorium atoms migrate to the surface of the filament and form the emissive layer. Heating the filament in a hydrocarbon atmosphere carburizes the surface and stabilizes the emissive layer.  Thoriated filaments can have very long lifetimes and are resistant to the ion bombardment that occurs at high voltages, because fresh thorium continually diffuses to the surface, renewing the layer. They are used in nearly all high-power vacuum tubes for radio transmitters, and in some tubes for [[hi-fi]] amplifiers. Their lifetimes tend to be longer than those of oxide cathodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userweb.suscom.net/~mos/knowledgebase/tp2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408173003/http://userweb.suscom.net/~mos/knowledgebase/tp2.htm |archivedate=2006-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thorium alternatives====
Due to concerns about thorium radioactivity and toxicity, efforts have been made to find alternatives. One of them is zirconiated tungsten, where [[zirconium dioxide]] is used instead of thorium dioxide. Other replacement materials are [[lanthanum(III) oxide]], [[yttrium(III) oxide]], [[cerium(IV) oxide]], and their mixtures.&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5911919.html Electron emission materials and components: United States Patent 5911919]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other materials===
In addition to the listed oxides and borides, other materials can be used as well. Some examples are [[carbide]]s and [[boride]]s of [[transition metal]]s, e.g. [[zirconium carbide]], [[hafnium carbide]], [[tantalum carbide]], [[hafnium diboride]], and their mixtures. Metals from [[group (periodic table)|groups]] [[group 3 element|IIIB]] ([[scandium]], [[yttrium]], and some [[lanthanide]]s, often [[gadolinium]] and [[samarium]]) and [[group 4 element|IVB]] ([[hafnium]], [[zirconium]], [[titanium]]) are usually chosen.&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"/&gt;

In addition to tungsten, other [[refractory metal]]s and alloys can be used, e.g. [[tantalum]], [[molybdenum]] and [[rhenium]] and their alloys.

A [[barrier layer]] of other material can be placed between the base metal and the emission layer, to inhibit chemical reaction between these. The material has to be resistant to high temperatures, have high melting point and very low vapor pressure, and be electrically conductive. Materials used can be e.g. [[tantalum diboride]], [[titanium diboride]], [[zirconium diboride]], [[niobium diboride]], [[tantalum carbide]], [[zirconium carbide]], [[tantalum nitride]], and [[zirconium nitride]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4137476.html Thermionic cathode: United States Patent 4137476]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathode heater==
A ''cathode heater'' is a heated wire filament used to heat the [[cathode]] in a [[vacuum tube]] or [[cathode ray tube]]. The cathode element has to achieve the required temperature in order for these tubes to function properly. This is why older electronics often needs some time to "warm up" after being powered on; this phenomenon can still be observed in the cathode ray tubes of some modern televisions and [[computer monitor]]s. The cathode heats to a temperature that causes [[electron]]s to be 'boiled out' of its surface into the evacuated space in the tube, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The temperature required for modern oxide-coated cathodes is around {{convert|800|-|1000|C|F}}.

The cathode is usually in the form of a long narrow sheet metal cylinder at the center of the tube. The heater consists of a fine wire or ribbon, made of a high [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] metal alloy like [[nichrome]], similar to the [[heating element]] in a [[toaster]] but finer. It runs through the center of the cathode, often being coiled on tiny insulating supports or bent into hairpin-like shapes to give enough surface area to produce the required heat. Typical heaters have a ceramic coating on the wire. When it's bent sharply at the ends of the cathode sleeve, the wire is exposed.
The ends of the wire are electrically connected to two of the several pins protruding from the end of the tube. When [[Electric current|current]] passes through the wire it becomes red hot, and the radiated heat strikes the inside surface of the cathode, heating it. The red or orange glow seen coming from operating vacuum tubes is produced by the heater.

There is not much room in the cathode, and the cathode is often built with the heater wire touching it. The inside of the cathode is insulated by a coating of [[alumina]] (aluminum oxide). This is not a very good insulator at high temperatures, therefore tubes have a rating for maximum voltage between cathode and heater, usually only 200 to 300 V.

Heaters require a low voltage, high current source of power. Miniature receiving tubes for line-operated equipment use on the order of 0.5 to 4 watts for heater power; high power tubes such as rectifiers or output tubes use on the order of 10 to 20 watts, and broadcast transmitter tubes might need a kilowatt or more to heat the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Sōgo Okamura ''History of electron tubes'', IOS Press, 1994 {{ISBN|90-5199-145-2}}, pp. 106, 109, 120, 144, 174&lt;/ref&gt; 
The voltage required is usually 5 or 6 volts [[Alternating current|AC]]. This is supplied by a separate 'heater winding' on the device's power supply [[transformer]] that also supplies the higher voltages required by the tubes' plates and other electrodes.  One approach used in transformerless line-operated radio and television receivers such as the [[All American Five]] is to connect all the tube heaters in series across the supply line. Since all the heaters are rated at the same current, they would share voltage according to their heater ratings.

Battery-operated radio sets used direct-current power for the heaters (commonly known as filaments), and tubes intended for [[Battery (vacuum tube)|battery]] sets were designed to use as little filament power as necessary, to economize on battery replacement. The final models of tube-equipped radio receivers were built with subminiature tubes using less than 50 mA for the heaters, but these types were developed at about the same time as transistors which replaced them.

Where leakage or stray fields from the heater circuit could potentially be coupled to the cathode, direct current is sometimes used for heater power. This eliminates a source of noise in sensitive audio or instrumentation circuits.

The majority of power required to operate low power tube equipment is consumed by the heaters. Transistors have no such power requirement, which is often a great advantage.

==Failure modes==
The emissive layers on coated cathodes degrade slowly with time, and much more quickly when the cathode is overloaded with too high current. The result is weakened emission and diminished power of the tubes, or in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] diminished brightness.

The activated electrodes can be destroyed by contact with [[oxygen]] or other chemicals (e.g. [[aluminium]], or [[silicate]]s), either present as residual gases, entering the tube via leaks, or released by [[outgassing]] or migration from the construction elements.   This results in diminished emissivity. This process is known as ''cathode poisoning''. High-reliability tubes had to be developed for the early [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computer, with filaments free of traces of [[silicon]].

Slow degradation of the emissive layer and sudden burning and interruption of the filament are two main [[failure mode]]s of vacuum tubes.

{{Wildlife of India}}
'''India Nature Watch''', usually referred to as '''INW''', is a [[nonprofit|non-commercial]] [[community website]] that focuses on sharing [[photograph]]s of [[Wildlife of India|Indian wildlife]].&lt;ref name='hindu-1'&gt;http://www.hindu.com/mp/2011/05/19/stories/2011051951310200.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The site was started in 2005 by [[Sudhir Shivaram]], [[Kalyan Varma]], [http://www.yathin.com/ Yathin S K] and [http://www.indiabirds.com/ Vijay Cavale].&lt;ref name='inw-about'&gt;http://www.indianaturewatch.net/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

INW allows uploads into eight categories: ''Birds, Mammals, Reptiles &amp; Amphibians, Butterflies &amp; Moths, Landscape, Insects &amp; Other Invertebrate, Flora and Others''&lt;ref name='inw-home'&gt;http://www.indianaturewatch.net&lt;/ref&gt; and currently hosts close to 400,000 photographs of Indian wildlife. The copyright of images hosted on the site remains with the photographer, although the site does encourage photographers to release photographs under more liberal licenses like [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref name='inw-terms'&gt;http://www.indianaturewatch.net/terms.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was started by the moderators of a popular mailing list called ''india-nature-pixs'' when [[Yahoo Inc.|Yahoo]] stopped storing of attachments on its groups service.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The aim of the site is to help document and share India's rich but threatened wildlife through the means of photography, with the help of a community of wildlife photographers in India. Photographs posted on the site have uncovered new ranges for species and documentation of rare wildlife,&lt;ref name='hindu-2'&gt;http://www.hindu.com/2011/01/12/stories/2011011252300600.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='express-1'&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/story_mobile.php?storyid=907397&lt;/ref&gt; though the website has come under fire for being emblematic of an Indian wildlife photography culture that has failed to support conservation efforts in any meaningful way.&lt;ref name='Conservation India'&gt;http://www.conservationindia.org/resources/beyond-the-pretty-picture&lt;/ref&gt;

INW also maintains a strong neutral and non-conflict culture and discourages posting of controversial photographs. It is believed to be the most popular site in India for wildlife photographs.&lt;ref name="Conservation India"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2001">[[File:Protective relay.jpg|thumb|Protective relay is an example of an Intelligent Electronic Device]]

An '''Intelligent Electronic Device''' ('''IED''') is a term used in the electric power industry to describe [[microprocessor]]-based controllers of power system equipment, such as [[circuit breaker]]s, [[transformer]]s and [[capacitor]] banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subnet.com/resources/dictionary/intelligent-electronic-device.aspx |title=Intelligent Electronic Device : Definition |publisher=Subnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2016}}
IEDs receive data from [[sensors]] and power equipment and can issue control commands, such as tripping circuit breakers if they sense [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], or [[frequency]] anomalies, or raise/lower voltage levels in order to maintain the desired level. Common types of IEDs include protective relaying devices, [[Tap changer#On-load designs (OLTC)|On Load Tap Changer]] controllers, circuit breaker controllers, capacitor bank switches, recloser controllers, voltage regulators etc. This is generally controlled by a setting file. The testing of setting files is typically one of the most time consuming roles of a protection tester.

[[Digital protective relay]]s are primarily IEDs, using a microprocessor to perform several protective, control and similar functions.  A typical IED can contain around 5-12 protection functions, 5-8 control functions controlling separate devices, an autoreclose function, self monitoring function, communication functions etc. Hence, they are aptly named as Intelligent Electronic Devices.

Some recent IEDs are designed to support the [[IEC61850]] standard for [[electrical substation|substation]] automation, which provides interoperability and advanced communications capabilities.

An '''iodide''' [[ion]] is the ion I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds with [[iodine]] in formal [[oxidation state]] −1 are called '''iodides'''. This page is for the iodide ion and its salts, not [[organoiodine compound]]s. In everyday life, iodide is most commonly encountered as a component of [[iodized salt]], which many governments mandate. Worldwide, [[iodine deficiency]] affects two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of [[intellectual disability]].&lt;ref name="mcneil"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html?fta=y|title=In Raising the World’s I.Q., the Secret’s in the Salt|last=McNeil|first=Donald G. Jr|date=2006-12-16|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and characteristics of inorganic iodides==
Iodide is one of the largest monatomic [[anion]]s. It is assigned a radius of around 206 [[picometer]]s. For comparison, the lighter halides are considerably smaller: [[bromide]] (196&amp;nbsp;pm), [[chloride]] (181&amp;nbsp;pm), and fluoride (133&amp;nbsp;pm). In part because of its size, iodide forms relatively weak bonds with most elements.

Most iodide salts are soluble in water, but often less so than the related chlorides and bromides. Iodide, being large, is less hydrophilic compared to the smaller anions. One consequence of this is that sodium iodide is highly soluble in acetone, whereas sodium chloride is not. The low solubility of [[silver iodide]] and [[lead iodide]] reflects the covalent character of these metal iodides. A test for the presence of iodide ions is the formation of yellow precipitates of these compounds upon treatment of a solution of [[silver nitrate]] or [[lead(II) nitrate]].&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

Aqueous solutions of iodide salts dissolve iodine better than pure water. This effect is due to the formation of the [[triiodide]] ion, which is brown:
:I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ {{chem|I|3|−}}

===Redox, including antioxidant properties===
Iodide salts are mild [[reducing agent]]s and many react with oxygen to give iodine. A reducing agent is a chemical term for an antioxidant. Its antioxidant properties can be expressed quantitatively as a [[redox potential]] :

:I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[Electron|e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{spaces|5}} ''E''° = −0.54&amp;nbsp;volts (versus [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]])

Because iodide is easily oxidized, some enzymes readily convert it into [[electrophilic]] iodinating agents, as required for the [[biosynthesis]] of myriad iodide-containing [[natural product]]s. Iodide can function as an antioxidant [[redox|reducing]] species that can destroy [[reactive oxygen species]] such as [[hydrogen peroxide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Küpper FC |title=Iodide accumulation provides kelp with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=19 |pages=6954–8 |year=2008|pmid=18458346 |pmc=2383960 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0709959105|format=Free full text |author2=Carpenter LJ|authorlink2=Lucy Carpenter |author3=McFiggans GB |display-authors=3 |last4=Palmer |first4=C.

==Natural occurrence==
Iodargyrite - natural, crystalline silver iodide - is the most common iodide mineral currently known. Iodide anions may sometimes also be found combined with mercury, copper and lead, but minerals with such compositions are even more scarce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other oxyanions==
[[Iodine]] can assume [[oxidation state]]s of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. A number of neutral [[iodine oxide]]s are also known.

The '''Cape Verde''' or '''Cape Verdes basslet''' (''Liopropoma emanueli'') is a species of [[grouper|basslet]] [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Atlantic]] waters around [[Cape Verde]], western [[Africa]] where it is found at depths of about {{convert|20|m|ft}} and in rocky areas.  Its length is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species |genus= Liopropoma|species= emanueli| month = June | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of grouper, the basslet was first founded in the Danger diving site southwest of [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]] in the [[Santiago, Cape Verde|island of Santiago]] at 15°15'51.22" N and23°45'35.41" W, below overhanging large boulder, 20 m in depth.&lt;ref name="Wirtz &amp; Schliewen"&gt;Wirtz, P. &amp; Schliewen, U.

''Spixiana'', 35 (1): 149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was named and described by [[Peter Wirtz]] and [[Ulrich K. Schliewen]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Wirtz &amp; Schliewen"/&gt; They are founded in the north of Santiago and likely the southern part.

The species is named  in honour of Emanuel d’Oliveira, whose knowledge of the marine fauna of Santiago Island has been a great help to the first author during many dives.&lt;ref name="Wirtz &amp; Schliewen"/&gt;

The '''March 2017 North American blizzard''' was a major late-season [[blizzard]] that affected the [[Northeastern United States]], [[New England]] and [[Canada]], dumping up to {{convert|3|ft|in cm}} of [[snow]] in the hardest hit areas, mainly [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and Southern [[Quebec]]. Forming out of an [[extratropical cyclone]] near the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], the storm system dived into the northern portions of the United States, dropping light to moderate snow across the [[Great Lakes]], [[Upper Midwest]] on March 11–12 before reaching the [[Ohio Valley]] the next day. It later coalesced into a powerful [[nor'easter]] off the East Coast, producing a swath of heavy snowfall across a large portion of the Northeast. The storm was given various unofficial names, such as ''Winter Storm Stella'', ''Blizzard Eugene'', and ''Blizzard of 2017''.

Ahead of the storm, residents prepared in advance for the major nor'easter, with [[blizzard warning]]s issued for several states, including [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Massachusetts]]. Several officials had crews with salt trucks ready to deploy to clear roads. The system also disrupted travel across the country, with numerous flight cancellations at most of the major airports in the Northeast. It dropped a swath of moderate snow accumulation as it moved across the northern tier of the country, with as much as {{convert|13|in|cm}} reported. The storm was also responsible for ending a record streak without snowfall in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where no snow had occurred since December 25, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/news/news/chicago-no-snow-january-february-2017|title=Winter Storm Stella Ends Chicago's Record-Long Stretch Without Snow Cover|work=weather.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, an [[extratropical cyclone]] formed in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]. On March 11, it began to affect parts of the [[Northwestern United States]] as well as [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/11/2017&amp;selmap=2017031112&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 12:00 UTC on 3/11/2017|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually moved ashore later that day and transferred its energy to a new surface low, which began to move southeastwards into the United States as an [[Alberta clipper]]. The system moved swiftly across the [[Upper Midwest]] throughout the day of March 12, dropping a swath of accumulating snow of {{convert|3–6|in|cm}} as [[frontogenesis]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/11/2017&amp;selmap=2017031215&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 15:00 UTC on 3/12/2017|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13 at 15:00&amp;nbsp;UTC, the [[Weather Prediction Center]] began issuing storm summaries while the system was located west-northwest of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_1.html|title=Storm Summary Number 01 for Upper Midwest to Northeast Winter Storm|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the day, a weak secondary area of low pressure formed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and drifted northeastwards, while not expected to fuse with the other low to its north, it helped inject moisture from the ocean over the state of [[Florida]], which gradually began to merge with the outermost fringes of the northerly system that had now moved into the [[Ohio Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/12/2017&amp;selmap=2017031318&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 15:00 UTC on 3/13/2017|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_2.html|title=Storm Summary Number 02 for Upper Midwest to Northeast Winter Storm|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 21:00&amp;nbsp;UTC that night, a new surface low developed off the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] coastline with a central pressure of {{convert|1010|mbar|inHg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/12/2017&amp;selmap=2017031321&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 21:00 UTC on 3/13/2017|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually becoming the dominant low of the nor'easter. The storm began to [[explosive cyclogenesis|rapidly deepen]] as it moved parallel to the [[East Coast of the United States]], with the central pressure dropping to {{convert|986|mbar|inHg}} by 15:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 14 while it was just off the [[Maryland]] coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/12/2017&amp;selmap=2017031415&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 15:00 UTC on 3/14/2017|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm continued to intensify as it drifted northeastwards towards [[Long Island]], continuing to produce an expansive area of snow with heavier rates embedded in snowbands across [[Connecticut]], northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and most of interior [[New England]], as well as parts of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_6.html|title=Storm Summary Number 06 for Upper Midwest to Northeast Winter Storm|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low subsequently reached its peak intensity of {{convert|974|mbar|inHg}} while just inland over Long Island. By 20:00&amp;nbsp;UTC, most of the snow had come to an end in [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], and [[Washington D.C.]], as the low began to move inland over New England; subsequently it also began to weaken as it traveled further inland, and by early on March 15, snow began to end in more parts of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_8.html|title=Storm Summary Number 08 for Upper Midwest to Northeast Winter Storm|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system continued to weaken as it moved slowly through upper [[New England]], the system continued to weaken, consequently, the Weather Prediction Center terminated storm summaries on the winter storm as nearly most of the moderate to heavy snow had stopped in the region and switched to rain. On March 18, the low that was formerly the blizzard had moved out to sea and dissipated.

===Forecasting controversy===
Predictions of the storm were criticized by some due to overestimation of the predicted snowfall totals in the major metropolitan areas including [[New York City]], with ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' calling it "the blizzard that WASN'T".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-stella-northeast-bust-march-2017|title=Winter Storm Stella Wasn't Really a Forecast Bust – Except Along I-95|work=weather.com|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4311374/Storm-Stella-causes-states-emergency-claims-two-lives.html|title=Storm Stella causes states of emergency, claims two lives|work=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] stated that the storm was not as bad as previously anticipated, due to the change over to a mix of snow and [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], but advised residents to not let their guard down, as the storm was still predicted to cause high wind gusts and coastal flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kwbe.com/abc_national/severe-winter-storm-bears-down-on-northeast-abcid35877771/|title=Severe winter storm bears down on Northeast|work=Beatrice News Channel|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction in snowfall totals was due to a shift in the storm's track to the west more towards the [[New Jersey]] coastline, which resulted in more mixed precipitation rather than snow. Initially, the [[National Weather Service]] predicted that the blizzard would leave New York City with up to {{convert|12–24|in|cm}} (rivaling it almost with the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]), however these totals were later reduced due to the change in the system's track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/business/article138359753.html|title=The Latest: Tidal flooding in New Jersey as nor'easter hits|work=kansas|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/Tracking_the_2017_NYC_blizzard_updates_advisories_and_photos_from_the_March_snowstorm|title=Tracking the 2017 NYC blizzard: updates, advisories and photos from the March snowstorm|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the metro area faced a similar situation [[January 2015 North American blizzard#Forecasting controversy|a little over two years prior]] where New York City was predicted to receive up to {{convert|2–3|ft|in}} of snow, but only received less than half of the predicted amount due to a shift in the storm's track by {{convert|50–100|mi|km}}.

Meteorologists at the National Weather Service were aware of the changing conditions that led to lesser snow accumulations along the coast the night prior to the expected event. In a multi-office conference, however, forecasters decided to maintain the higher-than-likely snowfall predictions "out of extreme caution." They sought to avoid sending mixed and/or incorrect messages about a dangerous storm by maintaining a steady forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seth Borenstein |publisher=Associated Press |date=March 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 14, 2017 |title=Weather Service decided last minute not to cut snow forecast |url=https://apnews.com/8e8516da51234851b2fa50ee71d6636a/Weather-Service-decided-last-minute-not-to-cut-snow-forecast |archivedate=March 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6oy7OqVjw?url=https://apnews.com/8e8516da51234851b2fa50ee71d6636a/Weather-Service-decided-last-minute-not-to-cut-snow-forecast |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quebec and Ontario ====
The snow began hitting [[Ontario]] and Quebec on March 13 around noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-storm-warning-heavy-snow-zero-visibility|title=Chaos on Quebec roads as winter storm blows in|date=2017-03-15|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cp24.com/weather/winter-storm-hits-southern-ontario-messy-commute-expected-tuesday-1.3322212|title=Winter storm hits southern Ontario; messy commute expected Tuesday|last=Freeman|first=Codi Wilson and Joshua|work=CP24|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly intensified in the afternoon over portions of Southern Quebec and the [[Eastern Townships]] before becoming a powerful blizzard over [[Montreal]] and its [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]], as heavy snow bands came from the South-East and did a wrap-around effect just on the South Shore of Montreal, where the snow fell at a rate of more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm/hr (3 in/hr) for more than 6 hours between 6PM and midnight.&lt;ref name="BLZCAN"&gt;[https://www.meteomedia.com/nouvelles/articles/tempete-hivernale--le-quebec-sur-un-pied-dalerte/80271 More than 75 cm in Some Areas - Weather Network (french ''Météo Media'') '''(fr)''']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environment Canada]] reported that a blizzard officially occurred in Montreal and Quebec City.&lt;ref name="BLZCAN" /&gt; The storm continued to track Northeast and affected [[Quebec City]] and Eastern Quebec where blizzard conditions were also occurring in the night. At the end of the blizzard, 18&amp;nbsp;cm (7&amp;nbsp;in) were recorded in [[Ottawa]], 40&amp;nbsp;cm (16&amp;nbsp;in) in Montreal, 35&amp;nbsp;cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) in Quebec City, 55&amp;nbsp;cm (22&amp;nbsp;in) in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec|Sherbrooke]], 70&amp;nbsp;cm (28&amp;nbsp;in) in [[Drummondville]], and more than 75&amp;nbsp;cm (30&amp;nbsp;in) in several locations such as [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]], [[Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec|Vaudreuil-Dorion]] and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]].&lt;ref name="BLZCAN" /&gt;

Winds from the Northeast increased in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] between Montreal and Quebec City in the evening, producing the blizzard. Wind gusts reached 107&amp;nbsp;km/h (66&amp;nbsp;mph) at [[YUL|Montreal Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport]], 113&amp;nbsp;km/h (70&amp;nbsp;mph) at [[YHU|Saint-Hubert Airport]] on the South Shore and 140&amp;nbsp;km/h (87&amp;nbsp;mph) at [[YQB|Quebec International Airport]].&lt;ref name="BLZCAN" /&gt; Numerous road [[pileup]]s occurred, most notably on [[Ontario Highway 401]] near [[Mallorytown, Ontario|Mallorytown]], on [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Quebec highway 20]] near [[Saint-Zotique, Quebec|Saint-Zotique]] (which caused a major fire, destroying several semis and killing one of their drivers), on [[Quebec Autoroute 10|highway 10]] near [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]], on [[Quebec Autoroute 40|highway 40]] near [[Lavaltrie, Quebec|Lavaltrie]] and on Highway 20 near [[Sainte-Hélène-de-Bagot, Quebec|Sainte-Hélène de Bagot]].&lt;ref name="BLZCAN" /&gt; Road closures included [[Quebec Autoroute 15|highway 15]] near the USA border, highway 10 near Magog, highway 20 in Saint-Zotique and [[Saint-Eugène, Quebec|Saint-Eugène]], and most notably on [[Quebec Autoroute 13|highway 13]] on Montreal Island, where several hundreds of cars and trucks were left trapped for more than 14 hours due to communication and logistic issues complicating the evacuation.&lt;ref name="BLZCAN" /&gt;

In [[Quebec]], many areas were left without power for more than 24 hours.  In [[Quebec city]], the [[Saint-Lawrence river]] stepped out of its riverbed, flooding both areas of Quebec City and [[Lévis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=March 15, 2017 |title=Le fleuve déborde dans la région de Québec|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1022400/fleuve-saint-laurent-debordement-tempete-quebec |publisher=ICI Radio-Canada |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people were killed during the storm itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duchaine |first=Gabrielle  |last2=Teisceira-Lessard |first2=Philippe  |title=Tempête: cinq morts, perturbations majeures dans les transports|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201703/15/01-5078854-tempete-cinq-morts-perturbations-majeures-dans-les-transports.php |date= March 15, 2017|work=La Presse |accessdate=March 17, 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two more (both elderly males) were found dead in Montreal in parked cars over the following days, presumably killed by heart attacks while attempting to clear them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perron |first=Lousi-Samuel |title=Tempête: un autre homme trouvé mort dans une voiture à Montréal|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/justice-et-affaires-criminelles/faits-divers/201703/16/01-5079395-tempete-un-autre-homme-trouve-mort-dans-une-voiture-a-montreal.php |date=March 16, 2017 |work=La Presse |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

The practice of winter storm naming remains controversial in the United States.

* [[January 2015 North American blizzard]] – similar storm that had origins from an Alberta clipper, and was criticized for less snowfall totals in [[New York City]] as well when forecasts predicted much more

The oil spill was caused by a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] on March 2, 1992 at the Mingbulak oil field in the [[Fergana Valley]], [[Uzbekistan]] at [[Oil well|well]] #5.

'''Moisture sensitivity level''' relates to the packaging and handling precautions for some semiconductors. The MSL is an [[Electronics|electronic]] standard for the time period in which a moisture sensitive device can be exposed to ambient room conditions (30&amp;nbsp;°C/85%RH at Level 1; 30&amp;nbsp;°C/60%RH at all other levels).

Increasingly, [[semiconductors]] have been manufactured in smaller sizes. Components such as thin fine-pitch devices and [[ball grid array]]s could be damaged during [[Surface-mount technology|SMT]] reflow when moisture trapped inside the component expands.

The expansion of trapped moisture can result in internal separation ([[delamination]]) of the plastic from the die or lead-frame, wire bond damage, die damage, and internal cracks. Most of this damage is not visible on the component surface. In extreme cases, cracks will extend to the component surface. In the most severe cases, the component will bulge and pop. This is known as the "popcorn" effect.

[[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] (Association Connecting Electronic Industries) created and released IPC-M-109, Moisture-sensitive Component Standards and Guideline Manual (''not active'').

Moisture sensitive devices are packaged in a moisture barrier [[antistatic bag]] with a [[desiccant]] and a moisture indicator card which is sealed.

IPC-M-109 includes seven documents. According to [http://www.jedec.org/sites/default/files/docs/jstd020d-01.pdf]: Moisture/reflow sensitivity classification for plastic
Integrated circuit (IC) SMDs, there are eight levels of moisture sensitivity. Components must be mounted and reflowed within the allowable period of time (floor life out of the bag).

Development of the Titan began in September 1999, with design work under Diane Allen. Giovanny Arroba's TA60 exterior was chosen in late 2000, with a final production freeze in July 2001. The design language of the future truck was previewed by the 2001 Alpha T concept shown at the 2001 [[Detroit Auto Show]], which had previously developed through November 2000. 

Production began on September 21, 2003 and sales on December 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/15/business/fi-nissan15 |title=Along for the Ride |date=June 15, 2003 |first=John |last=O'Dell |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.just-auto.com/analysis/infiniti-goes-big_id86183.aspx |title=Infiniti Goes Big |date=March 23, 2004 |work=Just Auto |accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Titan used Nissan's new full-size [[Nissan F-Alpha platform|F-Alpha platform]]. This new platform was shared with the [[Nissan Armada]] and [[Infiniti QX56]] [[SUV]]s, with all three manufactured in [[Canton, Mississippi]], [[United States]]. The first generation Titan continued without a major redesign through 2015.

===Specifications===

====Models and equipment====
All models came standard with a 32-valve, 5.6-liter engine, VK56DE, which generates {{Convert|317|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}  on 2004–2006 models) and {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The first generation Titan came equipped with a fully boxed ladder frame and was available in either rear-wheel drive or a shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system coupled with a five-speed RE505A automatic transmission. An automatic brake-limited slip (ABLS) system was available on all Titans. The first generation was available as a King Cab (extended cab) or a crew cab with a full-sized back seat, with no regular cab being offered. The King Cab featured a {{convert|6|ft|7|in|adj=on}} bed, while the crew cab had a {{convert|5|ft|7|in|adj=on}} bed. In 2008, a longer wheelbase model was offered with either an {{convert|8|ft|3|in|adj=on}} bed on the King Cab or a {{convert|7|ft|3|in|adj=on}} bed on the crew cab. There were originally four trim levels available: the S, SV, Pro-4x, SE, and LE. The SE and LE trim was eventually replaced by the luxury SL trim. The S was the base model, the SV a mid-level model with more features, the PRO-4X was the off-road-oriented version, and the top level SL was offered with features like 20-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment.

====Features====

The second-generation Titan was to be a lightly reskinned, rebadged version of the Dodge Ram, but those plans fell through with the 2008 worldwide financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://jalopnik.com/379676/chrysler-to-produce-full-size-trucks-for-nissan-what-the-truck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caranddriver.com/news/next-gen-nissan-titan-to-get-most-dodge-ram-attributes-car-news&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/02/nissan-and-chrysler-halt-rambased-titan-effort.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissan unveiled the second generation Titan at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashgear.com/nissan-unveils-new-titan-xd-truck-in-detroit-with-cummins-diesel-option-13364175/ |title=Nissan unveils new Titan XD truck in Detroit with V8 Cummins diesel option |work=SlashGear |author=McGlaun, Shane |date=January 13, 2015 |accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation Titan was designed in California, engineered in Michigan, tested in Arizona, and is assembled in Mississippi. The V8 Cummins is built in Indiana and Tennessee. 

[[Cummins]] has partnered with Nissan and has announced that the next generation Titan will offer a {{convert|310|hp|adj=on}} Cummins 5.0-liter turbo diesel V8 (after plans with Dodge fell through) that produces almost {{convert|555|lbft}} of torque. The engine is referred to as the ISV. The engine will be built in [[Columbus, Indiana]], and have a different version of the engine for commercial trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cumminsengines.com/cummins-5L-V8-turbo-diesel|title=Cummins 5.0 Turbo V8|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5.6-liter gasoline engine will remain standard. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nissanusa.com/trucks/titan/versions-specs?tool=model.top_nav.section.link&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the gasoline engine has increased in power compared to the previous model, producing {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|394|lbft|Nm|0}} of torque mated to a 7-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

The 2nd-generation Titan is available in two forms, regular and XD, with the XD having been released for sale first. The XD version is built on a heavy-duty frame based on Nissan's commercial vehicle line and includes the Cummins diesel engine as an option. The platform is shared with the [[Nissan NV (North America)|Nissan NV]].

An '''offset well''' is an existing [[wellbore]] that may be used as a guide for planning a well. Many offsets could be referred to in the planning of a well, to identify subsurface geology and pressures. Offset well data may be combined with seismic data and prior experience. Where offset data is lacking, well planners will be more conservative, allowing for a greater range of contingencies and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/o/offset_well.aspx| title=Schumberger Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High quality offset well data is highly sought after by planners for optimizing their designs, and is also used retrospectively to benchmark performance. Offset data from competing companies is particularly coveted but very hard to obtain due to a profound reluctance by oil and gas operators to share their offset data with competitors.

As well planning becomes more complex, regulated and expensive, access to offset well data becomes increasingly important for well planning and benchmarking.

'''PAMELA''' ('''Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics''') was a [[cosmic ray]] research module attached to an Earth orbiting satellite. ''PAMELA'' was launched on 15 June 2006 and was the first [[satellite]]-based experiment dedicated to the detection of [[cosmic rays]], with a particular focus on their [[antimatter]] component, in the form of [[positron]]s and [[antiproton]]s. Other objectives included long-term monitoring of the solar modulation of cosmic rays, measurements of energetic particles from the [[Sun]], high-energy particles in Earth's [[magnetosphere]] and [[gas giant|Jovian]] electrons. It was also hoped that it may detect evidence of [[dark matter]] annihilation.&lt;ref name="wizardpamela"&gt;{{cite web

==Development and launch==
''PAMELA'' was the largest device up to the time built by the Wizard collaboration, which includes Russia, Italy, Germany and Sweden and has been involved in many satellite and balloon-based cosmic ray experiments such as [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-GLAST]]. The 470&amp;nbsp;kg, US$32&amp;nbsp;million (EU€24.8&amp;nbsp;million, UK£16.8&amp;nbsp;million) instrument was originally projected to have a three-year mission. However, this durable module remained operational and made significant scientific contributions until 2016.

''PAMELA'' is mounted on the upward-facing side of the [[Resurs-DK1]] Russian satellite.&lt;ref name="wizardpamela"/&gt; It was launched by a [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] rocket from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on 15 June 2006. ''PAMELA'' has been put in a polar elliptical orbit at an altitude between 350 and 610&amp;nbsp;km, with an inclination of 70°.

==Design==
The apparatus is 1.3 m high, has a total mass of 470&amp;nbsp;kg and a power consumption of 335 W. The instrument is built around a permanent magnet spectrometer with a silicon microstrip tracker that provides rigidity and dE/dx information. At its bottom is a silicon-tungsten imaging calorimeter, a neutron detector and a shower tail scintillator to perform lepton/hadron discrimination. A Time of Flight (ToF), made of three layers of plastic scintillators, is used to measure the velocity and charge of the particle. An anticounter system made of scintillators surrounding the apparatus is used to reject false triggers and albedo particles during off-line analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0708.1808|last1=Casolino|first1=M| display-authors=etal|title=Launch of the Space experiment PAMELA|journal=Advances in Space Research|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455–466|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.asr.2007.07.023|bibcode=2008AdSpR..42..455C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary data (released August 2008, ICHEP Philadelphia) indicate an excess of positrons in the range 10–60 GeV. This is thought to be a possible sign of [[dark matter]] annihilation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumfiel|first1=Geoff|title=Physicists await dark-matter confirmation|journal=Nature|date=14 August 2008|volume=454|issue=7206|pages=808–809|doi=10.1038/454808b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0810.5344|last1=Cholis|first1=Ilias|title=The PAMELA Positron Excess from Annihilations into a Light Boson|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2009|issue=12|pages=007|last2=Finkbeiner|first2=Douglas P|last3=Goodenough|first3=Lisa|last4=Weiner|first4=Neal|year=2008|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2009/12/007|bibcode=2009JCAP...12..007C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
hypothetical [[WIMPs]] colliding with and annihilating each other to form gamma rays, matter and antimatter particles. Another explanation considered for the indication mentioned above is the production of electron-positron pairs on pulsars with subsequent acceleration in the vicinity of the pulsar.

The first two years of data were released in October 2008 in three publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0810.4980|last1=Casolino|first1=M| display-authors=etal|title=Two years of flight of the Pamela experiment: Results and perspectives|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=78|pages=35|year=2008|doi=10.1143/JPSJS.78SA.35|bibcode=2009JPSJ...78S..35C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0810.4995|last1=Adriani|first1=O|title=Observation of an anomalous positron abundance in the cosmic radiation|journal=Nature|volume=458|issue=7238|pages=607–609| display-authors=etal|year=2008|doi=10.1038/nature07942|bibcode=2009Natur.458..607A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positron excess was confirmed and found to persist up to 90 GeV. Surprisingly, no excess of antiprotons was found. This is inconsistent with predictions from most models of dark matter sources, in which the positron and antiproton excesses are correlated.

A paper, published on 15 July 2011, confirmed earlier speculation that the [[Van Allen belt]] could confine a significant flux of [[antiproton]]s produced by the interaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere with [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/737/2/L29 | title = The Discovery of Geomagnetically Trapped Cosmic-Ray Antiprotons | year = 2011 | last1 = Adriani | first1 = O. | display-authors=etal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 737 | issue = 2 | pages = L29 | bibcode = 2011ApJ...737L..29A | arxiv=1107.4882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy of the antiprotons has been measured in the range of 60–750 MeV.

==Sources of error==

Between 1 and 100 GeV, ''PAMELA'' is exposed to one hundred times as many electrons as antiprotons. At 1 GeV there are one thousand times as many protons as positrons and at 100 GeV ten thousand times as many. Therefore, to correctly determine the antimatter abundances, it is critical that PAMELA is able to reject the matter background. The PAMELA collaboration claimed in [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=APHYE,26,111 The electron hadron separation performance of the PAMELA electromagnetic calorimeter]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} that less than one proton in 100,000 is able to pass the [[calorimeter]] selection and be misidentified as a positron when the energy is less than 200 GeV.

The ratio of matter to antimatter in cosmic rays of energy less than 10 GeV that reach PAMELA from outside the [[solar system]] depends on solar activity and in particular on the point in the 11 year [[solar cycle]]. The ''PAMELA'' team has invoked this effect to explain the discrepancy between their low energy results and those obtained by ''[http://ida1.physik.uni-siegen.de/caprice.html CAPRICE]'', ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998APS..4CF..B201N HEAT]'' and ''[[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer|AMS-01]]'', which were collected during that half of the cycle when the [[solar magnetic field]] had the opposite polarity. It is important to note that these results are consistent with the series of positron / electron measurements obtain by ''[http://www.bartol.udel.edu/~balloon/ AESOP]'', which has spanned coverage over both polarities. Also the ''PAMELA'' experiment has contradicted an earlier claim by the ''HEAT'' experiment of anomalous positrons in the 6 GeV to 10 GeV range.

[[File:17 Drummond Place, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Tait's house at 17 Drummond Place, Edinburgh]]	
'''Peter Guthrie Tait''' [[FRSE]] (28 April 1831 – 4 July 1901) was a Scottish [[Mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]] and early pioneer in [[thermodynamics]]. He is best known for the mathematical physics textbook ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'', which he co-wrote with [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]], and his early investigations into [[knot theory]],

His work on knot theory contributed to the eventual formation of [[topology]] as a mathematical discipline. His name is known in [[graph theory]] mainly for [[Tait's conjecture]].

== Early life ==
Tait was born in [[Dalkeith]] on 28 April 1831 the only son of Mary Ronaldson and John Tait, secretary to the [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|5th Duke of Buccleuch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tait, Peter Guthrie (1831–1901), physicist and mathematician {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36407|work=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/36407|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was educated at Dalkeith Grammar School then [[Edinburgh Academy]]. He then studied Maths and Physics at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and then went to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], graduating as [[senior wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TT848PG|name=Tait, Peter Guthrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fellow and lecturer of his college he remained at the University for a further two years, before leaving to take up the professorship of mathematics at [[Queen's College, Belfast]]. There he made the acquaintance of [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]], whom he joined in researches on the density of [[ozone]] and the action of the electric discharge on [[oxygen]] and other gases, and by whom he was introduced to Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[quaternion]]s.

== Middle years ==
[[File:Peter Guthrie Tait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Peter Guthrie Tait]]
In 1860, Tait succeeded his old master, [[James David Forbes|James D. Forbes]], as professor of [[natural philosophy]] at the University of Edinburgh, and occupied the Chair until shortly before his death. The first scientific paper under Tait's name only was published in 1860. His earliest work dealt mainly with mathematical subjects, and especially with [[Quaternion|quaternions]], of which he was the leading exponent after their originator, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. He was the author of two text-books on them—one an ''Elementary Treatise on Quaternions'' (1867), written with the advice of Hamilton, though not published till after his death, and the other an ''Introduction to Quaternions'' (1873), in which he was aided by [[Philip Kelland]] (1808–1879), one of his teachers at the University of Edinburgh. Quaternions was also one of the themes of his address as president of the mathematical section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1871.

He also produced original work in mathematical and experimental physics. In 1864, he published a short paper on [[thermodynamics]], and from that time his contributions to that and kindred departments of science became frequent and important. In 1871, he emphasised the significance and future importance of the ''principle of the dissipation of energy'' ([[second law of thermodynamics]]). In 1873 he took [[thermoelectricity]] for the subject of his discourse as [[Rede lecturer]] at [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and in the same year he presented the first sketch of his well-known thermoelectric diagram before the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

Two years later, researches on "Charcoal Vacua" with [[James Dewar]] led him to see the true dynamical explanation of the [[Crookes radiometer]] in the large [[mean free path]] of the [[molecule]] of the highly rarefied air. From 1879 to 1888, he engaged in difficult experimental investigations. These began with an inquiry into what corrections were required for thermometers operating at great pressure. This was for the benefit of thermometers employed by the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] for observing deep-sea temperatures, and were extended to include the compressibility of water, glass, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. This work led to the first formulation of the [[Tait equation]], which is widely used to fit liquid density to pressure. Between 1886 and 1892 he published a series of papers on the foundations of the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the fourth of which contained what was, according to [[Lord Kelvin]], the first proof ever given of the [[John James Waterston|Waterston]]-[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] [[theorem]] ([[equipartition theorem]]) of the average equal partition of energy in a mixture of two gases. About the same time he carried out investigations into impact and its duration.

Many other inquiries conducted by him might be mentioned, and some idea may be gained of his scientific activity from the fact that a selection only from his papers, published by the [[Cambridge University Press]], fills three large volumes. This mass of work was done in the time he could spare from his professorial teaching in the university. For example, in 1880 he worked on the [[Four color theorem]] and proved that it was true if and only if no [[snark (graph theory)|snarks]] were planar.

== Later years ==
[[File:Memorial plaque to Peter Guthrie Tait, St Johns Episcopal Church, Edinburgh.JPG|300px|thumb|Memorial plaque to Peter Guthrie Tait, St Johns Episcopal Church, Edinburgh]]
[[File:The grave of Peter Guthrie Tait, St Johns Episcopal Church, Princes St, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of Peter Guthrie Tait, St Johns Episcopal Church, Princes St, Edinburgh]]
In addition, he was the author of a number of books and articles. Of the former, the first, published in 1856, was on the dynamics of a particle; and afterwards there followed a number of concise treatises on [[thermodynamics]], heat, light, properties of matter and dynamics, together with an admirably lucid volume of popular lectures on Recent Advances in Physical Science.

With Lord Kelvin, he collaborated in writing the well-known ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]''. "Thomson and Tait," as it is familiarly called (" T and T' " was the authors' own formula), was planned soon after Lord Kelvin became acquainted with Tait, on the latter's appointment to his professorship in Edinburgh, and it was intended to be an all-comprehensive treatise on physical science, the foundations being laid in [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], and the structure completed with the properties of [[matter]], heat, light, electricity and [[magnetism]]. But the literary partnership ceased in about eighteen years, when only the first portion of the plan had been completed, because each of the members felt he could work to better advantage separately than jointly. The friendship, however, endured for the remaining twenty-three years of Tait's life.

Tait collaborated with [[Balfour Stewart]] in the ''Unseen Universe'', which was followed by ''Paradoxical Philosophy''. It was in his 1875 review of ''The Unseen Universe'', that William James first put forth his [[Will to Believe Doctrine]]. Tait's articles include those he wrote for the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' on light, mechanics, quaternions, radiation, and thermodynamics, and the biographical notices of Hamilton and James Clerk Maxwell.

He died in Edinburgh on 4 July 1901. He is buried in the second terrace down from [[Princes Street]] in the burial ground of [[St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh]].

==Topology==
The [[Tait conjectures]] are three conjectures made by Tait in his study of knots. The Tait conjectures involve concepts in [[knot theory]] such as [[alternating knot]]s, [[chirality]], and [[writhe]]. All of the Tait conjectures have been solved, the most recent being the Flyping conjecture, proved my [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]] and [[William Menasco]] in 1991.

== Private life ==
Tait was married to Margaret Archer Porter (1839-1926), the sister of (1) [[William Archer Porter]], a [[lawyer]] and [[educationist]] who served as the Principal of [[Government Arts College, Kumbakonam]] and tutor and secretary to the Maharaja of [[Mysore kingdom|Mysore]], (2) [[James Porter (Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge)]] and (3) Jane Bailie Porter, who married [[Alexander Crum Brown]], the Scottish organic chemist.

Tait was an enthusiastic golfer and, of his seven children, two, [[Frederick Guthrie Tait]] (1870–1900) and [[John Guthrie Tait]] (1861–1945) went on to become gifted amateur golf champions. He was an all-round sportsman and represented Scotland at international level in [[rugby union]]. Tait himself had, in 1891, invoked the [[Magnus effect]] to explain the influence of [[rotation|spin]] on the flight of a [[golf ball]]. His daughter Edith Tait was married to Rev. [[Harry Reid (bishop)|Harry Reid]], who later became [[Bishop of Edinburgh]].

His son [[William Archer Porter Tait]] was a [[civil engineer]].

==Artistic recognition==
Tait was a lifelong friend of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and a portrait of Tait by [[Harrington Mann]] is held in the [[James Clerk Maxwell Foundation]] museum in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/birthplace.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7923">The '''polyiodides''' are a class of [[polyhalogen anions]] composed entirely of [[iodine]] atoms. The most common and simplest member is the [[triiodide]] ion, {{chem|I|3|−}}. Other known, larger polyiodides include [I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, [I&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; and [I&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="InorgChem"&gt;{{cite book

==Preparation==

The polyiodides can be made by addition of stoichiometric amounts of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to solutions containing I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|I|3|−}}, with the presence of large [[cation|counter-cations]] to stabilize them. For example, KI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O can be crystallized from a saturated solution of [[potassium iodide|KI]] when a stoichiometric amount of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is added and cooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Potassium triiodide|encyclopedia=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|edition=2nd|editor-first=G.|editor-last=Brauer|publisher=Academic Press|date=1963|location=New York|volume=1|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

[[File:Solid state structure of (I26)4- in (DMFc)4(I26).png|right|thumb|300px|The primitive cubic lattice of iodide ions bridge by I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, present in [Cp*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[I&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;]]]

Polyiodides are characterized by their highly complex and variable structures, and can be considered as associations of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{chem|I|3|−}} units. Discrete polyiodides are usually [[linear molecular geometry|linear]], reflecting the origin of the ion. The more complex two- or three-dimensional network structures of chains and cages are formed as the ions interact with each other, with their shapes depending on their associated [[cation]]s quite strongly. The table below lists the polyiodide salts which have been structurally characterized, along with their counter-cation.&lt;ref name="Encyclo"&gt;{{cite book

There is enormous potential for '''renewable energy in Kazakhstan''', particularly from wind and small hydropower plants. The [[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]] has the potential to generate 10 times as much power as it currently needs from [[Wind power|wind energy]] alone. But [[renewable energy]] accounts for just 0.6 percent of all power installations. Of that, 95 percent comes from small [[hydropower]] projects.&lt;ref name="http://www.eurasia.undp.org/"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDP Kazakhstan report|url=http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/dam/rbec/docs/Kazakhstan.pdf|website=UNDP|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main barriers to investment in renewable energy are relatively high financing costs and an absence of uniform [[Feed-in tariff|feed-in tariffs]] for [[electricity]] from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]]. The amount and duration of renewable energy feed-in tariffs are separately evaluated for each project, based on [[Feasibility study|feasibility studies]] and project-specific generation costs. Power from wind, solar, biomass and water up to 35 MW, plus geothermal sources, are eligible for the tariff and transmission companies are required to purchase the energy of renewable energy producers. An amendment that introduces and clarifies technology-specific tariffs is now being prepared. It is expected to be adopted by [[Parliament of Kazakhstan|Parliament]] by the end of 2014.{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} In addition, the World Bank’s [[Ease of doing business index|Ease of Doing Business indicator]] shows the country to be relatively investor-friendly, ranking it in 10th position for investor protection.&lt;ref name="Data Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Bank report,2014|url=http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/|website=Datacatalog.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan is a party to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (1995) and ratified the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 2009. Kazakhstan has committed to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="http://www.climatechange.kz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=12"&gt;{{cite web|title=Киотский протокол в Республике Казахстан|url=http://www.climatechange.kz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=12|website=ClimateChange.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having more renewable energy in the energy balance of Kazakhstan is one of the most effective mechanisms to reduce harmful effects of the [[Energy industry|energy sector]] and to diversify the national [[Electricity generation|power generation]] capacity.

To help Kazakhstan meet its goals for renewable energy generation, the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) is launching the Kazakhstan Renewable Energy Financing Facility (KazREFF). The KazREFF aims to provide development support and debt finance to renewable energy projects which meet required commercial, technical and environmental criteria. Renewable energy technologies supported will include solar, wind, small hydropower, [[geothermal]], [[biomass]], and [[biogas]]. The Facility comprises an amount of up to €50 million for financing projects together with up to €20 million of concessional finance from [[Clean Technology Fund]] (CTF), and the technical assistance funded by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] through the Japan-EBRD Cooperation Fund (JECF).&lt;ref name="http://www.kazreff-ser.com/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan Renewable Energy Financing Facility|url=http://www.kazreff-ser.com/|website=KazREFF-ser.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==

In 2013, the [[Government of Kazakhstan]] adopted a new law, On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources. This promotes technology-specific feed-in tariffs for selected renewable energy technologies, such as biomass, solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower, up to 35 MW.&lt;ref name="http://www.government.kz/en/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan|url=http://www.government.kz/en/|website=Government.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the programme is estimated at KZT 1,100 billion (c. €5.3 billion). A plan to develop alternative and renewable energy in Kazakhstan for 2013-2020 was adopted by the Government in 2013. The plan aims to install about 1040 MW renewable energy capacity by 2020, including 793 MW from wind, 170 MW from hydro and 4 MW from solar sources. The cost of the plan is estimated at KZT 317.05 billion (c. €1.25 billion). Also in 2013, the Government of Kazakhstan adopted the Energy Efficiency 2020 programme, which plans to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent annually until 2015. A long-term strategy for Kazakhstan (until 2050) was also adopted in 2012. The strategy sets an ambitious goal of generating 50 percent of all power from [[alternative energy]] sources, including renewable sources. There are more incentives for investment in renewable energy.&lt;ref name="http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/global-status-report/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewables Global Status Report|url=http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/global-status-report/|website=Ren21.net|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2012 [[Astana]] was chosen by the [[International Exhibitions Bureau]] (BIE) as the venue to host [[Expo 2017|EXPO-2017]], which focused on future energy issues. The theme of Future Energy is aimed to concentrate on both the future of energy but also on the potential energies of the future. Kazakhstan is very aware that the time has come for the world to move from [[fossil fuels]] to renewable energy sources. The selection of Astana to serve as host city is especially notable, because EXPO-2017 was the first time that a major international exhibition of this kind was held in a country from the former [[Soviet Union]]. More than 100 countries and 10 international organizations participated. The exhibition gathered and demonstrated best global developments in the field of energy conservation, as well as latest technology achievements in solar, wind and water energies. Moreover, the energy for the exhibition itself was obtained from renewable energy sources produced domestically.&lt;ref name="https://zenodo.org/record/13918/files/pdf.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative energy sources Kazakhstan|url=https://zenodo.org/record/13918/files/pdf.pdf|website=Zenodo.org|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydropower==
[[File:Water atlas, Kazakhstan.PNG|thumb|High potential regions for Hydropower plants]]
Small hydropower plants are the most rapidly developing areas of use of renewable energy in the country. Thus, in the period from 2007 to 2010 the [[Almaty]] region introduced five small hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of 20 MW.&lt;ref name="http://www.rfc.kegoc.kz/vozmozhnosti-vozobnovlyaemyx-istochnikov-energii-v-kazaxstane/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Возможные источники энергии в Казахстане|url=http://www.rfc.kegoc.kz/vozmozhnosti-vozobnovlyaemyx-istochnikov-energii-v-kazaxstane/|website=Rfc.kegoc.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the important areas of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of Kazakhstan's economy is construction of [[hydroelectric power plants]] on small rivers operating without retaining dams.
Hydropower accounts for approximately 13% percent of Kazakhstan's total generating capacity delivering around 7.78TWh from 15 large (450 MW)hydropower station with a total capacity of 2.248GW.&lt;ref name="http://www.resourcegovernance.org/"&gt;{{cite web|title=NRGI Kazakhstan report|url=http://www.resourcegovernance.org/|website=Natural Resource Governance Institute|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large hydropower plants comprise the [[Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Plant|Bukhtyrma]] (750MW), [[Shulbinsk Hydroelectric Power Plant|Shulbinsk]] (702MW) and [[Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydroelectric Power Plant|Ust-Kamenogorsk]] (315MW) plants on the [[Irtysh river|Irtysh River]], the [[Kapshagay Hydroelectric Power Plant|Kapshagai]] (364MW) plant on the [[Ili River]], the [[Moinak Hydro Power Plant|Moinak]] (300MW) plant on the [[Charyn River|Charyn Rriver]] and the Shardarinskaya (104MW) plant on the [[Syr Darya|Syrdarya River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marinina|first1=O|title=Problems of [[water resources management]] in the Republic of Kazakhstan|journal=Institute for Water and Environmental Problems|date=2013|pages=109–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small (1–10MW) and medium-scale (10–50MW) hydropower projects have become more popular because of their low cost, reliability and apparent environmental friendliness.&lt;ref name="http://www.smallhydroworld.org/"&gt;{{cite web|title=World small hydropower development report|url=http://www.smallhydroworld.org/|website=UNIDO|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven small hydropower plants (&lt;10MW), with a total installed capacity of 78MW and an estimated potential of 13TWh, spanning east and south Kazakhstan, [[Zhambyl Province|Zhambyl]] and [[Almaty]] provinces. According to the experts, provided the smaller hydropower stations are installed about 8 billion kWh can produced per year and this is more than enough to meet the demand that is now satisfied through imports from [[Central Asia]].
In December 2011 the [[Moinak Hydro Power Plant|Moynak hydropower plant]] (300 MW) was put into operation within the realization of the State Program for Rapid Industrial-innovative Development. A number of the projects to build smaller hydropower plants are being implemented in southern Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="http://www.buro247.kz/lifestyle/expo-2017/kak-kazakhstan-razvivaet-zelenyu-energetiku.html"&gt;{{cite web|title=Как в Казахстане развивается зеленая энергетика|url=http://www.buro247.kz/lifestyle/expo-2017/kak-kazakhstan-razvivaet-zelenyu-energetiku.html|website=Buro24/7.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar energy==
[[File:Solar atlas, Kazakhstan.PNG|thumb|High potential regions for Solarpower plants]]
Kazakhstan has areas with high [[insolation]] that could be suitable for [[solar power]], particularly in the south of the country, receiving between 2200 and 3000h of sunlight per year, which equals 1200–1700&amp;nbsp;kW/m2 annually.&lt;ref name="bmz.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable energies in Central Asia|url=http://www.bmz.de/en/what_we_do/approaches/bilateral_development_cooperation/players/selection/gtz/index.html?PHPSESSID=b9baca7e80b4a65f2c02114abdebac86|website=Bmz.de|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both concentrated [[solar thermal]] and [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) have potential.There is a 2MW solar PV plant near Almaty and six solar PV plants are currently under construction in the Zhambyl province of southern Kazakhstan with a combined capacity of 300MW.&lt;ref name="http://www.bourabai.kz/toe/kazenergy.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Электроэнергетика Казахстана|url=http://www.bourabai.kz/toe/kazenergy.htm|website=Bourabai.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to solar PV, concentrated solar thermal is advantageous given it does not require water for operation so can be used in [[desert]] and [[semi-desert]] areas, the materials ([[steel]], [[glass]],and [[concrete]]) are domestically produced in [[Kazakhstan]] and readily available, and solar thermal plants store energy in the form of [[heat]], which is far more efficient than the batteries used in [[PV systems]] and allows [[electricity]] to be produced on demand, even after the sun has set, enabling both base and peak loads to be met. There are no current plans to install a concentrated solar thermal plant although the government plans to create 1.04GW of renewable energy capacity by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cochran|first1=J|title=Kazakhstan's potential for wind and concentrated solar power|journal=Almaty,Kazakhstan|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South-Kazakhstan, [[Kyzylorda Region|Kyzylorda]] oblast and the [[Aral, Kazakhstan|Aral]] region are the most suitable locations to build solar power plants.

The most significant project in this field implemented in 2002 in Kazakhstan and financed by the [[UN]] was to install 50 prism solar power plants with capacity of 100 liters of water each, and 50 solar stills, using the water from the [[Syr Darya]] river to provide the residents of two villages in the Aral region for drinking water and heating.&lt;ref name="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/sagatov1/docs/kaz_energy_resources_ru.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Энергетика Казахстана|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/sagatov1/docs/kaz_energy_resources_ru.pdf|website=Обзор перспектив|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, according to the Plan of Activities for Alternative and Renewable Energy in Kazakhstan, it is planned to put into operation about 28 solar energy projects until the end of 2020 with total installed capacity of 713.5 MW.&lt;ref name="http://kazcham.com/renewable-energy-in-kazakhstan-more-than-1-gw-until-2020/"&gt;{{cite web|title=RES in Kazakhstan: More than 1 GW until 2020|url=http://kazcham.com/renewable-energy-in-kazakhstan-more-than-1-gw-until-2020/|website=KazCham.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) financed two solar parks in Kazakhstan. The first one, 50MW Burnoye Solar 1, was established in April 2014. The second one, known as Burnoye Solar 2, is also 50MW and will be located in the Zhambyl region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EBRD finances 50MW solar park in Kazakhstan|url=https://www.pv-tech.org/news/ebrd-finances-50mw-solar-park-in-kazakhstan|website=www.pv-tech.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wind energy==
[[File:Wind atlas Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|High potential regions for Windpower plants]]
Kazakhstan's [[steppe]] geography makes it suitable for wind energy applications and the estimated potential of wind energy that can be economically developed is about 760GW.&lt;ref name="undp.kz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lessons learnt from the Kazakhstan: windpower market development initiative|url=http://undp.kz/|website=United Nations Development Program Kazakhstan|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50% of Kazakhstan's territory has average wind speeds suitable for energy generation (4–6&amp;nbsp;m/s) with the strongest potential in the [[Caspian Sea]], central and northern regions. The most promising individual sites are in the Almaty region in the Djungar (Dzhumgarian) Gates, 600&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Almaty close to the [[Xinjiang]] border and the Chylyk Corridor 100&amp;nbsp;km east of Almaty. Wind potentials of 525Wm2 in the Djungar Gates and 240Wm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Chylyk corridor have been estimated with power production from wind turbines potentially achieving 4400&amp;nbsp;kW/h/MW and 3200&amp;nbsp;kW/h/MW respectively.&lt;ref name="http://www.windenergy.kz/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospective of windpower development in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.windenergy.kz/|website=UNDP-GEF|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies selected 10 sites to build large wind power plants (WPP) with total capacity of 1,000 MW with a view to commercial production of electricity in the amount of 2-3 billion kWh. Currently only one wind energy plant is operating in Kazakhstan; the Kordai wind power plant with 1500&amp;nbsp;kW capacity was launched in December 2011 in Zhambyl region.&lt;ref name="http://kisi.kz/en/categories/economy-and-energy/posts/future-of-renewable-energy-in-kazakhstan406"&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of Renewable Energy in Kazakhstan|url=http://kisi.kz/en/categories/economy-and-energy/posts/future-of-renewable-energy-in-kazakhstan406|website=KazISS.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kazakhstan’s power companies, Samruk-Energy JSC, was recently awarded a $94 million loan from the [[Eurasian Development Bank]] to build Kazakhstan’s largest wind farm. The project will produce 172 million kilowatt/hours of electrical energy per year, save more than 60 million tons of coal, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="http://kzgreenenergy.com/wind-energy/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Energy|url=http://kzgreenenergy.com/wind-energy/|website=KZgreenenergy.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wind generator production plant in the post-Soviet region is set to be constructed in Kazakhstan's [[Aktobe]]. This project, with a cost of 84 million euros (US$95.3 million), is expected to create 500 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind generator production plant to be built in Aktobe|url=http://astanatimes.com/2017/07/wind-generator-production-plant-to-be-built-in-aktobe/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioenergy==
Kazakhstan has 76.5Mha agricultural land, 10Mha forest and 185Mha steppe grasslands providing abundant biomass wastes and residues which have the potential to generate arrange of bioenergy services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pala|first1=C|title=Abandoned Soviet farmlands could help offset global warming|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2009|volume=43|issue=23|pages=685–707|doi=10.1021/es903218x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan produces and exports crops such as wheat (winter and spring), rye (winter), maize (for grain), barley (winter and spring), oats, millet, buckwheat, rice and pulses, with an average grain yield of 17.5–20 Mt, which equates to roughly 12–14Mt of biomass wastes.&lt;ref name="http://www.fao.org/home/en/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|url=http://www.fao.org/home/en/|website=General summary for the countries of the former Soviet Union|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass wastes are currently poorly exploited and only ~10% of the total volume of the residues isused, mostly as a feed additive for livestock; the proportion of rural households using biomass cook stoves for cooking and heating is currently unknown.Organic wastes are also a potential source of energy and at least 400,000 households are known to keep cattle, horses and sheep.&lt;ref name="http://www.resourcegovernance.org/"/&gt; It has been estimated that electricity generation potential in Kazakhstan from biomass is 35 billion kWh per year and heat generation potential is 44 million Gcal per year.&lt;ref name="http://www.energypartner.kz/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass and biogas in Kazakhstan report|url=http://www.energypartner.kz/|website=Energy Partner LLP|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various external funding agencies(UNDP, GEF, HIVOS Foundation) have supported the development of biogas initiatives including the Biogas Training Centre at the Eco-museum in Karanga (2002–2003) and the ‘Azure Flame’ Central Kazakhstan Biogas Education Centre (2004–2005) however despite this promotion there is only one large scale biogas unit currently in operation in the country which is a 360kWe biogas plant run at Vostok village in the Kostanai region.The Vostok biogas unit consists of two 2400m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; digesters operating with a feedstock of 40 t/day of cow, sheep and camel manure, grain residues and 1t/day of slaughterhouse waste. The plant was installed in 2011 by Karaman-K Ltd. and Zorg Biogas with an aim of delivering 3 million kWh of electricity annually.&lt;ref name="http://zorg-biogas.com/?lang=en"&gt;{{cite web|title=First biogas plant started energy production in Kazakhstan|url=http://zorg-biogas.com/?lang=en|website=ZorgBiogas|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another potential area is the use of biogas, which is produced from the waste of farms and poultry factories. Kazakhstan has a significant number of livestock and poultry. Methane production potential of the waste in cattle is more than 85 thousand tons. Potential methane production from waste-water communal services is about 3 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="http://led-ca.net/vozobnovlyaemyie-istochniki-energii/energiya-biomassyi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Энергия биомассы|url=http://led-ca.net/vozobnovlyaemyie-istochniki-energii/energiya-biomassyi|website=Led-ca.net|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to renewable energy==
In spite of considerable renewable energy potential there are still significant barriers to address including: low electricity tariffs; transmission losses and inefficient technologies; weak regulatory and legal frameworks to stimulate the use of renewable energy in the electricity sector; persistent governmental body reforms; inadequate levels and quality of scientific support; awareness and information barriers; and a high-risk business environment.&lt;ref name="http://www.invest.nauka.kz/reviews/ways_of_development_of_biofuel_kazakh_energy.php"&gt;{{cite web|title=Пути развития биотопливной энергетики казахстана|url=http://www.invest.nauka.kz/reviews/ways_of_development_of_biofuel_kazakh_energy.php|website=Invest.nauka.kz|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstacles to renewable energy promotion in Kazakhstan are similar to the ones that are persisting in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, ''Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies'', Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy projects==
In 2016, Kazakhstan's capital Astana started testing and implementing energy-saving systems in construction. Thus, the Kazakhstan Centre for Modernisation and Development of Housing and Communal Services moved to a new building equipped with energy-saving wind and solar energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind and Solar-Equipped Building to Serve as Test Model for New Construction Standards|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/05/wind-and-solar-equipped-building-to-serve-as-test-model-for-new-construction-standards/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan encourages SME's to develop and implement green energy projects. To that end, Kazakhstan's DAMU Entrepreneurship Development Fund (DAMU) and [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) has signed two contracts to finance SMEs working to mitigate climate change and protect the environment. The EIB agreed to provide €200 million (£169.04m) of funding to support small sustainable projects in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green projects in Kazakhstan get €200m funding|url=https://www.energylivenews.com/2016/12/02/green-projects-in-kazakhstan-get-e200m-funding/|website=www.energylivenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy Ministry of Kazakhstan announced 2017 to be the "Green Energy" year with 37 new projects aimed at attracting investment in the renewable energy projects throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 ‘green energy’ year in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.inform.kz/en/2017-green-energy-year-in-kazakhstan_a2960947|website=www.inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kazakhstan's primary goals in its transition to green economy set by [[Nursultan Nazarbayev|President Nazarbayev]] is to achieve 50% of total electricity to be generated by renewable sources by 2050. As of mid-2017, there were 50 enterprises operating in Kazakhstan that produced energy from renewable sources with a total capacity of 300 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan has 50 enterprises producing energy from renewable sources|url=http://bnews.kz/en/news/kazakhstan_has_50_enterprises_producing_energy_from_renewable_sources|website=bnews.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rosetta Stone''' is a [[granodiorite]] [[stele]], found in 1799, inscribed with three versions of a [[Rosetta Stone decree|decree]] issued at [[Memphis, Egypt]] in 196 BC during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] on behalf of King [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V]]. The top and middle texts are in [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] using [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] script, respectively, while the bottom is in [[Ancient Greek]]. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, thereby opening a window into ancient Egyptian history.

The stone, carved during the [[Hellenistic period]], is believed to have originally been displayed within a [[Egyptian temple|temple]], possibly at nearby [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It was probably moved during the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] or [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], and was eventually used as building material in the construction of [[Fort Julien]] near the town of [[Rosetta|Rashid (Rosetta)]] in the [[Nile Delta]]. It was rediscovered there in July 1799 by a French soldier named [[Pierre-François Bouchard]] during the [[Napoleon]]ic [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|campaign in Egypt]]. It was the first Ancient Egyptian [[bilingual inscription|bilingual text]] recovered in modern times, and it aroused [[Egyptology#Modern Egyptology|widespread public interest]] with its potential to decipher this [[undeciphered writing systems|previously untranslated]] hieroglyphic language. [[Lithography|Lithographic copies]] and [[plaster cast]]s began circulating among European museums and scholars. [[British Army|British troops]] having meanwhile defeated the French, under the [[Capitulation of Alexandria (1801)|Capitulation of Alexandria]] in 1801 the original stone came into British possession and was transported to London. It has been on public display at the [[British Museum]] almost continuously since 1802 and is the most-visited object there.

Study of the decree was already under way when the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic ([[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).

Ever since its rediscovery, the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries, including its transfer from French to British possession during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young and Champollion's contributions to the decipherment and, since 2003, demands for the stone's return to Egypt.

Two other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier [[Ptolemaic Decrees|Ptolemaic decrees]] (the [[Decree of Canopus]] in 238 BC, and the [[Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy IV)|Memphis decree of Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;IV]], c. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, but it was the essential key to modern understanding of [[Ancient Egyptian literature]] and [[Ancient Egypt|civilisation]]. The term ''Rosetta Stone'' is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.

==Description==
The Rosetta Stone is listed as "a stone of black [[granodiorite]], bearing three inscriptions&amp;nbsp;... found at Rosetta" in a contemporary catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the French expedition and surrendered to British troops in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bierbrier99|Bierbrier (1999)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;111–113&lt;/ref&gt; At some period after its arrival in London, the inscriptions on the stone were coloured in [[chalk|white chalk]] to make them more legible, and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of [[carnauba wax]] designed to protect the Rosetta Stone from visitors' fingers.&lt;ref name="Cracking23"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt; This gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as [[basalt|black basalt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synopsis|''Synopsis'' (1847)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;113–114&lt;/ref&gt; These additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in 1999, revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock, the sparkle of its crystalline structure, and a [[vein (geology)|pink vein]] running across the top left corner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller00|Miller et al. (2000)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;128–132&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with the [[Rosemarie and Dietrich Klemm Collection|Klemm collection]] of Egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small [[granodiorite]] quarry at [[Gebel Tingar]] on the west bank of the [[Nile]], west of [[Elephantine]] in the region of [[Aswan]]; the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region.&lt;ref name="MiddletonKlemm207"&gt;[[#Middleton03|Middleton and Klemm (2003)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;207–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosetta Stone is {{Convert|1123|mm|ftin|0}} high at its highest point, {{convert|abbr=on|757|mm|ftin}} wide, and {{convert|abbr=on|284|mm|ftin|0}} thick. It weighs approximately {{Convert|760|kg}}.&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;[[#BMRS|The Rosetta Stone]]&lt;/ref&gt; It bears three inscriptions: the top register in Ancient Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, the second in the Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] script, and the third in [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref name="Ray3"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; The front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly [[Incised#Archaeology and the Plastic Arts|incised]] on it; the sides of the stone are smoothed, but the back is only roughly worked, presumably because this would have not been visible when it was erected.&lt;ref name="MiddletonKlemm207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking28"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original stele===
[[File:RosettaStoneAsPartOfOriginalStele.svg|thumb|upright|alt="Image of the Rosetta Stone set against a reconstructed image of the original stele it came from, showing 14 missing lines of hieroglyphic text and a group of Egyptian deities and symbols at the top"|One possible reconstruction of the original stele]]

The Rosetta Stone is a fragment of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site.&lt;ref name="Cracking20"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its damaged state, none of the three texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.&lt;ref name="Budgea2"&gt;[[#Budge69|Budge (1913)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The full length of the hieroglyphic text and the total size of the original stele, of which the Rosetta Stone is a fragment, can be estimated based on comparable stelae that have survived, including other copies of the same order. The slightly earlier [[decree of Canopus]], erected in 238 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;III]], is {{convert|2190|mm|ft|disp=x| high (|)}} and {{convert|abbr=on|820|mm}} wide, and contains 36 lines of hieroglyphic text, 73 of demotic text, and 74 of Greek. The texts are of similar length.&lt;ref name="Mummy106"&gt;[[#Budgem|Budge (1894)]] p.&amp;nbsp;106&lt;/ref&gt; From such comparisons, it can be estimated that an additional 14 or 15 lines of hieroglyphic inscription are missing from the top register of the Rosetta Stone, amounting to another {{Convert|300|mm}}.&lt;ref name="Mummy109"&gt;[[#Budgem|Budge (1894)]] p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the inscriptions, there would probably have been a scene depicting the king being presented to the gods, topped with a winged disc, as on the Canopus Stele. These parallels, and a hieroglyphic sign for "stela" on the stone itself, &lt;div style="display:inline;"&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;O26&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/div&gt; (see [[Gardiner's sign list#O._Buildings.2C_parts_of_buildings.2C_etc.|Gardiner's sign list]]), suggest that it originally had a rounded top.&lt;ref name="Ray3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking26"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the original stele is estimated to have been about {{Convert|149|cm|ftin}}.&lt;ref name="Cracking26"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Memphis decree and its context==
{{Main article|Rosetta Stone decree}}
The stele was erected after the [[coronation]] of King [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V]] and was inscribed with a decree that established the divine cult of the new ruler.&lt;ref name="Cracking25"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt; The decree was issued by a congress of priests who gathered at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. The date is given as "4 Xandicus" in the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] and "18 [[Meshir]]" in the [[Egyptian calendar]], which corresponds to March 27, 196 BC. The year is stated as the ninth year of Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V's reign (equated with 197/196 BC), which is confirmed by four priests named who officiated in that same year: [[Aëtus son of Aëtus]] was priest of the divine cults of [[Alexander the Great]] and the five [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] down to Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V himself; his three colleagues, named in turn in the inscription, led the worship of [[Berenice II|Berenice Euergetis]] (wife of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;III]]), [[Arsinoe II of Egypt|Arsinoe Philadelphos]] (wife and sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]]), and [[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe Philopator]], mother of Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clarysse83|Clarysse and Van der Veken (1983)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21&lt;/ref&gt; However, a second date is also given in the Greek and hieroglyphic texts, corresponding to {{Nowrap|27 November 197 BC}}, the official anniversary of Ptolemy's coronation.&lt;ref name="Cracking29"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription in demotic conflicts with this, listing consecutive days in March for the decree and the anniversary.&lt;ref name="Cracking29"/&gt; It is uncertain why such discrepancies exist, but it is clear that the decree was issued in 196 BC and that it was designed to re-establish the rule of the Ptolemaic kings over Egypt.&lt;ref name="ShawNicholson 247"&gt;[[#ShawNicholson1995|Shaw &amp; Nicholson (1995)]] p.&amp;nbsp;247&lt;/ref&gt;

The decree was issued during a turbulent period in Egyptian history. Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V Epiphanes reigned from 204 to 181 BC, the son of [[Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;IV Philopator]] and his wife and sister Arsinoe. He had become ruler at the age of five after the sudden death of both of his parents, who were murdered in a conspiracy that involved Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;IV's mistress [[Agathoclea]], according to contemporary sources. The conspirators effectively ruled Egypt as Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V's guardians&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tyldesley2006|Tyldesley (2006)]] p.&amp;nbsp;194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayton211"&gt;[[#Clayton06|Clayton (2006)]] p.&amp;nbsp;211&lt;/ref&gt; until a revolt broke out two years later under general [[Tlepolemus (regent of Egypt)|Tlepolemus]], when Agathoclea and her family were lynched by a mob in Alexandria. Tlepolemus, in turn, was replaced as guardian in 201 BC by [[Aristomenes of Alyzia]], who was chief minister at the time of the Memphis decree.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bevan27|Bevan (1927)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Africa/Egypt/_Texts/BEVHOP/8*.html pp.&amp;nbsp;252–262]&lt;/ref&gt;

Political forces beyond the borders of Egypt exacerbated the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. [[Antiochus&amp;nbsp;III the Great]] and [[Philip&amp;nbsp;V of Macedon]] had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in [[Caria]] and [[Thrace]], while the [[Battle of Panium]] (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of [[Coele-Syria]], including [[Judea|Judaea]], from the Ptolemies to the [[Seleucids]]. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;IV,&lt;ref name="Cracking29"/&gt; led by [[Hugronaphor|Horwennefer]] and by his successor [[Adikhalamani|Ankhwennefer]].&lt;ref name="Assmann"&gt;[[#Assmann|Assmann (2003)]] p.&amp;nbsp;376&lt;/ref&gt; Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign), and the Memphis decree issued.&lt;ref name="Clayton211"/&gt;

[[File:PepiII-DecreeOfOfficialExactionForTempleOfMin MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|upright|alt="A small, roughly square piece of light-grey stone containing hieroglyphic inscriptions from the time of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II"|Another fragmentary example of a "donation stele", in which the [[Old Kingdom]] [[pharaoh]] [[Pepi II Neferkare|Pepi&amp;nbsp;II]] [[Coptos Decrees|grants tax immunity]] to the priests of the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]]]]

The stele is a late example of a class of donation stelae, which depicts the reigning monarch granting a tax exemption to the resident priesthood.&lt;ref name="Kitchen59"&gt;[[#Kitchen70|Kitchen (1970)]] p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt; Pharaohs had erected these stelae over the previous 2,000 years, the earliest examples dating from the Egyptian [[Old Kingdom]]. In earlier periods, all such decrees were issued by the king himself, but the Memphis decree was issued by the priests, as the maintainers of traditional Egyptian culture.&lt;ref name="focus13"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; The decree records that Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;V gave a gift of silver and grain to the [[Egyptian temple|temples]].&lt;ref name="Bevan 264–265"&gt;[[#Bevan27|Bevan (1927)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;264–265&lt;/ref&gt; It also records that there was particularly high [[flooding of the Nile]] in the eighth year of his reign, and he had the excess waters dammed for the benefit of the farmers.&lt;ref name="Bevan 264–265"/&gt; In return for these concessions, the priesthood pledged that the king's birthday and coronation days would be celebrated annually, and that all the priests of Egypt would serve him alongside the other gods. The decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple, inscribed in the "language of the gods" (hieroglyphs), the "language of documents" (demotic), and the "language of the Greeks" as used by the Ptolemaic government.&lt;ref name="Ray136"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt;

Securing the favour of the priesthood was essential for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The [[High Priest of Ptah|High Priests]] of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities of the time and had influence throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Shaw407"&gt;[[#Shaw00|Shaw (2000)]] p.&amp;nbsp;407&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, it is evident that the young king was anxious to gain their active support.&lt;ref name="Walker19"&gt;[[#Walker2001|Walker and Higgs (editors, 2001)]] p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the [[Wars of Alexander the Great#Egypt|conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]], the Memphis decree, like the [[Ptolemaic Decrees|two preceding decrees]] in the series, included texts in Egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall04|Bagnall and Derow (2004)]] (no. 137 in online version)&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists no one definitive English translation of the decree because of the minor differences between the three original texts, and because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop. An up-to-date translation by R. S. Simpson appears on the British Museum website, based on the demotic text.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simpson|Simpson (n. d.)]]; revised version of [[#Simpson96|Simpson (1996)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;258–271&lt;/ref&gt; It can be compared with [[Edwyn R. Bevan]]'s full translation in ''The House of Ptolemy'' (1927),&lt;ref name="Rosetta Text"&gt;[[#Bevan27|Bevan (1927)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Africa/Egypt/_Texts/BEVHOP/8*.html 263–268]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the Greek text with footnote comments on variations between this and the two Egyptian texts.

The stele almost certainly did not originate in the town of [[Rosetta|Rashid]] (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]].&lt;ref name="focus14"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt; The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] emperor [[Theodosius I]] ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship.&lt;ref name="focus17"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref name="focus20"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the [[Mamluk|Mameluke]] [[Sultan]] [[Qaitbay]] (c. 1416/18–1496) to defend the [[Nile Delta|Bolbitine branch]] of the Nile at Rashid.&lt;ref name="focus20"/&gt; There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.&lt;ref name="focus20"/&gt;

Two other inscriptions containing the same Memphis decree have been found since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone: the [[Nubayrah Stele]], and an inscription found at the [[Philae|Temple of Philae]] (on the [[Philae obelisk]]). Unlike the Rosetta Stone, the hieroglyphic texts of these other copies of the decree were relatively intact. The Rosetta Stone had been deciphered long before they were found, but later Egyptologists, including [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Wallis Budge]], used these other copies to refine the reconstruction of the hieroglyphs that must have been used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic text on the Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref name="Budge133"&gt;[[#Budge69|Budge (1913)]] p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
[[File:Rosetta news.jpg|thumb|alt="Image of a contemporary newspaper report from 1801 of approximately three column inches describing the arrival of the Rosetta Stone in England"|Report of the arrival of the Rosetta Stone in England in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1802]]

[[Napoleon]]'s 1798 [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|campaign in Egypt]] came at (and helped cause) the beginning of a burst of [[Egyptomania]] in Europe, and especially France.  A corps of 167 technical experts (''savants''), known as the ''[[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]]'', accompanied the [[French Revolutionary Army|French expeditionary army]] to Egypt. On {{nowrap|July 15,}} 1799, French soldiers under the command of Colonel d'Hautpoul were strengthening the defences of [[Fort Julien]], a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rosetta (modern-day Rashid). Lieutenant [[Pierre-François Bouchard]] spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side that the soldiers had uncovered.&lt;ref name="Benjamin2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Don C.|title=Stones and stories: an introduction to archaeology and the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBcG8phWFMYC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=March 2009|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2357-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and d'Hautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed General [[Jacques-François Menou]], who happened to be at Rosetta.{{Cref2|A|1}} The find was announced to Napoleon's newly founded scientific association in Cairo, the [[Institut d'Égypte]], in a report by Commission member [[Michel Ange Lancret]] noting that it contained three inscriptions, the first in hieroglyphs and the third in Greek, and rightly suggesting that the three inscriptions were versions of the same text. Lancret's report, dated {{Nowrap|July 19,}} 1799, was read to a meeting of the Institute soon after {{Nowrap|July 25}}. Bouchard, meanwhile, transported the stone to Cairo for examination by scholars. Napoleon himself inspected what had already begun to be called ''la Pierre de Rosette'', the Rosetta Stone, shortly before his return to France in August 1799.&lt;ref name="Cracking20"/&gt;

The discovery was reported in September in ''[[Courrier de l'Égypte]]'', the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day be the key to deciphering hieroglyphs.{{Cref2|A|2}}&lt;ref name="Cracking20"/&gt; In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was [[Jean-Joseph Marcel]], a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as had originally been thought.&lt;ref name="Cracking20"/&gt; It was artist and inventor [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] who found a way to use the stone itself as a [[woodblock printing|printing block]] to reproduce the inscription.&lt;ref name="Adkins38"&gt;[[#Adkins69|Adkins (2000)]] p.&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly different method was adopted by [[Antoine Galland (1763–1851)|Antoine Galland]]. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General [[Charles Dugua]]. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gillispie87|Gillispie (1987)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;1–38&lt;/ref&gt;

After Napoleon's departure, French troops held off British and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks for another 18 months. In March 1801, the British landed at [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]]. Menou was now in command of the French expedition. His troops, including the Commission, marched north towards the Mediterranean coast to meet the enemy, transporting the stone along with many other antiquities. He was defeated in battle, and the remnant of his army retreated to Alexandria where they were surrounded and besieged, the stone now inside the city. Menou surrendered on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson (1803)]] vol. 2 pp.&amp;nbsp;274–284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking21"/&gt;

==From French to British possession==
[[File:RosettaStone-LeftAndRightSides-BritishMuseum-August21-08.jpg|thumb|upright|alt="Combined photo depicting the left and right sides of the Rosetta Stone, which have much-faded inscriptions in English relating to its capture by English forces from the French, and its donation by George III to the British Museum"|Left and right sides of the Rosetta Stone, with inscriptions in English relating to its capture by English forces from the French]]

After the surrender, a dispute arose over the fate of the French archaeological and scientific discoveries in Egypt, including the artefacts, biological specimens, notes, plans, and drawings collected by the members of the commission. Menou refused to hand them over, claiming that they belonged to the Institute. British General [[John Hely-Hutchinson, 2nd Earl of Donoughmore|John Hely-Hutchinson]] refused to relieve the city until Menou gave in. Scholars [[Edward Daniel Clarke]] and [[William Richard Hamilton]], newly arrived from England, agreed to examine the collections in Alexandria and claimed to have found many artefacts that the French had not revealed. In a letter home, Clarke said that "we found much more in their possession than was represented or imagined".&lt;ref name="Burleigh212"&gt;[[#Burleigh07|Burleigh (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;212&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson claimed that all materials were property of the [[The Crown|British Crown]], but French scholar [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] told Clarke and Hamilton that the French would rather burn all their discoveries than turn them over, referring ominously to the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]]. Clarke and Hamilton pleaded the French scholars' case to Hutchinson, who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be the scholars' private property.&lt;ref name="Cracking21"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burleigh241"&gt;[[#Burleigh07|Burleigh (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;214&lt;/ref&gt; Menou quickly claimed the stone, too, as his private property.&lt;ref name="Budge2"&gt;[[#Budge69|Budge (1913)]] p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking21"/&gt; Hutchinson was equally aware of the stone's unique value and rejected Menou's claim. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the [[Capitulation of Alexandria (1801)|Capitulation of Alexandria]] signed by representatives of the [[British Army|British]], [[French Revolutionary Army|French]], and [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman]] forces.

It is not clear exactly how the stone was transferred into British hands, as contemporary accounts differ. Colonel [[Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner]] was to escort it to England, but he claimed later that he had personally seized it from Menou and carried it away on a [[limbers and caissons|gun-carriage]]. In a much more detailed account, Edward Daniel Clarke stated that a French "officer and member of the Institute" had taken him, his student John Cripps, and Hamilton secretly into the back streets behind Menou's residence and revealed the stone hidden under protective carpets among Menou's baggage. According to Clarke, their informant feared that the stone might be stolen if French soldiers saw it. Hutchinson was informed at once and the stone was taken away—possibly by Turner and his gun-carriage.&lt;ref name="Cracking2122"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner brought the stone to England aboard the captured French frigate [[HMS Egyptienne (1799)|HMS ''Egyptienne'']], landing in [[Portsmouth]] in February 1802.&lt;ref name="Andrews12"&gt;[[#Andrews69|Andrews (1985)]] p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; His orders were to present it and the other antiquities to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George&amp;nbsp;III]]. The King, represented by [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|War Secretary]] [[Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire|Lord Hobart]], directed that it should be placed in the [[British Museum]]. According to Turner's narrative, he and Hobart agreed that the stone should be presented to scholars at the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], of which Turner was a member, before its final deposit in the museum. It was first seen and discussed there at a meeting on {{Nowrap|March 11,}} 1802.{{Cref2|B}}{{Cref2|H|1}}

In 1802 the Society created four plaster casts of the inscriptions, which were given to the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and to [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College Dublin]]. Soon afterwards, prints of the inscriptions were made and circulated to European scholars.{{Cref2|E}} Before the end of 1802, the stone was transferred to the [[British Museum]], where it is located today.&lt;ref name="Andrews12"/&gt; New inscriptions painted in white on the left and right edges of the slab stated that it was "Captured in Egypt by the [[British Army]] in 1801" and "Presented by King George&amp;nbsp;III".&lt;ref name="Cracking23"/&gt;

The stone has been exhibited almost continuously in the British Museum since June 1802.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; During the middle of the 19th century, it was given the inventory number "EA 24", "EA" standing for "Egyptian Antiquities". It was part of a collection of ancient Egyptian monuments captured from the French expedition, including a [[sarcophagus]] of [[Nectanebo&amp;nbsp;II]] (EA 10), the statue of a [[High Priests of Amun|high priest of Amun]] (EA 81), and a large granite fist (EA 9).&lt;ref name="focus30-31"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;30–31&lt;/ref&gt; The objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] (the original building of The British Museum), and they were transferred to a new extension that was built onto the mansion. The Rosetta Stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in 1834 shortly after Montagu House was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the British Museum.&lt;ref name="focus31"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt; According to the museum's records, the Rosetta Stone is its most-visited single object,&lt;ref name="focus7"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; and a simple image of it has been the museum's best selling postcard for several decades.&lt;ref name="focus47"/&gt;

The Rosetta Stone was originally displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle that was made for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides to ensure that the cradle fitted securely.&lt;ref name="focus31"/&gt; It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors.&lt;ref name="focus32"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the [[King's Library]] of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.&lt;ref name="focus50"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was concerned about [[German strategic bombing during World War I#1917|heavy bombing in London]] towards the end of the [[First World War]] in 1917, and the Rosetta Stone was moved to safety, along with other portable objects of value. The stone spent the next two years {{Convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} below ground level in a station of the [[London Post Office Railway|Postal Tube Railway]] at [[Royal Mail Mount Pleasant Sorting Office|Mount Pleasant]] near [[Holborn]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Other than during wartime, the Rosetta Stone has left the British Museum only once: for one month in October 1972, to be displayed alongside Champollion's ''[[Lettre à M. Dacier|Lettre]]'' at the [[Louvre]] in Paris on the 150th anniversary of the letter's publication.&lt;ref name="focus47"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the Rosetta Stone was undergoing conservation measures in 1999, the work was done in the gallery so that it could remain visible to the public.&lt;ref name="focus50-51"&gt;[[#Parkinson70|Parkinson (2005)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading the Rosetta Stone==
{{For|more information|Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs}}

Prior to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, the ancient [[Egyptian language]] and script had not been understood since shortly before the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]]. The usage of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]] had become increasingly specialised even in the later [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic period]]; by the [[4th century]] AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading them. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by Roman Emperor [[Theodosius&amp;nbsp;I]]; the last known inscription is dated to {{Nowrap|24 August 394}}, found at [[Philae]] and known as the [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom]].&lt;ref name="Ray11"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

Hieroglyphs retained their pictorial appearance, and classical authors emphasised this aspect, in sharp contrast to the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabets]]. In the [[5th century]], the priest [[Horapollo]] wrote ''Hieroglyphica'', an explanation of almost 200 [[glyph]]s. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing.&lt;ref name="Cracking1516"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Later attempts at decipherment were made by [[List of Muslim historians|Arab historians]] in [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|medieval Egypt]] during the 9th and 10th centuries. [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary [[Coptic language]] used by [[Copts|Coptic]] priests in their time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eldaly05|El Daly (2005)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;65–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray15"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;15–18&lt;/ref&gt; The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] in the 16th century, [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 17th, and [[Georg Zoëga]] in the 18th.&lt;ref name="Ray20"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;20–24&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed [[Jean-François Champollion]] to solve the puzzle that [[Athanasius Kircher|Kircher]] had called the [[Sphinx#The Riddle of the Sphinx|riddle of the Sphinx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Barry B.|title=Writing: Theory and History of the Technology of Civilization|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-6256-2|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6Gx-MwHvaoC&amp;pg=PA91|language=en|date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|The Greek text}}

===Greek text===
[[File:Porson 13 Jan 1803.jpg|thumb|alt="Illustration depicting the rounded-off lower-right edge of the Rosetta Stone, showing Richard Porson's suggested reconstruction of the missing Greek text"|upright=1.5|[[Richard Porson]]'s suggested reconstruction of the missing Greek text (1803)]]

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text on the Rosetta Stone provided the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, but they were not familiar with details of its use in the [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic]] period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek [[papyrus|papyri]] were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. [[Stephen Weston (antiquary)|Stephen Weston]] verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] meeting in April 1802.&lt;ref name="Budge133"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews13"&gt;[[#Andrews69|Andrews (1985)]] p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, two of the lithographic copies made in Egypt had reached the [[Institut de France]] in Paris in 1801. There, librarian and antiquarian [[Gabriel de La Porte du Theil]] set to work on a translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague [[Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon]]. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both [[Latin]] and French to ensure that they would circulate widely.{{Cref2|F}} At [[Cambridge]], [[Richard Porson]] worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]] in [[Göttingen]] was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803.{{Cref2|G}} It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal ''Archaeologia'' in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, [[Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner|Colonel Turner's]] narrative, and other documents.{{Cref2|H|2}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Budge70|Budge (1904)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking22"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|The Demotic text}}

===Demotic text===
At the time of the stone's discovery, Swedish diplomat and scholar [[Johan David Åkerblad]] was working on a little-known script of which some examples had recently been found in Egypt, which came to be known as [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]]. He called it "cursive Coptic" because he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the [[Coptic language]] (the direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian), although it had few similarities with the later [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic script]]. French Orientalist [[Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy|Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy]] had been discussing this work with Åkerblad when he received one of the early lithographic prints of the Rosetta Stone in 1801 from [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]], French minister of the interior. He realised that the middle text was in this same script. He and Åkerblad set to work, both focusing on the middle text and assuming that the script was alphabetical. They attempted to identify the points where Greek names ought to occur within this unknown text, by comparing it with the Greek. In 1802, Silvestre de Sacy reported to Chaptal that he had successfully identified five names ("''[[Alexander the Great|Alexandros]]''", "''[[Alexandria|Alexandreia]]''", "''[[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemaios]]''", "''[[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe]]''", and Ptolemy's title "''Epiphanes''"),{{Cref2|C}} while Åkerblad published an alphabet of 29 letters (more than half of which were correct) that he had identified from the Greek names in the demotic text.{{Cref2|D}}&lt;ref name="Budge133"/&gt; They could not, however, identify the remaining characters in the Demotic text, which, as is now known, included [[ideogram|ideographic]] and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson09|Robinson (2009)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;59–61&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|The hieroglyphic text}}

===Hieroglyphic text===
[[File:Champollion table.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A page containing three columns of characters, the first column depicting characters in Greek and the second and third columns showing their equivalents in Demotic and in hieroglyphs respectively|upright=1.5|Champollion's table of hieroglyphic phonetic characters with their Demotic and Coptic equivalents (1822)]]

Silvestre de Sacy eventually gave up work on the stone, but he was to make another contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about [[Chinese character|Chinese script]], Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by [[Jörgen Zoega|Georg Zoëga]] in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, [[Jean-Jacques Barthélemy]] had suggested that the characters enclosed in [[cartouche]]s in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], foreign secretary of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], wrote to him about the stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson09|Robinson (2009)]] p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt;

Young did so, with two results that together paved the way for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters "''p t o l m e s''" (in today's transliteration "''p t w l m y s''") that were used to write the Greek name "''Ptolemaios''". He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the Demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and Demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another. This led him to deduce correctly that the Demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters imitated from hieroglyphs.{{Cref2|I}} Young's new insights were prominent in the long article "Egypt" that he contributed to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' in 1819.{{Cref2|J}} He could make no further progress, however.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson09|Robinson (2009)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with [[Jean-François Champollion]], a teacher at [[Grenoble]] who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the [[Philae obelisk]] in 1822, on which [[William John Bankes]] had tentatively noted the names "Ptolemaios" and "Kleopatra" in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters ''k l e o p a t r a'' (in today's transliteration ''q l i҆ w p ꜣ d r ꜣ.t'').&lt;ref name="Budge136"&gt;[[#Budge69|Budge (1913)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;3–6&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, which appears in his famous 1822 "''[[Lettre à M. Dacier]]''" sent to [[Bon-Joseph Dacier]], secretary of the Paris [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] and immediately published by the Académie.{{Cref2|K}} In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs [[Ramesses I|Ramesses]] and [[Thutmose I|Thutmose]] written in cartouches at [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]]. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]].{{Cref2|M}} From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the [[decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs]] diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewachter90|Dewachter (1990)]] p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
[[File:2007-08-27 Rosetta Stone London 0309.JPG|thumb|upright|The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum.]]
Work on the stone now focused on fuller understanding of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar [[Jean Antoine Letronne|Antoine-Jean Letronne]] promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion's use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion's sudden death in 1832, his draft of this analysis could not be found, and Letronne's work stalled. [[Francesco Salvolini|François Salvolini]], Champollion's former student and assistant, died in 1838, and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini's own publication on the stone, published in 1837, was [[plagiarism]].{{Cref2|O}} Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841.{{Cref2|P|1}} During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch|Heinrich Brugsch]] and [[Max Uhlemann]] produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts.{{Cref2|Q}}{{Cref2|R}} The first English translation followed in 1858, the work of three members of the [[Philomathean Society]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{Cref2|S}}

Whether one of the three texts was the standard version, from which the other two were originally translated, is a question that has remained controversial. Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version, the product of the Egyptian government under the Macedonian [[Ptolemies]], was the original.{{Cref2|P|2}} Among recent authors, John Ray has stated that "the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone: they were there for the gods to read, and the more learned of their priesthood".&lt;ref name="Ray3"/&gt; Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously, while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree "an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Quirke69|Quirke and Andrews (1989)]] p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Parkinson|Richard Parkinson]] points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life.&lt;ref name="focus13"/&gt; The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why its decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected, especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name="Cracking3031"&gt;[[#Parkinson69|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
[[File:Place des ecritures Figeac.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo depicting a large copy of the Rosetta Stone filling an interior courtyard of a building in Figeac, France|A giant copy of the Rosetta Stone by [[Joseph Kosuth]] in [[Figeac]], France, the birthplace of [[Jean-François Champollion]]]]

Even before the Salvolini affair, disputes over precedence and plagiarism punctuated the decipherment story. Thomas Young's work is acknowledged in Champollion's 1822 ''Lettre à M. Dacier'', but incompletely, according to British critics: for example, [[James Browne (writer)|James Browne]], a sub-editor on the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (which had published Young's 1819 article), anonymously contributed a series of review articles to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' in 1823, praising Young's work highly and alleging that the "unscrupulous" Champollion plagiarised it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parkinson99|Parkinson et al. (1999)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;35–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson09|Robinson (2009)]] pp.&amp;nbsp;65–68&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were translated into French by [[Julius Klaproth]] and published in book form in 1827.{{Cref2|N}} Young's own 1823 publication reasserted the contribution that he had made.{{Cref2|L}} The early deaths of Young (1829) and Champollion (1832) did not put an end to these disputes. The authoritative work on the stone by [[British Museum]] curator E. A. Wallis Budge (1904) gives special emphasis to Young's contribution compared with Champollion's.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Budge70|Budge (1904)]] vol. 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;59–134&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, French visitors complained that the portrait of Champollion was smaller than one of Young on an adjacent information panel; English visitors complained that the opposite was true. The portraits were in fact the same size.&lt;ref name="focus47"/&gt;

==Requests for repatriation to Egypt==
Egypt first requested the return of the Rosetta Stone in July 2003, on the British Museum's 250th anniversary. [[Zahi Hawass]], the chief of Egypt's [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], asked that the stele be [[art repatriation|repatriated]] to Egypt, commenting that it was the "icon of our Egyptian identity".&lt;ref name="Edwardes"&gt;[[#Edwardes03|Edwardes and Milner (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the proposal two years later in Paris, listing the stone as one of several key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also included: the iconic [[Nefertiti Bust|bust of Nefertiti]] in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]]; a statue of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] architect [[Hemiunu]] in the [[Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany; the [[Dendera zodiac|Dendara Temple Zodiac]] in the [[Louvre]] in Paris; and the [[Ankhhaf (sculpture)|bust of Ankhhaf]] from the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah El Shaarawi |title=Egypt's Own: Repatriation of Antiquities Proves to be a Mammoth Task | date=5 October 2016| url=http://newsweekme.com/egypts-repatriation-antiquities-proves-mammoth-task/|publisher=Newsweek – Middle East}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2005, the British Museum presented Egypt with a full-sized replica of the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated [[Rashid National Museum]], close to the site where the stone was found.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rose05|"Rose of the Nile" (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huttinger05|Huttinger (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the [[Grand Egyptian Museum]] at [[Giza]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Antiquities05|"Antiquities wish list" (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; These requests were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosetta09|"Rosetta Stone row" (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Historical cannons in Rosetta.JPG|thumb|alt="Photo of a public square in Rashid (Rosetta) in Egypt featuring a replica of the Rosetta Stone"|left|A replica of the Rosetta Stone in Rashid ([[Rosetta]]), [[Egypt]]]]

As [[John D. Ray|John Ray]] has observed, "the day may come when the stone has spent longer in the British Museum than it ever did in Rosetta."&lt;ref name="Ray4"&gt;[[#Ray69|Ray (2007)]] p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; There is strong opposition among national museums to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the Rosetta Stone. In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[Parthenon]] and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002 over 30 of the world's leading museums&amp;nbsp;— including the British Museum, the Louvre, the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] in New York City&amp;nbsp;— issued a joint statement declaring that "objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the light of different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era" and that "museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bailey03|Bailey (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Rosetta Stone==

The Digital Rosetta Stone Project is a collaboration between the University of Leipzig's Digital Humanities Chair and the Institute of Egyptology; and the British Museum and the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology Project, to make available an annotated transcription of each of the three versions of the text, as well as providing them in [[XML]] format.&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Digital Rosetta Stone Project |url=http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2018-05mb.html |website=Digital Classicist |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DRS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Rosetta Stone |url=http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/drs/ |publisher=University of Leipzig |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-resolution images and a high-resolution 3D model of the stone will also be produced.&lt;ref name="DC" /&gt;

==Idiomatic use==
The term ''Rosetta stone'' has been used [[idiom]]atically to represent a crucial key in the process of decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole.&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;[[#OUP|''Oxford English dictionary'' (1989)]] s.v. "[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/findword?query_type=word&amp;find=Find+word&amp;queryword=Rosetta+stone Rosetta stone]"  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110620211021/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/findword?query_type=word&amp;find=Find+word&amp;queryword=Rosetta+stone |date=June 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt; Another use of the phrase is found in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1933 novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in [[shorthand]] that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in longhand, both handwritten and typed.&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt;

Since then, the term has been widely used in other contexts. For example, [[Theodor W. Hänsch]] in a 1979 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article on [[spectroscopy]] wrote that "the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms has proved to be the Rosetta stone of modern physics: once this pattern of lines had been deciphered much else could also be understood".&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt; Fully understanding the key set of genes to the [[human leucocyte antigen]] has been described as "the Rosetta Stone of immunology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#International|"International Team"]]&lt;/ref&gt; The flowering plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' has been called the "Rosetta Stone of flowering time".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simpson02|Simpson and Dean (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gamma-ray burst|Gamma ray burst]] (GRB) found in conjunction with a [[supernova]] has been called a Rosetta Stone for understanding the origin of GRBs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cooper10|Cooper (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of [[Doppler echocardiography]] has been called a Rosetta Stone for clinicians trying to understand the complex process by which the [[left ventricle]] of the [[human heart]] can be filled during various forms of [[diastolic dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nishimura98|Nishimura and Tajik (1998)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name has also become used in various forms of [[machine translation|translation software]]. [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] is a brand of language-learning software published by American company Rosetta Stone Ltd. "[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]" is the name of a "lightweight dynamic translator" that enables applications compiled for [[PowerPC]] processors to run on Apple systems using an [[x86]] processor. "Rosetta" is an online language translation tool to help localisation of software, developed and maintained by [[Canonical Ltd.]] as part of the [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] project. Similarly, [[Rosetta@home]] is a [[Distributed computing|distributed computing project]] for predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences (or ''translating'' sequence into structure). The [[Rosetta Project]] brings language specialists and native speakers together to develop a meaningful survey and near-permanent archive of 1,500 languages, intended to last from AD 2000 to 12,000. The [[European Space Agency]]'s ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'' spacecraft was launched to study a [[comet]] named [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] in the hope that determining its composition would reveal the origin of the [[Solar System]].

'''Sigmar Hartmut Gabriel''' (born 12 September 1959) is a German politician who was [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from 2017 to 2018 and [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] from 2013 to 2018. He was [[chairman|Leader]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from 2009 to 2017,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Holger Hansen and Madeline Chambers (January 5, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-spd-idUSKBN14P27A SPD leader Gabriel expected to challenge Merkel in German: sources] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which made him the party's longest-serving leader since [[Willy Brandt]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; He was the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister of the Environment]] from 2005 to 2009 and the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany)|Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy]] from 2013 to 2017. From 1999 to 2003 Gabriel was [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony]].

Gabriel is a member of the [[Seeheimer Kreis]], an official internal grouping of the party with [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] positions.

==Early life and education==
Gabriel was born in [[Goslar]], [[West Germany]], the son of Walter Gabriel (1921–2012), a municipal civil servant, and Antonie Gabriel (1922–2014), a nurse. Gabriel's parents divorced in 1962, and for the next six years he lived with his father and grandmother Lina Gabriel, while his sister lived with their mother. After a lengthy custody battle his mother was awarded custody for both children in 1969.

Gabriel's father was a [[Lutheran]] originally from [[Jelenia Góra|Hirschberg im Riesengebirge]] in [[Silesia]], while his mother was a [[Catholic]] originally from [[Lidzbark Warmiński|Heilsberg]] in the [[Warmia|Ermland (Warmia)]] region of [[East Prussia]] who had most recently lived in [[Königsberg]]; both parents came as refugees to West Germany during the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] during the Second World War. Refugees from the eastern provinces often suffered prejudices in West Germany, and his mother's family were often disregarded as "Poles" in West Germany.&lt;ref name="rhein-zeitung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.deregion_artikel,-sigmar-gabriel-ganz-privat-in-zell-an-der-mosel-verbrachte-er-die-gluecklichsten-tage-seiner-kindheit-_arid,1389811.html|title=Sigmar Gabriel ganz privat: In Zell an der Mosel verbrachte er die glücklichsten Tage seiner Kindheit - Region - Rhein-Zeitung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmar Gabriel has described his family history as a "wild story of flight and expulsion" and noted that his parents dealt with the trauma of expulsion in different ways. According to Gabriel, his father was physically and emotionally abusive to him&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/spd-leader-praised-for-speaking-of-nazi-father-1.957281|title=SPD leader praised for speaking of Nazi father|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[national socialism|national socialist]] ideology "until his dying breath;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/06/12/vicekanselier-trekt-vergelijking-tussen-afd-en-nazi-ideologie|title=Vicekanselier vergelijkt AfD met nazi-ideologie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Gabriel however never saw active service during the war, due to suffering from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/!5075647/|title=Sigmar Gabriel spricht über seine Familie: Mein Vater, der Fulltime-Nazi|first=Stefan|last=Reinecke|publisher=|via=taz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was involved in relief and solidarity work for Poland during the period of [[martial law in Poland]].&lt;ref name="rhein-zeitung" /&gt;

Sigmar Gabriel attended school in Goslar, and served as a soldier in the [[German Air Force]] from 1979 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/gabriel.html |title=Biography, Sigmar Gabriel |date=2016 |website=www.bmwi.de |publisher=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921190451/http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/gabriel.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied [[politics]], [[sociology]] and [[German studies|German]] at the [[University of Göttingen]] from 1982 and passed the first state examination as a grammar school teacher in 1987 and the second state examination in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/gabriel.html "Biography, Sigmar Gabriel:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921190451/http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/gabriel.html |date=2016-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===Early beginnings===
Gabriel joined the SPD in 1977 and soon held a number of positions in local politics. In 1990, he was first elected to the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|State Parliament]] of [[Lower Saxony]], where he led the SPD parliamentary group from 1998 until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Fuhrer (November 29, 1999), [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article560313/Der-Enkel-des-Kanzlers.html Der Enkel des Kanzlers] ''[[Die Welt]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister-President of Lower Saxony, 1999–2003===
On 15 December 1999, after the resignation of [[Gerhard Glogowski]], who had succeeded [[Gerhard Schröder]] in office, Gabriel became [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]]. He had previously won an internal party vote against [[Wolfgang Jüttner]] and [[Thomas Oppermann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glogowski-ruecktritt-sigmar-gabriel-soll-neuer-ministerpraesident-werden-a-54239.html Sigmar Gabriel soll neuer Ministerpräsident werden] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', November 27, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He served until 4 March 2003. During these years, he was widely presented as a protégé of Schröder, and even as a possible successor as chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (January 31, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/world/elections-in-2-german-states-may-be-setback-to-schroder.html Elections in 2 German States May Be Setback to Schröder] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being voted out of office in 2003, Gabriel became the SPD's "Representative for Pop Culture and Pop Discourse" from 2003 to 2005, for which he was bestowed the nickname ''Siggi Pop''.&lt;ref name="zeitde2010-02"&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-02/gabriel-opposition Wir sind nicht aus Versehen Opposition?], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 02/07/2010; ''&gt;2003 wurde Gabriel SPD-Beauftragter für "Popkultur und Popdiskurs" – was ihm den Spitznamen "Siggi Pop" eintrug&lt;''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2005–2009===
From 2005 to 2009 Gabriel was the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany)|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] in the [[First Merkel cabinet|first cabinet]] of [[Angela Merkel]] (CDU).

During his time in office, Gabriel promoted the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]]. He also led the German delegation to the [[2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Beatty, Judith Crosbie, Stewart Fleming, Emily Smith and Simon Taylor (December 13, 2006), [http://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-movers-and-shakers-2/ Germany’s movers and shakers] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, when Germany held the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], he led the negotiations between European Union environment ministers on an ambitious effort to cut [[greenhouse gases|greenhouse gas emissions]] to 20 percent below 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/21/world/fg-eu21 EU may aim for 20% cut in greenhouse gases] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he accompanied Merkel on a two-day visit to [[Greenland]] to see the [[Ilulissat Icefjord]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO world heritage site]], and the [[Jakobshavn Glacier|Sermeq Kujalleq]] glacier in order to get a firsthand look at the effects of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/arctic-thaw-merkel-inspects-a-changing-climate-in-greenland-a-500486.html Arctic Thaw: Merkel Inspects a Changing Climate in Greenland] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition leader, 2009–2013===
Following the SPD's defeat in the [[German federal election, 2009|federal election of 2009]], [[Franz Müntefering]] resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Gabriel was nominated as his successor and was elected on 13 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,661227,00.html ''Spiegel Online'' 11/13/2009].&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected as party chairman for a further two years at the SPD party conference in Berlin on 5 December 2011, receiving 91.6 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gabriel-als-spd-chef-wiedergewaehlt-wind-unter-den-fluegeln-der-sozialdemokratie-1.1226716|accessdate=2011-12-06|title=Wind unter den Flügeln der Sozialdemokratie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his early years as chairman, Gabriel pushed through internal party reforms. He abolished the party steering committee in favor of an expanded executive committee and led the regular party conventions, the most important meetings for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Bettina Marx (December 14, 2013), [http://www.dw.de/sigmar-gabriel-losing-his-way-to-the-top/a-17296572 Sigmar Gabriel: Losing his way to the top] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a critical role in founding the [[Progressive Alliance (political international)|Progressive Alliance]] in 2013 by canceling the SPD payment of its £100,000 yearly membership fee to the [[Socialist International]] in January 2012. Gabriel had been critical of the Socialist International's admittance and continuing inclusion of undemocratic "despotic" political movements into the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/a-810543.html |title=SPD will Sozialistischer Internationale den Geldhahn zudrehen und den Mitgliedsbeitrag nicht zahlen|publisher=Spiegel.de [[Spiegel Online]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sigmar Gabriel |url=http://www.fr-online.de/meinung/keine-kumpanei-mit-despoten,1472602,7705378.html |title=Gastbeitrag: Keine Kumpanei mit Despoten &amp;#124; Meinung – Frankfurter Rundschau |language=de |publisher=Fr-online.de |date=2011-02-03 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[German federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], Gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] but deemed too “unpopular and undisciplined” at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Barkin (September 3, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/business/global/merkels-opponents-struggle-to-find-relevant-issues.html Merkel's Opponents Struggle to Find Relevant Issues] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, he and the other members of the party's leadership agreed to nominate [[Peer Steinbrück]] after [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], the party's parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Eddy (September 28, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/europe/merkels-former-finance-minister-set-to-run-against-her.html Merkel’s Ex-Finance Minister to Oppose Her] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the election campaign, Gabriel became the first SPD leader to address a party convention of [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]; in his speech, he called for a [[red–green alliance]] to defeat Merkel in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Kirschbaum (April 27, 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/27/germany-greens-idUSL6N0DE09S20130427 German SPD leader woos Greens for anti-Merkel alliance] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister, 2013–2018===

In 2013, Gabriel turned the Social Democrats’ third successive defeat to [[Angela Merkel]] in the [[German federal election, 2013|federal election]] into a share of government, after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members, who endorsed the accord.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;Patrick Donahue (December 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-15/merkel-s-third-term-cabinet-social-democratic-party-ministers.html Merkel’s Third-Term Cabinet: Social Democratic Party Ministers] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully, particularly considering the relative weakness of his party, which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections, against more than 41 percent for Merkel's conservative bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Smale (December 14, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/europe/social-democrats-secure-a-third-term-for-merkel.html Social Democrats Secure a Third Term for Merkel] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an SPD convention shortly after the elections, however, Gabriel and the other members of the party's leadership were punished by delegates who re-elected them to their posts with reduced majorities; he received 83.6 percent of members’ ballots after 91.6 percent at the previous vote in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Parkin and Birgit Jennen (November 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/german-spd-chief-set-to-sell-party-on-merkel-coalition.html German SPD Chief Set to Sell Party on Merkel Coalition] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel, who serves as vice-chancellor in the [[third Merkel cabinet]], took on responsibility for [[Energy transition in Germany|Germany's energy overhaul]] as part of a newly configured Economy Ministry.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt; Since late 2016, he has been a member of the German government's cabinet committee on [[Brexit]] at which ministers discuss organizational and structural issues related to the [[United Kingdom]]'s departure from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nasr (January 13, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-germany-idUSKBN14X15Y Merkel to chair first Brexit committee meeting next week] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation about Gabriel's future as leader of the SPD has been brewing since he registered just 74 percent&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;Stefan Wagstyl (July 13, 2016), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0019b93a-48f9-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab.html German court accuses Merkel rival Gabriel of ‘bias’ and ‘secrecy’] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in a party delegates' vote of confidence in December 2015 – the lowest for an SPD leader in 20 years.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;Caroline Copley (May 8, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-gabriel-idUSKCN0XZ0DJ Germany's Gabriel makes light of rumors he's stepping down] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 2017 Gabriel announced that we will not run as candidate for chancellor in 2017; instead, he proposed that [[Martin Schulz]] become candidate and replace him as party chairman.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Online Jan 24"&gt;Florian Gathmann (January 24, 2017), [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sigmar-gabriel-uebergibt-an-martin-schulz-rumms-a-1131586.html Gabriel übergibt an Schulz: Rumms] ''[[Spiegel Online]] Jan 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel also announced that he will succeed [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]. He took office on 27 January 2017, the previous Parliamentary State Secretary [[Brigitte Zypries]] followed Gabriel as Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Online Jan 27"&gt;Spiegel Online (January 27, 2017), [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sigmar-gabriel-zum-neuen-aussenminister-ernannt-a-1131984.html l Wechsel im Kabinett: Gauck ernennt Gabriel und Zypries] ''[[Spiegel Online]] Jan 27''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foreign Minister Gabriel has said Germany's "arms will remain outstretched" to the US to continue the trans-Atlantic alliance between the two countries. However he has said that Germany will step into global markets the US abandons and take on a bigger role on the international stage if Donald Trump continues his protectionist and isolationist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/germany-to-enter-areas-where-us-retreats-top-envoy-says-20170127-gu0gfv.html|title=Germany to enter areas where US retreats, top envoy says|first=Patrick|last=Donahue|date=28 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==

===Foreign policy===
[[File:President Rouhani meeting German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel in Saadabad Palace 139404291812348335724664.jpg|thumb|Gabriel meets Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]], 16 July 2015]]
Gabriel has been staunchly against German soldiers remaining in [[Afghanistan]]. In 2010, he called for an independent assessment that would determine whether the U.S. [[Counterinsurgency in Northern Afghanistan|counter-insurgency strategy]] would succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (April 22, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/world/europe/23iht-germany.html Merkel Tries to Beat Back Opposition to Afghanistan] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he voted in favor of extending German participation in the [[NATO]]-led security mission [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/bilateral/pages/bilateral%20agreements%20reached%20at%20first%20israeli-german%20intergovernmental%20consultations%2017-mar-2008.aspx Bilateral agreements reached at first Israeli-German intergovernmental consultations] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], press release of March 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after having visited [[Hebron]] and the [[Palestinian territories]], he said the Palestinians in those areas were systematically discriminated against and called Israel an "[[Apartheid|Apartheid Regime]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=261998 ''Jerusalem Post'' 15/03/2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

While German members of parliament call out Iran's human rights violations and [[Nazanin Boniadi]], advocate for the [[Center for Human Rights in Iran]], described "systemic gender apartheid" where women advocating equal rights are regularly imprisoned, homosexuality is illegal and can carry the death penalty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-mps-call-out-irans-human-rights-violations-amid-nuclear-deal-tension/a-43407099.

In one of the strongest comments by Germany to push for a federal solution for [[Ukraine]], Gabriel told German weekly ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'' in August 2014 that a federal structure was the only option to resolve [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest]] in the country. He added that Germany's priority was to prevent direct conflict between Russia and its southern neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Olearchyk and Jeevan Vasagar (August 23, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b0b440c-2ac8-11e4-811d-00144feabdc0.html Germany urges Ukraine to accept federal solution with separatists] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|international sanctions regime]] against Russia, Gabriel stated in early 2015 that “we want to help resolve the conflict in Ukraine but don’t want to force Russia to its knees.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Meyer and Volodymyr Verbyany (January 4, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-04/ukraine-in-talks-with-separatists-on-prisoner-exchangeria-says.html Ukraine in Talks With Rebels on Prisoner Exchange, RIA Says] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He later suggested that Europe consider easing sanctions in exchange for cooperation in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Noah Barkin (November 22, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/22/us-mideast-crisis-russia-germany-idUSKBN0TB0QQ20151122 Russia serious about solution in Syria, German minister says] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian-American historian [[Alexander J.

[[File:Meeting with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel 6.jpg|thumb|left|Gabriel with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], 9 March 2017]]

In September 2015, amid the [[European migrant crisis]], Gabriel visited the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] in [[Jordan]] to learn more about the plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrians]] fleeing the violence in the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] that erupted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Annekarin Lammers (September 22, 2015), [https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/gabriel-jordanien-101.html Gabriel in Flüchtlingslager in Jordanien: "Demütig wird man hier"] ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel publicly urged [[Saudi Arabia]] to stop supporting [[religious]] radicals, amid growing concern among about the country's funding of [[Wahhabi]] mosques in Germany which are accused of breeding dangerous [[Islamists]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeline Chambers (December 6, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-germany-idUSKBN0TP0H720151206 German Vice Chancellor warns Saudi Arabia over Islamist funding] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Secretary Tillerson Meets With German Foreign Minister Gabriel (33913288223).jpg|thumb|Gabriel and U.S. Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] in Washington, D.C., 17 May 2017]]
In January 2016, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and [[Turkey]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2016/01/2015-01-15-deu-tuerk-regierungskonsultationen-breg.html Erste Deutsch-Türkische Regierungskonsultationen in Berlin] [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government of Germany]], press release of January 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he called any [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] in the near term an "illusion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/turkish-eu-accession-far-off-says-gabriel/a-19455171 Turkish EU accession far off, says Gabriel] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[G7]] summit in 2017, Sigmar Gabriel stated that the United States, with [[Donald Trump]] as president, has "weakened" the West and that the balance of power has now shifted. The remark comes days after Merkel stated, in an apparent policy shift, that "Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump's actions have 'weakened' the West, German foreign minister says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/europe/angela-merkel-uk-amber-rudd/|agency=CNN|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Gabriel criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against [[Russia]] that target EU–Russia energy projects, including [[Nord Stream|Nord Stream 2]] gas pipeline. In a joint statement Gabriel and Austria's Chancellor [[Christian Kern]] said that "Europe's energy supply is a matter for Europe, and not for the United States of America."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-06-15/germany-austria-slam-us-sanctions-against-russia Germany, Austria Slam US Sanctions Against Russia]". U.S. News. June 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They also said: "To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the U.S. market if they participate in natural gas projects such as Nord Stream 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-and-austria-warn-u-s-over-expanded-russia-sanctions/ Germany and Austria warn US over expanded Russia sanctions]". ''[[Politico]]''. June 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sigmar Gabriel MSC 2018.jpg|thumb|Gabriel during the [[Munich Security Conference|MSC]] 2018]]
Gabriel is a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. He argued the U.N. needed to be made "more effective, transparent, and democratic through a reform of its structures and decision-making procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/statements/page/3/|title=Statements|last=|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, after his departure as German foreign minister, Gabriel published an opinion piece about the future of the relations between Turkey (under [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] rule) and the West, where he advocated for an inclusive stance towards Turkey and criticized the policy of the United States in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://causa.tagesspiegel.de/politik/nach-afrin-welches-verhaeltnis-hat-der-westen-zur-tuerkei/afrin-ist-eine-botschaft-an-die-usa.html ''Die Türkei und der Westen nach Afrin: Afrin ist eine Botschaft an die USA''] (in German, ''"Turkey and the West after Afrin: Afrin is a message for the USA"''), causa.tagesspiegel.de, 24 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
On the occasion of the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|G20 summit in 2011]], Gabriel joined [[Ed Miliband]], the leader of the UK's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and [[Håkan Juholt]], the chairman of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], in suggesting a “new deal” for economic growth. They also said G20 leaders should commit to the introduction of a [[financial transaction tax]] for all major financial centers and an agreement to separate consumer and [[investment banking]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Cullen (November 3, 2011), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-03/german-u-k-swedish-left-calls-for-g20-deal-handelsblatt-says.html German, U.K., Swedish Left Calls for G20 Deal, Handelsblatt Says] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the [[European Commissioner for Trade]], [[Karel De Gucht]], Gabriel stated in March 2014 that “special investment-protection provisions are not required in an agreement between the E.U. and the U.S” on a [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP).&lt;ref&gt;James Kanter (March 27, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/business/international/eu-tries-to-assuage-fears-over-us-trade-deal.html E.U. Tries to Assuage Fears Over U.S. Trade Deal] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he later called for a public trade and investment court to replace the current system of private arbitration, and to enable appeals against arbitration rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Fox (May 6, 2015), [https://euobserver.com/news/128588 EU unveils plans for global investor court] ''[[EUobserver]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he has continuously warned against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from TTIP but maintained that the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Madeline Chambers (April 11, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/11/us-eu-usa-germany-idUSKBN0N20C020150411 German economy minister plays down boost from EU-U.S. trade deal: magazine] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2016, Gabriel said talks on TTIP had "de facto" failed.&lt;ref name="Caroline Copley 2016"&gt;Caroline Copley (September 16, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-trade-germany-gabriel-idUSKCN11M0ZU Germany's Gabriel faces crunch vote over EU-Canada trade deal] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Gabriel rejected the inclusion of an [[investor-state dispute settlement]] clause in the [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (CETA) between [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]], prompting a renegotiation that delayed the entry into force of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Stearns (September 29, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-29/malmstroem-warns-germany-against-altering-eu-canada-pact Malmstroem Warns Germany Against Altering EU-Canada Pact] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the renegotiations, he championed CETA to demonstrate the center-left party's business credentials.&lt;ref name="Caroline Copley 2016"/&gt;

In a 2014 meeting with French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], whose best-selling work ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' calls for a [[wealth tax]], Gabriel rejected such a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] levy on capital as “crazy” for business. He also argued that a wealth tax would generate no more than 8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) a year.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Donahue (November 7, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-11-07/merkel-deputy-tells-piketty-wealth-tax-is-dead-in-germany Merkel Deputy Tells Piketty Wealth Tax Is Dead in Germany] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his French counterpart [[Emmanuel Macron]], Gabriel presented a joint proposal in 2015 to set up a common [[eurozone]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Rose (November 25, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/25/us-france-shooting-fund-idUSKBN0TE0FA20151125 Franco-German risk fund could be set up in weeks if political will: source] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011, Gabriel harshly criticized the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], saying it had promoted “the construction of nuclear plants in all parts of the world, even in war and crisis regions. That needs to stop.”&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (March 13, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/europe/14atom.html Japan's Nuclear Crisis Stokes Fear in Europe] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Gabriel opposed a [[European Commission]] proposal for regional power-capacity markets, according to which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]], such as the sun and wind, cannot supply the grid. A free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets, Gabriel told ''[[Handelsblatt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Nicola, Tino Andresen and Weixin Zha (January 20, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-20/germany-s-eon-facing-off-with-merkel-over-capacity-market Germany’s EON Facing Off With Merkel Over Capacity Market] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation, concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Eckert, Tom Kaeckenhoff, Christoph Steitz and Caroline Copley (January 19, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/articlerwe-coal-idUSL8N1531X2 Germany warns against rushed exit from coal power]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms exports===
Early in his tenure as Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, Gabriel vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports, unnerving the sizeable defense industry and signaling a change in policy from the [[Second Merkel cabinet|previous coalition government]] under which sales rose.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Hudson and Thorsten Severin (May 18, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/18/us-germany-defence-exports-idUSBREA4H06220140518 German economy minister pledges to restrict arms exports] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, he withdrew permission for [[Rheinmetall]] to build a military training center east of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Buergin and Richard Weiss (August 4, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-04/germany-blocks-combat-training-center-for-russia.html Germany Blocks Rheinmetall Sale of Russian Combat Center] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel is bound by pledges to his SPD to reduce arms sales to states that abuse human rights and the rule of law or where such sales may contribute to political instability. He has stated that controls over the final destination of small arms sold to such nations are still insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Parkin (October 15, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-15/german-arms-exports-permit-crackdown-hits-airbus-heckler-and-koch German Arms-Exports Permit Crackdown Hits Airbus, Heckler &amp; Koch] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also indicated that the government would not universally block deals with countries outside of Germany's traditional alliances. Deals with such countries could be approved because of "special foreign-policy or security interests."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Troianovski (June 11, 2014), [https://online.wsj.com/articles/german-arms-exports-to-non-allies-soar-1402508012 German Arms Exports to Non-Allies Soar] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that in future the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]] may be a more appropriate body for deciding whether to allow exports, and called for common European arms exports.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Siebold (October 8, 2014), [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2785355/Ministers-odds-defence-sectors-vital-Germany.html Ministers at odds over which defence sectors vital to Germany] ''[[The Daily Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, his ministry approved a merger of German tank maker [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]] (KMW) with the French armoured vehicle maker [[Nexter]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nienaber (December 4, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nexter-m-a-kmw-idUSKBN0TN12O20151204 Germany approves merger of tank maker KMW with French Nexter] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel has been criticized by opposition leaders and the press for failing to prevent several deals that resulted in a significant rise in German arms exports during his tenure,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-weapons-exports-reach-highest-level-ever-in-2015-1467817067 German Weapons Exports Reached Highest Level on Record in 2015] in: ''wsj.com'', updated July 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-cabinet-approved-record-breaking-arms-exports/a-42282068 Germany's cabinet approved record-breaking arms exports] in: ''dw.com'', 24 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nordbayern.de/politik/rustungsexporte-wie-gabriel-seine-glaubwurdigkeit-verspielt-1.7142814|title=Rüstungsexporte: Wie Gabriel seine Glaubwürdigkeit verspielt|last=Germany|first=nordbayern.de, Nürnberg,|access-date=2018-03-08|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a paradigm shift (lifting of the prohibition against arms exports in zones of war and crisis) already occurred before that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr.de/politik/waffenexporte-die-merkel-doktrin-a-831219 Waffenexporte: Die Merkel-Doktrin], (in German) fr.de, 1.

===Digital policy===
In May 2014, Gabriel and France's economy and digital minister [[Arnaud Montebourg]] sent the [[European Commissioner for Competition]], [[Joaquín Almunia]], a letter criticizing the settlement of a three-year antitrust probe into [[Google]];&lt;ref&gt;Aoife White (May 23, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-23/google-settlement-is-defended-by-eu-s-almunia-after-criticism.html Google Settlement Is Defended by EU’s Almunia After Criticism] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel later “warmly welcomed” the launch of EU antitrust charges against Google in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Jeevan Vasagar (April 15, 2015), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1485980a-e377-11e4-aa97-00144feab7de.html Google’s foes in Germany and France cheer antitrust charges] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Gabriel called [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Apple Inc.]] “anti-social” for skirting appropriate taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Rahn, Brian Parkin and Stephanie Bodoni (October 14, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-14/google-s-schmidt-heads-to-berlin-talks-to-sootherattled-germans Google’s Schmidt to Soothe Rattled Germans in Berlin Talks] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Gabriel and his French counterpart [[Emmanuel Macron]] wrote in a joint letter to [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] [[Andrus Ansip]] that the growing power of some online giants “warrants a policy consultation with the aim of establishing an appropriate general regulatory framework for ‘essential digital platforms.’”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21650558-eus-digital-master-plan-all-right-far-it-goes-disconnected-continent Disconnected Continent] ''[[The Economist]]'', May 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, during a series of Chinese bids for German engineering firms, Gabriel publicly called for a European-wide safeguard clause which could stop foreign takeovers of firms whose technology is deemed strategic for the future economic success of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Copley (June 9, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuka-m-a-mideagroup-germany-idUSKCN0YV147 Germany's Gabriel seeks EU rule to block foreign takeover of key technologies] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
In April 2014, human rights lawyer [[Mo Shaoping]] was blocked from meeting Gabriel during his visit to China, despite the minister saying ahead of the meeting that he wanted to meet critical voices.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Coonan (April 24, 2014), [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-blocked-from-meeting-german-vice-chancellor-1.1771476 Chinese human rights lawyer blocked from meeting German vice-chancellor] ''[[The Irish Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2015 visit to [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman of Saudi Arabia]], Gabriel launched an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer [[Raif Badawi]] and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Anton Troianovski and Ahmed Al Omran (March 8, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-vice-chancellor-presses-saudis-over-bloggers-sentence-1425810401 German Vice Chancellor Presses Saudis Over Blogger’s Sentence] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31786564 Blogger lashing: Saudi rejects criticism of Badawi case] ''[[BBC News]]'', March 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State militants]], particularly given Germany’s status as [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; While the [[U.S. State Department]] had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] did not talk about the case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

During a subsequent trip to Qatar, Gabriel called on the [[List of emirs of Qatar|emir of Qatar]], [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani]] and other senior officials to do better in protecting foreign household workers who face abuse from their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Troianovski (March 10, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-minister-criticizes-qatars-labor-policies-1426023496 German Minister Criticizes Qatar’s Labor Policies] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Thilo Sarrazin===
In 2010, Gabriel called the speeches of [[Thilo Sarrazin]], his party colleague who wrote critically about immigration by accusing Muslims of refusing to integrate and of “dumbing down” German society,&lt;ref name="German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry"&gt;Michal Slackman (September 9, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/world/europe/10germany.html German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; "verbal violence". He stated that although Sarrazin described many things that were accurate, his conclusions did not fit into the egalitarian “ideals” of Social Democracy anymore.&lt;ref name="German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry"/&gt;

===Kaiser’s takeover===
In 2016, a German court nullified Gabriel's controversial decision to grant a special permission for the country's biggest supermarket chain [[Edeka]] to buy grocery store chain Kaiser's, owned by [[Tengelmann Group]]. The judges raised questions about the minister's "bias and a lack of neutrality" in the case, saying he had held secret discussion during the decision making process.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tina Bellon (July 12, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-tengelmann-edeka-idUSF9N19801Q German court halts Edeka takeover of Kaiser's chain] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar hybrid power systems''' are [[hybrid power]] systems that combine solar power from a [[photovoltaic system]] with another power generating [[energy source]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Hillig"&gt;{{cite web |title=Renewables for the Mining Sector |url=http://www.decentralized-energy.com/articles/print/volume-16/issue-1/features/renewables-for-the-mining-sector.html |author=Thomas Hillig |website=decentralized-energy.com |date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-energy-hybrid" /&gt; A common type is a '''photovoltaic diesel hybrid system''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hybrid Power Plants |url=http://www.th-energy.net/english/platform-renewable-energy-and-mining/hybrid-power-plants/ |author=Thomas Hillig |website=th-energy.net |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Photovoltaic Diesel Hybrid System? |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2014/01/what-is-a-photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid-system |author=Amanda Cain |website=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  combining [[photovoltaics]] (PV) and [[diesel generator]]s, or diesel gensets, as PV has hardly any marginal cost and is treated with priority on the [[power grid|grid]]. The diesel gensets are used to constantly fill in the gap between the present load and the actual generated power by the PV system.&lt;ref name="th-energy-hybrid" /&gt;

As solar energy is fluctuating, and the generation capacity of the diesel genesets is limited to a certain range, it is often a viable option to include [[Rechargeable battery|battery storage]] in order to optimize solar's contribution to the overall generation of the hybrid system.&lt;ref name="th-energy-hybrid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.th-energy.net/english/platform-renewable-energy-and-mining/hybrid-power-plants/ |title=Hybrid power plants (wind- or solar-diesel) |publisher=TH-Energy.net – A platform for renewables &amp; mining |access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/14674492/Performance_of_U.S._hybrid_distributed_energy_systems_Solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_combined_heat_and_power Kunal K.

The best business cases for diesel reduction with solar and wind energy can normally be found in remote locations because these sites are often not connected to the grid and transport of diesel over long distances is expensive.&lt;ref name="Thomas Hillig"/&gt; Many of these applications can be found in the [[mining]] sector &lt;ref&gt;http://www.th-energy.net/english/platform-renewable-energy-and-mining/database-solar-wind-power-plants/&lt;/ref&gt; and on islands &lt;ref name="th-energy-hybrid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun For More Than Fun |url=http://www.solarindustrymag.com/issues/SI1601/FEAT_03_Sun-For-More-Than-Fun-Island-Resorts-Benefit-From-Solar-Power.html |author=Thomas Hillig |website=solarindustrymag.com |date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.th-energy.net/english/platform-renewable-energy-on-islands/database-solar-wind-power-plants/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids. However, financing costs for diesel-powered electricity grids with solar photovoltaics are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant. While cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant, the study also identified short-term economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities, such as [[independent power producer]]s, given historical costs at the time of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |title=New study: Hybridising electricity grids with solar PV saves costs, especially benefits state-owned utilities |publisher=SolarServer.com |date=31 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726213948/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |archivedate=26 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/renewable-energy-hybrid-mini-grids-and-isolated-grids-economic-benefits-and-business#overlay-context=publications |title=Renewable Energy in Hybrid Mini-Grids and Isolated Grids: Economic Benefits and Business Cases |publisher=Frankfurt School – UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate &amp; Sustainable Energy Finance |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other solar hybrids include [[Wind hybrid power systems#Wind-solar systems|solar-wind systems]]. The combination of wind and solar has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such a hybrid system is more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/hybrid-wind-and-solar-electric-systems |title=Hybrid Wind and Solar Electric Systems |website=energy.gov |publisher=DOE |date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intermittent / non-dispatchable [[photovoltaics|solar PV]] at the prevailing low tariffs clubbed with [[Thermal energy storage#Pumped-heat electricity storage|Pumped-heat electricity storage]] can offer cheapest [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable power]] round the clock on demand.

==Solar thermal hybrid systems==
Though [[photovoltaics|Solar PV]] generates cheaper intermittent power during the day light time, it needs the support of sustainable power generation sources to provide round the clock power. [[concentrated solar power|Solar thermal]] plants with thermal storage are clean [[load following power plant|sustainable power generation]] to supply electricity round the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/solarreserve-awarded-au78mwh-concentrated-solar-power-contract/|title=Solar Reserve awarded AU$78/MWh Concentrated Solar Power contract |accessdate= 23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/luneng-50mw-concentrated-solar-power-tower-epc-bid-reopened-oversea-suppliers-win-over/|title=LuNeng 50MW Concentrated Solar Power tower EPC bid reopened overseas suppliers win over |accessdate= 12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can cater the load demand perfectly and work as base load power plants when the  extracted solar energy is found excess in a day.&lt;ref name=sther&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/aurora-what-you-should-know-about-port-augustas-solar-power-tower-86715/|title=Aurora: What you should know about Port Augusta’s solar power-tower |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper mix of solar thermal (thermal storage type) and [[Photovoltaics|solar PV]] can fully match the load fluctuations without the need of costly battery storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarthermalmagazine.com/2017/07/19/solarreserve-receives-environmental-approval-390-megawatt-solar-thermal-facility-storage-chile/|title=SolarReserve receives environmental approval 390 MW solar thermal facility storage in Chile |accessdate= 29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/03/13/solarreserve-bids-24-hour-solar-6-3-cents-chile/|title=SolarReserve Bids 24-Hour Solar At 6.3 Cents In Chile |accessdate= 29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day time, the additional auxiliary power consumption of a solar thermal storage power plant is nearly 10% of its rated capacity for the process of extracting solar energy in the form of thermal energy.&lt;ref name=sther/&gt; This auxiliary power requirement can be made available from cheaper solar PV plant by envisaging hybrid solar plant with a mix of solar thermal and solar PV plants at a site. Also to optimise the cost of power, generation can be from the cheaper solar PV plant (33% generation) during the day light whereas the rest of the time in a day is from the solar thermal storage plant (67% generation from [[Solar power tower]] and [[parabolic trough]] types) for meeting 24 hours base load operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/08/25/cheap-baseload-solar-copiapo-gets-ok-chile-exclusive-info/|title=Cheap Baseload Solar At Copiapó Gets OK In Chile  |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When solar thermal storage plant is forced to idle due to lack of sunlight locally during cloudy days in monsoon season, it is also possible to consume (similar to a lesser efficient, huge capacity and low cost battery storage system) the cheap surplus / infirm power from solar PV, wind and hydro power plants by heating the hot molten salt to higher temperature for converting stored thermal energy in to electricity during the peak demand hours when the electricity sale price is profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/06/salt-silicon-or-graphite-energy-storage-goes-beyond-lithium-ion-batteries|title=Salt, silicon or graphite: energy storage goes beyond lithium ion batteries  |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-110/features/thermal-renewable-energy/commercializing-standalone-thermal-energy-storage.html|title=Commercializing Standalone Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kingdom of England|England]] and other [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking countries of northern Europe formerly used various standardised "stones" for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 [[Pound (mass)#Historic use|local pounds]] (roughly 3 to 15&amp;nbsp;kg) depending on the location and objects  weighed. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]'s [[imperial units|imperial system]] adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in [[Weights and Measures Act of 1835|1835]]. With the advent of [[metrication]], Europe's various "stones" were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century on. The stone continues in customary use in Britain and Ireland used for measuring [[body weight]], but was prohibited for commercial use in the UK by the [[Weights and Measures Act of 1985 (UK)|Weights and Measures Act of 1985]].

The name "stone" derives from the use of stones for weights, a practice that dates back into antiquity. The [[Hebrew Law|Biblical law]] against the carrying of "diverse weights, a large and a small"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more literally translated as "you shall not carry a stone and a stone ({{lang|he|אבן ואבן}}), a large and a small".

In England, merchants traditionally sold potatoes in half-stone increments of 7 pounds. Live animals were weighed in stones of 14&amp;nbsp;lb; but, once slaughtered, their carcasses were weighed in stones of 8&amp;nbsp;lb. Thus, if the animal's carcass accounted for {{fract|8|14}} of the animal's weight, the butcher could return the dressed carcasses to the animal's owner stone for stone, keeping the offal, blood and hide as his due for slaughtering and dressing the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Scotland===
The [[Scottish units|Scottish]] stone was equal to 16 Scottish pounds (17&amp;nbsp;lb 8&amp;nbsp;oz avoirdupois or 7.936&amp;nbsp;kg). In 1661, the Royal Commission of Scotland recommended that the Troy stone be used as a standard of weight and that it be kept in the custody of the burgh of [[Lanark]]. The tron (or local) stone of [[Edinburgh]], also standardised in 1661, was 16 tron pounds (24&amp;nbsp;lb 1 oz avoirdupois or 9.996&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ireland===
Before the early 19th century, as in England, the stone varied both with locality and with commodity. For example, the ''[[Belfast]] stone'' for measuring flax equaled 16.75 [[avoirdupois pound]]s.&lt;ref name="Chaney"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Weights and Measures | publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode | author=Chaney, Henry J. | year=1897 | location=London | pages=24 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BqVIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most usual value was 14 pounds.&lt;ref name=Wakefield&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P54TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA202|pages = 197–202al

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
The 1772 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] defined the stone:&lt;ref name="eb1772"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Vol III, Edinburgh{{spaced ndash}}1772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;STONE also denotes a certain quantity or weight of some commodities. A stone of beef, in London, is the quantity of eight pounds; in Hertfordshire, twelve pounds; in Scotland sixteen pounds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Weights and Measures Act of 1824]], which applied to all of the United Kingdom, consolidated the weights and measures legislation of several centuries into a single document. It revoked the provision that bales of wool should be made up of 20 stones, each of 14 pounds, but made no provision for the continued use of the stone. Ten years later, a stone still varied from 5 pounds (glass) to 8 pounds (meat and fish) to 14 pounds (wool and "horseman's weight").&lt;ref name="Gregory"&gt;{{cite book | title=Mathematics for Practical Men | publisher=E.

In 1965, the then [[Federation of British Industry]] informed the British Government that its members favoured adopting the metric system. The [[Board of Trade]], on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. There would be minimal legislation, as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

With the adoption of metric units by the agricultural sector, the stone was, in practice, no longer used for trade; and, in the Weights and Measures Act 1985, passed in compliance with EU directive 80/181/EEC,&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; the stone was removed from the list of units permitted for trade in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72/contents legislation.gov.uk: Weights and Measures Act 1985] Retrieved 2013-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Fenna |editor-first=Donald |title=A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK_Act&gt;{{Cite legislation UK

The stone remains widely used in the UK and Ireland for human body weight: in those countries people may commonly be said to weigh, e.g., "11 stone 4" (11 stones and 4 pounds), rather than "72 kilograms" as in many other countries, or "158 pounds" (the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the US).&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hopkins, Ann Pope, Sandy Pepperell (2013). "Understanding Primary Mathematics". p. 195.

In Australia and New Zealand, metrication has almost entirely displaced stones and pounds since the 1970s.

Shortly after the United States declared independence, [[Thomas Jefferson]], then [[Secretary of State]] presented a [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|report on weights and measures]] to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Even though all the weights and measures in use in the United States at the time were derived from English weights and measures, his report made no mention of the stone being used. He did, however, propose a decimal system of weights in which his "[decimal] pound" would have been {{convert|9.375|oz|g}} and the "[decimal] stone" would have been {{convert|5.8595|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The number of local "pounds" in a stone also varied from city to city. During the early 19th century, states such as the Netherlands (including Belgium) and the South Western German states, which had redefined their system of measures using the ''kilogramme des Archives'' as a reference for weight (mass), also redefined their stone to align it with the kilogram.

==Metric stone==
Although the advent of the metric system spelt the demise of the stone as a unit of measure, the stone was used in some early discussions and implementations of the metric system. In his [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|''Philosophical essay'']] written in 1668, [[John Wilkins]] proposed a system of measure whose unit of length, the ''standard'', was approximately one metre and whose unit of mass was the mass of a cubic ''standard'' of rainwater (which would have been approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg). He proposed that one tenth of this mass (100&amp;nbsp;kg) should be called a ''stone''.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction (33 MB):{{cite book

Neither Wilkins' nor Jefferson's proposals were adopted; but, in the [[Netherlands]], where the metric system was adopted in 1817, the ''pond'' (pound) was set equal to a [[kilogram]]. In modern colloquial Dutch, a ''pond'' is used as an alternative for 500 grams or half a kilogram, and the ''steen'' (stone), which had previously been 8 [[Dutch units of measurement|Amsterdam pond]] (3.953&amp;nbsp;kg), was redefined as being 3&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=Horace/&gt;

'''Tantalum hafnium carbide''' is a [[refractory]] [[chemical compound]] with a general formula [[Tantalum|Ta&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Hafnium|Hf&lt;sub&gt;y-x&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;]], which can be considered as a solid solution of [[tantalum carbide]] and [[hafnium carbide]]. Individually, these two [[carbide]]s have the highest [[melting point]]s among the [[binary compound]]s, {{convert|4150|K}} and {{convert|4201|K}}, respectively,&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electronic structure of cubic HfxTa1–xCy carbides from X-ray spectroscopy studies and cluster self-consistent calculations|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.08.018|year=2008|last1=Lavrentyev|first1=A|last2=Gabrelian|first2=B|last3=Vorzhev|first3=V|last4=Nikiforov|first4=I|last5=Khyzhun|first5=O|last6=Rehr|first6=J|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=462|pages=4–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their "alloy" with a composition [[Tantalum|Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Hafnium|Hf]][[Carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] is believed to have a melting point of {{convert|4263|K}}.&lt;ref name="AndrievskiiStrel'nikova1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrievskii|first1=R.

Very few measurements of melting point in tantalum hafnium carbide have been reported, because of the obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures. A 1965 study of the TaC-HfC solid solutions at temperatures 2225–2275&amp;nbsp;°C found a minimum in the vaporization rate and thus maximum in the thermal stability for Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HfC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. This rate was comparable to that of [[tungsten]] and was weakly dependent on the initial density of the samples, which were [[Sintering|sintered]] from TaC-HfC powder mixtures, also at 2225–2275&amp;nbsp;°C. In a separate study, Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HfC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; was found to have the minimum oxidation rate among the TaC-HfC  solid solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA396947|title=Vaporization of Tantalum Carbide-Hafnium Carbide Solid Solutions|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1965.tb14760.x|year=1965|last1=Deadmore|first1=D.

Individual tantalum and hafnium carbides have a [[Cubic crystal system|rocksalt cubic]] lattice structure. They are usually carbon deficient and have nominal formulas TaC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and HfC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, with x = 0.7–1.0 for Ta and x = 0.56–1.0 for Hf.

'''Tenebrescence''', also known as ''reversible [[photochromism]]'', is the ability of minerals to change colour when exposed to sunlight. The effect can be repeated indefinitely, but is destroyed by heating.

Tenebrescent minerals include [[sodalite|hackmanite]], [[spodumene]] and [[tugtupite]].

Tenebrescent behavior is exploited in synthetic materials for the manufacture of self-adjusting sunglasses, which darken on exposure to sunlight.

A '''unified power flow controller'''  [[electricity|electrical]] device for providing fast-acting [[reactive power]] compensation on [[high-voltage]] [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission]] networks. It uses a pair of three-phase controllable bridges to produce current that is injected into a transmission line using a series transformer. The controller can control active and reactive power flows in a transmission line. 

Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), as a representative of the third generation of FACTS devices, is by far the most comprehensive FACTS device, in power system steady-state it can implement power flow regulation, reasonably controlling line active power and reactive power, improving the transmission capacity of power system, and in power system transient state it can realize fast-acting reactive power compensation, dynamically supporting the voltage at the access point and improving system voltage stability, moreover, it can improve the damping of the system and power angle stability. 

The UPFC uses solid state devices, which provide functional flexibility, generally not attainable by conventional thyristor controlled systems. The UPFC is a combination of a static synchronous compensator ([[STATCOM]]) and a static synchronous series compensator ([[Static synchronous series compensator|SSSC]]) coupled via a common DC voltage link. 

The main advantage of the UPFC is to control the active and reactive power flows in the transmission line. If there are any disturbances or faults in the source side, the UPFC  will not work.The UPFC operates only under balanced sine wave source.The controllable parameters of the UPFC are reactance in the line, phase angle and voltage. The UPFC concept was described in 1995  by L. Gyugyi of Westinghouse. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal| doi=10.1109/61.400878| url=http://www.cpdee.ufmg.br/~elt/docs/EltSep/Facts/the%20unified%20power%20flow%20controller%20a%20new%20approach.pdf| title=The unified power flow controller: A new approach to power transmission control| year=1995| last1=Gyugyi| first1=L.| last2=Schauder| first2=C.D.| last3=Williams| first3=S.L.| last4=Rietman| first4=T.R.| last5=Torgerson| first5=D.R.| last6=Edris| first6=A.| journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery| volume=10| issue=2| pages=1085| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064838/http://www.cpdee.ufmg.br/~elt/docs/EltSep/Facts/the%20unified%20power%20flow%20controller%20a%20new%20approach.pdf| archivedate=2012-04-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPFC allows a secondary but important function such as stability control to suppress power system oscillations improving the transient stability of power system.

A '''weigh lock''' is a specialized [[canal]] [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] designed to determine the weight of [[barge]]s in order to assess toll payments based upon the weight and value of the cargo carried. This requires that the unladen weight of the barge be known.

A barge to be weighed was brought into a supporting cradle connected by levers to a weighing mechanism. The water was then drained and the scale balance adjusted to determine the barge [[gross weight]]. Subtracting the [[tare weight]] (the weight of the barge when empty) would give the cargo weight. Originally weighlocks measured the weight of the barge, initially by measuring the displacement of water from the lock by collecting the liquid in a separate measuring chamber after the barge had entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of the State of New York, in Relation to the Erie and Champlain Canals|volume=II|date=8 February 1825|publisher=State of New York|pages=254–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method also requires that the unladen weight of the barge be known.

&lt;/ref&gt; A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert [[mechanical energy|mechanical rotation]] into [[electrical power]], and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.

This article covers the design of [[horizontal axis wind turbine]]s (HAWT) since the majority of commercial turbines use this design.

In 1919, the physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law]] limit can be approached by modern turbine designs which may reach 70 to 80% of this theoretical limit.

In addition to aerodynamic design of the blades, design of a complete wind power system must also address design of the hub, controls, generator, supporting structure and foundation. Further design questions arise when integrating wind turbines into electrical power grids.

== Aerodynamics ==
{{main article|Wind turbine aerodynamics}}
The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.  
[[File:Wind rotor profile.jpg|thumb|Wind rotor profile]]
The aerodynamics of a horizontal-axis wind turbine are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields.

In 1919, the physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law]] limit can be approached by modern turbine designs which may reach 70 to 80% of this theoretical limit.

== Power control ==
[[File:Powercurve.png|right|500px]]
The speed at which  a wind turbine rotates must be controlled for efficient power generation and to keep the turbine components within designed speed and torque limits.  The centrifugal force on the spinning blades increases as the square of the rotation speed, which makes this structure sensitive to overspeed. Because the power of the wind increases as the cube of the wind speed, turbines have to be built to survive much higher wind loads (such as gusts of wind) than those from which they can practically generate power. Wind turbines have ways of reducing torque in high winds.

A wind turbine is designed to produce power over a range of wind speeds. The cut-in speed is around 3–4&amp;nbsp;m/s for most turbines, and cut-out at 25&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wind-power-program.com/turbine_characteristics.htm |title=Wind turbine power curves|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add: nominal= nameplate_capacity = flat intermediate, why limit at 25 m/s --&gt; If the rated wind speed is exceeded the power has to be limited. There are various ways to achieve this.

A control system involves three basic elements: sensors to measure process variables, actuators to manipulate energy capture and component loading, and control algorithms to coordinate the actuators based on information gathered by the sensors.&lt;ref name="univ2011"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alan T. Zehnder  |author2=Zellman Warhaft  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy |date= 27 July 2011 |url= http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |publisher= Cornell University [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] |accessdate= 22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All wind turbines are designed for a maximum wind speed, called the survival speed, above which they will be damaged. The survival speed of commercial wind turbines is in the range of 40&amp;nbsp;m/s (144&amp;nbsp;km/h, 89 MPH) to 72&amp;nbsp;m/s (259&amp;nbsp;km/h, 161 MPH). The most common survival speed is 60&amp;nbsp;m/s (216&amp;nbsp;km/h, 134 MPH). Some have been designed to survive {{convert|80|m/s|kph mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1437274/vestas-scales-42mw |title=Vestas scales up to 4.2MW|publisher=[[Windpower Monthly]] |date=22 June 2017 |first=David |last=Weston |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stall ===
Stalling works by increasing the angle at which the relative wind strikes the blades ([[angle of attack]]), and it reduces the induced drag ([[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] associated with [[Lift (force)|lift]]). Stalling is simple because it can be made to happen passively (it increases automatically when the winds speed up), but it increases the cross-section of the blade face-on to the wind, and thus the ordinary drag. A fully stalled turbine blade, when stopped, has the flat side of the blade facing directly into the wind.

A fixed-speed HAWT (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine) inherently increases its angle of attack at higher wind speed as the blades speed up. A natural strategy, then, is to allow the blade to stall when the wind speed increases. This technique was successfully used on many early HAWTs. However, on some of these blade sets, it was observed that the degree of blade pitch tended to increase audible noise levels.

[[Vortex generators]] may be used to control the lift characteristics of the blade.

[[Reefing|Furling]] works by decreasing the angle of attack, which reduces the induced drag from the lift of the rotor, as well as the cross-section. One major problem in designing wind turbines is getting the blades to stall or [[Furl (sailing)|furl]] quickly enough should a gust of wind cause sudden acceleration. A fully furled turbine blade, when stopped, has the edge of the blade facing into the wind.

Loads can be reduced by making a structural system softer or more flexible.&lt;ref name="univ2011"/&gt; This could be accomplished with downwind rotors or with curved blades that twist naturally to reduce angle of attack at higher wind speeds. These systems will be nonlinear and will couple the structure to the flow field - thus, design tools must evolve to model these nonlinearities.

Standard modern turbines all furl the blades in high winds. Since furling requires acting against the torque on the blade, it requires some form of pitch angle control, which is achieved with a [[slewing drive]]. This drive precisely angles the blade while withstanding high torque loads. In addition, many turbines use hydraulic systems. These systems are usually spring-loaded, so that if hydraulic power fails, the blades automatically furl. Other turbines use an electric servomotor for every rotor blade. They have a small battery-reserve in case of an electric-grid breakdown. Small wind turbines (under 50&amp;nbsp;kW) with variable-[[Pitching moment|pitching]] generally use systems operated by centrifugal force, either by flyweights or geometric design, and employ no electric or hydraulic controls.

Fundamental gaps exist in pitch control, limiting the reduction of energy costs, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]]. Load reduction is currently focused on full-span blade pitch control, since individual pitch motors are the actuators currently available on commercial turbines. Significant load mitigation has been demonstrated in simulations for blades, tower, and drive train.  However, there is still research needed, the methods for realization of full-span blade pitch control need to be developed in order to increase energy capture and mitigate fatigue loads.

A control technique applied to the pitch angle is done by comparing the current active power of the engine with the value of active power at the rated engine speed (active power reference, Ps reference). Control of the pitch angle in this case is done with a PI controller controls. However, in order to have a realistic response to the control system of the pitch angle, the actuator uses the time constant Tservo, an integrator and limiters so as the pitch angle to be from 0° to 30° with a rate of change (± 10° per sec).

[[File:Pitch Controller.jpg|thumb|Pitch Controller]]

From the figure at the right, the reference pitch angle is compared with the actual pitch angle b and then the error is corrected by the actuator. The reference pitch angle, which comes from the PI controller, goes through a limiter. Restrictions on limits are very important to maintain the pitch angle in real term. Limiting the rate of change is very important especially during faults in the network. The importance is due to the fact that the controller decides how quickly it can reduce the aerodynamic energy to avoid acceleration during errors.&lt;ref name="univ2011"/&gt;

== Other controls ==

=== Generator torque ===
Modern large wind turbines are variable-speed machines. When the wind speed is below rated, generator torque is used to control the rotor speed in order to capture as much power as possible. The most power is captured when the [[tip speed ratio]] is held constant at its optimum value (typically 6 or 7). This means that as wind speed increases, rotor speed should increase proportionally. The difference between the aerodynamic torque captured by the blades and the applied generator torque controls the rotor speed. If the generator torque is lower, the rotor accelerates, and if the generator torque is higher, the rotor slows down. Below rated wind speed, the generator torque control is active while the blade pitch is typically held at the constant angle that captures the most power, fairly flat to the wind. Above rated wind speed, the generator torque is typically held constant while the blade pitch is active.

One technique to control a permanent magnet synchronous motor is [[Vector control (motor)|Field Oriented Control]]. Field Oriented Control is a closed loop strategy composed of two current controllers (an inner loop and outer loop cascade design) necessary for controlling the torque, and one speed controller.

Constant torque angle control

In this control strategy the d axis current is kept zero, while the vector current is align with the q axis in order to maintain the torque angle equal with 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. This is one of the most used control strategy because of the simplicity, by controlling only the Iqs current. So, now the electromagnetic torque equation of the permanent magnet synchronous generator is simply a linear equation depend on the Iqs current only.

So, the electromagnetic torque for Ids = 0 (we can achieve that with the d-axis controller) is now:

T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;= 3/2 p (λ&lt;sub&gt;pm&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt; + (L&lt;sub&gt;ds&lt;/sub&gt;-L&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt;) I&lt;sub&gt;ds&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt; )=  3/2 p λ&lt;sub&gt;pm&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt;
   
[[File:Machine Side Controller.jpg|thumb|Machine Side Controller Design]]

So, the complete system of the machine side converter and the cascaded PI controller loops is given by the figure in the right. In that we have the control inputs, which are the duty rations m&lt;sub&gt;ds&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt;, of the PWM-regulated converter. Also, we can see the control scheme for the wind turbine in the machine side and simultaneously how we keep the I&lt;sub&gt;ds&lt;/sub&gt; zero (the electromagnetic torque equation is linear).

=== Yawing ===
Modern large wind turbines are typically actively controlled to face the wind direction measured by a [[wind vane]] situated on the back of the [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]]. By minimizing the yaw angle (the misalignment between wind and turbine pointing direction), the power output is maximized and non-symmetrical loads minimized. However, since the wind direction varies quickly the turbine will not strictly follow the direction and will have a small yaw angle on average. The power output losses can simply be approximated to fall with ([[Cosine|cos]](yaw angle))&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Particularly at low-to-medium wind speeds, yawing can make a significant reduction in turbine output, with wind direction variations of ±30° being quite common and long response times of the turbines to changes in wind direction. At high wind speeds, the wind direction is less variable.

=== Electrical braking ===
[[File:Turbrake.jpg|thumb|upright|2kW Dynamic braking resistor for small wind turbine.]]

Braking of a small wind turbine can be done by dumping energy from the generator into a [[resistor]] bank, converting the kinetic energy of the turbine rotation into heat. This method is useful if the kinetic load on the generator is suddenly reduced or is too small to keep the turbine speed within its allowed limit.

Cyclically braking causes the blades to slow down, which increases the stalling effect, reducing the efficiency of the blades. This way, the turbine's rotation can be kept at a safe speed in faster winds while maintaining (nominal) power output. This method is usually not applied on large grid-connected wind turbines.

=== Mechanical braking ===
A mechanical [[drum brake]] or [[disk brake]] is used to stop turbine in emergency situation  such as extreme gust events or over speed. This brake is a secondary means to hold the turbine at rest for maintenance, with a rotor lock system as primary means. Such brakes are usually applied only after blade furling and electromagnetic braking have reduced the turbine speed generally 1 or 2 rotor RPM, as the mechanical brakes can create a fire inside the nacelle if used to stop the turbine from full speed. The load on the turbine increases if the brake is applied at rated RPM. Mechanical brakes are driven by hydraulic systems and are connected to main control box.

== Turbine size ==
[[File:Flow diagram for wind turbine plant.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Flow diagram for wind turbine plant]]
There are different size classes of wind turbines. The smallest having power production less than 10&amp;nbsp;kW are used in homes, farms and remote applications whereas intermediate wind turbines (10-250&amp;nbsp;kW ) are useful for village power, [[hybrid systems]] and [[distributed power]].  The world's largest wind turbine, an 8-MW turbine located at the Burbo Bank Extension wind farm in [[Liverpool Bay]], [[United Kingdom]], was installed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps2.eere.energy.gov/wind/windexchange/filter_detail.asp?itemid=5827|title=WINDExchange: World's Largest Offshore Wind Turbine Installed in Liverpool Bay|website=apps2.eere.energy.gov|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utility-scale turbines (larger than one megawatt) are used in central station [[wind farm]]s, distributed power and community wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps2.eere.energy.gov/wind/windexchange/utility-scale-wind.asp|title=WINDExchange: Utility-Scale Wind|website=apps2.eere.energy.gov|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WindPropBlade.jpg|left|thumb|A person standing beside 15 m long blades.]]
For a given survivable wind speed, the mass of a turbine is approximately proportional to the cube of its blade-length. Wind power intercepted by the turbine is proportional to the square of its blade-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagrillo|first=Mick|title=SMALL TURBINE COLUMN|journal=Windletter|year=2010|volume=29|issue=1|url=http://www.renewwisconsin.org/wind/Toolbox-Homeowners/Back%20to%20the%20basics%205-Collector%20Size.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum blade-length of a turbine is limited by both the strength, the stiffness of its material, and transportation considerations.

Labor and maintenance costs increase only gradually with increasing turbine size, so to minimize costs, wind farm turbines are basically limited by the strength of materials, and siting requirements.

Typical modern wind turbines have diameters of {{convert|40|to|90|m|ft}} and are rated between 500&amp;nbsp;kW and 2 MW.

== Nacelle ==
{{main article|Nacelle (wind turbine)}}
The [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]] is [[Enclosure (electrical)|housing]] the gearbox and generator connecting the tower and rotor. Sensors detect the wind speed and direction, and motors turn the nacelle into the wind to maximize output.

=== Gearbox ===
In conventional wind turbines, the blades spin a shaft that is connected through a gearbox to the generator. The gearbox converts the turning speed of the blades 15 to 20 rotations per minute for a large, one-megawatt turbine into the faster 1,800 revolutions per minute that the generator needs to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/wind/inside-wind-turbine-0|title=The Inside of a Wind Turbine|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Energy|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts from GlobalData estimate that gearbox market grows from $3.2bn in 2006 to $6.9bn in 2011, and to $8.1bn by 2020. Market leaders were [[Winergy]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=PT-GD&gt;"[http://www.power-technology.com/features/feature-global-wind-energy-market-gears-growth/ The global wind energy market gears up for growth]" ''Power Technology'' / ''GlobalData'', 18 September 2013 .

=== Generator ===
[[File:Scout moor gearbox, rotor shaft and brake assembly.jpg|thumb|[[Gearbox]], rotor shaft and brake assembly]]

For large, commercial size horizontal-axis wind turbines, the [[electrical generator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = International Journal of Dynamics and Control | title = A Review on the Development of the Wind Turbine Generators across the World | author = Navid Goudarzi | publisher = Springer | date = June 2013 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–202 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40435-013-0016-y | doi=10.1007/s40435-013-0016-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; is mounted in a [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]] at the top of a tower, behind the hub of the turbine rotor. Typically wind turbines generate electricity through [[induction motor|asynchronous machines]] that are directly connected with the electricity grid. Usually the rotational speed of the wind turbine is slower than the equivalent rotation speed of the electrical network: typical rotation speeds for wind generators are 5–20 rpm while a directly connected machine will have an electrical speed between 750 and 3600 rpm. Therefore, a gearbox is inserted between the rotor hub and the generator. This also reduces the generator cost and weight. Commercial size generators have a rotor carrying a field winding so that a rotating [[magnetic field]] is produced inside a set of windings called the [[stator]]. While the rotating field winding consumes a fraction of a percent of the generator output, adjustment of the field current allows good control over the generator output voltage.

Older style wind generators rotate at a constant speed, to match [[utility frequency|power line frequency]], which allowed the use of less costly induction generators.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Newer wind turbines often turn at whatever speed generates electricity most efficiently. The varying output frequency and voltage can be matched to the fixed values of the grid using multiple technologies such as [[DFIG|doubly fed induction generators]] or full-effect converters where the variable frequency current produced is converted to DC and then back to AC. Although such alternatives require costly equipment and cause power loss, the turbine can capture a significantly larger fraction of the wind energy. In some cases, especially when turbines are sited offshore, the DC energy will be transmitted from the turbine to a central (onshore) [[Static inverter|inverter]] for connection to the grid.
=== Gearless wind turbine ===
{{anchor|Gearless wind turbine}}
Gearless wind turbines (also called [[Direct drive mechanism|direct drive]]) get rid of the gearbox completely. Instead, the rotor shaft is attached directly to the generator, which spins at the same speed as the blades. 

[[Direct drive mechanism#Advantages|Advantages of PMDD generators]] over gear-based generators include increased efficiency, reduced noise, longer lifetime, high torque at low rpm, faster and precise positioning, and drive stiffness. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-23|title=Direct drive mechanism|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Direct_drive_mechanism&amp;oldid=822010497|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMDD generators "eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.

To make up for a direct drive generator's slower spinning rate, the diameter of the generator's [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is increased so that it can contain more magnets to create the required frequency and power. Gearless wind turbines are often heavier than gear-based wind turbines. A study by the [[European Union|EU]] called "Reliawind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliawind.eu|title=MEHDI-BOUZAIDA-avocat – Un site utilisant WordPress|author=|date=|website=www.reliawind.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the largest sample size of turbines has shown that the reliability of gearboxes is not the main problem in wind turbines. The reliability of direct drive turbines offshore is still not known, since the sample size is so small.&lt;!-- 20% gearless market share sounds odd, must be of offshore only? &lt;ref name=PT-GD/&gt; --&gt;

Experts from [[Technical University of Denmark]] estimate that a geared generator with permanent magnets may use 25&amp;nbsp;kg/MW of the [[rare-earth element]] [[Neodymium]], while a gearless may use 250&amp;nbsp;kg/MW.&lt;ref name="ingPM"&gt;Wittrup, Sanne.

== Blades ==

=== Blade design ===
[[File:Unlackierte Blattspitze.JPG|thumb|upright|Unpainted tip of a blade]]
The ratio between the speed of the [[airfoil|blade]] tips and the speed of the wind is called [[tip speed ratio]]. High efficiency 3-blade-turbines have tip speed/wind speed ratios of 6 to 7.
Modern wind turbines are designed to spin at varying speeds (a consequence of their generator design, see above). Use of [[aluminum]] and [[composite materials]] in their blades has contributed to low [[moment of inertia|rotational inertia]], which means that newer wind turbines can accelerate quickly if the winds pick up, keeping the tip speed ratio more nearly constant. Operating closer to their optimal tip speed ratio during energetic gusts of wind allows wind turbines to improve energy capture from sudden gusts that are typical in urban settings.

In contrast, older style wind turbines were designed with heavier steel blades, which have higher inertia, and rotated at speeds governed by the AC frequency of the power lines. The high inertia buffered the changes in rotation speed and thus made power output more stable.

It is generally understood that noise increases with higher blade tip speeds. To increase tip speed without increasing noise would allow reduction the torque into the gearbox and generator and reduce overall structural loads, thereby reducing cost.&lt;ref name="univ2011"/&gt;
The reduction of noise is linked to the detailed aerodynamics of the blades, especially factors that reduce abrupt stalling.  The inability to predict stall restricts the development of aggressive aerodynamic concepts.&lt;ref name="univ2011"/&gt; Some blades (mostly on Enercon) have a [[winglet]] to increase performance and/or reduce noise.&lt;ref&gt;Hau, Erich.

=== The hub ===
[[File:Connecting Hub to Turbine Tower No 11 - geograph.org.uk - 787410.jpg|thumb|A Wind turbine hub being installed]]
In simple designs, the blades are directly bolted to the hub and are unable to pitch, which leads to aerodynamic stall above certain windspeeds. In other more sophisticated designs, they are bolted to the [[pitch bearing]], which adjusts their [[angle of attack]] with the help of a pitch system according to the wind speed to control their rotational speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119992714|title=Wind Energy Handbook, Second Edition - Burton - Wiley Online Library|last=Burton|first=Tony|last2=Jenkins|first2=Nick|last3=Sharpe|first3=David|last4=Bossanyi|first4=Ervin|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119992714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitch bearing is itself bolted to the hub. The hub is fixed to the rotor shaft which drives the generator directly or through a gearbox.

=== Blade count ===
{{No footnotes|section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Mod-5B Wind turbine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The 98 meter diameter, two-bladed NASA/DOE [[Mod-5B]] wind turbine was the largest operating wind turbine in the world in the early 1990s]]

[[File:Mod-0 Wind turbine.jpg|thumb|The NASA test of a one-bladed wind turbine rotor configuration at Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio]]
The number of blades is selected for aerodynamic efficiency, component costs, and system reliability. Noise emissions are affected by the location of the blades upwind or downwind of the tower and the speed of the rotor. Given that the noise emissions from the blades' trailing edges and tips vary by the 5th power of blade speed, a small increase in tip speed can make a large difference.

Wind turbines developed over the last 50 years have almost universally used either two or three blades. However, there are patents that present designs with additional blades, such as Chan Shin's Multi-unit rotor blade system integrated wind turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5876181 |title=Patent US5876181 - Multi-unit rotor blade system integrated wind turbine - Google Patents |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aerodynamic efficiency increases with number of blades but with diminishing return. Increasing the number of blades from one to two yields a six percent increase in aerodynamic efficiency, whereas increasing the blade count from two to three yields only an additional three percent in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hau (ed), ''Wind Turbines Fundamentals, Technologies, Applications, Economics 2nd Edition'', Springer 2006, {{ISBN|3-540-24240-6}} page 121&lt;/ref&gt; Further increasing the blade count yields minimal improvements in aerodynamic efficiency and sacrifices too much in blade stiffness as the blades become thinner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Theoretically, an infinite number of blades of zero width is the most efficient, operating at a high value of the tip speed ratio. But other considerations lead to a compromise of only a few blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAT windpower course Blade design notes|url=http://www.scoraigwind.com/wpNotes/bladeDesign.pdf|author=Hugh Piggott|year=1998}}. Course notes from [[Scoraig]] Wind Electric, used in courses at the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Component costs that are affected by blade count are primarily for materials and manufacturing of the turbine rotor and drive train. Generally, the lower the number of blades, the lower the material and manufacturing costs will be. In addition, the lower the number of blades, the higher the rotational speed can be. This is because blade stiffness requirements to avoid interference with the tower limit how thin the blades can be manufactured, but only for upwind machines; deflection of blades in a downwind machine results in increased tower clearance. Fewer blades with higher rotational speeds reduce peak torques in the drive train, resulting in lower gearbox and generator costs.

System reliability is affected by blade count primarily through the dynamic loading of the rotor into the drive train and tower systems. While aligning the wind turbine to changes in wind direction (yawing), each blade experiences a cyclic load at its root end depending on blade position. This is true of one, two, three blades or more. However, these cyclic loads when combined together at the drive train shaft are symmetrically balanced for three blades, yielding smoother operation during turbine yaw. Turbines with one or two blades can use a pivoting teetered hub to also nearly eliminate the cyclic loads into the drive shaft and system during yawing. A Chinese 3.6 MW two-blade is being tested in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boel|first=Thomas|title=Two wings work|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/134314-testdata-afliver-fordom-moelle-med-to-vinger-fungerer-fint|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]]|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=22 November 2012}} [http://ing.dk/artikel/134390-se-detaljerne-paa-kinesisk-moelle-med-kun-to-vinger#0 Design]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mingyang Wind Power|Mingyang]] won a bid for 87 MW (29 * 3 MW) two-bladed offshore wind turbines near Zhuhai in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wspa.com/story/23564370/my-secures-off-shore-tender-in-zhuhai-guangdong-province-china-with-3mw-scd-wind-turbine-generators-construction-to-begin-in-october-2013 MY Secures Off-Shore Tender in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China with 3MW SCD Wind Turbine Generators, Construction to Begin in October 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131122140927/http://www.wspa.com/story/23564370/my-secures-off-shore-tender-in-zhuhai-guangdong-province-china-with-3mw-scd-wind-turbine-generators-construction-to-begin-in-october-2013 |date=2013-11-22 }}" ''WSPA'', 30 September 2013.

Finally, aesthetics can be considered a factor in that some people find that the three-bladed rotor is more pleasing to look at than a one- or two-bladed rotor.

=== Blade materials ===
[[File:Windturbine HamburgWasser Steinwerder 02.jpg|thumb|Several modern wind turbines use rotor blades with carbon-fibre girders to reduce weight.]]
In general, ideal materials should meet the following criteria: 
* wide availability and easy processing to reduce cost and maintenance
* low weight or density to reduce gravitational forces

''Perspectives of carbon nanotubes/polymer nanocomposites for wind blade materials''.

This narrows down the list of acceptable materials. Metals would be undesirable because of their vulnerability to fatigue. Ceramics have low fracture toughness, which could result in early blade failure. Traditional polymers are not stiff enough to be useful, and wood has problems with repeatability, especially considering the length of the blade. That leaves fiber-reinforced composites, which have high strength and stiffness and low density, as a very attractive class of materials for the design of wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uotechnology.edu.iq/dep-laserandoptoelec-eng/branch/lectures/solid%20state/chapter%201%20classification%20of%20materail.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood and canvas sails were used on early windmills due to their low price, availability, and ease of manufacture. Smaller blades can be made from light metals such as [[aluminium]]. These materials, however, require frequent maintenance. Wood and canvas construction limits the [[airfoil]] shape to a flat plate, which has a relatively high ratio of drag to force captured  (low aerodynamic efficiency) compared to solid airfoils. Construction of solid airfoil designs requires inflexible materials such as metals or [[composite material|composites]]. Some blades also have incorporated lightning conductors.

New wind turbine designs push power generation from the single [[megawatt]] range to upwards of 10 megawatts using larger and larger blades. A larger area effectively increases the tip-speed ratio of a turbine at a given wind speed, thus increasing its energy extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Zbigniew Lubosny |title=Wind Turbine Operation in Electric Power Systems: Advanced Modeling (Power Systems) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=3-540-40340-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 the rotor diameters of onshore wind turbine blades are as large as 130 meters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1333448/nordex-secures-first-n131-3000-finland Nordex secures first N131/3000 in Finland] In: [[Windpower Monthly]], Retrieved 22.

An important goal of larger blade systems is to control blade weight. Since blade mass scales as the cube of the turbine radius, loading due to gravity constrains systems with larger blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The magnitude of these loads fluctuates cyclically and the edgewise moments (see below) are reversed every 180° of rotation.
Typical rotor speeds and design life are ~10 and 20 years, respectively, with the number of lifetime revolutions on the order of 10^8.   Considering wind, it is expected that turbine blades go through ~10^9 loading cycles.
Wind is another source of rotor blade loading.  Lift causes bending in the flapwise direction (out of rotor plane) while air flow around the blade cause edgewise bending (in the rotor plane). 
Flapwise bending involves tension on the pressure (upwind) side and compression on the suction (downwind) side.  
Edgewise bending involves tension on the leading edge and compression on the trailing edge.

Wind loads are cyclical because of natural variability in wind speed and wind shear (higher speeds at top of rotation).

Failure in ultimate loading of wind-turbine rotor blades exposed to wind and gravity loading is a failure mode that needs to be considered when the rotor blades are designed. The wind speed that causes bending of the rotor blades exhibits a natural variability, and so does the stress response in the rotor blades. Also, the resistance of the rotor blades, in terms of their tensile strengths, exhibits a natural variability.&lt;ref&gt;Ronold, K. O., &amp; Larsen, G. C. (2000). Reliability-based design of wind-turbine rotor blades against failure in ultimate loading. Engineering Structures, 22(6), 565-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these failure modes and increasingly larger blade systems, there has been continuous effort toward developing cost-effective materials with higher strength-to-mass ratios. In order to extend the current 20 year lifetime of blades and enable larger area blades to be cost-effective, the design and materials need to be optimized for stiffness, strength, and fatigue resistance.&lt;ref name="Ma 2014" /&gt;

The majority of current commercialized wind turbine blades are made from fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs), which are composites consisting of a polymer matrix and fibers. The long fibers provide longitudinal stiffness and strength, and the matrix provides fracture toughness, delamination strength, out-of-plane strength, and stiffness.&lt;ref name="Ma 2014" /&gt; Material indices based on maximizing power efficiency, and having high fracture toughness, fatigue resistance, and thermal stability, have been shown to be highest for glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (GFRPs and CFRPs).&lt;ref&gt;Bassyouni, M., &amp; Gutub, S.

Manufacturing blades in the 40 to 50 metre range involves proven fibreglass composite fabrication techniques. Manufactures such as [[Nordex SE]] and [[GE Wind]] use an infusion process. Other manufacturers use variations on this technique, some including [[carbon]] and [[wood]] with fibreglass in an [[epoxy]] matrix. Other options include preimpregnated ("prepreg") fibreglass and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. Each of these options use a glass-fibre reinforced [[polymer]] composite constructed with differing complexity. Perhaps the largest issue with more simplistic, open-mould, wet systems are the emissions associated with the volatile organics released. Preimpregnated materials and resin infusion techniques avoid the release of volatiles by containing all VOCs. However, these contained processes have their own challenges, namely the production of thick laminates necessary for structural components becomes more difficult. As the preform resin permeability dictates the maximum laminate thickness, bleeding is required to eliminate voids and ensure proper resin distribution.&lt;ref name=Griffin03/&gt;
One solution to resin distribution a partially preimpregnated fibreglass. During evacuation, the dry fabric provides a path for airflow and, once heat and pressure are applied, resin may flow into the dry region resulting in a thoroughly impregnated laminate structure.&lt;ref name=Griffin03/&gt;

Epoxy-based composites have environmental, production, and cost advantages over other resin systems. Epoxies also allow shorter cure cycles, increased durability, and improved surface finish. Prepreg operations further reduce processing time over wet lay-up systems. As turbine blades pass 60 metres, infusion techniques become more prevalent; the traditional resin transfer moulding injection time is too long as compared to the resin set-up time, limiting laminate thickness. Injection forces resin through a thicker ply stack, thus depositing the resin where in the laminate structure before gelation occurs. Specialized epoxy resins have been developed to customize lifetimes and viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0034-3617(07)70148-0 |title=Advanced materials for turbine blade manufacture |year=2007 |author=Christou, P |journal=Reinforced Plastics |volume=51 |issue=4 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon fibre-reinforced load-bearing spars can reduce weight and increase stiffness. Using carbon fibres in 60 metre turbine blades is estimated to reduce total blade mass by 38% and decrease cost by 14% compared to 100% fibreglass. Carbon fibres have the added benefit of reducing the thickness of fiberglass laminate sections, further addressing the problems associated with resin wetting of thick lay-up sections. Wind turbines may also benefit from the general trend of increasing use and decreasing cost of carbon fibre materials.&lt;ref name=Griffin03/&gt;

Although glass and carbon fibers have many optimal qualities for turbine blade performance, there are several downsides to these current fillers, including the fact that high filler fraction (10-70 wt%) causes increased density as well as microscopic defects and voids that often lead to premature failure.&lt;ref name="Ma 2014" /&gt;
 
Recent developments include interest in using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to reinforce polymer-based nanocomposites. CNTs can be grown or deposited on the fibers, or added into polymer resins as a matrix for FRP structures. Using nanoscale CNTs as filler instead of traditional microscale filler (such as glass or carbon fibers) results in CNT/polymer nanocomposites, for which the properties can be changed significantly at very low filler contents (typically &lt; 5 wt%). They have very low density, and improve the elastic modulus, strength, and fracture toughness of the polymer matrix. The addition of CNTs to the matrix also reduces the propagation of interlaminar cracks which can be a problem in traditional FRPs.&lt;ref name="Ma 2014" /&gt;

Further improvement is possible through the use of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in the blade coatings. A major problem in desert environments is erosion of the leading edges of blades by wind carrying sand, which increases roughness and decreases aerodynamic performance. The particle erosion resistance of fiber-reinforced polymers is poor when compared to metallic materials and elastomers, and needs to be improved. It has been shown that the replacement of glass fiber with CNF on the composite surface greatly improves erosion resistance. CNFs have also been shown to provide good electrical conductivity (important for lightning strikes), high damping ratio, and good impact-friction resistance. These properties make CNF-based nanopaper a prospective coating for wind turbine blades.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, N., Yang, F., Guerra, D., Shen, C., Castro, J., &amp; Lee, J. L. (2013).

Development of multifunctional nanocomposite coatings for wind turbine blades. Ceramic Transactions, 224, 325-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important source of degradation for turbine blades is lightning damage, which over the course of a normal 25-year lifetime is expected to experience a number of lightning strikes throughout its service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishnaevsky|first1=Leon|last2=Branner|first2=Kim|last3=Petersen|first3=Helga|last4=Beauson|first4=Justine|last5=McGugan|first5=Malcolm|last6=Sørensen|first6=Bent|title=Materials for Wind Turbine Blades: An Overview|journal=Materials|date=9 November 2017|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1285|doi=10.3390/ma10111285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of damage caused from lightning strikes goes from merely surface level scorching and cracking of the laminate material, to ruptures in the blade or full separation in the adhesives that hold the blade together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;It is most common to observe lightning strikes on the tips of the blades, especially in rainy weather due to the copper wiring within attracting lightning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Protect a Wind Turbine From Lightning|last=Dodd|first=Curtis W.|publisher=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Conservation and Renewable Energy Wind Energy Technology Division|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=91-97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common method to combat this, especially in non-conducting blade materials like GFRPs and CFRPs, is to add lightning "arresters", which are merely metallic wiring that provides an uninterrupted path to the ground, skipping the blades and gearbox entirely to eliminate the risk of damage in those components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Blade recycling ===
The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) predicts that wind energy will supply 15.7% of the world’s total energy needs by the year 2020, and 28.5% by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gwec.net/publications/global-wind-energy-outlook/gweo-2008/|title=GLOBAL WIND ENERGY OUTLOOK 2008 {{!}} GWEC|website=www.gwec.net|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatic increase in global wind energy generation will require installation of a newer and larger fleet of more efficient wind turbines and the consequent decommissioning of aging ones. Based on a study carried out by the European Wind Energy Association, in the year 2010 alone, between 110 and 140 kilotons of composites were consumed by the wind turbine industry for manufacturing blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/our-activities/policy-issues/environment/research_note_recycling_WT_blades.pdf|title=Research note outline on recycling wind turbines blades|last=The European Wind Energy Association|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the blade material will eventually end up as waste, and in order to accommodate this level of composite waste, the only option is recycling. Typically, glass-fibre-reinforced-polymers (GFRPs) compose of around 70% of the laminate material in the blade. GFRPs hinder incineration and are not combustible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflou|first=Joost R.|last2=Deng|first2=Yelin|last3=Acker|first3=Karel Van|last4=Dewulf|first4=Wim|date=2012-04-01|title=Do fiber-reinforced polymer composites provide environmentally benign alternatives?

Currently, depending on whether individual fibres can be recovered, there exists a few general methods for recycling GFRPs in wind turbine blades:
* Mechanical Recycling: This method doesn't recover individual fibres. Initial processes involve shredding, crushing, and/or milling. The crushed pieces are then separated into fibre-rich and resin-rich fractions. These fractions are ultimately incorporated into new composites either as fillers or reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=S. J.|date=2006-08-01|title=Recycling technologies for thermoset composite materials—current status|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359835X05002101|journal=Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing|series=The 2nd International Conference: Advanced Polymer Composites for Structural Applications in Construction|volume=37|issue=8|pages=1206–1215|doi=10.1016/j.compositesa.2005.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chemical Processing/[[Pyrolysis]]: Thermal decomposition of the composites is used to recover the individual fibres. For [[pyrolysis]], the material is heated up to 500&amp;nbsp;°C in an environment without oxygen, thus causing it to break down into lower weight organic substances and/or gaseous products. The glass fibres will generally lose 50% of their initial strength and can now be downcycled for fibre reinforcement applications in paints or concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.appropedia.org/Recycling_of_wind_turbine_blades#cite_note-.5B4.5D-4|title=Recycling of wind turbine blades - Appropedia: The sustainability wiki|website=www.appropedia.org|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that this end of life option is able to recover up to approximately 19 MJ/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflou|first=Joost R.|last2=Deng|first2=Yelin|last3=Acker|first3=Karel Van|last4=Dewulf|first4=Wim|date=2012-04-01|title=Do fiber-reinforced polymer composites provide environmentally benign alternatives?

In addition, it has not yet been modified to satisfy the future need of large scale wind turbine blade recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refiber.com/technology.html|title=ReFiber ApS Wind Turbine Blade Recycling Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct Structural recycling of composites: Developed to combat the inefficiencies and costs associated with chemical, thermal and mechanical recycling processes, which either reduce the performance properties or only act as filler for other composites. The general idea to this method is to reuse the composite as is, which can be achieved especially in larger composite materials as it can be partitioned in several pieces which can be used in other applications as is, without altering the chemical properties of the composite component. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asmatulu|first=Eylem|date=February 2013|title=Recycling of fiber-reinforced composites and direct structural composite recycling concept|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021998313476325|journal=SAGE|volume=|pages=13-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tower ==
=== Tower height ===
Wind velocities increase at higher altitudes due to [[Planetary boundary layer#Cause of surface wind gradient|surface aerodynamic drag]] (by land or water surfaces) and the viscosity of the air. The variation in velocity with altitude, called [[wind shear]], is most dramatic near the surface.
Typically, the variation follows the [[wind profile power law]], which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10% and the expected power by 34%. To avoid [[buckling]], doubling the tower height generally requires doubling the diameter of the tower as well, increasing the amount of material by a factor of at least four.

At night time, or when the atmosphere becomes '''stable,''' wind speed close to the ground usually subsides whereas at turbine hub altitude it does not decrease that much or may even increase. As a result, the wind speed is higher and a turbine will produce more power than expected from the 1/7 power law: doubling the altitude may increase wind speed by 20% to 60%. A stable atmosphere is caused by radiative cooling of the surface and is common in a temperate climate: it usually occurs when there is a (partly) clear sky at night. When the (high altitude) wind is strong (a 10-meter wind speed higher than approximately 6 to 7&amp;nbsp;m/s) the stable atmosphere is disrupted because of friction turbulence and the atmosphere will turn '''neutral'''. A daytime atmosphere is either neutral (no net radiation; usually with strong winds and heavy clouding) or '''unstable''' (rising air because of ground heating—by the sun). Here again the 1/7 power law applies or is at least a good approximation of the wind profile. [[Indiana]] had been rated as having a wind capacity of 30,000 MW, but by raising the expected turbine height from 50 m to 70 m, the wind capacity estimate was raised to 40,000 MW, and could be double that at 100 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html |title=Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources |publisher=Indianacleanpower.org |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209233955/http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Horizontal axis wind turbine|HAWT]]s, tower heights approximately two to three times the blade length have been found to balance material costs of the tower against better utilisation of the more expensive active components.

Road size restrictions makes transportation of towers with a diameter of more than 4.3 m difficult. Swedish analyses show that it is important to have the bottom wing tip at least 30 m above the tree tops, but a taller tower requires a larger tower diameter.&lt;ref name=iba/&gt; A 3 MW turbine may increase output from 5,000 MWh to 7,700 MWh per year by going from 80 to 125 meter tower height.&lt;ref name=twrshell1&gt;Wittrup, Sanne.

As of 2003, typical modern wind turbine installations use towers about 210&amp;nbsp;ft (65 m) high.
Height is typically limited by the availability of [[crane (machine)|cranes]].
This has led to a variety of proposals for "partially self-erecting wind turbines" that, for a given available crane, allow taller towers that put a turbine in stronger and steadier winds, and "self-erecting wind turbines" that can be installed without cranes.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Tower materials ===

Currently, the majority of wind turbines are supported by conical tubular steel towers. These towers represent 30% – 65% of the turbine weight and therefore account for a large percentage of the turbine transportation costs. The use of lighter materials in the tower could greatly reduce the overall transport and construction cost of wind turbines, however the stability must be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Ancona, Dan, and Jim McVeigh. (2011): Wind Turbine - Materials and Manufacturing Fact Sheet. Princeton Energy Resources International, LLC, 19 Aug. 2001. Web. 21 Oct. 2015. &lt;http://www.perihq.com/documents/WindTurbine-MaterialsandManufacturing_FactSheet.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher grade S500 steel costs 20%-25% more than S335 steel (standard [[structural steel]]), but it requires 30% less material because of its improved strength. Therefore, replacing wind turbine towers with S500 steel would result in net savings both in weight and cost.&lt;ref&gt;""Steel Solutions in the Green Economy." (2015): Wind Turbines. World Steel Association, 2012.

Another disadvantage of conical steel towers is that constructing towers that meet the requirements of wind turbines taller than 90 meters proves challenging. High performance concrete shows potential to increase tower height and increase the lifetime of the towers. A hybrid of [[prestressed concrete]] and steel has shown improved performance over standard tubular steel at tower heights of 120 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Quilligan, Aidan, A. O’Connor, and V. Pakrashi. "Fragility analysis of steel and concrete wind turbine towers." Engineering Structures 36 (2012): 270-282.&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete also gives the benefit of allowing for small precast sections to be assembled on site, avoiding the challenges steel faces during transportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocem.ie/downloads/Concrete_Windmills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One downside of concrete towers is the higher CO2 emissions during concrete production as compared to steel. However, the overall environmental benefit should be higher if concrete towers can double the wind turbine lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Levitan, Dave.

==Connection to the electric grid==

All grid-connected wind turbines, from the first one in 1939 until the development of variable-speed grid-connected wind turbines in the 1970s, were fixed-speed wind turbines.
As recently as 2003, nearly all grid-connected wind turbines operated at exactly constant speed (synchronous generators) or within a few percent of constant speed (induction generators).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2011, most new grid-connected wind turbines are [[variable speed wind turbine]]s—they are in some variable speed configuration.&lt;ref name="caliao" /&gt;

Early wind turbine control systems were designed for peak power extraction, also called [[maximum power point tracking]]—they attempt to pull the maximum possible electrical power from a given wind turbine under the current wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent wind turbine control systems deliberately pull less electrical power than they possibly could in most circumstances, in order to provide other benefits, which include:
* [[spinning reserve]]s to quickly produce more power when needed—such as when some other generator suddenly drops from the grid—up to the max power supported by the current wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* Variable-speed wind turbines can (very briefly) produce more power than the current wind conditions can support, by storing some wind energy as kinetic energy (accelerating during brief gusts of faster wind) and later converting that kinetic energy to electric energy (decelerating, either when more power is needed elsewhere, or during short lulls in the wind, or both).&lt;ref&gt;

The generator in a wind turbine produces [[alternating current]] (AC) electricity. Some turbines drive an [[AC/AC converter]]—which converts the AC to [[direct current]] (DC) with a [[rectifier]] and then back to AC with an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]]—in order to match the frequency and phase of the grid. However, the most common method in large modern turbines is to instead use a [[DFIG|doubly fed induction generator]] directly connected to the [[Electrical grid|electricity grid]].

A useful technique to connect a permanent magnet synchronous generator to the grid is by using a back-to-back converter. Also, we can have control schemes so as to achieve unity [[power factor]] in the connection to the grid. In that way the wind turbine will not consume reactive power, which is the most common problem with wind turbines that use induction machines. This leads to a more stable power system. Moreover, with different control schemes a wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous generator can provide or consume reactive power. So, it can work as a [[Variable capacitor|dynamic capacitor]]/[[Electrical reactance#Inductive reactance|inductor]] bank so as to help with the [[Utility frequency#Stability|power systems' stability]]. 
[[File:Grid Side Controller.jpg|thumb|Grid Side Controller Design]]
Below we show the control scheme so as to achieve unity power factor :

[[Volt-ampere reactive|Reactive power]] regulation consists of one [[PID controller#PI controller|PI controller]] in order to achieve operation with unity power factor (i.e. Q&lt;sub&gt;grid&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 ). It is obvious that I&lt;sub&gt;dN&lt;/sub&gt; has to be regulated to reach zero at steady-state (I&lt;sub&gt;dNref&lt;/sub&gt; = 0).

We can see the complete system of the grid side converter and the cascaded PI controller loops in the figure in the right.

== Foundations ==
[[File:Concrete base for turbine 23 - geograph.org.uk - 517353.jpg|thumb|Wind turbine foundations]]
Wind turbines, by their nature, are very tall slender structures,&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, D. (2010). Long Term Performance of Mono-pile Supported Offshore Wind Turbines. Bristol: University of Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt; this can cause a number of issues when the structural design of the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are considered. The foundations for a conventional [[structural engineering|engineering structure]] are designed mainly to transfer the vertical [[Structural load|load]] (dead weight) to the ground, this generally allows for a comparatively unsophisticated arrangement to be used. However, in the case of wind turbines, the force of the wind's interaction with the rotor at the top of the tower creates a strong tendency to tip the wind turbine over. This loading regime causes large [[torque|moment loads]] to be applied to the foundations of a wind turbine. As a result, considerable attention needs to be given when designing the footings to ensure that the foundation will resist this tipping tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. A., &amp; Jones, C. (2010). Long-Term Performance of Suction Caisson Supported Offshore Wind Turbines. Bristol: University of Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common foundations for [[Offshore wind power|offshore]] wind turbines is the [[monopile]], a single large-diameter (4 to 6 metres) tubular steel pile driven to a depth of 5-6 times the diameter of the pile into the seabed. The cohesion of the soil, and friction between the pile and the soil provide the necessary structural support for the wind turbine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icebookshop.com/Products/Wind-Turbine-Foundations-(ICE-Themes).aspx|title=Wind Turbine Foundations|last=Gavin|first=Kenneth|last2=Craig|first2=William|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763969|location=London|pages=3-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In onshore turbines the most common type of foundation is a gravity foundation, where a large mass of concrete spread out over a large area is used to resist the turbine loads. Wind turbine size &amp; type, wind conditions and soil conditions at the site are all determining factors in the design of the foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ashlock |first1=Jeramy |last2=Schaefer |first2=Verne |title=FOUNDATIONS FOR WIND TURBINES |url=http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~jdm/engr340-2011/ENGR%20340%20-%20Foundations%203%20-%20Ashlock%20-%20Schaefer.pdf |publisher=Iowa State |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern wind turbine is a complex and integrated system. Structural elements comprise the majority of the weight and cost.  All parts of the structure must be inexpensive, lightweight, durable, and manufacturable, under variable loading and environmental conditions. Turbine systems that have fewer failures,&lt;ref name=cost1&gt;Budny, Rob. [http://machinedesign.com/mechanical-drives/bearing-failures-cause-serious-problems-wind-turbines-there-are-solutions Bearing Failures Cause Serious Problems for Wind Turbines, but There Are Solutions] | Machine Design Magazine, 26 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; require less maintenance, are lighter and last longer will lead to reducing the cost of wind energy.

One way to achieve this is to implement well-documented, validated analysis codes, according to a 2011 report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]].&lt;ref name="univ2011"/&gt;

The major parts of a modern turbine may cost (percentage of total): tower 22%, blades 18%, gearbox 14%, generator 8%.&lt;ref name=cost3B&gt;Jamieson, Peter.

== Design specification ==
The [[design specification]] for a wind-turbine will contain a power curve and guaranteed [[availability]]. With the data from the [[wind resource assessment]] it is possible to calculate commercial viability.&lt;ref name="BERR"/&gt;
The typical [[operating temperature]] range is {{convert|-20|to|40|C|F}}. In areas with extreme climate (like [[Inner Mongolia]] or [[Rajasthan]]) specific cold and hot weather versions are required.

Wind turbines can be designed and validated according to [[IEC 61400]] standards.&lt;ref name=iec61400&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec61400-1%7Bed3.0%7Den.pdf International Standard IEC 61400-1, Third Edition] ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'', August 2005. Accessed: 12 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Low temperature ==
Utility-scale wind turbine generators have minimum temperature operating limits which apply in areas that experience temperatures below {{convert|-20|C|F}}. Wind turbines must be protected from ice accumulation. It can make [[anemometer]] readings inaccurate and which, in certain turbine control designs, can cause high structure loads and damage. Some turbine manufacturers offer low-temperature packages at a few percent extra cost, which include internal heaters, different lubricants, and different alloys for structural elements. If the low-temperature interval is combined with a low-wind condition, the wind turbine will require an external supply of power, equivalent to a few percent of its rated power, for internal heating. For example, the [[St. Leon Wind Farm]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada, has a total rating of 99&amp;nbsp;MW and is estimated to need up to 3&amp;nbsp;MW (around 3% of capacity) of station service power a few days a year for temperatures down to {{convert|-30|C|F}}. This factor affects the economics of wind turbine operation in cold climates.
